       "{'The Reformer (Power of the Matchmaker Book 12)': ['I\\'m giving this one five stars. The story is unique when compared to the standard fare currently available in this genre. Jaima Fixsen is a rising star who gives us books with very interesting heroes/heroines. If you haven\\'t read her Fairchild (3 Book Series), I highly recommend those books to you.\\n\\nThe Power of the Matchmaker Series is apparently a set of books that are written by various authors. When I first noticed this set of books, I thought I had missed out on Ms. Fixsen\\'s first 11 books of the series. After reading this one, I am certainly willing to give some of the other books in this series a try, even though they weren\\'t written by Fixsen. A big plus factor is that several are available on KU for those readers who subscribe.\\n\\nIn this book, we have a very unique heroine. Mary Buchanan\\'s world is very small. In fact, even to be able to go in the yard and speak to a neighbor might reasonably be compared to a fun day at the mall for a young lady of this day and age. When Mary inadvertently gets locked out of her home in the rain, she is rescued by her \"unacceptable\" radical-reformer-writer neighbor, Samuel Brown. This meeting and rescue in the rain serves as the catalyst that will eventually bring out the formidable persona that has been hiding inside Mary.\\n\\nFrom the day Mary meets Samuel, he turns her world upside down. Of course her world is so small, up to this point, her fascination has primarily been limited to her neighbor\\'s handsome footman. Her father has long been set against Samuel Brown and his doings. There is a deeper reason Mary\\'s father has kept her \"hidden\" away, but this truth will not come forth until much later in the story. In the meantime, Mary\\'s fascination with Samuel and his newspaper articles results in Mary deciding to join in the reform effort by providing cartoons which go along with the written word - anonymously of course. Anonymously because women simply didn\\'t do political cartoons and get credit, plus dear old dad would have a conniption if he knew Mary was involved in such dealings..\\n\\nThere is a third main character - that would be Samuel\\'s long time friend - a young Scotsman, Neil Murray. From the beginning of Neil\\'s introduction into the storyline, it\\'s obvious Samuel and Neil have a very close relationship but I won\\'t give any further details about the foundation for their relationship. When Neil and Mary meet up for the first time, it was puzzling to me as to why Neil reacted in the manner he did. Eventually, this is explained and the storyline actually brings in Neil as a third primary character in the book.\\n\\nThis is a book about a young, sheltered woman coming of age during a period in England when everything was changing. There were those who were sick and tired of the status quo - that being a world where men and women struggled under a very unrighteous class system. It was the beginning of the end of that class system. We see firsthand, the power of the written word and the accompanying artwork - in this case - cartoons that played a part in the downfall of this system. Of course, years would pass before the system completely breaks down, but reformers such as Samuel, Neil and Mary all had a part to play.\\n\\nGreat writing. Not my typical reading fare, but still very romantic. Bonus minor character: Mary\\'s unusual Chinese neighbor - a lovely lady named Mrs. Chin - a very wise, practical, intriguing woman.',\n",
       "  \"The year is 1830 and there is a growing unrest in England. Machines are taking jobs and displaced workers are demanding that members of Parliament make sweeping changes. Young Mary Buchanan lives a highly restricted life with her bombastic physician father and hypochondriac aunt. Her only 'friends' are a young housemaid and the family cook. Her life consist mostly of peering at neighbors from behind curtained windows and sighing over the handsome footman down the street. When a journalist with radical views moves next door, her father reacts as if the devil himself has invaded their neighborhood. It isn't until Mary is accidentally locked out of her house in a pouring rain that she meets Samuel Brown and soon realizes that her father's view of the world isn't necessarily the right one. This is a beautifully told tale of a sheltered young girl blossoming into womanhood and learning to make her own decisions. Attention to period detail and the political climate of the time is perfectly done.\",\n",
       "  \"To say Mary Buchanan leads a boring life could be considered somewhat of an understatement. She spends her days trying to keep her father's temperament in check and fetching powders or laudanum for her Aunt Yates' migraines and other 'ailments'. At almost 18 years old she hasn't had a season and doesn't seem to have any type of social life unless you count attending church. Although her father seems to be a busy and well respected doctor the family seems to live quite frugally, if the descriptions of Mary's clothing and her Aunt Yates routinely taking inventory and thorough inspections of the household are any indications.\\nAs Mary's father is very conventional, naturally he's against political reform, and he also seems to dislike the Chinese. When Samuel Brown, a 'radical' journalist, moves into the house next door Mary's father is extremely displeased since they already have Mrs. Chin (Miss Pearl) living on the other side of them.\\nMary first meets Samuel Brown when she's inadvertently locked out of her house (she isn't allowed a key) in a downpour, and finds she's instantly attracted to him. His best friend, Neil Murray is quite rude to Mary in an effort to dissuade her from pursuing Samuel.\\nMary's only outlet seems to be drawing and she starts drawing pictures of botanicals for Mrs. Chin. Later she anonymously leaves political cartoons at Samuel's house which leads to Mary secretly working for The Times.\\nI really felt for Mary--she seemed to simply be tolerated by her father and aunt, but came into her own once she started drawing the political cartoons. She accepted the way her family treated her for what it was and something she couldn't change but made plans to use her drawing talent to make money so she could move out and live on her own.\\nI'm not sure how I feel about Samuel--he was very devoted to the cause of reform but it seemed he was unable to give that much devotion to a wife. His best friend (and brother-in-law) Neil had good intentions for keeping Samuel and Mary apart, but came on a little too strong. Mary was very young and Samuel was probably her first crush--Neil didn't have to treat her as rudely as he did at Mrs. Chin's house that one morning when she rushed home in tears. It serves him right that he would turn around and fall in love with her himself. Lol.\\nI don't know why the character of Pearl is called Mrs. Chin in this book, but I found her as mysterious as ever. This is the last book in the Power of the Matchmaker series and although I haven't had the opportunity to read all of them, I'm sad to see the series end.\\nJaima Fixsen is a new author to me but I enjoyed this book. There was a surprise towards the end that I definitely didn't see coming. This is a clean romance.\",\n",
       "  \"(4.5 stars) When I preordered this book some time ago, it was an automatic reflex on my part because I'm a fan of Fixsen's Fairchild trilogy. I probably even thought this new one was connected to that trilogy. It's not, but who cares? If Fixsen writes it, I'll probably like reading it. (It's actually part of the Power of the Matchmaker series comprising books by several authors, linked by the matchmaker character in each one, but all able to be read as standalones.)\\n\\nTold with warmth and humor, this is the tale of young Mary Buchanan, almost 18 at the beginning, repressed and rather lonely daughter of cold, unloving, authoritarian Dr. Sidney Buchanan, whose hypochrondriacal, order-obsessed sister Susan Yates (Aunt Yates to Mary) has been living in the household since the loss of Mary's mother when Mary was a very young girl. The closest thing to affection Mary finds is with the cook and maid, so it's no wonder that she retreats to her painting and to her imagination and to her crushes on handsome footmen (well, one footman in particular who works for a neighbor) to improve on her life.\\n\\nWhen Samuel Brown, handsome reformer and radical journalist, moves in next door, Mary transfers her interest from the footman (who's romantically involved with her young maid anyway) to him. Mary, who has been very innocent and uninformed about issues, takes to reading radical newspapers (hiding them, of course, from her ultraconservative, don't-rock-the-boat father and aunt), begins using her creative artistic talents to make political cartoons and caricatures and finds herself involved in the reformer's world.\\n\\nIn addition to Samuel Brown, two other important characters in Mary's story are Mrs. Chin, mysterious Chinese neighbor (and employer of said handsome footman) and Neil Murray, friend and brother-in-law of widowed Samuel Brown. All characters are nicely developed (although I felt reformer Brown could have been fleshed out a bit more) and we find a love triangle developing with Mary, Samuel and Neil.\\n\\nThe story takes Mary from the age of almost 18 to 21 years of age and in this time we watch Mary come into her own, develop more backbone with regard to her father and aunt, and learn more about life and love. It's a charming tale told beautifully by Fixsen. There's warmth and humor and even a little bit of sadness in a well-rounded story, using political and class unrest in Britain in the 1830s as the background. I grew quite fond of several of the characters and was rooting for Mary to find love and happiness and fulfillment.\",\n",
       "  \"A clean coming of age romance in a time of political strife in England. Strained family relationships, adolescent crushes, and a lonely existence are all part of this story that ends the Power of the Matchmaker series. It's not my favorite but I enjoyed the botany references and the political cartoons. Definitely worth reading. FYI, refers to heroine looking up information about reproduction and includes slang as well as scientific references. Tastefully done but her shock is humorous.\",\n",
       "  \"I struggled to get to 25%. The young woman is barely 17 years old and acts like she's younger. When her neighbor, Samuel, rescues her from the rain he has a lustful reaction and then proceeds to call her a child. Neil does the same thing. That was an enormous hurdle for me to get over. I know that's not a problem for others - but for me it was enough to stop reading.\",\n",
       "  \"This book was really slow in the beginning. I contemplated quitting a few times, but kept chugging along. It got a little better towards the end. Warning: it did talk about sex a little bit, but not in a very dirty way. It's more from the standpoint of an innocent girl who has questions and looks it up in her father's medical book to understand and she's absolutely repulsed.\",\n",
       "  'I could find no fault with this excellent book. It is largely driven by Mary, the main character, but she is wonderfully drawn and delightfully complex. The story is told against the backdrop of a tumultuous time in English history (circa 1830) and the author deftly weaves the plot into it.',\n",
       "  'Love is not infatuation. A difficult thing to discern at any age. Delightful novel of talented young artist and an interesting cast of characters. Of course, all ends well. Just the kind of fantasy for any time.',\n",
       "  \"Regency romance novels that don't insult my intellect or rely on steamy love scenes are hard to find. I loved this one and I would recommend it to anyone who loves lively historical fiction with a dose of old-fashioned romance.\",\n",
       "  'Must Read',\n",
       "  'Wonderfully written, with fully developed characters and plotline. One of my favorites.',\n",
       "  'Slow moving and tepid. For those of you who like a \"clean\" romance (whatever that means) this book may fit the bill. I prefer a bit of tension and spice in my stories. Good writing but slow.',\n",
       "  'This is the final book of the Matchmaker series. I have read all the Matchmaker books and have loved most of them. I love that this series has not been \"cookie-cutter\" at all! The Reformer was set in the 1830\\'s in England. Mary Buchanan leads a very suppressed and sheltered life while she keeps hoping for destiny to change that. When political reformer Samuel Brown moves in next door, Mary\\'s life is destined to change. And when Samuel\\'s best friend, Neil Murray, shows up trying to discourage her from pursuing Samuel, Mary\\'s life is going to change even more. My favorite description of Mary in the book is \"an unpredictable mix of deviousness, determination, and straightforward honesty.\"\\n\\nI loved how Mary found her voice and learned to stand up for herself. She grew up a lot in this book, and in the end realized that she was going to have to stand up for herself again if she was going to have lasting happiness. Her character reminded me a lot of Valancy in L.M. Montgomery\\'s \"The Blue Castle\" so it was fun to read the author\\'s note at the end and see that she was influenced by L.M. Montgomery and Valancy.\\n\\nI loved Pearl\\'s (the matchmaker) role in this book as Mrs. Chin. She seemed the right mix of subtle, devious, nosy and friendly.\\n\\nRating: 4.5 stars (I kept going back and forth between 4 & 5 stars for this one, and in the end decided on 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 because I really liked Mary)\\nContent: PG-13. There was a part (that wasn\\'t even necessary to the story so I wish it had just been left out) where she learns about \"the birds and the bees\" from the drawings in one of her father\\'s books, and then she has follow-up conversations with her maid so she can feel more sophisticated and draw salacious cartoons.\\nSource: Review copy (opinion is 100% my own)',\n",
       "  'Awful',\n",
       "  'Seventeen year old Mary Buchanan lives with her father, Dr. Sidney Buchanan, and his sister (her Aunt), Mrs. Susan Yates. Aunt Yates’s “favorite hobby is suffering” (I love that line. LOL), and “her favorite companion is her own ill- health”. Dr. Buchanan is dead set on any kind of reform. You can imagine his distress when Mr. Samuel Brown, a “reformer” and writer for the Times, moves in right next door. It is the worst thing to happen to the neighborhood since an “Oriental”, Mrs. Chin, moved into the house on the corner. Samuel brings with him his brother-in-law, Neil Murray. Neil doesn’t live in the neighborhood but he and Samuel have been best friends since school days and they are often together. Samuel’s young wife, Neil’s sister, died a short time after they were married; and he is still consumed with guilt and feels responsible for her death.\\nMrs. Chin is, of course, the matchmaker mentioned in the subtitle. She is about to help a couple of young people fall in love. If Mary is lucky she might be one of them. But will it be Samuel, who she is immediately attracted to, or his best friend, Neil? Neil never attracts the girls but they are always falling at Samuel’s feet even though Samuel seems to be oblivious to his effect on them. Neil doesn’t want his friend hurt again so he feels he has to do what he can to discourage the young Mary from bothering Samuel. Too bad that means he ends up spending quite a bit of time with Mary and starts to find her very attractive himself.\\nSo the love triangle develops and even Mrs. Chin gives up on them. Only Mary can straighten it out. Who will she choose?\\nThis is a great story. I have read a couple of the Matchmaker books and so far have enjoyed all of them. You don’t always see what the matchmaker is doing until it all comes together, she is very subtle.\\nI really like stories written by Jaima Fixen and have read several of them. They have all been very good and she is one of my favorite authors. I received a free copy of this book from the author and this is my honest and voluntary review. I look forward to reading more of her books.',\n",
       "  \"I actually didn't remember that this was the last book of The Matchmaker Series--that makes me sad, as I have really enjoyed them.\\n\\nThis book was slow at the beginning and used words that I didn't even get, and I consider myself a pretty good reader....\\nMary’s life was very sheltered and her father and aunt were not nice to her for most of the book. I feel like I never really got to know Samuel, beyond his passion for the reform movement. Neil annoyed me at first, but I liked him more as the book went on. I did like the ending.\\nThe first 2/3 of the book were slow and contained lots of descriptions--I felt they could have been left out and it would not have hurt the story at all.\\n\\nThe romantic relationships are clean, but there was some innuendo and Mary turns to a book to learn about sex and some of the physical responses are described. This wasn't really necessary. I’ve read other books in the series, and they have all have been very clean, so I was surprised to see those things included; especially, since I didn't even realize it was part of the series as I was reading it!\\n\\nThe Power of the Matchmaker series is now complete. It has been fun to read these books and see the different techniques Miss Pearl uses to help couples find love. In this book, I kind of wondered if the character, Mrs. Chin might be Miss Pearl. But I seriously, did not even figure it out until I finished the book. I like Miss Pearl and feel that she should have had a bigger role in Mary's life--at least in the story. Too much historical stuff that I had a hard time following.\\n\\nI was given a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.\",\n",
       "  \"When I first started reading this book, I was less than impressed, but it quickly improved beyond my initial expectations. I loved the contrast of Neil's real worth to Samuel's flashy self-absorption. Yet Samuel, like all the characters, was merely imperfect; I loved that there were no true villains, no one nearly as bad, cold, hard-hearted or manipulative as they might seem or might have been. While at the same time, no one was unrealistically angelic. The people were real. And though misunderstandings and neglect were rampant, I loved that the characters were able to repair - to have relationships and respect their differences. I loved Mary's growth over time (many years wonderfully), providing a realism infrequently taken advantage of in modern books. And of course, Mrs. Chin was a spectacular treasure of a character! If only to have one's own Mrs. Chin...\\n\\nThis is the first book I've read by Fixsen, having just recently been introduced via A Holiday in Bath. I enjoyed that novella, but was unprepared for the literary and human worth I found in The Reformer. I relished reading this book due to it's truth, it's historical gravitas, and it's recognition of human imperfection and humor. I particularly admired the uncliched balance of women's potential absorption and abilities in the meat of the times with their roles in society and personal desires. I admired the avoidance of anachronisms and the dignified handling and acknowledgment of physical, carnal desires and drives. Truthful yet clean. Very good writing. I hadn't previously found her other books' topics particularly inspiring, but now I look forward with anticipation to reading them!\\n\\nI particularly was struck by the Author's Note and reference to L.M. Montgomery. Literally, I have always felt and said that I could aspire to no better goal, if I were to write, than to create a world like Montgomery's worlds - inhabited by ordinary people with their laughter and sorrow, mistakes and feats. Yet I've never heard or read of anyone else feeling quite that way. So my heart was gladdened to find a kindred spirit, who loved and appreciated Montgomery's writing as I did. Fixsen indeed achieved a taste of Montgomery's style and skill in her writing. Wonderfully melding it with her own style and unique story - and with delightful shades, at least to me, of my other, later favorites - Georgette Heyer and Elizabeth Gaskell. And of course, I was ecstatically happy to see a recognition of Valancy, who is my heart, and Rilla, who is my Emma. The only addition I would make to the list is Pat, who is me.\",\n",
       "  \"Jaima Fixsen proves yet again that charming historical romance is alive and kicking. The Reformer unfolds steadily, but not predictably, with a cast of interesting supportive characters and a fully realized setting in 1830s Britain. Mary Buchanan blooms, a neglected flower with talent and wit who lacked the proper sunlight, and the hero emerges from the story naturally, a perfect foil.\\n\\nEspecially fun was meeting the recurring motif of the series, but I won't spoil the surprise for those who haven't read the others yet.\",\n",
       "  '3.5 Stars\\n\\nThis last book the Power of the Matchmaker series has a different feel than the others.\\n\\nFirst, Miss Pearl is never called Miss Pearl in this book. If you\\'ve read the other stories, you know it\\'s her. If you haven\\'t read the other stories, you know it\\'s the matchmaker, but it just isn\\'t as overt as some of the other books.\\n\\nSecond, this story has more mature content. There is talk of sexual intercourse and how it is done in a round-about way. I was surprised when I read it. It isn\\'t too graphic, but definitely discussed more than in any of the other books.\\n\\nThird, the romance isn\\'t as \"sweet\" as some of the others. There is a bit of a love triangle and lovey feelings aren\\'t discussed as much.\\n\\nHaving said all of this, I still like this book. I don\\'t love it like I did some of the other Power of the Matchmaker books, but I find it an interesting read based on the time period and the situation the characters are in. Like some of the other Power of the Matchmaker books, it takes me to a time and place I don\\'t know much about and I find that engaging.\\n\\nWarnings: Talk of sexual intercourse\\n\\nI would let my 15 year old read this book after I warned her that there would be talk of sex in it.\\n\\nReceived ebook in exchange for an honest review',\n",
       "  \"I loved it!\\n\\nThis a timeless, well researcher historical coming of age page turner that kept me up late reading into the night. Through (our heroine) Mary Buchanan's rebellion from her aunt and father her eyes are opened more to the English world around her, to relationships and to herself. It really is a delightful read. Mary's character is so endearing that you want to be her best friend and your heart is right with her through her escapades.\\n\\nRegency romance purists, this story is about the working class and although it does follow social decorum of the era it is often broken with little or no sociatal consequences. I do not think this breaks from the historical value though as the storyline is full of, and more driven by, historically political content.\\n\\nThis book is clean, but has mature content about sexuality. Because of the rebellious behavior and coming of age discoveries I would not recommend this for a young and innocent audience if you wanted them to stay that way. (I would rate this a PG-13)\\n\\nI traded this honest review for a digital copy of the book.\",\n",
       "  'The Reformer is much more than a simple, shallow romance. You either \"get it\" or you don\\'t. In my mind, it approaches real literature with its layers within the story.\\n\\nFirst, you have the real history that\\'s going on in England. At the end, the author gives a recap of the actual events that she used in the storyline. As someone who appreciates history, I found this fascinating.\\n\\nSecond, you have the characters. Each character has a \"story to tell.\" Each character grows and develops. For example, Mary begins the book as a sheltered, lonely 17 year old child. She acts it too. I have teenagers in my house and I recognized much of what Mary did as that of a flighty teenage girl that loves to fantasize and dream. However, the author demonstrated how Mary developed and matured, learning from her mistakes, forgiving and giving forgiveness, and so much more. By the end, she was a mature, self-assured woman who understood life and what it meant to love and be loved. Another character is Mary\\'s father, Dr. Buchanan. To me, he\\'s more of a tragic figure and when you learn his backstory, your heart reaches out to him. My feelings completely turned 180 degrees regarding him. All the other characters likewise develop and mature, except maybe Samuel. He proves in the end to be exactly how he is described much earlier in the book. Also, given the timeline of around 2 years, there\\'s plenty of time allotted for character development.\\n\\nNext, you have the growing love triangle with Mary, Samuel, and Neil. The reader is left in suspense as to who she would choose until the very end. Would she choose the right man?\\n\\nThere\\'s also a sweet sub-story involving the servants. And, Miss Pearl makes her appearance throughout as Mrs. Chin, the kind neighbor who has a beautiful garden and so much helpful advice - even when delivered bluntly.\\n\\nNext, I like to take note of what becomes symbolic throughout the story. In this case, it was the flowers.\\n\\nAnd, finally, I never felt like the story lagged or was boring. I was either laughing at some sort of nonsense of Mary\\'s when she was acting like a typical teenager, or I was anxious over events happening throughout the countryside during such turbulent times.\\n\\nAll in all, I felt like this was one of the best books in the Matchmaker series.\\n\\nRomance - PG - some kisses\\nLanguage - PG\\nViolence - a tense scene where a character gets tangled up in riots in the city and hit by a rock. Blood in mentioned.\\n\\nMy rating - 5 stars',\n",
       "  \"I'm so sad that we've reached the end of the Power of the Matchmaker series. What a fun adventure it has been. I have loved reading these books, all from different authors, that span the ages from contemporary to regency. Each book stands alone and you can read them in any order. They all share one common character- the matchmaker Pearl, who we meet in the novella that set this whole series in motion. I would recommend reading that book first before you begin this series, if you haven't already. It's free on Amazon. (Power of the Matchmaker)\\n\\nJaima Fixen is a new author to me. I haven't read any of her books before now but I do have Fair Child on my kindle, just waiting to be read. Someday. :) Hopefully soon.\\n\\nI enjoyed this book and especially the time and setting of England during the Reformation period. It was interesting to me and I felt like the characters and the setting really complimented each other well. This book moves at a more sedate pace than some.\\n\\nMary is definitely naive. She has been securely sheltered by her father and has not been given the opportunities to learn and develop her keen mind. Her wings have been clipped all her life and she has never had the chance to fly. I didn't fall in love with Mary but there were moments that I loved her pluck and determination. I loved that she wanted to learn and become her own woman and found ways to be heard.\\n\\nAnother thing I loved about this book was the role that Pearl played. She was a very large part of the story and she seemed more developed in this book than in many of the others. It was nice to have her as a more solid presence.\\n\\nOverall, a great ending to a fantastic series. I was really hoping we were going to see something similar this new year, but alas, nothing. This is a series I would highly recommend. Clean romance- a variety of settings and genres. It's the perfect way find new authors to love!\\n\\nContent: Clean- some talk of sexual matters (Mary is so naive and doesn't understand- she asks questions and reads a book about sexual relations between men and women)\\n\\n- I received this book for free. I was under no obligation to give a positive review and all opinions expressed are my own.\",\n",
       "  'Mary lives a life that would definitely make anyone dream for release! Her father and aunt are less than loving in a world of reform and politics. Mary finds the new neighbor Mr Samuel Brown, a journalist, attractive and appealing. Her father is not on the same political stand as Mr Brown and Mary wants to know what makes Mr Brown tick. So with her drawing talent, she finds a way into his world by drawing cartoons to match his articles in the \"other newspaper\". Her Papa would definitely not approve and the neighbors do not get along.\\n\\nWhen things get bad; as in Mary is caught with a letter from Samuel and there is protests and politics going awry, her papa sends her to Bath.\\n\\nMr. Neil Murray is best friends with Mr Brown and he goes to check on Mary in Bath. While he pretends he is there for healing, he appeases Mary\\'s aunt and appears to be Mary\\'s suitor in Bath. Mr Murray and Mary have been at odds from the beginning. But in Bath, things look and feel a little different. Both are away from the heat of politics and Samuel, and Neil becomes more himself and finding his feelings for Mary changing. Mary even notices her feelings but is hell bent on Mr Brown because she would just accept someone who just finds her in good regards not really even love.\\n\\nI am not a political person. Mary really isn\\'t either but chose to immerse herself in it for the sake of getting Mr Brown as she believes he would care for her. After the book ends. The author has many comments on the times and where her writings come from and the liberties she took. There is a lot of rioting not unlike what is happening here in the US lately! So, I really couldn\\'t get into that part of the story.\\n\\nAs far as the Matchmaker goes, she was totally different in this book. Her name was different and no mention of her hairpiece with the pearls on it. I just assumed it to be the same women in all the other books in the series.\\n\\nAs far as love goes, I liked the slow change from not liking each other (Neil and Mary to falling in love. Love takes time and I like how Mary had to figure things out all on her own. Neil was a wonderful person and I wish I could have heard his Scottish accent in my head when I read the book!',\n",
       "  \"The Reformer by Jaima Fixsen is set in London, England in 1830, during the time that reforms were beginning to take place to protect poor laborers. Mary Buchanan is a 19 year old girl who has been brought up by her father and aunt and has been extremely sheltered throughout her life. When a newspaper journalist from the liberal London Times moves in next door, Mary begins to come out of her shell and begins defying her father by getting to know her neighbors, reading the Times and educating herself about the politics of the time, and starting to think for herself. Her infatuation with Samuel Brown leads her to begin drawing political cartoons to illustrate the articles he writes. After some of her cartoons are published anonymously in the paper, Samuel and his best friend Neil Murray convince her to begin accepting money for her cartoons and building up her money to get out of her father's house.\\n\\nThis book was enjoyable for me. The characters of Mary and Neil are very well developed, and Samuel's character is only a little less developed. The storyline was interesting, and watching Mary grow up and spread her wings was a treat. There were some surprises throughout the story that kept me turning pages. The author's research into the historical setting was very well done.\\n\\nI didn't like that this was a somewhat typical Recency type romance. However, I would try reading more books from this author. If you like clean, well developed romances, you should like this book.\\n\\nI voluntarily read and reviewed an ARC copy of this book.\",\n",

       "  \"I'm a big fan of Jaima Fixsen's books and this one did not disappoint. It's not a Regency as it takes place in the 1830s, but it's close enough to the time period that only the purists will notice. The story picks up quickly in true Fixsen style and I was already laughing two pages in. The romance was sweet, made richer by the setting, which was elaborately built without making the reader feel they had to trudge through paragraphs of descriptions to see it. The Reformer has all the elements of a perfect read - poignancy that brings you to tears, a growing love that makes your heart melt, good writing and accurate historical details, and most of all, wit that will make you laugh out loud. I highly recommend.\\n\\nI was given an advanced reader copy.\",\n",
       "  \"Once again, Ms. Fixsen hits it out of the ballpark. This is her fourth novel, and every bit as great as the other three. The main character, seventeen year old Mary, is just precious. She is smart, funny, and inquisitive, despite being somewhat neglected and suppressed. When she falls for the reformer next door, she learns everything she can about current political issues in order to have a clandestine working relationship with her crush. Her father and aunt are anti-reform, and do everything they can to keep innocent Mary away from the agitator and his radical friends. They also want to keep her from visiting with their Chinese neighbor (the matchmaker in this book), because of intense prejudice. Of course, Mary finds ways to do her own bidding, and in the process becomes a knowledgeable, mature, and thoughtful young lady, and a reformer in her own right. Her transformation, and those of the other characters, too, is compelling. I don't want to give anything away, but in the end, Mary becomes who she should be, and ends up where she should be, in regard to her beliefs and her relationships. Well written, great dialogue, wonderful characters, exciting story. Who could ask for anything more? (Me! I want more books by Ms. Fixsen!)\\n\\nI received an advance digital copy of this book, in exchange for giving an honest review. Honestly!\",\n",
       "  'Romance, clean, some violence (street riots, and injury), PG-13 for that, and for some other scenes describing the sex act (in a text book, very dry, and not explicit, but some discussion). While this is a series, it is a stand-alone novel.\\nThis was an interesting read. The author definitely hinted at the final outcome throughout the book, but it was a lovely fall. Mary was a young woman who had lived a sheltered life. Her father and aunt were dictatorial and unkind (brusque). She developed her talent for drawing, and started sneaking reading of the political situation after meeting her neighbor, Mr. Brown when he rescues her from being locked outside in a rainstorm. She falls entranced into the love of his writing, and for the man himself. The journey she makes through the course of the novel, is really one of her finding her independence, and recognizing the worth of a suitor, and finding her heart. A lovely, introspective book, full of changes, and family secrets being exposed. The ending was a lovely fall.\\nI received a copy in exchange for a fair and honest review.',\n",
       "  \"This novel is the final book in the Power of the Matchmaker series. It has been such a fun series and I'm sad to say goodbye to Miss Pearl(the matchmaker and the one character who ties the series together), she has been fun to read about. Each author was able to portray her in their own way and give her however much page time they wanted, some more than others. But in all the books she was a fun, witty, sassy and great advocate for true love. If you haven't ventured into any books in this series, you can pick up any one without feeling lost since they are all stand alone novels. I would recommend reading the free(on Amazon) and short novella titled Power of the Matchmaker first to get a quick glimpse and understanding of who Miss Pearl is and where she came from. If I had an absolute favorite from the ones I've read in the series(I've read all but 4) I would have to pick Chasing Fireflies by Taylor Dean but that doesn't lessen my enjoyment of the other books I've read in the series. A great group of authors came together and gave me much enjoyment for many hours.\\n\\nI know I diverged there for a minute about the series when this review is really about this book, The Reformer. Overall I enjoyed this story, all the little hidden bits that were slowly revealed, which wrapped up all my questions by the end of the book. I will admit it took me a little while to feel connected with Mary Buchanan, our heroine. I couldn't decide if it was because I was really tired when I was trying to read just a few pages at a time or if it was the writing style, or a combination. I found it interesting how the author started out writing, almost as if you're watching a movie and a narrator is cluing us in on what is happening in a certain house on a certain street and all the main players within that home. That narration feel doesn't last long but just for the opening. I thought it was a very clever way to open the book but honestly I think my overly tired brain from a long Christmas break and very little sleep was slow to pick up on anything.\\n\\nMary's family life is lacking substantially. She is almost like a prisoner in her own home. Her father is a Doctor and runs his practice from their home. Her Aunt Yates suffers from headaches and ailments that she must rest most of the time and the other amount of time she is running the household with an iron fist. Mary doesn't remember much about her mother and is trying to find out from her father details about her, what she was like, hair/eye color, what she enjoyed doing, who her family was and most importantly how she died. Unfortunately, mum's the word on any talk about her mother. Mary is suffocating in her home and needs to get out. Fortunately for her, the cook and a young housemaid are her friends and help her sneak out every once in a while for some much needed fresh air.\\n\\nUnfortunately for Mary, on either side of them reside neighbors whom her father cannot abide by. Yet when she finds herself introduced to either, she can't stop her curiosity and need for friendship...and possibly a little romance and love. The newspaper man next door is beyond handsome and her first interaction with him tells her there is a lot of potential for a relationship and marriage between them. Yet again, her father steps up and labels Samuel Brown a taboo subject.\\n\\nAs Mary escapes to the refugee of her other neighbor, Mrs. Chin(Miss Pearl), she finds solace and comfort in their friendship and realizes that there is so much out there in life than she has seen. As our matchmaker starts playing matchmaker Mary finds herself in the presence of Samuel and his close friend Niall Murray. Mary is infuriated by Niall and doesn't understand how one man can be so rude, but unfortunately she is constantly running into him and if there ever is to be a connection with Samuel she must learn to be tolerable of his rudeness.\\n\\nMary starts a little intrigue with her drawings and soon finds herself employed and sneaking around without her father's knowledge. Of course it all comes to a head when he discovers her sneaking and he believes much more is happening and won't listen to anything she has to say.\\n\\nWhat will come of her newfound freedom and friendships now that she has been discovered? There is danger occurring in the city with reformation coming. Can her father keep her safe from that danger? Will she ever have questions answered about her mother? Will she ever find true love? Or will she be stuck as a prisoner in her home forever, feeling trapped, alone and unloved?\\n\\nFor the most part I liked Mary's character but then other times I found her a little irritating or frustrating. And yet I couldn't help but look at her home life and know that she had been very sheltered and was trying to understand life that had been happening around her without any knowledge. I did like that she tried to take her life into her own hands and make the best of her situation. Her father and aunt made me mad many times and I wasn't sure what my final opinion of them was going to be. I'm not going to say because I'll leave that for you to decide if you choose to read it. I also wasn't always the biggest fan of Samuel Brown and Niall Murray, for many reasons but I can't say because then, once again, I'd give away a major plot point. So you're stuck with those questions I posed and without too much detail to avoid any spoilers for you readers.\\n\\nThe love story within was slow and took Mary some time to realize but I liked the interactions she had with the gentleman and how they both came to realize the love they had for each other. Mrs. Chin was fun and her normal sneaky self.\\n\\nContent wise I would say the book was clean. At first I wondered because of an interaction she had with a man. Some of his thoughts and later conversations about her carried some innuendos. We also have Mary trying to figure out why men and women are attracted to each other. She takes it into her own hands to learn about the birds and bees, so there is a moment where she reads one of her father's anatomy books and learns about the male anatomy and sex. There were also a couple sweet kisses but nothing further than kisses between characters. Some violence due to street riots caused by voting and passing/not passing reform measures. Nothing too graphic. I'd recommend for older YA and up.\\n\\nI received a copy from ebooks, all thoughts and opinions are my own.\\n\\nHappy Reading!!!\",\n",

She is very stifled and a chance meeting with a handsome neighbor opens her eyes to life and causes her to start to spread her wings--in a rebellious way. Samuel is a reformer and that's very attractive to Mary. His best friend, Neil, and another neighbor, Mrs. Chin (whom I assume is Pearl--I wish her pearl comb would have been mentioned), along with servant, Annie, help shape and mold Mary into the woman she is meant to be.\\n\\nWith Mary's new freedom, she longs for love and has a couple of options--although it takes her awhile to realize what they are. Her true passion, aside from her growing love of politics, is her drawing, which she uses not only to support herself independently from her old-fashioned and controlling father, but to put her mark on the Reformation. I like Samuel and his head-in-the-clouds ways and his encounters with the doctor are funny, in a ridiculous way. Neil is argumentative, yet supportive, and I couldn't decide if I liked him or not. Mrs. Chin is sweet and wise and a very good inspiration for Mary.\\n\\nI loved watching Mary blossom and gain strength. I loved watching character relationships develop, especially as the plot reached the pinnacle of the government crisis.

I'm sad to see it all come to an end and I'm really happy to find another new-to-me author through this series. \\n\\nContent: mild-moderate romance (kissing, innuendo); mild language (several cuss words); mild violence, due to the Reformation.\\n\\n*I received a copy through eBooks for Review.

       "  '“She was quite alone, a shadow who watched and sketched.” Miss Mary Buchanan has been sheltered and secluded from society. Raised by her Aunt Yates and her father, this “little brown house sparrow” is naïve and coddled. She simply desires to help and serve and be loved. “His grief was to her advantage. It gave her more time to grow up, educate herself, and study how to make herself useful to him.” Her courage and determination propel her to make life changing, completely unsuitable choices. I really liked her pluck and propensity for misfortune. My favorite scenes are when she finds her voice and the fortitude to choose for herself.\\nExposure to Samuel Brown opens her eyes to a whole new world of politics and reform. Suddenly she longs to visit new places and see forbidden sights. Mrs. Chin provides a listening ear and words of wisdom to young Mary. I wish Mrs. Chin had been referred to as Ms. Pearl just once to provide consistency with the other Matchmaker books. Determined to protect both Samuel and Mary, Neil Murray interferes and pushes Mary away. Samuel is a very shallow character in this story. Neil’s character is more sympathetic as he plays an active role in the plot. Romance is woven into this coming of age story.\\nThe discussions of lust and sex were a bit disarming for me. There are several surprising plot twists that add intrigue to this story. I also enjoyed reading about the historical and political unrest at that time in England. As the action picked up, I found myself more engaged in the second half of this book.

She feels like she's tolerated rather than loved. Her political leanings are different than her father's but she keeps her opinions to herself to keep the peace in her home. Life gets more interesting for her when Samuel Brown, a reformer who writes for the Times, moves in next door. The more she learns about him, the more she knows he is the perfect match for her. She just needs to get him to see her that way.\\n\\nI enjoyed this book and getting to know the characters! It was fun to watch Mary's character develop and grow throughout the book. I got a chuckle out of the way her father and Samuel treated each other. The matchmaker, Pearl, appeared as Mrs. Chin. She played a subtle role in this story and was able to steer Mary in the right direction. And then there's Neil, Samuel's best friend who is determined to keep Mary away from Samuel. I loved how the story progressed and the twists that were thrown in to keep it interesting!\\n\\nThis is the final installment in the Matchmaker series.

       "  \"Another favorite from the Power of the Matchmaker series, and a new-to-me author discovered! I really enjoyed the writing style, the way the author portrayed the mundane and repressed life of Mary without it being boring, and her transformation into somewhat of a rebel. Mary's one passion she is allowed to have is drawing, and the descriptions of the caricatures she draws of those around her reveal a wry and cynical part of her personality, which make some of her later choices understandable. She develops a romantic obsession with Samuel, a man she hardly knows but finds herself attracted to, which brings with it an association with Samuel's good friend and protector, Niall. He isn't pleasant to her in an effort to scare her off his friend, but it backfires by helping her find her spine and he becomes an outlet for her before-hidden sassiness. I loved their interactions!!! Poor Niall finds himself shifting from defender of Samuel to self-appointed protector of Mary, and the twists in the plot were angst-inducing. I enjoyed the historical setting and learning more about the reform movement in England, which also provided some action when the riots start. The matchmaker's role in the story as Mary's neighbor Mrs. Chin is an integral one which I liked since it didn't make her seem random. Her love for gardening, long talks with Niall, and appreciation of Mary's drawing skills are endearing and I felt like she was more well-rounded in this story than in some of the others. I'm looking forward to reading the other books written by this author!\\n\\n(I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher; all opinions in this review are my own)\",\n",
       "  \"This is a continuation of the Matchmaker series. The books don't tie to each other except for one character, Pearl, who matches people together.\\n\\nIn this book, Pearl plays a very minor role and in fact I wasn't even 100% sure she was in the book since she was referred to as Mrs. Chin.\\n\\nThat aside, the story was set in England with Mary Buchanan wanting more from her life than just being a wife. She takes an interest in politics and the new neighbor who is a journalist. Granted she meets him by accident but takes an interest in what he has to say about what is happening in the world of politics.\\n\\nMary may be 18 but she is very naive about the world around her. Probably because her father and aunt seem to keep her sheltered. This was probably very common for that time period, but it hindered her in the beginning because she wasn't really tuned into the world. However, I liked that it made her step out of her comfort zone and meet other people and take an interest in the country she lived in and how they were ruled (a good thing for everyone to do no matte where they live).\\n\\nMary thinks she is in love with Samuel Brown, but it is his friend (and brother in law) Mr. Murray that is who she is meant to be with according to Mrs. Chin. I liked that he took a trip to Bath to check on her when she disappeared and how he got to know her during that time. He may not have known or thought she was for him, but it was apparent that they were better suited.\",\n",

The two men in the story were great characters as well and I enjoyed watching the story unfold to see how it would all come together in the end. Mary\\'s family members were frustrating, but they also had changed by the end of the book.\\nI think this was the first story of the Matchmaker series where Miss Pearl was called by a different name, which seemed odd, but I enjoyed seeing her matchmaking at work (and also how she got frustrated with Mary at the end). I was also a little disappointed by one part of the story that made it not quite \"squeaky clean\" and didn\\'t seem necessary to the story, where the main character learns about the \"birds and the bees\" through a text book and then with a follow-up discussion with her maid.\\nOverall, a great ending to this series!\\nNote: I received a free e-book version of this book in exchange for an honest review.',\n",

I liked the way that she wanted to break out of her father's rules and live her own life. And she does. She becomes a satire comic for the newspaper her dad hates. This part was fun and a little funny to see the lengths she would go to to be her own person for just a little while.\\n\\nThe problem with Mary, though, is she fancies herself in love wither her neighbor Samuel Brown. And he's so boring...he's a column writer for the newspaper her father hates, and her father hates him as well. That's probably part of why Mary likes him so much. And the one man that seems to be perfectly suited to Mary, she hates.\\n\\nI didn't love the plot of this one, some parts were fun, like her drawings, but a good chunk of it was just boring to me. There are some fun developments late in the book, but for me it wasn't enough to liven up the boring plot.\\n\\nBottom line for me, Mary's great character wasn't enough to make the boring plot okay for me.\\n\\nI was sent a complimentary copy of this book.\",\n",

I loved how Fixsen shows how Mary has a real change and growth throughout the course of the book - her own journey is strong in the plot (it isn't just all about the romance).

She begins to draw political cartoons to go with Samuel\\'s articles concerning the reformation going on in Parliament. She thinks their eventual romantic relationship likely, if not for the irritation and interference of Samuel\\'s friend Neil. Eventually Mary and Neil call a truce, but all other conflict in her life seems only to escalate, especially with her father\\'s disapproval constantly looming over her necessitating more and more secrets.\\n\\nMary grows up quite a bit in this book. She\\'s been so sheltered and the grievances she learns of from the newspapers come as quite a shock, but not quite as much a shock as when she gets into her father\\'s medical textbooks and learns what married men and women do...she is shocked beyond belief and it is hilarious.\\n\\n\"Nothing about it sounds normal. It\\'s ugly and unrefined and--and how am I supposed to know it isn\\'t terrifying if nobody tells me!\"\\n\\nThe first quarter to half of this book was a bit tedious because Mary was tedious herself. She\\'s seemingly never had a thought of her own and is very stifled and repressed. Throughout the book she learns about the world and makes friends and learns more about how families perhaps should interact. The hardest thing she learns, though, is what a real, loving relationship can be. After all, if she\\'s never had one before, why bother seeking one? She wouldn\\'t miss what she\\'d never had. So sad. Luckily she learns--and in enough time--what love and a true relationship can be. And so maybe we can excuse her if she doesn\\'t notice the heavy hints a certain gentleman sends her way,',\n",

She has been raised in a family that seems to not care much for her, she has little to no freedom, yet she is generally a kind, considerate, and positive young lady. I did not care for Mary\\'s family members much at all, though due to Ms Fixsen\\'s wonderful character development, my opinion had changed toward her father by the end of the book.\\n\\nMr Brown & Mr Murray are both heroes that a reader (and Mary) can fall for. Of course, I had a preference for one over the other, but I found that what I really enjoyed about the men was that they weren\\'t stagnant characters. Mr Murray\\'s character grew and developed as the story unfolded in a most pleasant way. He is a wonderful friend to Mr Brown and an all around good man, even if he sometimes makes poor judgments due to lack of knowledge/experience. Mr Brown was easy to fall for from the start and by the end, we find he\\'s more than just a pretty face obsessed with reform.\\n\\nMiss Pearl was a delight in this installment. I loved that she had an active role throughout the book and I really enjoyed that she was working with more than one match.

I wasn't sure about Neil Murray at first but liked him more as the book went on. The aunt and the father frustrated me. I wasn't too fond of the mother when she made an appearance. I also didn't really care for Samuel Brown. He was a luke warm character that seemed to only care about himself and reformation.

I was very excited to read this story as I love anything in Historical England.\\nThe book takes place in 1830 England. At that time the country and people wanted a change. Mary Buchanan had a less than meaningful life. She occupied her time helping her ailing aunt, agreeing with her politically opinionated doctor father, and her love of drawing. Her life changed when new neighbor, Samuel Brown, moves in next door. Samuel is a political reformer destined to change the world along with his best friend Neil Murray. Mary becomes infatuated with Samuel and soon begins her own journey of new ideas and self-reliance.\\nWhen I began this book, I had a difficult time being engaged in the story. As I continued I started finding myself becoming more and more interested in Mary. I wanted her to break out of her mundane life and discover herself. I enjoyed seeing her love art and using it to her advantage. She became determined and confident while learning about life and love.\\nI recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a cute romance while learning a bit of history. I would consider it a clean read even though Mary learns about attraction between men and women. A kiss is as far as it goes. This novel can be enjoyed as a stand-alone.

Mary, turned from an isolated girl to someone who manipulates, retaliates, meanly to her family. While I believe in her anger she made some choices that were not to my liking. She really needed to grow up and I feel like neither male in the book could give her that.\\n\\nI really disliked Mrs. Chin. After reading the other books in the series, this recurring character was not used to my liking. She came across the page as a sharp, almost rude person when in the picture.

She has a deplorable home life with a distant angry father and a hypochondriac aunt who rules the house with an iron fist. But with the help of the cook and a maid, Mary finds her freedom in occasional outings and in her talent with drawing. When she fixates on the reformer, Mr. Samuel Brown, who moves in next door and also becomes friends with another new neighbor, Mrs. Chin (aka Pearl), her future is irrevocably changed. And this is where the story proceeded to disgust me. Because of her crush on Mr. Samuel Brown, she ends up using her talent for drawing to create caricatures that are published in a newspaper. If they were just political in nature it wouldn't have bothered me but for various reasons, Mary decides she needs to learn about a man and woman's anatomy and sex ( which she reads about in graphic detail in her father's doctor books). She then proceeds to put sexual innuendo into her caricatures. If I hadn't agreed to review this book, I would not have finished it after this.

I am going with that, it was me, not you. Other readers really enjoyed it, give it a try. It just wasn't for me. Oh, and someone should have given the author the heads up that the matchmaker's name is Miss Pearl.\",\n",
       "  \"This appears to be the last installment for Power of the Matchmaker series. I have enjoyed each book in different ways and am so sad to see it come to an end. This book was enjoyable for me to read as an historian. It is a time I don't know much about, so I learned a lot. (Yes, I know it is fiction, but there are factual events.) I appreciated the interactions between the characters and the places they visited. My biggest complaint was that there was really no matchmaking and you can't tell it is connected to the other books. Her name wasn't even Pearl! A great stand alone book.\",\n",
       "  'I had a harder time getting into this book and never really connected with the characters. Mary’s life is very sheltered and her father and aunt do not treat her well. I felt for her, and liked seeing her grow and find her self-confidence, but never felt invested in her story. I didn’t feel like I ever got to know Samuel, beyond his passion for the reform movement. Niall annoyed me in the beginning, but grew on me as the book went on. I did like the way things ended.\\n\\nThe romantic relationships are clean, but there is some innuendo and the heroine turns to a book to learn about sex and some of the physical responses are described. In my opinion, it wasn’t necessary. I’ve read nine other books in the series, and all have been very clean, so I was surprised to see those things included.\\n\\nThe Power of the Matchmaker series is now complete. It has been fun to read these books and see the different techniques Miss Pearl uses to help couples find love. In this book, Miss Pearl is never actually called by that name. She goes by Mrs. Chin, and is Mary’s neighbor. I really enjoyed her part in the story.\\n\\nI received a complimentary copy of the book. This review contains my honest opinion.',\n",
       "  \"Interesting story! This gal is seriously over protected. I like that the young lady is a political artist that draws cartoons for the opposite party from her dad's alliance. Her dad and aunt were not endearing. In fact I found them unkind and controlling. I like that Mary is a cartoonist but watches the world from a window in her house. The story felt like the romance was part of the story but not really the main story. I felt strongly about the characters in the book. So that makes the book a good one, in my opinion.\\n\\nI received the book and choose to review it.\",\n",
       "  'This book in the matchmaker group approached the whole Pearl much differently than any of the others that I read. In fact I didn’t even realize that Mrs. Chin was the matchmaker until I realized that no other character was showing up to play the part. I love how subtlety she goes about being the matchmaker in this book and the side matchmaking… As far as the main plot goes it was very well done and a thoroughly enjoyable book.',\n",
       "  'This is the final book in the matchmaker series, and I have enjoyed reading them all, all different and yet based on the same premise.\\nWe are back in the 1830’s in merry old England, only its not merry at all, a lot chaos going on, and our girl Mary behind a pseudonym hides her art. A very controversial art, political cartoons, and we end up having a writer next door that writes for the paper. A match made in heaven?\\nWhat a great historical look at the political unrest at this period of time in England, and having an adamant father on one side and a man she admires on another. We also have Mrs. Chin, not Pearl as she was known in the other books, and she doesn’t seem to play as large a part.\\nWill Mary be able to achieve having the man of her dreams, or will fate play a trick on her? You are about to have a great journey here, and we are also going to Bath, to receive a healing?\\nI received this book through Inspired Kathy, and was not required to give a positive review.',\n",
       "  'Not sure who is more annoying or frustrating Mary or Neil. They were ridiculously stupid, cruel and oblivious. Plus they were supposed clever politicians. Simply unbelievable.',\n",
       "  'who shows the breadth and depth of her knowledge of the Regency period as this one does. You may guess the ending but will be entertained by how the characters arrive there.',\n",
       "  \"I liked the time period of this book, I haven't read much about this time period or subject so it was a fun change. It was a fun book and I liked it a lot. It wasn't my favorite in the Power of the Matchmaker series but it was good! POM is an amazing series that I've thoroughly enjoyed.\\nThe characters were fun. I'm not usually a fan of love triangles but I was ok with this one. I liked the coming of age and growth of the main character. Overall, it's a great book and I'd recommend it!\",\n",
       "  'I received a free book and voluntarily chose to review it. This book has romance, a secret, political trouble and is a good read. I did guess the secret before it was revealed. I have read a lot of books in my life time so I am often able to see where a story is going before I actually read it. I really felt so sorry for Mary. Her father is a tyrant and that word is much too good for him.',\n",
       "  'Rarely do you find a writer who can combine romance with intelligence and belly-shaking wit. Fixsen delivers again! Like her past books, this one keeps the tongue in one cheek through nearly every sentence and makes the reader feel that he or she is in on a private, 300 page joke. The twists and conclusion surprised me entirely, but truly, she left the clues all along the way. It is not part of a \"series\" but rather a collaboration and this book stands completely on its own, independent of any other matchmaker books. What a way to finish a \"series\" with a bang. I believe they saved the best for last! Read it and weep- but only because you are laughing so hard.',\n",
       "  'It may have been love at first sight for Mary Buchanan, but it was not love at first chapter for me. I had a hard time getting into this story. I looked up the reviews on Amazon to see what other people were saying and was surprised to find that most had good things to say about it. I started reading again to try one more time and still couldn’t get through it. I was disappointed that Ms. Pearl (or Mrs. Chin as she was called in this book) was lacking her usual charm; although I guess that is probably a challenge when a series is written by different authors. I have enjoyed most of the other Power of the Matchmaker series, but this one did not hold my interest.',\n",
       "  'It was another great addition to the Matchmaker series. The author did a great job with the characters they were well-developed characters. I have to say that the book was worth the read. It was a well-thought-out plot on the Matchmaker series. I would highly recommend this book series. I loved the twist to the true love.',\n",
       "  'This is another addition to the Matchmaker series. The heroine is a little naive at first. But with time she tiptoes out of her house into the real world. The relationship between her and the newspaper columnist evolves. The columnist is a thwarted soul. He is narcissistic. His best friend is the one with a soul. Albeit a tortured soul. Our heroine learns that her artistic talent has an outlet. She learns that she is very intelligent and can look at any political situation in a fresh manner. There are other plot lines which give this story depth and legitimacy. Well done!',\n",
       "  \"I love Jaima's smart and witty style. Her books are always well researched, her characters unique and real, and her language beautiful. A wonderful finale to the Power of the Matchmaker series.\",\n",
       "  \"Between 3 1/2 and 4.\\n\\nI enjoyed this story. It took me some chapters to get used to the voice, it wasn't my favorite.\\n\\nIt's a well researched historical and the main character went through some growth. I also liked the scenes with Pearl.\",\n",
       "  \"I have throughly enjoyed the Matchmaker Series! This one was just as FABULOUS as the rest of them! I REALLY loved Mary. Despite being young, she has so much heart and she is just a woman that goes after what she wants. I do love how she finally realizes who she really loves. While Mr. Brown has helped become more independant, or has fed her drive, she doesn't realize that Neil Murray is also, that her grit and stubborness is fed by his wanting to protect her. Just super cute!!\",\n",
       "  'Living next door to your political enemy must have been interesting in times gone by! This tale is well written appealing to readers with a sense of humour and a taste for adventure. Although living what must have been a rather boring life as the only ward of a wealthy doctor, our heroine manages to change her destiny.\\nNot only does she secure an income for herself, she finds the backbone to be able to tell her family members what she is willing to do. This story will appeal to those who abhor oppression of any kind. Most importantly, this is a love story. The reader is led through thoughts and experiences of the heroine as she matures and finally recognizes true love.',\n",
       "  \"This was a lovely weekend read. A young woman coming into her own despite an abysmal family life, and learning about love vs. lust. Set in 1830s London, this book had quite a bit of politics that history buffs would love. It is a clean romance. This book had a lot going on, and I couldn't read it all in one sitting, but I'm glad I did read it. *I received a free copy in exchange for an honest review.\",\n",
       "  \"So this book was fascinating. Yes, it's a great romance, with an unexpected plot that takes place during the political chaos of 1830's England during the reformation period. Also, it's #12 in the Power of the Matchmaker series so our beloved Ms. Pearl is present and stirring things up as usual.\",\n",
       "  'I\\'ve read the other books in this series, so when this became available on a review site for free in exchange for an honest review, I snagged it. I enjoyed the story and I thought the love triangle was well done (and I\\'m usually against them, so that\\'s a definite positive). The characters were all interesting. I think the reason that it\\'s just a 3 (\"liked it\") for me was that there were some mildly unclean parts that really weren\\'t necessary for the plot (and I kept waiting to see why they were included, but I couldn\\'t figure out a reason). It wasn\\'t filthy by any stretch, but it started in pretty quick with a small lust scene and later in the book the main character took it upon herself to educate herself on terminology. Neither of those scenes really had a very strong connection to the plot and it\\'s in a series that is in general pretty squeaky clean. So I don\\'t think it\\'s a deal breaker, but it is something to be forewarned if you\\'re wanting the squeaky clean. And although there was a matchmaker in this book, she didn\\'t feel the same as the had felt in the other books- although to be fair she did feel a little different in each book. Overall it kept me entertained for an afternoon. I appreciated the opportunity to review it.',\n",
       "  'Very enjoyable read.',\n",
