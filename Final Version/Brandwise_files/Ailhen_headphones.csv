0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered the ""mint/grey"" pair, and they aren't really mint, but rather a gorgeous shade of light teal/aqua. First, I bought the Green/grey pair for my daughter, and she loved them. I liked them so much, I had to order a pair for myself! They are very comfortable, look great, and sound great. The cord is a nice braided cable that resists tangling. Love them! I uploaded pictures of both so you can see the colors."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are really lightweight, good for children too. I let my 4 year old wear them some times. At first I thought they wouldnt expand out to fit my head but found out if you pull them a little harder its (hard to notice at first) they do adjust. And the mic works well. The sound is nice, but for my ears I cant wear them for more than a few hours. Otherwise, theyre good for normal use if your not going to sit all day with them on."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are just what I was looking for. I was having trouble talking on the phone for long periods of time because of needing to be mobile and use both hands. This was the perfect solution. Adjustable and fit comfortably, blocks out about 95% of the outside noise and the other party can hear you crystal clear."
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 8 year old son can be very hard on headphones. I bought him these to replace a set that the audio was cutting in and out on due to a crimped cord. The first thing I noticed about these is that they seemed well made for the price. These are much sturdier than the ones he had before. The sound is very nice offering crisp highs and nice lows without distortion. There are two features that I especially liked; first of all they fold up which makes it easier to for travel and to put in his backpack (he has to have his own set of headphones for school). Folded up in his back pack they are much less likely to get twisted, broken, etc. Secondly, I like the in line volume control. It is a slide switch not an up/down button that changes the volume on the device. What this allows me to do is to set the maximum volume level on the device and then he can control it through the slide switch up to that point. This is great for kids that tend to turn the volume up excessively."
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these. I can watch a movie or show on my laptop while my husband watches TV and it almost completely covers up the noise from HIS shows. The fit is comfortable on the ears, as the pads are quite generous, and I like that you can adjust these to be longer or shorter, depending on the size of your head. The sound quality is good - but if you're looking for Bose quality - it's not going to happen. If that's what you want - then go pay for it and don't complain about THESE. These are quite good for the price."
5,4.0 out of 5 stars,This product is absolutely fabulous my daughter can talk on her tablet with face time and you can hear her clearly. The sound is crisp the headphones adjust to her head and stay on snuggly. It has a long battery life as well she played for hours and it never shut off on her. The only downside is that I wear glasses so when I use these I can't wear them for too long or my ears hurt from my frames. Overall very happy.
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great little entry level headphones. If you have a teen or young adult and just want to have a little peace in the car, and let them jam out, these are for you.

Pros:

1) the headband is very comfortable to wear. I love that these fit well, and do not squeeze your head. My five year old can wear these pretty easily on the smallest setting, but they do border on being just a bit big.

2) the ear pieces are also comfortable, and cup my ears nicely. They do a decent job of dampening the sound, but they are not sound canceling. They do a great job for the price!

3) sound and sound control are nice and work well. These have great sound for entry level headphones.

4) I ordered the teal, and these are awesome. The color was pleasing to 5 and 8 year old girls, and our 13yr old nephew.

5) phone microphone is ok. Not the best ever, but it works, and I haven't had too many issues.

Cons:

1) I don't really have any cons. They are great for the price!"
7,2.0 out of 5 stars,"NOT LONG LASTING.
These were great for about three or four months but have now stopped playing sound out of the right ear. It wasn't like I was constantly using them either, I'm not a huge headphone person so would usually try to listen to something straight out of the device so it wasn't really them just getting over used or abused--for the most part they stayed in my desk drawer until I needed them and then one day when I needed them, the sound in the right ear kept cutting in and out and now it's gone altogether and will pop up occasionally if I move in just the right way."
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This head phone set is exactly what I have been searching for. My job requires a lot of phone calls and these work great for that. When I get a phone call, I put this head set on, and then place my I phone in my short pocket, and I can move to get files, make copies and even stack fire wood. The head set fits well and is very comfortable. By covering both ears, I am not distracted from the caller. Also the volume works really good. It actually will hurt your ears if you do not turn it down quick enough on certain calls."
9,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Another case of the buyer not understanding the technology, I guess. I bought these for my daughter who posts videos on YouTube a lot and is not happy with her microphone setup. So when she asked for headphones, and I found these that are described as having a built-in mic, and are compatible with phones and PCs, I thought this was the perfect thing. However, the mic part seems to be only activated when used with a phone, and not possible with a PC. I haven't found anything on the net that explains how to use the mic with a PC and would love feedback from any viewers if they have found the info. Also, the ear pieces seem uncomfortable for my large head. The pressure is too tight and the pieces are too small. I enjoy using Sony professional headphones for work. My 11 year old hasn't complained about their size, though."
10,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The structure of the headset is tough and durable. Not too find that it is wired since they were for my young son who doesn't keep still very well. The cord is long enough but personally think it could be a little longer to give more freedom for movement. The earcuffs are a good size as well. The volume is not as loud as I would like but as I said before, theyh are for a found child so that is not all bad. They seem more appealing for kids rather than asuults but either one could use them."
11,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are stylish and have exactly the audio quality you'd expect. Unfortunately, due to a bit of a cable tangle yank situation, the tip of the headphone jack freely dislodged itself from the rest of the jack... directly into my phone. You would not believe how much trouble it is to get just the tip of an audio plug out of a phone, and how many problems it creates when your phone thinks a headphone is there that really isn't. Bummer!"
12,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my children for school. The price was good and didn't expect much in the quality category but was pleasantly surprised. We're good out of the box and they have held up good thus far. Would recommend these if your not looking for high end headphones with a high price. Sound quality is average but for ththe price you can't beet them
13,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Higher quality than I expected for under $20. Sound is acceptable. Bass and low notes not great, but if you are listening on a computer to higher quality audio, you can still enjoy it. This isn't what a huge audiophile would use daily, but someone who just wants to Netflix binge without waking kids, this is a great choice. The build quality is surprisingly solid, with a braided reinforced cord. Microphone and volume control slider built into cord work just fine. Probably would be the most comfortable for someone with small ears, as the ear pads and cups are small on the small side. Again, overall a better product than I expected for the price."
14,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really excited about these headphones. They're comfortable and cute. However they do have some drawbacks. My hair frequently gets caught in the hinges or pulled by the rubber lining, which is annoying but not a huge deal.

The headphone plug is fragile. I've had these for about two months but already the wires inside the plug are showing signs of wear, to the point where I have to frequently adjust the plug or press on the cord to get full sound. I normally keep these at the top of my backpack or tote bag, and thought I was taking good care of them, especially in contrast to my old iPhone headphones, which I frequently abused and would last a year or two before breaking down.

If you're only planning to use these at your office desk and never unplug them or take them anywhere I'm sure they'll hold on fine (although the super long cord may get annoying). But if you're always on the go like me, spring for headphones that are more durable."
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not much bass, but what can you expect for under $20? I was pleasantly surprised that the sound was clear and the headphones comfortable. Honestly I was expecting to have to throw these out but based on the good reviews I was willing to give them a whirl.

I use them for a very long ferry and bus commute to and from work (you really don't want to do that with expensive earphones, trust me!). These serve their porpoise of making it clear I'm busy so I get left alone ;) but they also really do have decent sound. Not awesome sound, but far better than I anticipated considering the price.

I would definitely recommend these if you need a pair you aren't afraid to knock around a little bit. And to that point, it's been a month or so and there is literally nothing damaged on these either, so I suspect their durability will prove to be impressive as well!"
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never had much luck buying headphones for my wife. Over the years I must have bought her probably 6 different pairs and in almost 3/4 of those I ended up taking them back or keeping them for myself. They were too big, too tight, they were ugly. So, I thought I'd try again as this is what she still wants and now two weeks later is using them and I haven't heard a complaint yet. I really hope they last, but only time will tell."
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good sounding headphones. Not just for the price, but actually sound pretty good. I got them for my son, and out of curiosity tried them out for myself. Now, they don't sound quite as good as my Sony studio monitors, or my wife's Beats Studios, but they are pretty close. No idea how durable they are, time will tell as my 7 year old uses and abuses them. I'll be happy to get a year out of them for $20."
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for my son's 8th birthday and he has worn then nonstop, he loves them! After trying them out myself, the cushioning is extremely comfortable for extended wear and the cord seems pretty durable. I do notice that the collapsible feature of these headphones might be a little TOO easy to fold, but they do not affect performance and does not bother my son at all!"
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of this brand of headphones, I've purchased another color of the same type. Their excellent for the price, my kids live them, and their pretty durable. Volume is excellent, which my kids really like. For the money, you simply can't go wrong, plus there's a good variety of colors and their customer service is great, I've already received a email asking if I enjoy them, you'll love them!"
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a bit skeptical about buying these headphones but they looked so good I went ahead with the purchase. I am not disappointed one bit. The sound that these things put out is amazing. You can hear the bass, the mid range and the tweeters. They are so loud that I cannot listen the volume at it's max. It's no beats or bose but for $20 it is amazing."
21,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was getting tired of having earbuds stuck in my ear so I decided to give these headphones a try.
The fit is great and as is the sound both from the headset and the microphone. Where my wife complaining she couldn't always hear me during call she now talks about the clarity."
22,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are just about as ""OK"" as any headphones you're going to be able to buy for $20. Mine broke after about 6 months which seems like a decent run, but they just stay at my desk at work. First one side, now both sides. Unless I tilt my head in a weird way and don't move. I imagine if you're going to be using these more regularly and taking them around they would not last as long. They look pretty good for how cheaply they are probably made, but that's the best thing I can say about them."
23,5.0 out of 5 stars,What I liked the most about these head phones is that they are super comfortable. They are noise canceling and the wrapped cord is perfect. The cord is extra long so you can do whatever you need to. These are stylish. The only thing I didn't like was the silver part is plastic but it folds easily and is adjustable. You bet I'll be buying alihen again!
24,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked these headphones while they lasted, but I've only had them for two months and one side randomly stopped working. I wasn't particularly rough with them and they stopped working in the middle of me using them. I'm really disappointed because they were nice headphones."
25,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked these headphones. They are really cute. However, I've owned them for 3 months, and the sound has started to cut out in the right speaker. The padding started to slip off the headphone about a month ago. There is a reason they are cheap.

I do use them everyday, and walk about 40 minutes a day with them on, so you may have better luck than I if you're more gentle on them than I am."
26,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After trying a bunch of headphones for the kids, these have been by far the best. They also cancel noise pretty good - my son uses them in the car to watch movies and he can't hear me playing my music over these."
27,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter uses these for school. Not the absolute best sound. But they get the job done. A child doesn't need base anyway. They are better quality than most in the same price range. Would have preferred hidden wires, but you get what you pay for."
28,1.0 out of 5 stars,Was pleased with this product until recently. My son received these as a gift and now the interior wire has become disconnected after a couple of months and does not work on one side...
29,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones were a quick replacement for headphones that quit working just prior to a family trip to Hawaii. My son was thrilled with them initially (they looked cool and worked well). Unfortunately this didn't last long. About 2 weeks after getting back from our trip (and about a month after receiving the headphones), the audio connector snapped off inside my son's kindle fire. Not only did this make his headphones unusable (cable is an integral part of the headphones), but also kept him from hearing any sound from his kindle. I ended up having to take his kindle apart to remove the broken piece. This was not any easy task, and I'm lucky I didn't destroy the kindle in the process."
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these headphones for my granddaughter. She traveled with us to Florida over the Christmas break and loved them!!
31,5.0 out of 5 stars,so cool
32,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good. The kids are liking these headphones. They are 11 & 12 years old and the headphones are a bit big but still work great."
33,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these as a Christmas gift for my sister and she loves them! The color selection is great (got the mint green) and I like the style. My sister says they’re a good fit and good sound quality.
34,2.0 out of 5 stars,They worked just fine for a few months and then just died in mid-use. I guess that’s what you get for the price.

45,5.0 out of 5 stars,"we gave these as a gift, I believe the recipient liked them."

47,5.0 out of 5 stars,she liked it
48,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound was great and they worked really well until about 2 months after I got them. One ear stopped working about 1.5 months after I got them, and the other broke after 2 months"

50,5.0 out of 5 stars,niceQ

79,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say I liked this product when I first got it. The packaging was nice with no damage! However these headphone did not hold up for even a month. They did live up to their standards however the wiring did break so only one side worked, but was really drowned out."
80,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great for a while. After about 6 months, one ear is losing sound. I did like that I could fold the headphones and put it in a bag easily. Sound was great while it lasted."

97,4.0 out of 5 stars,It sounds nice I haven't had a headphones way to many years. So I have nothing to compare to. I like them so far thank you. And the color is fun and bright blue that is.

104,3.0 out of 5 stars,"You get what you pay for. The material feels cheap, the audio sounded poor and the headphones where way to wide for my head. They look decent and will work if you're not looking for high quality music streaming."
105,1.0 out of 5 stars,These broke within weeks of receiving them. The metal piece that goes into the headphone jack bent. These are not good quality and I would not recommend.

107,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product!
108,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't sound as good as I had hoped. Pretty color and sturdy built and I liked the volume control. However they did not sound very good. Apple headphones sound better.
109,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They broker after a couple weeks, but while they lasted they were very good. I don't personally think it was worth the money, sorry to say. Maybe invest in something a bit more expensive?"
110,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. Excellent so far. The only problem which is minor is the adjustability is for adults only. Too big for my 11 year old that I bought them for. Great price so I will keep them as a back up or use them myself.
111,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter wanted these to use with her laptop. They are comfortable and the sound quality is good.
112,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the money they are great headphones. Very good sound reproduction qualities.
113,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product for the price. The only thing (for me) is I have a big head and wish the adjustment would be longer to totally secure the ears. Regardless, the product is great and my music sounds fabulous. Highly recommended."
114,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Far from sound proof of any kind, but I know they're not advertised as that. Sound is good, and they're comfortable."
115,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for about a month, I don't use them often and I take care of them... The mic has already gone bad on it. It sounds like I'm underwater.....
They look cute though?"
116,2.0 out of 5 stars,It stop working in less than a month. the connection went out as it seems the wiring has a problem near the 3.5mm jack. Could not rehab the problem and had to purchase a replacement.
117,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones may look nice and be comfy, but the audio quality is absolutely horrendous. Voices sound muffled and have a grainy quality. Mid tones are lacking and high tones are nearly non-existant."
118,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought them for my wife and she loves them.
She like the soft feel on the ears, not hot like some full headphones but still has good clarity.
She is going to order more and send as gifts."
119,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved the headphones. They were a little big for my son's head but he will grow into them. The sound quality was great and the quality of the headphones were great as well. All around the headphones are amazing.
120,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for kids, well built and great sound quality."
121,2.0 out of 5 stars,Headset appears to work good. After four (4) month only sound that could be heard was static.. Music can be heard when move around but talking would be drowned out when used on laptop and cell phone.
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love all of my Ailihen Headphones they have a nice clean sound."
123,2.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap

128,4.0 out of 5 stars,No complaints.
129,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am extremely pleased with my headphones. Amazon has never let me down so far. And I will continue shopping with them.
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my daughter for school just a few weeks ago. The color is awesome and they seem pretty durable and sturdy. I'm not sure what the cord is made out of but I love it and it looks as though it will hold up nicely. My daughter is 8 and is super big for her age so these fit her really well.
131,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son needed headphones for school.. Green is his favorite color so these were an even bigger bonus! They work well and I am not worried about him getting an ear infection from earbuds being in his backpack for a week with who knows what, since they don't go in his ear."
132,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality was good, both listening and for the person on the other end of the line. I gave this a 3 star however, because I did not find the headphones very comfortable. They pinched my ears a bit and I am looking for headphones I could wear for multiple hours. These are on-ear headphones."
133,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this headset and liked the fit and color very much. It was a lot more comfortable than headsets I had used in a similar price range. After 4 months the 3.5 mm plug connection to the phone was not working properly and the audio would fade in and out. I contacted Ailihen and they responded promptly and made some suggestions of 4 things to try to solve the problem. After trying the 4 suggestions with no improvement, they offered to send me a new headset free of charge, which they did and I had a brand new headset within several days. They were very professional and kind in their interactions. In summary, a great headset for the price and excellent customer service."
134,5.0 out of 5 stars,10 year old daughter is loving these... I'm a little jealous too. LOL. They appear to be of very good quality and have decent sound reproduction. Love the fact they're one cord only. Daughter also likes the volume control and pause button in line. She also likes the mint green color. Can't really complain.... Pirate approved.... Arrrrrrrrrrrrr!
135,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very cute and comfortable. The sound quality is better than I expected for the price - not bass-heavy, so it's not gonna feel like Beats-style imitation headphones, but it is clean and crisp sound. Only major problem with them so far is that the sides aren't adjustable, so they are just ever so slightly too large for my head - I wouldn't be able to work out in these because they would fall off, but listening to music or watching videos they work great."
136,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this in early February. When I got it, it was great. Good sound, comfortable to wear, worth the price.
But despite taking care of it, at the end of March, the headphones started having issues. Now my left side is wonky. I have to hold the cord a right way in order for me to hear sound coming from the left. I've had cheaper headphones that worked longer than these.

If my headphones didn't have issues a month after purchase, I would give this 5 stars."
137,5.0 out of 5 stars,"light weight, great sound.
We purchased this headphone for our son who is very ""rough"" on items. It has truly helpup to all the use he has put it though. I love that they fold down for easy storage. Great purchase for children."
138,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like mine, they are soft and fit well on my ears and head. I don't get a headache when I wear them like some over the ear headphones give me. I use then a couple hours a night while doing homework and studying. Didn't block outside noise 100% but well enough that I can focus while my family watches TV in the other room."
139,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in love with this headphones, honestly talking I wasn't expecting much from it but it surprise me how good they are.
1st they are REALLY comfortable you barely feel that you have them on
2nd the music sound AMAZING in them the volume is perfect you can either have it loud or low with no problem
3rd and this is a plus, you don't hear your surrounding, which for me is great cause I want to listen to my music not to what the person next to me is saying
In simple words they are perfect. 👍👍👍"

185,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones in February and the sound has already gone out on the right side. Not worth the money.
186,3.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are okay. I broke mine very easily. Plus the left side headphone stopped working after a while.
187,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great, the adjustable fit works for both a 10-year-old and a parent. They are also exceedingly comfortable."
188,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son received these for Christmas and they are working great for him! Good headphones for the money!
189,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a gift for our daughter (9yr old). She absolutely loves them. They are comfortable & she likes the pause & volume options on the cord. Great gift option for anyone!!

193,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter really enjoyed the headphones, though her use has been limited. Unfortunately, after only a few weeks, the headphones no longer work properly. I cannot recommend them."
194,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Ailihen V8 Folding Headphones. They are comfortable and the long nylon cord is an invention that makes so much sense. I just bought another pair for a friend.
195,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They look nice, but I keep getting emails about doing a review so that is why a lower rating. We haven't used them yet because they are a Christmas gift."
196,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones arrived quickly and worked as expected, and as described."

199,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted almost a month before one side failed
200,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bulkier than expected. Usage was for sleeping so might be my mistake.
201,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good fit and comfortable.
202,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones arrived right on time and the quality is much better than I expected for the price. Great deal and service.
203,5.0 out of 5 stars,My granddaughter loved them. Great headphones.
204,4.0 out of 5 stars,Too early to determine.
205,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones were delivered in time. I'm satisfied by the product itself, with the only downside that it starts to hurt a little when put for too long (around 45 min-1 hour for me) and even then its more a slight annoyance than a real issue."
206,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value and terrific sound.
207,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered three of these all from the same manufacturer and distributor. They were all broken by the end of the first week. One of them was defective right out of the box. When I tried to email the distributor the email address no longer worked.
208,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful headset clear and flexible great that I just received another pair
209,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exactly what I needed! I wanted something that would allow me to make phone
calls from my google phone in a crowded environment with a lot of background
noise."
210,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Color , size , and softness speakers are very clear very comfortable"
211,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what he needed.
212,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product. I got it on time.
213,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves them. The color and fit is perfect for his head. Thank you
214,2.0 out of 5 stars,Just ok. These look cute but are not adjustable like every other headphones I've ever seen. So if your ears do not match up perfectly with the them...too bad. :(
215,5.0 out of 5 stars,Came quickly. This is my sons second pair and he specifically asked for these saying they are good.
216,2.0 out of 5 stars,I was unhappy with this item. The sound was of poor quality.. the worst problem was that the back ground music. It would overpower the audio and could not be turned down.
217,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son LOVES his head phones!! This is a great product for a GREAT price! I definitely recommend this product!! Love how comfy they are and how they fold away nicely!
218,5.0 out of 5 stars,Second purchase. first ones lasted a long time. Very well built. Can take a beating from a 16 year old!
219,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love! They not only look great but more importantly, they sound great! Impressed with the value and comfort and would definitely recommend."
220,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was the best $9.99 I've spent in a long time. ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️ Sound is great. Great quality.
221,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use it for my Xbox and iPad. Good sound quality but the ear phones do not turn so if you have it on for 15 min it hurts your ears. But other wise their pretty nice.
222,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter loves this headphones, they have great sound and are perfect for her, she's 11."
223,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's for my daughter- her Christmas present as she requested. It's not been opened yet, but I hope she'll love it."
224,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought as Christmas present for Grandson. He gives them a two thumbs up rating!
225,4.0 out of 5 stars,Its functional but light weight like cheap plastic and the ear bud is small so it sits on my ears. Cheap for the price
226,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are a gift so they haven't used them yet....I am sure they will be very happy with them!!!
227,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for our 14 year old granddaughter, and the fact that she wore them a lot after receiving, is testament enough that they were worth it."
228,2.0 out of 5 stars,These are our second pair. Both pair have stopped working after a short amount of time.
229,5.0 out of 5 stars,These were of good quality. I enjoy the sound they provide as well as the nice teal/mint color. They are fairly comfortable and worth the purchase
230,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They are beautiful, great sound, and easily adjustable. I get feedback in the headphones when there isn't anything playing. It also isn't as tall as I need them and gives me a headache from the pressure on the top of my head."
231,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these headphones for my daughters birthday! Of course she loves them! Very nice and comfortable to wear also good quality of sound! Also the price of them isn't bad either!
232,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with these headphones. Love the color and the sound is very clear
233,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good quality at all. Thought they’d be great for just listening to my electric guitar through my amp and these things crack with every sound.
234,2.0 out of 5 stars,I liked the style the best. Least was the lacking of depth of the sound. Would give it 2.5 stars. Am actually paying for shipping to return it.
235,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product with good quality.
236,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought 2 pair...both have stopped working with very little use. Had one pair replaced and same thing happed. Not a good purchase.
237,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones and super service
238,1.0 out of 5 stars,only one side of the headphones works.
239,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad, but they don't hug my ears like other headphones that I have used in the past. They are also inclined, and in spite of adjusting the headband, to slip forward on my head if I lean over."
240,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Light weight, sound quality is good (very good for gym), and construction, even though plastic, is good. The fit over the ears is acceptable but could be better. If you are looking for significant noise cancelling, these are not for you. But they do help. Overall and for the price they are worth trying. No regrets."
241,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great seller, bad product. Bought one set, the sound went out in one ear within weeks. Seller replaced very quickly under warranty without any hassle at all. Replacement set had the same problem within a few weeks, too- sound in one ear becomes unreliable, goes in and out when the cable moves, then stops working entirely. Wiring issue? Would buy from this seller again, but not this manufacturer."
242,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like these head phones. Got them for my 4 year old son who has a average size head and they work great. He uses them mostly for listening to movies in the car when we go on trips. I like the volume control on the wire of the head phones.
243,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my 10-year-old for Christmas this year as he was wanting Dr. Dre Beats and I was clearly not going to spend that kind of money on headphones for someone this age. These were surprisingly comfortable with decent sound and excellent noise reduction. Highly recommend these headphones at this price point. My son loves them!
244,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have great sound for the price. But after a short period of listening, they become uncomfortable and painful to the outsides of my ears. I've tried adjusting them every-which-way, with the same results. I don't have unusually large or small ears, but maybe these headphones just don't fit me correctly."
245,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the color! My son loved that he could control his iPad with the controls on the cord. I like how compact they fold & I do not hear his utube videos when he is laying next to me wearing them. These fit both of my boys...Bought for my almost 6 year old, but my 11 year old like to steal them too!"
246,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones to use at work for my music streaming on my cell phone. I absolutely love them! They fit really nicely on my ears and are very lightweight. I highly recommend them.
247,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked less than a year & wouldn't ya know, by the time I was able to get to the return process, it was too late :/ Crazy thkng is, I bought a set for each of us & they all crashed around the same time. I guess they're supposed to only last long enough to get you past the allowable return time."
248,3.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter has had these for 3 months and there must be something loose because the sound coming from the left side is hit or miss. If I tilt my head to the left and keep it there then it’s all good. 3 stars because technically they still function I guess.
249,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not sure what's the hype about. I guess it's the price. To me the sound is just average, I find more treble and clarity in my ear buds. For what I use them, they're fine, but I wouldn't buy another pair."
250,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
251,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product looks like the display. I enjoy my headphones not only can I listen to music but I can also talk through the mic and people have said that it sounds very clear !
252,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful color and the sound is great. They are super comfortable and love that they can fold.
253,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased with these headphones.

255,3.0 out of 5 stars,"ok, but far from great sound was muffled compared to better headphones still in the $30 price point"
256,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son loves the ""adult"" look and feel of these headphones. I like the volume control, so its a win for us both!"
257,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product for use at school.
258,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awsome you cant hear any noises out side of them and the loudest voulume is louder than my phones highest volume
259,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the color, also they are comfortable. But if you really enjoy sounds, this is not the best option. It’s poor quality."
260,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had the headphones for about a month before one side gave out, and then another week before they just stopped working entirely."
261,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones! Great sound and cool design, the only negative trait is that my pair stopped working in only a few months."
262,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and durability
263,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Gift for my 8yr old, he loves them. I tried them on and they are very comfy and noise canceling."

265,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them! Lightweight good volume!
266,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones work flawlessly. They are vibrant and work as described. Price is great and would definitely order again!
267,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are awful. They are way too big and they hurt my head and ears. They look nice and are soft to the touch.
268,1.0 out of 5 stars,These broke off in our iPad within 1 week of using. Super disappointed and a waste of money.
269,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my daughter and she loves them! They are comfortable, a great color and have awesome features like volume control. A great price too!"

276,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like them very much
277,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent headphones for the price. I thought I was buying ""around the ear"" headphones. These are ""on ear"". Less comfortable and less sound isolation."

290,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones were great only draw back was they were to big for one of the grandsons but other than that everything from ordering to receiving were great
291,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My kid loves these headphones. Earbuds always hurt his ears, and these are nice and comfy. We purchased a hard case so he can put them in his backpack."

294,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter love the look and feel of these. Sound quality is good and perfect for her needs.
295,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones aren't producing any sound at all. No matter what it's plugged into, and even if I have the volume turned all the way up."
296,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My 12 year old grandson showed these headphones to me on Amazon and asked me to buy them for him. He gave me the money and two days later he had them. He loved them. Good value, good styling and he loved the sound.
One week later he texted me saying the headphone plug broke off in his phone. He was very upset.
They should certainly have lasted more than a week. I cannot recomend them."
297,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for about 2 months. They work great, but the cable is already fraying. From the looks of it, I estimate the useful life of this purchase will be 6-9 months."
298,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased as a gift. The recipient is very pleased with it... Simple... not a lot of bells and whistles!
299,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great so far

301,5.0 out of 5 stars,sound great for the money!

327,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For a kid who wants beats, these suited him just fine and at a lot better price. Great sound, comfortable wear and cool look. I love that they fold up compact and can be stored in a case to protect them from damage when not being worn."

335,4.0 out of 5 stars,My kids each got a pair of these for XMas and everyone loves them.

339,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke within 1.5 months
340,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. They don't block out ALL sound. But the quality is good for the price. The headphones fold up nicely and produce good sound quality.

347,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this though it could be a bit louder. The colors are beautiful. But anyway it is great and I suggest it to people who are looking for headphones.
348,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound was very good and not like in a box or underwater. The wires inside the jack did not last. Now my sound cuts in and out
349,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love tbese headphones! i use them to watch my shkws on netflix and the sound quality is so good that i can hear background conversations! lol
350,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones...I had a pair that were tight, but these are a good fit. I use them at the gym and they work well. They fold, a good feature for them to fit in my gym bag. They don't shut out all the sound, but that's fine. They muffle the sound of the weights being dropped by those jerks, such a jarring sound! Music sounds good through them. Thanks for a good product."
351,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed these for an all day nursing simulation. They were so comfortable, the audio quality was great, and everyone heard me clearly. I like that the length of the cord. It's long enough to stand up and move around."
352,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these for my teenage grandson for Christmas --- he used them for a couple hours yesterday and several hours today --- he loves them. They appear to be very good quality and he said the ""fit"" is perfect."
353,4.0 out of 5 stars," Love these headphones so much! Honestly I was afraid to get these becaus of the price but to my suprise they are absolutely amazing. The sound is very nice and clear, and as the volume goes, it goes pretty high. I love the way it sounds and especially the look of it. I got the tourqiouse color and im ipressed with how it looks. I read other reviews on how they didnt like it but im very pleased and recommend this product. I dont have anything bad to say about this. I even like how its foldable for on the go."
354,1.0 out of 5 stars,We've been purchasing headphones from this company for the last few years but this set has been unbelievably disappointing. The company has already replaced ours once and the replacement headset has already broken.
355,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought as an Easter gift for my 9 year old. In limited use (2-3 times per week) and they are already unusable. Were good at first with solid noise cancelling ability but as of this writing in June (about 2 months) they barely play sound and its mostly muffled and broken up. Tested on several devices to ensure its headphones and unfortunately, it is. Not good quality. Do not recommend to buy at all, they don't last and you will be disappointed."
356,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are great headphones. Love that they fold up too! I even ordered a pair for my son and he loves them too.
My favorite part is the volume on the cord. and the string is not a typical plastic covered wire, which makes working out with them even better. They don't get caught on anything and the cord doesn't tangle up either."
357,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two pairs of these for my tween sons and have to say that they were one of the best purchases for the holiday so far! The headphones are not only comfortable and cleverly designed, but they were within an affordable price range. I imagine most parents with teenagers will appreciate this due to the incredible number of expensive headphones/earbuds/etc. we've purchased that have either gotten lost, broken, or flat out disappeared into thin air. Thanks, AILIHEN team for designing headphones with my kids in mind! Cheers!"
358,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the color of these headphones. They are a little tight after wearing for an hour but this is only a slight nuisance. These are not noise canceling but they do a pretty good job. I sometimes wear them at work, even when I am not listening to anything, to drown out colleagues talking. I like that the cord is not plastic. Definitely recommend."
359,4.0 out of 5 stars,I'm giving this a 4 rating due to the non adjustment for those with a smaller head. However they work great I use them while doing my housework listening to music or my wonder Bible that I really love
360,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Doesn't sound incredible, but good enough for the price. We had another set that lasted about 6 months and the plug on it now needs replacing."
361,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shipped quickly.
Headphones are great quality.
Will be buying these again because I now have to get my daughter a pair!"
362,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great 👍
363,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality sound, though the cord is a little longer than what I'm used to. So far I'm very pleased with the headphones."
364,1.0 out of 5 stars,they broke within a month of me using them. totally not worth the $20. just invest in a good pair of headphones

370,1.0 out of 5 stars,They lasted only a couple months before one side went out.
371,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty and comfortable headphones, but poor sound quality. If you are bass lover, this headphones are not for you."
372,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value. Clear sound and although not rated as noise cancelling, they do block out quite a bit of sound."
373,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice, but broke easily"
374,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Shorted after extremely careful minimal use in less than 2 months since received. One side no longer has sound, short seem to be at the headphone jack part of the cord."
375,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my 8 year old. He loves them
376,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a gift from my kids really love them they're not totally noise canceling but for the price point I think they're really great buy!!!

382,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones overall. However not a good choice for running/working out. I found that these headphones made me very hot

387,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good for the price. 👍
388,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my autistic grandson for our plane ride to Disney. They not only acted as an earplug he loved them. No discomfort
389,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product is not worth the money. I've had it less than 2 weeks and the sound started to disconnect. I would not buy this again.
390,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast delivery. My 14 year old is in love
391,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter really enjoys them.

398,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy so far. Way better than earbuds for watching movies on my tablet, but way more reasonable than some of the “designer” brands!"
399,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Microphone part of the headphones quickly broke and left them with only listening aspect. besides that they're good.

408,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift for my daughter, she likes them very much and so far they are working well."
409,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very cute. Soft cushions. Does not connect well to my iPhone 5s. Poor sound quality. Volume control is clumsy and there is no remote.
410,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The volume control being a slider is a little weird. Other than that, it's wonderful!"
411,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. Good sound for the price paid. Are they noise canceling - no. But they do block out some noise and have decent tone.
412,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two sets of these AILIHEN headphones, one for my 5 year old and one for my 8 year old. Both kids love them! They fit well and the sound is great. They seem to be very well made. I would definitely purchase again."
413,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, comfortable. Great Schitt"
414,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great starter headphones for my pre-teen grandchild. Love the color choices.

416,3.0 out of 5 stars,One side stopped working after 3 months
417,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these...well did, love. They quit working 3 days after the return window. I recommend buying the insurance. I did not."
418,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these headphones, and when the package was ""delivered"" it was a completely empty envelope. Not even a piece of paper in it. Nothing."
419,1.0 out of 5 stars,My son liked the color but that's about it. Here we are 2 months later after receiving this item and it no longer works. Very frustrated
420,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are of high quality and love the way they fold.
421,4.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful headphones
422,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke after a week.
423,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent and my daughter love it!!
424,2.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought these headphones for my 11 year old daughter, and they were too small. We will regift them to a 4 year old niece, instead of going through the hassle of returning. Very cute color though."
425,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable when I use them. Also I like that it arrived fast. Thanks
426,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They work great. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that I personally don't like to have my ears covered, but they are comfortable. I would recommend them to my friends and would buy them as a gift."
427,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the color. Love the corded cable. Love that they fold up. However, they are bigger than expected and are quite loose on my 11 year old daughter, and on me (< 40 yrs) as well."
428,1.0 out of 5 stars,Speakers and microphone worked great initially. Now microphone functions only when cord is held at a specific angle.
429,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ear pad falls off easily and is not easy to put back on...it is meant to slip back under a piece which is impossible to so once it falls off.
430,5.0 out of 5 stars,Present for my 11 daughter. She loves them
431,5.0 out of 5 stars,After purchasing these for one of our daughters we bought a second pair for the other daughter as the first pair was such a hit. Colors are great too. Definitely recommending these!
432,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these
433,5.0 out of 5 stars,A+++
434,5.0 out of 5 stars,Daughter loved them. She lives the gassy that she can fold them up and pack away in her back pack.
435,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These just arrived, and I’m already in love with them! Fits well, the volume is very accessible and such good sounds!"
436,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves them. He is 6 and they fit him great!
437,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good quality.
438,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for someone else. They are pleased. No news is good news.
439,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sound quality at a very affordable price!
440,1.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter got these headphones on Christmas Eve (Dec 24) today is Dec 29 and they've already quit working!
441,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fit snugly. Came with manufacturing warranteed of 1 year. Mic and button work great. Good sound quality for it price.
442,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked for about 2 weeks and then the cable shorted out... don't waste your money! Will be returnng!
443,2.0 out of 5 stars,"While the headphones are a fun color, comfortable to wear and foldable, they only lasted about six weeks. Not worth the money."
444,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for gaming
445,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son is very happy with these! He just figured out that they can pause and play, as well as control the volume."
446,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable fitting and I like that I can fold them up. Good sound quality.
447,1.0 out of 5 stars,We missed the return date by one day. They quit working today. I was hoping they weren’t cheap. Super disappointed.
448,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful. Told all about these
449,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones! Works really well!! Its worth the price
450,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not very durable. The wire inside the head band is what breaks. Good sound quality when it worked.
451,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great! Fast delivery, thanks!"
452,1.0 out of 5 stars,The pin literally fell out of the jack today rendering these headphones useless. And 7 days after our return policy expired :(
453,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say?
This is the best headphone I've owned thus far,its really loud & blocks outside noise.Would definitely recommend."
454,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked really good for a few days. The cord is very weak.. after a weak they break... all you hear us static... was very disappointed
455,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son left loves them, great sound and price"
456,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great price. A little uncomfortable after an hour of wear.
457,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nicely made and work great!
458,3.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones do not fit snug on ears. Not a good purchase for a classroom set of headphones.
459,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice headphones
460,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased two of these. One pair stopped working after a month, the second was only used once and the connector piece that goes in the headphone port broke, not completely off but the end is wobbly. Not willing to try plugging it in again for fear it'll get stuck in the headphone port."
461,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The build quality on these is very good and so is the noice cancellation, but the sound quailtity is very meh. The highs are drowned out by the rest of the sound and are very muddy. The bass is fine along with the mids. Overall: Not great, but not awful either.

EDIT: The casing around the headphone plug is VERY weak. They were plugged into my phone in my back pocket, when I sat down the casing around the metal bit that goes into my phone snapped. Have to fidget with it before the sound comes back now."
462,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought 4 of these. All in different colors. None of them even lasted a month or two. The sound started going out on them. You had to wiggle the cords to get sound back. Then it just finally quit.
463,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For such a reasonable price, these headphones provide great quality sound and I love that they fold up! I use these in my classroom at my computer station and they are very easy for my students to clean and put away. When students are wearing them, I am not able to hear what they are doing which is very nice for my other students. This was a great purchase!"
464,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It looks like a great product and good price too, unfortunately the wiring cable is very fragile. I bought 3 for my kids, they are all broken. I think if the cable was not attached...maybe I just could replace it..however if you still use in a safe place and you don't touch a lot, it may still work for you."
465,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for school to go with the Ipads the kids use. Nice that they fold up for storage and adjust easily.
466,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought an headphone for my son and decided to buy this green headphone for myself. I didnt use it immediately as i bought it. It was still in its case etc. when i started to use it both soft spongy area came off. Making it unbearable to wear and listen to my class work undisturbed. Now i do not have a headphone. I only can look at the useless pretty green headphone as a decoration. I believe i should get a replacement or my money back.
467,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that it helps reduce alot of the background noise and that there is a hassle-free microphone for talking. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, it's really bulky. I'm sure that if it was reduced in size, the rating would go up."
468,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have bought 2 pairs of these headphone and neither pair lasted longer than 1.5 months. I assumed the first pair was just a lemon (it happens) and that's why it only worked for a month. But after buying a second pair of AILIHEN headphone and this pair only last 1.5 month I can only assume that this is an extremely sub par product. I have never had a electronic product perform so poorly. I will never by any product by AILIHEN again - I have no trust in their brand or the quality of their products after this.
469,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter got these for her birthday. She absolutely loves them and brings them everywhere. Sturdy enough that her 2 and 4 year old siblings haven't been able to break them yet. After showing them to her cousin, we ended up purchasing another pair for him for Christmas. Great quality, great sound, durable and noise canceling (or selective hearing?)"
470,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are a beautiful color and work really well. My daughter loves the volume and pause on the wire cord!
471,1.0 out of 5 stars,These broke within a month of buying them. They just stopped playing sound. Very upsetting for my 8 year old!
472,4.0 out of 5 stars,I enjoyed my pair so much that I ordered a pair for my grandson. Now we both enjoy are Ailihen C8 headphones.
473,5.0 out of 5 stars,I just got them today and they work great!!!! I live the color too. The cord is a little long but I can deal with it. I love the volume slider button on it.
474,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones exactly as advertised. For a low-priced item, it has decent sound and the headphones are comfortable."
475,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves them.
476,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase! I would definitely purchase from seller again.
477,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Broke quickly, bad sound, don't recomend"
478,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price. Cute and fold up nicely. Very heavy and do not fit completely comfortable.
479,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the headphones it Meats everything that I need them for very good product
480,2.0 out of 5 stars,The head phones itself work well but the ear cushions come out very easily and we were unable to put them back.
481,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice headphones. Feels comfortable on a (10-year old) child and even on adults. Good sound quality.
482,1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT PURCHASE!!! Right when I opened these, the piece that connects to my phone/iPod broke off. There is dried glue around the edges where the metal piece was clearly glued into the plastic cord. I am returning them. Rip off!!!"
483,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product!! My son loves these!! And the sound quality is super crisp!! Great audio fidelity!! And a great price!!
484,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to buy new headphones thanks to my cat chewing through my old ones. I love theses ones because it has a nice durable nylon cord that so far has thwarted the attempts of my cats sharp teeth whenever he manages to attack them while I'm using them. One my favorite things about these headphones is how sound isolative they are, perfect for being able to zone out to my music without being disturbed by any background noise, plus they look nice and are well put together. They are also better quality than ones that I have payed more for in the past so I'm definitely in love with them. Besides the cat, im pretty harsh on headphones myself but I have had these ones for close to a month I believe and I have not had any issues with any kind of parts coming off or the cord breaking easily. At this point I don't have anything bad to say and I'd recommend them to anyone wanting decent headphones without having to spend a fortune on some"
485,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality on these headphones is terrible. The earbuds that came with my iPhone have sound quality a million times better than these headphones... 30 seconds of listening and I knew I was going to need to return them. Also the volume control doesn't actually adjust the volume on your device, only raises or lowers on top of the volume you've already set on the device. I had to crank the volume way up on my phone and increase the volume on the headphones to reach the level I usually use with my other headphones.

I knew at $20 sound quality was going to be a gamble, but the other positive reviews convinced me to try them. Now I'm out the return shipping, so learn from my mistake and pick some higher quality/more expensive headphones if sound quality is important to you."
486,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought it for my niece in college per her request... she said she loves it!!!
487,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them work great !

489,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for my son to use at school in September. It is December and they've been sent home broken. Piece of garbage!
490,1.0 out of 5 stars,So much static! Couldn't hear my media at all. So disappointing.
491,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice headphones
492,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great price for this product. My daughter needs headphones for school and I didn't want to get anything too pricey just in case she lost them. They work great and she loved the way they look!
493,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. Comfortable for an adult sized head
494,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones that cancels and filters noise. It's also a good color, like the outline of the green popping out."
495,2.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is ok. The band is so large it barely stays on my head.
496,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can ignore the world with these headphones on! These headphones are worth every penny.

514,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These work well, but they are a little large for my head (however, I'm an adult who has a small head)."
515,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty comfortable and works well. Haven't tested microphone aspect.
516,1.0 out of 5 stars,No noise cancelling and you can hear the music from across the room even when someone is properly wearing the headphones. We also had problems with the MIC.
517,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this item. I got it for my son who loves the headphones
518,5.0 out of 5 stars,bought them for a long flight. love the way they fold. great color. sounds great.

520,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my teenage daughter. Light weight and sound is good for the price. She uses them for her laptop and iPhone. It doesn't work with her kindle.
521,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, not over the ear though. A little uncomfortable after long periods of use"
522,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable. The sound is a little more dominant on the left side but otherwise they're awesome
523,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones, haven’t found anything wrong yet."
524,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality. The wires started breaking after just a couple of months right by the jack.
525,5.0 out of 5 stars,I loved the product but it is against the law to drive with headphones covering both ears in case of emergency
526,1.0 out of 5 stars,Got them for my son for his school.... totally disappointed ... Really bad.... got them after 1 week stopped working😩😩
527,5.0 out of 5 stars,They have good sound! Very comfortable! And they look very stylish!

529,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent sound
530,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel so cool wearing these. My cool points go up 1000%. I can do the whole sidelong ""What are you looking at?"" and people are like, ""Woah, that chick is so cool, we better not go near her unless she shames us for our nerdery.""

All kidding aside--and my jokes are terrible ones--these are lovely headphones. I'm not a headphone aficionado, but these perform just as well as several higher-priced pairs I've had over the years. Plus they're cool. The cord is wrapped in fabric and stuff. It's awesome. They're also massively comfortable and I've worn them for hours at a time without feeling the pinch.

My only complaint is that the sound adjustment is a light touch. It goes from, ""Eh, I could use a little more sound."" to, ""HOLY ****BALLS I CAN'T FEEL MY EARS""

But that didn't take more than the one time to learn, so overall I'm keeping it at a full 5/5 stars. Cheers."
531,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for teenage boy and so far they have held up well and he loves them. They are loud, to the point that when he has them around his neck, i can hear clear as day."
532,4.0 out of 5 stars,"good sound quality for the price, only complaint is its a little tin-y"
533,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones! They feel very comfortable on my sensitive ears. I usually can't use headphones for long amounts of times due to my ears getting sore. But they feel so snug and comfortable.
534,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use at work. Very comfortable when listening to webinars.
535,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than the Sony set these replaced, much better. Only negative, ""made in China"" so it's 4 stars only"

564,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price
565,4.0 out of 5 stars,Inexpensive option for headphones and conference calls. Nice style too.
566,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is good but doesn't fit around your ears very well.
567,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for $20.
568,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Headphones work very well for my uses and I am very happy with them.
569,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product!
570,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It fits my 4 year old pretty well and the 2 year old too, although he's got a big head. They will still slide off if the kids were moving around but I expect them to be fine for our long plane ride since they will be seated. I previously bought soft headphones but apparently any headphone designed for kids has a volume control that is not conducive to plane travel. There's no way they would have been able to hear anything on a loud plane with kids headphones."
571,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter, who initially loved them. They were great, for a month. Last week they became staticy and today they stopped working altogether. Extremely disappointing product.

UPDATE: I am happy to say the seller reached out to me and is sending a pair of replacement headphones. I will write an updated review once the product arrives and we have a chance to use them. In the meantime, I am updating to 3 stars because good customer service means a lot in this day and age."
572,1.0 out of 5 stars,One of the ear cups broke off after second use. Could be that my 5 year old was using them or maybe these are junk??
573,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They were used and retuned by a school with writing on the side ""grade 3""......they were retuned"
574,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Really nice headphones with one key problem: The jack sometimes just stops working. I will contact the manufacturer about this, but be forwarned.

Edit: a few months have passed, and they died completely"
575,1.0 out of 5 stars,Have had these headphones a little over a month. Already broke. Everything is in tact... They seem built solid... There's just A short in the wire. If I hold the wire a certain way the sound comes through... I bought three pair of these headphones at once. Two of the 3 have this problem. Disappointed. Would love a refund or replacement. But I don't have my original box.
576,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Does the job. But I will be returning despite the return fee. The moment I opened the packaging, I already thought that it looks super cheap. After I saw that I have to shoulder shipping for return, I have thought about keeping it. But this literally hurts my ear after using it for an hour. This is the first headphone I had ever bought so I am not sure if it's supposed to be like that."
577,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these back in september and at first they worked great and i really loved them, but its October now and the right headphone only works if i fiddle with the cord for around an hour, and if the cord is jostled too much it starts messing with the volume and opening apps. The button doesn't work anymore to pause things, but the volume sliders does. I'm a little disappointed because i bought the case to protect them and everything and they didn't even last half the time those $5 headphones do."
578,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are a really cool color and feel comfy, however when playing with them I found out that other people can hear what your listening too. Not what I had in mind for headphones. Also if it's hot outside and your wearing your headphones, expect some trapped heat around your ears, aka sweaty ears. Other than that they are cool and work well. I especially like the long cord and the material surround it; wont crack and fall apart like my apple headphones."
579,1.0 out of 5 stars,Only had a month and they are already broken. Only can hear out of one ear. Cute but not well made.
580,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's the best headphones I ever got. Thanks :)

613,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones I got have a problem. When it's plugged into my iPhone my music starts turning off and on constantly. It also causes Siri to turn on and off when I'm trying to listen to music. It's very strange.

680,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but the connections are poor. After a couple of months of light use, the cord where it attaches to the headphone has gotten even looser, and I have to hold it at a specific, non repeatable angle to get full audio, meaning that they are now useless"

I did not tell her how much I paid for these Ailihen headphones. I asked her if they sounded as good as her Beats, she repied yes. Awesome purchase! Saved me $180 dollars! She can't tell the difference! Don't waste your money on Beats!"
685,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the size of these headphones; they're comfortable and compact but still give me good sound quality. I also like the unique color; they won't get confused with anyone else's headphones.

These are some good headphones, but having them on my ears for prolonged periods of time cause my ears to sweat, clogging them, and hurts them a little bit. More.. Unconfortable, than painful, actually. The ear cups are NOT made for larger ears. I have pretty normal sized ears, and they're smaller, and don't fit over them like I personally like in headphones (I like my ears inside my headphones. I don't like them on top of my ears, if you know what I mean.) They are actually three colors, The mint, a slightly darker mint where it folds, and the grey all around. Four if you count the silver part that extends to fit your head. Speaking of that, that part is kind of a fingerprint magnet, and I suggest wiping it off if its touched a lot, especially with sweaty hands. They cancel out some noise, and on top of that, are fairly loud. So yeah. Good overall. Have a good day people."

762,1.0 out of 5 stars,I usually have to order new headphones for my kids every few months just because they last a while then one side stops working. I ordered two pairs of these (one for each kid). One pair showed up already broken and was returned. The other pair broke after a few days use. Definitely much better headphone options out there.

789,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love them!!! They work great and have tough braided cord.
790,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my new headphones. I use them w/ a new morning & night meditation program. The program requires that the left ear hears thru the left speaker,etc. To get the full benefit of the meditation. The sound quality is excellent.
I highly recommend this product."
791,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked, but were extremely tight and painful, tried adjusting just did not conform to head shape. Sound quality was meh. You can get better headphones for the price. Added one star due to customer service reaching out to me, which is better than most products."
792,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been through 2 pairs of these. The hinge where the ear piece bends is a plastic, thin pin, and the housing section of that joint does not last, and it will break. Also, I have experienced separation of the ear padding from the speaker section. You get what you pay for.....or a little less in this case."
793,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my daughter. She uses it every day and says they are very comfortable. Still working after almost a month hopefully they will last until the end of the schoolyear.
794,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones fit over the ear and are quite comfortable. They work very well and are gorgeous! If I ever need another pair, I will definitely be ordering this item again."
795,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my headphones but the only thing is its too big i heve a little head and they are loud but not that loud but other then that they are perfect they are so cute and i love how you can fold them and the cord its long to you dont have to worry about your headphones tingle and they are comfortable
796,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 16-year-old loves them, and his little brother hasn't managed to break them yet (unlike the previous 4 pair from other brands). Win."
797,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfy and folds nicely. Unfortunately I only get the majority of sound from the R ear. At first I thought the L ear was a dud. But isolating it, sound comes out but VERY softly. So when listening to online lectures I feel like the professor is talking into my right ear."
798,5.0 out of 5 stars,I received the headphones promptly. I’m not a headphone connoisseur so I can only say that they do what I want them to do. I’m happy with my purchase. I’m trying to get my 11 year old to order some because she keeps stealing mine!
799,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These were great for my 11 year old until they broke in about 3 months. Not sure if it was the headphones or my kid, but I'd likely buy them again. The price is right. In fact, call me crazy (should I have given 5 stars? Find out after my next purchase of these same ear phones!) but I'm going to order another pair right now and see if we can get more than 3 months out of them."
800,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these to use while working out on my treadmill and They are Great!
801,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Christmas gift for my granddaughter.
She is enjoying. Fast shipping"
802,5.0 out of 5 stars,Granddaughter is enjoying these headphones.
803,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are junk. Cheap headphones that do not last long at all. When they did work, the sound quality is poor. I know they are $20 headphones but I cannot believe all the good reviews for these. They just don't sound good. I was expecting a lot more from the reviews. We had these for approximately 3 months before the volume slider became a weak point and decided to stop working hence making the headphones completely unusable. The audio became low and garbled. You get what you pay for and sometimes, reviews don't tell the real story."
804,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ended up having to print out a return slip for these TEN MINUTES after I opened up the package and tried them out. I literally didn't even get to enjoy them for a full day. Immediately when I plugged them into my phone, my laptop, my husband's laptop and phone, the sound on one side was gone, and the other side was awful. The sound control thing didn't work AT ALL. And the fit was uncomfortable. The earpieces felt like they were turned just a little bit so they weren't over my ears properly.

Pro-tip: If you come across headphones that go for under $25 and have a white nylon braided cord? They're made by the same lousy manufacturer and just sold under different names and they will either not work or stop working very quickly. Brands like AILIHEN, BienSound and others. Go for a brand you've heard of. Ugh."
805,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my daughter and she loved it
806,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thank you for fast shipping and a great product. My daughter loves her headphones.
Would definitely order again from you."

813,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fell apart two weeks after purchase. Used once per day for short duration each day. Poor quality.

831,4.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones were worth the price. Perfect for my 7 year old daughter.
832,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked for approximately two weeks and quit working! No return/exchange. Complete waste of money
833,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my 10 year olds class & she loves the color!
834,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not a lot of adjustment for fitting to one's head; earphones hurt after a short time listening. Not a bad buy though for the price.
835,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Good!!!
836,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two of these for my teenage girls. One broke after only a month. The other one broke about a month later. This is a piece of junk that I do not recommend at all. I bought my youngest, who is a lot more careless than the older two, a JLAB one for less than $10 JLab Audio INTRO Premium On-Ear Headphones with Universal Mic, Blue and that still works great."
837,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great inexpensive headset.
838,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got product on time. Quality of headphones are great.
839,3.0 out of 5 stars,I returned my headphones because the connection wouldn't fit through the otter box case. There was nothing wrong with the headphone

845,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound and masking outside noise
846,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great set for children! My 6 year old loves them.
847,3.0 out of 5 stars,Microphone doesn't work very well. I have to hold up to my mouth for my students to hear me clearly.
848,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this for my son, broke within 1 week. These headphones are cheaply made and are not good."
849,5.0 out of 5 stars,My niece absolutely lovestunning them.
850,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter absolutely loves these !!!
851,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My son has these just a month. Already the one side doesn't work and it gets static on the other. Poor quality, very disappointed."
852,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it. Good sound quality
853,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones my bestfriend and I both got them and couldn't be happier with them
854,2.0 out of 5 stars,Item came damaged.. NEVER worked.
855,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Take these other reviews with a grain of salt because most of them say that they got the product for a discount for their ""honest"" reviews.
I read a lot of them and these headphones seemed like a good choice. Cheap, good looking and claim to have crisp and clear sound.

However, once I got the product things started to get pretty ""meh"" in terms of quality. The packaging was obviously very cheap, but not a major concern.
The build quality seems very sub-par. They look good in the picture, but in reality they are very much plastic and I feel like I am going to break them every time I try to fold them. The ear cushions are somewhat comfortable, but feel awkward (as if they're backwards) on the ears.

Here's my least favorite part though: most of the reviews claim ""crisp and clear sound quality"". I completely disagree. These sound like cheap small earbuds that come standard with the purchase of a phone. I compared these to my pair of Urbanears (which are only about 30 bucks more to buy) and the difference in clarity is instantly noticeable. So if you are buying to replace standard phone earbuds, maybe invest a little more in a better pair of headphones.

I will give 3 stars because they're not horrible considering they're $20, so you pretty much get what you paid for. However, I'm disappointed that the majority of the reviews for the product did not accurately represent what I was getting, especially in terms of sound quality."
856,5.0 out of 5 stars,the sound is wonderful
857,1.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones broke after I had had them for only a few months. These are terrible. I would advise moving on to a different brand the next time you are looking for headphones.
858,5.0 out of 5 stars,More comfortable than other headphones in the past. Kids know how to break things in and so far both speakers still work.
859,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice fit my 8 year old great and volume did not blast loud

900,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great. I like the look and the way they fold. I have used them both with my android phone and with an old IPod shuffle. I subtracted one star because it does not adjust small enough for my head and the band keeps tipping forward and backward. However, my head is smaller than average and they will probably fit most other people."
901,2.0 out of 5 stars,Used three times and then wouldn't work!
902,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my 10 year old sister for Christmas and she absolutely loves them and so does my family. With these headphone not only do we not hear her games or YouTube videos she's watching, she doesn't have all the outside noise keeping her from being able to hear what ever she's listening too."
903,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, folds up to fit in my little side pocket on my backpack for school. My daughter who just turned 2 already knows how to pause and play Netflix videos with the volume control + pause/play button on it. Sound is nice. The headphones are so comfortable. The color is gorgeous and matches the picture perfectly.

I also got a coupon for another pair!"

951,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed at all with these. I used them for work and they often require me to unplug them and replug them in because the Mic looses connection. They're basically just sitting here looking cute now. The are decently comfortable but that means nothing if I can't rely on them for the microphone.

961,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, kid loves them."
962,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent earphones for $20. The quality of the materials is better than I would have expected.

Pros:
- Decent sound
- Folding
- Adjustable
- I like the slide volume switch.

Cons:
- Ear pieces are rigid. I mean they do not rotate to meet the ears so they feel tighter on the rear of my ears, and touch much more lightly on the front of my ears. The soft pads help a bit to compensate for the rigid ear pieces.
- The ear pads are not larger than my ears. The headphones set on top of my ears rather than surround my ears. This makes them less comfortable and they don't cut out ambient noise as well."
963,5.0 out of 5 stars,Snug to the head. Blocks out back ground noise.
964,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast delivery. Work great! Happy with purchase.

1008,5.0 out of 5 stars,very nice
1009,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves these headphones. They are made well and sound great.
1010,1.0 out of 5 stars,These worked great for one week. Then just stopped working all together. They were not dropped or mishandled. I contacted the seller regarding a replacement or return and never got a response. One week later I purchased another pair of headphones from the same seller but would not have done that if I had realized it was the same seller that had never responded to my message regarding a replacement.
1011,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work great. The sound is so clear. I have only use them this week but so far I'm very pleased. Great headphones at a great price. They were shipped quickly as promised
1012,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good purchase for me. Unless i tape the microphone button down the sound barely works. Disappointing the ears do not twist for a firmer fit.
1013,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Initially these headphones sounded pretty good. I was hoping that ordering a set with a braided cord would last longer. Unfortunately it was not to be. After just 2.5 months, there is a short in the cord and they no longer work well at all - very staticky and sounds terrible.

Pros: fit good, well constructed headset.
Cons: not good for on the go, or for kids use. Cord easily becomes tangled and develops,a short."
1014,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this product for my son. He has not removed them since he got them. They are comfy and perform very well, microphone and speakers work fine."
1015,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very comfortable and love the foldable function, however the negatives outweigh the positives by a landslide. The microphone sounds horrible, but that's not the worst of it. While being relatively inexpensive, they do not last long at all before they lose sound in one ear, or both. The longest any of them have lasted has been 4 weeks. We continued to buy them because of the comfort factor but will not purchase another pair."
1016,3.0 out of 5 stars,I got these to use with my roko instead of ear buds which I hate they are good as far as tv sound the cushion could be a little thicker and wider. But other than that for the price I'm happy with them. Will probably try another brand and give these to one of my grands.
1017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We purchased 2 of these as holiday gifts for teenagers in need. They arrived quickly! As it was the only item on their lists, I wanted to make sure to get nice ones. I read many online reviews before purchasing and these seem to be a solid pair. I won't be using them personally - so I can not attest to quality."
1018,4.0 out of 5 stars,My 6 year old thinks these headphones are so cool and I'm happy that I didn't have to spend a lot of money to make him happy. Sound is average.
1019,5.0 out of 5 stars,My six year old is using these at school and enjoying them very much. They are holding up well and performing better than the last pair she had.
1020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased with my headphones. I absolutely love them.
1021,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My headphones has a nice look to them they came in on time just the way the order said, and they sound great."

1107,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. Would definitely recommend these to anyone.
1108,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound for the price!
1109,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones at a great price. They look exactly like the do online.
1110,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Only 4 stars because I had to return them. Nowhere in the description, did it say these headphones were LARGE. I ordered them for my 8 year old son and they arrived and were too big, so I had to send them back. A hassle. I wish I had known they had a SIZE, I thought headphones were one size fits most. I only looked at them for about a minute while he tried them on, and they seemed like decent quality for the price. We never plugged them in to see the quality of the sound, but at a glance and a brief encounter, they are good, just be aware of the fact that they will not fit a youth size head."
1111,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Headphones for the price very great fit for me nice on ear fit and great clarity
1112,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast shipping, great headphones, love it,"
1113,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound quality the design is nice and it has a base.
1114,1.0 out of 5 stars,They broke after 2 days. Terrible product.
1115,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible. Headphone plug fell off randomly and jammed into our school's iPad. :(
1116,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these head phones
1117,5.0 out of 5 stars,☺🙃☺☺🙃☺🙃☺🙃🙃☺☺🙃
1118,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is just what I need! Thanks.
1119,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphone works well.
1120,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit: totally forgot to update this. After the trouble I had with my first pair the seller/company contacted me. Asked me a couple of questions and replaced the product. This second item has been functioning ever since without any problems.
They were great at first but after getting knocked off my head a couple times there's s loose wire and the right ear goes on an off. Didn't hit the ground just got the wires yanked I guess."
1121,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all this is a $20 headphone so don’t expect too much!! Sooo, for the $ it’s a fair deal, sound quality is ok not great but not horrible either.. build quality is fine it’s not solid, platicy feel but they built it good. Mic work excellent on phone calls, loud and clear at least the one I got. Earpads/foam is on the medium side so if you have a big👂 or head like mine this will sit on the ear. It’s soft though so it’s 👍.. Bought it for my niece so the will be perfect for her. Is it durable?? Idk yet, time will tell.."
1122,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Four starts because the headphones themselves are gorgeous - I've gotten several compliments on the color scheme and folding mechanism. -1 star because the sound quality of the music seems a little tinny or underwater sometimes - it seems to be dependent on the volume and type of music. Also, the volume adjusting mechanism on the headset cord is very strange; there aren't separate buttons for + and - like there are on most other headsets. You have to use the switcher to toggle from + or -, then the button will affect whichever volume selection you're toggled to. Photo for clarity.

For <$20, I think this is a solid pair of headphones. If you're looking for outstanding quality in music, look elsewhere, but these get the job done!"
1123,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I would buy again. The cable that connects to the headphones is fixed and not replaceable, It broke within a few weeks of use so I threw them away and wrote it off as a bad buy. When I saw there was a quality guarantee, i wrote to the seller and they were great about replacing them. Customer service like that goes a long way to building loyalty and trust, My kid now has a new pair and I told her to be very very careful with the cable!"
1124,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The product received was the same one described online. The pictures were spot on. They really are that shiny. I previously owned headphones that went in my ears and grew tired of them. So I picked these out and they go over my ears. They are super comfortable because of the padding they have (I fell asleep with them on). They have a pause and play button on the side. I really don't care for the volume control. It is a slider control. I just use the volume control on my phone to adjust the volume. The CORD is awesome. Its like a shoelace that doesn't tangle up on you. They are easy to adjust to your head. You just have to pull them down on the sides. They do fold up for storage. As for the sound, everything comes out clear. There is no static. Again, I switched from in ear headphones to over the ear headphones so these were overall a great upgrade."
1125,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for our son for Christmas. He loves them, and the sound is great. Update: Had a problem with these headphones after about 2 months. They stopped working. Contacted the company regarding the warranty on them. The warranty is for 1 year after purchase. The company Rep. was very rapid and courteous in responding. After describing the problem to the rep. They said they were sending another pair at no charge. No hassles, courteous rep. 1 yr. warranty. How can you beat that ? Very pleased with the product and company. Thanks for a great product aith a great warranty."
1126,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Really like these headphones, but the adapter where it plugs in is ready giving me static, and at times, the sound drops. Other than that, the sound is pretty good, and I love the longer cord. They are small enough to fit on ear and not be bulky when they're around your neck as well. The fact that they fold makes them easily stored. The earpads are fairly comfortable; keep in mind, they will get warm after longer sessions. However, they don't hurt my ears. I really like the colors and build, and I would consider giving them another shot when they completely go out."
1127,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I now walk a lot and wanted sturdy head set. This allows me to talk to people who call me (they hear me great they say) and listen to great music. Sturdy- they also fold nice. Good quality. They would make a good gift too.

I had to change my review after a few months-because I don't use these all the time-I use them when my husband takes my iPhone your plugs I Kathy says the second set-and the past like five times I've walked her job using music only one here works it goes in and out if I have to play with it. I don't have a problem with either your phone so I'm going to assume it's this. I don't have anyone I said that problem. If I had given these excessive use of wouldn't care because I know I got them at a good price-but I think they should've lasted longer than this. They do still work-but only one here and the other one popped in and out"
1128,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great pair of headphones. They look really gorgeous, fit well, are comfortable to wear, and sound great. I bought these for my daughter to use, so I really appreciate that the cable is braided which will help them to last longer and not get as tangled up. I also really like how they fold up so they don't take up as much space for storage or to bring along on a trip."
1129,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased 2 sets of them for my grade school daughters since they use netbooks in their classroom. They don't like earbuds because of their small ears. I looked online for an affordable pair of headphones and thought I would try them. They arrived in a couple of days and packaged very nicely. I was surprised how good they look in person. The sound quality is amazing. Very impressed. I always look at reviews and these headphones live up to their high ratings. I recently bought another pair.
1130,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones for my 6 year old son to use at school. He had previously used ear buds that were uncomfortable for him and didn’t stay in place. He loves these headphones. They are comfortable for him to wear. The cord has a fabric type covering that makes them more durable for kids. We liked them so much I bought another pair for my other son.
1131,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These worked for less than 3 months. I bought a total of 3 pairs one for each of my teens. None of them are functioning. Sound has quit playing altogether through the head phones. I liked the color, style and the kids said they were comfortable to wear. Sad these didn't last longer than 3 months."
1132,2.0 out of 5 stars,doesn't work all the time
1133,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is pretty good according to the teenager! However, cord by plug in to device is already frayed and shorted out so sound only comes out of one ear.....my teenager says its his fault...however exterior disc on outside of headphones on one side already came unglued, again teenager says it his fault and not product defect. I say its probably a 50/50 shot."
1134,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great as headphones but eventually the padding came off, making them impossible to wear.
I managed to tuck them over the plastic but they fall off in my backpack."
1135,1.0 out of 5 stars,"While these are cute and comfortable to wear, the music sounds terrible. Sounds hollow and echos with nearly no bass. I have only used a few times and they are holing up well, but they do feel a bit flimsy and cheap. I guess that can be expected with $20 headphones. I will be returning."
1136,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me tell you about the glory that is these headphones. So I am not an earbud person- therefore when my cat ate through my old headphones, I was distraught. I thought to myself nightly- what am I ever going to do? I can't hear music. I can't listen to audio books. I can't even watch really stupid YouTube Videos without my roommate hearing. My cat, evil dictator that he aspires to be, laughed maniacally at me. I searched everywhere for a decent pair of headphones that were cheep enough that I wouldn't be too upset if he ate through them again.

AND THEN I MET THE AILIHEN C8 LIGHWEIGHT FOLDABLE HEADPHONES AND MY LIFE WAS CHANGED!

They're cute. The sound is glorious. The feel on your ears makes you want to divorce your husband because he CANNOT please you like these headphones can. The jack works perfectly, smooth like the strings on a violin. It works on any type of phone except the iPhone 7. Did I mention they're cute- I can now actually be one of the popular kids at school, which is impressive since I'm a grad student. If I were going to jail I would forfit my one phone call if I could just keep these headphones with me. Also the braided cord is cat- proof so liiiike I'm in heaven."
1137,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good basic head phones. Not adjustable but the sound quality is alightly above other head phones I have used and much cuter, but nothing abive and beyond"
1138,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bough 4 pairs of those (for kids). For 2 of them, one side of the headset stopped working after a few days. For the third, it stopped altogether (fiddling with the connector would sometimes make it work, but no time for that!). The fourth is still ok. So not great in terms of quality."
1139,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a Christmas present for my son. I didn't expect great sound given the price, but I did expect them to work more than a week. IWithin a week, the sound only worked sporadically, going on and off without warning. This was a big disappointment!"

1236,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got them!
Fit nicely, like the volume control. Loving them so far!"
1237,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love ❤️ it it's really good
1238,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, seems sturdy, great price."
1239,1.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter has already broken them. The sound goes in and out on them. She only had them maybe two weeks.
1240,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing. Very short (I mean VERY SHORT) cord.
1241,3.0 out of 5 stars,The end broke off inside my granddaughters tablet. Had a difficult time getting it out. She's six so I am not sure if she was too rough when she inserted the headphones or if it was a defect. I know it wasn't because she dropped the tablet or something like that. It has a warranty but I figure they will say it was her fault. My thought is that it should have been more durable so I'm giving it a 3. They don't look like cheap headphones and I like how they fold up and they worked great until the end broke.
1242,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a beautiful pair of headphones. Primarily for my wife on her laptop, occasionally I have slipped them on as well. She loves them and I do too. They are comfortable, adjustable, and have a great sound. They appear and feel like they are well made.
We love them."
1243,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Our cat tends to chew through cords so I had to buy my daughter new ones recently. This color is her absolute favorite, so I knew she'd love them right away. The sound is really good and she says they're very comfortable to wear."
1244,4.0 out of 5 stars,They look awesome. They sound great. Only problem is they hurt my ears after a while where they sit over them. But I'm happy with them.
1245,1.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter talked me into these because she loved the color. They quit working 2 weeks after the return window. They were used regularly but not abused or thrown around. Huge wast of money. You can get a decent pair of Sonys for about the same price and they will last much longer.
1246,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones were purchased for a 7 year female to use with her Kindle. She plays Minecraft in concert with her brother and sister and keeps these headphones on for a long time and never complains.
1247,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are great! They were shipped and received quickly. Sounds quality is good and the color is fantastic. There is little to no leakage which is great being in a dorm right now. And also bonus plus if you want to muffle any sounds around you just put these on. They give me a bit more quiet when around other people.
1248,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my son and they were great for 3 weeks until the jack thing that plugs into your device snapped off. At first I blamed my son for being rough with them but I see this is a common complaint. I will not be buying again.
1249,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am delighted with these headphones, The sound is quite good for the price and the volume control, which is a slider and the only control that I use, works well."
1250,2.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap made
1251,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are cheap and the sound quality is what you paid for... about $10 of sound quality. My problem with them is they are so terribly uncomfortable. After wearing them for more than 20 minutes my ears hurt terribly. Most over the ear headphones have 360 degrees of movement from the headpiece to the earphone but these only have a little bit of give up and down.

I returned these - they are too uncomfortable to wear for more than a few minutes at a time and I wanted something I could wear most of the day at work."
1252,5.0 out of 5 stars,daughter likes them
1253,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality...got what we paid for though.
1254,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work amazing!!! The sound is great!! I would recommend

1274,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my 13-year old twins!
1275,3.0 out of 5 stars,good product
1276,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Work pretty well for calls. Decent quality for price. Would give more stars if it weren't for the unadjustable band... wish that was stated more explictly in the description or photos. I have a fairly large head and these are just on the edge of being acceptable.

45 Days Update (1/3/16): These headphones just stopped working for no good reason. No one could hear me properly and all the audio I was receiving was inconsistent and garbled. I have not done anything to ""abuse"" these headphones; I only use them for work, so they're either on my desk or in a section of my backpack"
1277,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product and the color brightens my mood ..
1278,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 11-year old daughter loves them!

1282,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality. My Grandson (5 years old) loves them.
1283,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great bang for the money!
1284,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are horrible. We ordered 2 pairs. The first one broke within 2 days after they fell from the table. The other ones power cord actually broke off inside our ipad after a month and we had to dig it out! I contacted customer service after the first one broke and they contacted me very quickly and said they would send out a replacement. I was very happy...yeah, they never sent it and it's been months. These headphones are pretty, but not durable at all!"
1285,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had less than a week and the jack broke off right in the Kindle.
1286,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They work fantastically well, very happy with my purchase!"
1287,2.0 out of 5 stars,Cute but broke in 2 mounths.
1288,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my son, great value for the price."
1289,5.0 out of 5 stars,great headphones!
1290,5.0 out of 5 stars,They have a great sound
1291,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For me I had headphones close to a week. I'll say this I live in New York the temperature here is really cold. I purchase for myself for the cold, music, and gaming too why not. First I went out with it and my ears were warm and toasty nice. Second the music the headphone comes with manual volume switch and a button to answer phone call or such. The audio was good the ear cups were cushion nice. It did not felt like my head was being squish like a water ballon like other headphones. Gaming I have a ps4 and a pc audio was good but speaking it was rough some part but I was hearablé on most part. The material feels kinda cheapie but all else it does its work pretty well. So 4/5 ☆ good pair of headphones for a good price."
1292,5.0 out of 5 stars,THE HEADPHONES ARE GREAT. MY BABYGIRL LOVES THEM

1304,5.0 out of 5 stars,Meets all my expectations
1305,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfy. I wear them all day at work. I like that you can adjust the volume right there, so if I can't/don't want to pause something but need to hear someone else, it's easy to change the volume.

I haven't had a reason to test the mic yet. Sound is wonderful though. Although not noise-cancelling, with music playing they almost are. No complaints about leaking sound from coworkers yet :)"
1306,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for my morning workouts
1307,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the cord as it's so durable! Shipped on time

1320,4.0 out of 5 stars,almost a month in and they still work beautifully
1321,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worked perfectly out of the box. Arrived very rapidly.
1322,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice color, worth as 20 dollar."
1323,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought two and they are both defective!
1324,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sound price,and color!"
1325,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good
1326,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are the best! Love them!
1327,1.0 out of 5 stars,They fell apart after two weeks. Cheaply made.
1328,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked for 3 months.
1329,4.0 out of 5 stars,The color is more green
1330,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality only lasted a month
1331,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift for her to work on audio projects. She was very disappointed by the Microphone Mic recorded voice with the loud high pitched background static noise (unbearable high pitch noise like scratching nail on the blackboard). I just noticed this last night after I bought it for her a month later as my daughter was so shy to tell me that a gift from Santa was this bad (my heart was really hurt after hearing this!). Very disappointed by this product!!! I am trying to see if I still can return this.
1332,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice headphones for a young person
1333,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke within a few weeks of buying
1334,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works perfectly
1335,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these so far.
1336,2.0 out of 5 stars,it's ok
1337,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones for a Good price
1338,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality.
1339,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent value and performance
1340,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best!
1341,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked for about 15-20 hours. Then quit on me
1342,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound.
1343,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones
1344,3.0 out of 5 stars,sound not what expected
1345,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not be fooled by the attractive color, these are terrible headphones. I got them today and immediately noticed that the sound quality was poor and the fit of on my ears was just terrible. I tried to adjust them but I don't think it's possible. I was kind of annoyed by this, but figured it was worth testing them out anyway. After wearing them for 30-45 minutes I found I could no longer bear the discomfort in my ears stemming from these really hideously designed headphones. I read a lot of the reviews on Amazon before choosing to buy, and noted that many had received these headphones free for their ""honest and unbiased"" review. I think perhaps getting something free tends to improve people's opinion of the thing. I would highly advise against getting these terrible headphones!"
1346,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great...good buy!
1347,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable to wear, sound is good quality, easy to adjust headphones size to head.

Volume control is a bit annoying in its placement - because of where it is on the cord, I kept adjusting the volume down by accident. It took me a while to figure out that was happening - I thought the headphones were broken, but it was just me brushing up against where I was sitting that was causing the volume to fluctuate. So be aware of that if you get these."
1348,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality, I like the longer cord. AND it fits all of my electronic devices, phone, laptop, tablet, notebook and all my home computers."
1349,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's working fine.
1350,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these as a gift for a nine year old. He loves them and says they sound great. They also fold which is very convenient.
1351,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter loves these headphones; she uses them with her Kindle Fire. My only complaint is that she can't hear me calling her when she's wearing them! I guess that's kind of the point, though."
1352,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the money, these are very good headphones--comfortable, good sound quality. The only thing I wished were different is if they were actually adjustable. They fold up very compactly, but it's ""one size fits all"" in terms of the fit. Good volume slider control, and you can answer the phone with a push of the button. Reduces exterior noise very well. If you're looking for decent headphones without spending a huge amount, these are a very good value/quality for the cost."
1353,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really great heaphones...until they don't work properly. We have only had these for about a month and the cord is all wonky, the sound going in and out whenever the cord is jostled in the slightest. Disappointing."
1354,2.0 out of 5 stars,These are cute but they don't cover the entire ears and they don't move any more either. I don't really like them and may send them back.
1355,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Item defective right out of the box. Mute button stuck on; only unmuted when pressed. Sadly, we threw out the box before we realized this, so no return. Live and learn, I guess."
1356,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great! The audio isn't quite as great as I had hoped, but they are still a great pair of headphones! I mean, you can't really expect too much from a pair of headphones that are this cheap! But I am pleased with the overall look and comfort of them. They are a little big for my head, but not to the point of discomfort or ridiculousness. Also, the headphones fit perfectly over my ears. I am very pleased with this product!"
1357,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality on these are great. I can have the volume turned up and set them down and I can clearly hear it as if I had an external speaker attached. I used them mostly for music, but have used them for my job to take calls while working remotely and have no complaints."
1358,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was a birthday gift that went over very well. My grandniece was thrilled. The headphones arrived on the other side of the country right on time as promised. Everyone was happy.
1359,4.0 out of 5 stars,I've ordered these headphones about 4 times. They're really great but after a few months they stop working. I keep ordering them though because they're great while they work.
1360,2.0 out of 5 stars,They broke after a month
1361,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Product exactly as described, fast shipping."
1362,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the quality and durability of this set they work so well.
1363,2.0 out of 5 stars,To big for my head
1364,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the third set of these headphones that we have tried. All three have become defective in a short time. The supplier has been very proactive in trying to help get us replacement items, but once again, in less than 2 months, this pair's (which according to the supplier is their upgraded model) jack has broken off and gotten stuck in the electronic device. These headphones have not been handled roughly and have been inserted and removed correctly/gently after each use. Very disappointed."
1365,5.0 out of 5 stars,My brother just loves it.
1366,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them so far. Have been exactly what I wanted.
1367,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Super comfortable and work well. Love that they fold up.

Cons: The jack stopped working less than a month after owning. We returned them and bought a different kind. The other pair we had bought of this model is still working well, so it may just be that you have to be gentle with them.

Update Sept. 2017- Other pair had its jack stop working as well. Would not recommend these headphones."
1368,2.0 out of 5 stars,not comfortable
1369,5.0 out of 5 stars,This works great !!!!!
1370,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Seem very nice, my 11yo says they are comfy. Sound quality is fine, not spectacular (again according to 11yo) and not bad. He uses them for Xbox. Proof will be in how long they last...he blows through headphones every few months. I'll come back and raise or lower the rating based on longevity."
1371,1.0 out of 5 stars,Headphone jack broke off in iPad.
1372,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good
1373,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do like these, very pleased and so well priced."
1374,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great at first but then slowly had problems - wiggling the wire worked to get them working again a few times and then they stopped working all together
1375,4.0 out of 5 stars,light weight. comfortable. good sound.
1376,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you!
1377,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Saw these cute speakers, and decided to get them as a Xmas present for my grandson..but of course I had to check them out first, cause I don't want him to be upset with them, if they wouldn't be loud and clear enough. But geez the clearty was great, so I know that he is going to be really happy to have them."
1378,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones worked great! I had made the mistake of buying a few from the dollar section at target and they always broke so I was going to spend the money on these knowing they would last. I even bought the storage case and religiously put them in there when they weren't being used. A bit ago one of the headphone cushions started to separate from the actual headphones. Then one day it just came off. I don't use them roughly and I've taken good care of them.
Now my son needs a pair of headphones for school coming up and I wish I could order him a pair of these since they worked well while they had two connected cushions but I just can't bring myself to do it! And I cannot even find a way to contact your company through amazon to ask you to make this better so that I'd feel great about ordering him his own pair of headphones and a case. I haven't even owned them that long. The $5 target ones lasted longer."
1379,5.0 out of 5 stars,met all expectations...very satisfified
1380,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not great, but some decent headphones"
1381,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these headphones on 7/23 and gave them to my daughter on her birthday on 7/26. She loved them. However, yesterday, 9/1, she told me that the cord was apparently wearing out because the sound was fading in and out in one ear. Very disappointing that they would give out so quickly."
1382,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Ailihen C8 headphones are an inexpensive product that works well. I was concerned about two issues: heat on my ears and isolation from the outside world. Using the Ailihens while on long walks on several hot days, the headphones proved not too hot for my ears. The degree of sound isolation was high enough to focus the sound quite well, but yet I could still hear automobiles and dialog clearly and well, which I believe is necessary for safety and also convenient when someone offers a greeting or asks a question. The headphones are also comfortable, with good adjustability."
1383,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable. Not completely sound excluding. I can still hear my husband's voice when he talks to me. Which is actually a good thing. And they fold up nicely and fit in my handbag. They look cute, too."
1384,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it for my daughter for her birthday in September 2017 and it already broke.
The wire got loose inside and the sound now on and off.
Where is the integrity, people?!?!
We are working hard for our money.
Very disappointing!!!!!"
1385,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Low quality and likely to break or stop working shortly. I bought two sets of these earphones for my kids. One, the head strap broke nearly immediately. The other, one earphone stopped working just after 30 days. The return policy on these is 30 days or something -- 50% of the time, yours will stop working shortly after that. I'd shop around if I were you."
1386,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These meet my needs exactly. They are comfortable, work well and are nice looking. Tried some bluetooth ones, but couldn't get them to work consistently. Even though this is a plug in, I can depend on getting the sound I want with no hassle."
1387,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For the most part these headphones work fine. I have only used them for about two weeks while viewing Netflix movies on my I-pad.
Why three stars? Well, I wear glasses and after 30 minutes or so of wearing the headphones, the top of my ears hurt. This annoys me greatly.
(Note: I hate earbuds. I've tried several different styles....no luck.) If anyone has a good remedy for taking the pressure off the arms of my glasses, while wearing earphones I'm all ears... (pun intended)"
1388,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it! We bought 2, one for each car (in color matching the car) so my son can always have them when on trips."
1389,2.0 out of 5 stars,I really liked them at first but they stopped working after about 2 or 3 months. I liked the color since it matches some of my gym outfits and the sound was good but then it stopped working.
1390,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought these headphones for our boys' new tablet devices in advance of a weeks-long road trip. Both sets were broken within a few weeks. I can concede that the bent jack on one pair was likely do to boy damage, but the second pair lost sound on one side within weeks for no reason. Disappointed."
1391,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound for a very competitively priced headphones! Actually bought these for my daughter, who LOVES them, but I've tested them out and I'd be happy if I had a pair to wear too!!! (although I'd pick a different color - lol)"
1392,5.0 out of 5 stars,They were a gift to my husband. He has been very happy.
1393,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality. Daughter uses frequently. Pretty, too!"
1394,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves these headphones. They do a nice job of amplifying the sound and the sound is clean and crisp.
1395,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have really enjoyed my headphones.Headphones,AILIHEN C8 Lightweight Foldable Headphone with Microphone Mic and Volume Control for iPhone,iPad,iPod,Android Smartphones,PC,Laptop,Mac,Tablet,Headphone Headset for Music Gaming(Black/Blue)

Would have rated 5 except the fast forward/rewind button stopped working within the second week after I bought them."
1396,5.0 out of 5 stars,good sound and I love the volume control
1397,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for grandson and he loves it!
1398,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 7 year old daughter chose these as headphones to bring to school to use with the iPads and computers in her classroom. She loves them and they work very well. No issues yet and we've used them for about a month.
1399,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awe full. I bought two pair for my kids. Neither lasted more than 2 months before having problems. One of the sides (I think it is the right side, opposite the cord ingress) goes out on them. I was going to return them, but they failed after the return window. I found this due to two reasons. Very poor wiring (tape used instead of a proper solder) for the connections, and the wires at the ingress point are susceptible to breakage due to bad design. Any tug or pull on the cord will easily disconnect/break the wiring. I would not recommend them to any one."
1400,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased for my 11 yr old grandson and he loves them. BIG smile!
1401,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase!
1402,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased as a Christmas gift. My grand son is going to love it !
1403,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my 7 year old, to use in first grade. They seem to work great, and the bright green color stands out, so it is easy for him to find his earphones, mixed in with the 20 other pairs of black ones!"
1404,1.0 out of 5 stars,"11/4/17 update: these crapped out after about 6 months and one side stopped working. OLD: I got these to use with my XBox One S and they work great, mic works and they are comfortable for a long gaming session or watching a movie quietly."
1405,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the headphones. The sound is great.
1406,5.0 out of 5 stars,satisfied
1407,5.0 out of 5 stars,love it
1408,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price these are great headphones, I bought them for a trip overseas...good sound, comfortable.
I've used them for a conference call & my team said I sounded more crisp than on my regular phone at work-these might be the replacement for my headset.
If they adjusted more, to be smaller, they would get more stars."
1409,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've purchased many items on Amazon, but this is the first time I've ever felt the urge to post a review. I bought these headphones for my daughter this past Christmas. She has used them periodically the past four months and they are already broken. Everything appears fine (no kinks in cables, etc) however they no longer function.

I checked the return policy and the return window closed January 31st, barely a month after purchase. That's not good business practice. My first and last purchase of an AILIHEN product!"
1410,5.0 out of 5 stars,It turned better than I expected. Perfect for my kid.
1411,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my daughter an she loves them..
1412,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones has a nice and clean sound. I like the way that I am able to fold them and store them in my bag. My husband used them, so now I have to purchase a pair for him. Colors are great."
1413,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my 9yr old to use with his ipad for school and personal use. They only lasted 6wks and now he longer hears any sound when he uses them. It's hard to find a quality headphones for kids without spending a fortune on a pair.
1414,4.0 out of 5 stars,"What's to say the sound is great it offers noise reduction ( for you ) and it has a reasonably long and sturdy cored. I just wished the donuts were more softer and confabulate, my ears tend to hurt after 3 hours of wearing them...than again I have been wearing them for 3 hours so that might just be it XD that one star is because I wanted mine to be purple."
1415,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The reviews seemed promising, so I purchased this pair of headphones hoping for the best. I have now learned that you get what you pay for - the sound was muffled and the earpieces didn't even fit properly over my ears when I took them out of the box to try them the day they came. Incredibly disappointed. Will be returning."
1416,5.0 out of 5 stars,After reading all the reviews from everyone helped me make the decision to buy them. I'm glad that I did. Worth the money.
1417,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My elementary schooler went through two of these already in less than a year! The wire is intact, the pads are good but there is no volume."
1418,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good sound and i love the the folding and light weight
1419,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them!! Perfect for my gaming and for my traveling needs!!
1420,5.0 out of 5 stars,"super lightweight, i got them for running cause earbuds always fall out of my ears. These are comfortable to run/walk in and the music sounds great"
1421,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After 1 months worth of daily use, one side doesn't work and the side that does work has static."
1422,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good
1423,1.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter used the headphones today for the first time and the pad for one of the earpices fell off! After wasting 20 minutes trying to put it back together it's still not on and now have to figure out how to send them back! seriously disappointed!
1424,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphone were perfect then the tip of the cord broke in the mp3 device after 2 days use. We decided that it might have just been a unusual problem because the rest of the headphone was of great quality and the sound very clear.
So, we filed up for a replacement but apparently could only get reimbursed which is already great because they didn't have any complains about our request. We are now waiting for our refund, and seriously consider buying the same exact headphones if they are still available."
1425,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After 6weeks of use the wire connection became loose, causing my audio to skips/fades constantly. I only use these at work occasionally, and this short of a lifespan for something I barely use is ridiculous. I would not recommend these at all."
1426,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is simply awful. Not much more to say. I bought them, and I stopped using them."
1427,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cannot wait to give them to him for Christmas.....he will love them
1428,5.0 out of 5 stars,Daughter loves them
1429,5.0 out of 5 stars,After one month very pleased. Pretty color. Durable. Long cord.
1430,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first recieved the product I was happy. Good sound quality, loud enough to block out the sounds of a college library, and I could still talk on the phone with them in. But after three weeks or so of being in my backpack, cord wrapped nicely up and tight- one side stopped working. So I had to throw them away because Ailihen would not send me a replacement."
1431,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good lightweight headphones for the money. The design, comfort and sound quality are good for the money. While these are certainly not the best sounding headphones I have, they could very well be the best ones I have in the same price range. It doesn't come with any carry bag though.

Recommended if you want something stylish and inexpensive with good but not great sound quality. For noticeably better sound quality you'll probably need to pay at least double the price.

I couldn't decide between 4 or 5 stars so I'm going to say 4.5 stars for the money and round up to 5.

NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write."
1432,5.0 out of 5 stars,Weight is right for a 8 years old.
1433,4.0 out of 5 stars,good stuff...sound quality is ok....looks good but does not have a mic!!!!!
1434,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this for VR headset, good sound isolation, fits pretty comfortably around headset straps. In line mic lets me take calls."
1435,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great for children. They are a little small for my head but they work great for my 3 kids (Ages 5, 7, and 9) A plus was the cord is one of those fiber kind and not the rubber which keeps them from being chewed on, if you have a child who likes to chew on all things rubber. Overall the kids love them and it makes long car rides very quite, which makes me love them."
1436,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product. I am really happy with them.
1437,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love my headphones, especially to watch movies on my iPad and my PC, they are very comfortable to wear!"
1438,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Goed price, seems to do what is says on the box. Son is happy.
Update , didn't last very long. Now only in mono"
1439,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones broke 2 days after the 30 day return window expired. My guess is they were broken in advance of this, however my 8 year old was scared to tell me the new headphones were not working. The cord needs to be jiggled to get any sound. And then it only comes out of one side. Save your money and buy something else."
1440,1.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are crap. I've only had them for a month and a half and now they don't work. I kept them in a special case so I didn't cause any damage they just stopped working. Don't buy if your looking for longevity
1441,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They work okay, I guess. Look decent too. And they also give you a massive, aching pain in your ears as the press into your head. After finally taking them off, I've got an ache in my ears, a sense of relief, and disappointment in having bought these."
1442,5.0 out of 5 stars,"light weight, quality sound, and sleek look."
1443,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. Fun color and excellent sound quality!
1444,1.0 out of 5 stars,THE MIC DOESNT WORK-rip off
1445,5.0 out of 5 stars,My little son is really enjoying it.

1450,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grandson loved them!
1451,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In perfect condition, works great, and got in right on time"
1452,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are terrible, I received them to use in my classroom as a donor choose project and have had them for 2 months and only four are still working out of the 10 I purchased. I am very disappointed with these headphones and wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
1453,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product just need to make them sound proof
1454,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These looked like they were going to be the perfect earphones, but they stopped working after just 4 months of very light use (my son used them at school for less than 30 ms a day).

We would return them but the window of time to return them has expired."
1455,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great buy , work great"
1456,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for price.
1457,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them
1458,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality. This is my second pair.
1459,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones stopped working after only a couple months of use. The headphone jack doesn't function properly. It was a lovely product while it worked, but sadly I can't give a good review."
1460,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great quality! I bought these for my son on road trips, so he could watch movies on his tablet. Before he complain that he couldn't listen to his movie with other noise going on in the car. But these are perfect. He can put them on and turn them up with no noise interruptions."
1461,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great basic headphones. I use them to watch my ""shows"" while my daughter is sleeping. They hurt a tiny bit, but my ears are super sensitive, so it could be me. Overall, great value for the product and good headphones for those who don't like buds."
1462,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I expected these to be a nicer pair for my 11yr old, but within three months they already don't work. If we wriggle the wire carefully, we can get one side to work, but that's it. My daughter is very careful with tech but these just didn't last any longer than the junkiest pair, so might as well buy 5 pairs of lesser head phones instead."
1463,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. I have had a very hard time finding good headphones lately, especially in ear headphones. These have great sound quality and having a sliding volume button on the headphones is a great feature to have. I will definitely buy these again if I need to that is!! Love these headphones!!!"
1464,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They work well, they sound decent, good for a simple basic set of headphones. Works with my android phone and my ipad."
1465,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased these for my 8 year old to use with his tablets. They fit well and have quite a bit of adjustment available.
1466,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these for music and gaming! I feel like the volume control on the cord works but not very loud...I usually just use the volume control on my phone (music) or computer(gaming).
1467,2.0 out of 5 stars,At first I enjoyed the headphones and had no problem with it but currently after 3 months I can't hear anything from either side of the headphones. One month prior I wasn't able to hear from the right side and I was fine but now I can't hear anything from it when I plugged it into my phone or labtop. Disappointed to say the least. I took great care of the headphones making sure the cord coiled correctly after use. I wouldn't recommend buying it.
1468,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is our 2nd pair of these headphones - they work awesome for our 9-year old. She uses them constantly so she wore out one pair and we ordered the exact same ones.
1469,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I break a pair of headphones a month because I'm super clumsy. I've used tons of different kinds. I've had a pair of Bose. These are my favorite. The sound is excellent. They get loud, are comfy, and cancel outside sound very well. Bonus: I plugged them into my PS4 controller for quiet gaming at night, and to my surprise, the mic works as a gaming headset."
1470,1.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased mid August 2017. Already broke. Microphone no longer works. So if you are looking for a headset that lasts about 3 months for $20 this is your set!
1471,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice headphones.
1472,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the size and color
1473,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Packaging was fine. When I took out of the box the first time and tried to use, one of the headphones was out like so many of the cheap earbuds you can buy anywhere. Don't waste your money..."
1474,1.0 out of 5 stars,This Product Headphones did not last 30 days.We were traveling.coming home I realize the Headphone work only on one side and only when it wants.I am not a comp wiz and do not know what to do.Please your advice. thank's Marcel
1475,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my daughter in January and by March she said that she can't hear anything anymore. I am very upset that it didn't even last over 3 months! I wish this headphones were better quality!
1476,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality and volume were as expected - I'm pleased with my purchase!
1477,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted 5 weeks...just long enough to not be able to return them. You get what you pay for here
1478,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, solid pair of headphones. Good for kids."
1479,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the product and the customer service was excellent. But the sound kinda fell through. I don’t know what happened the volume is really low now. But, overall it was a good Product."
1480,1.0 out of 5 stars,Loved the headphones! My 7 year old uses them ecerywhere. 2 months later they broke. What annoys me is there is no one to contact to get s replacement. Stand behind your product!
1481,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These work really well, they cancel out some of the outside noise which I did not really expect. They fit comfortably too. Initially I thought they were not adjustable but, in fact, they are!"
1482,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great for a little while and now not at all. We bought them for our daughter and she loves them but can't use them now. We have the year warranty with them.
1483,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sound for the price take them everywhere
1484,1.0 out of 5 stars,These worked great for listening to my music working out...for around a month..now only one side works and can not be fixed. I would not recommend.
1485,4.0 out of 5 stars,My son loved the color of his headphones! He needed them for school and told me no one else has the same color!
1486,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fold away neatly. Sounds quality is good. Blocks out outside noises. Soft pads make them comfortable on your ears.
1487,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these headphones for my kids. They are just as described and good quality. I will definitely buy them again. Fast shipping as well.
1488,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome! Packaged nicely!
1489,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good sound. A bit bulky but not too heavy on the ears. Overall, I'm pleased and would recommend."
1490,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it!!!
1491,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love to color, very comfortable, love that they fold. Only negative, which isn't a huge negative, is that they are not adjustable."
1492,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought them for a 15 year old. He says they are great. Good sound and likes the fact he can plug it in his phone and talk.
1493,1.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: 1 month later, 1 ear no longer works. The jack piece BENT! My son has been no more or less careful than he has with other headphone sets, and those have lasted years!

Took rating down from 5 stars.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
The Good sound, comfortable fit, cute colours, but pretty thin wire. I'm worrying about these holding up to daily use. Maybe they'll be great but I'm hesitant about giving 5 stars because--unless there is some space age technology in there--I know these won't last and I can't figure out why they'd go so thin!"
1494,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really am very satisfied with this head phone.
Because i am older, they are very comfortable to use"
1495,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them! They are so comfortable!
1496,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked for 2 months and then started cutting out in each ear piece.
1497,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price

So helpful.

Avoid these."
1510,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I listen to a lot of audiobooks and unfortunately, the in-ear buds start to hurt after awhile. I also wanted something I could use in bed and even though I still can't lay on my side with these they work really well. I can push one off of my ear and use the other.

I love how they fold up making them travel really easily. I fold them up and shove them in my purse. I'm really pleased with these. They're comfortable and although they don't go too small, they fit fairly well."

1514,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of really nice headphones in college, but sadly, they did not last very long. I was in desperate need of new headphones and decided to try this AILHEN set out. They were really nicely packaged and easy to open. This product does come with a warranty, which is reassuring, just in case something happens to it. The headphones fold in, making them ready to throw in a purse or backpack. The plugin part comes with a plastic protective piece which is a nice little bonus and very easy to remove. The headphones are very comfortable to wear and easy to adjust. You can just move the ears up and down to your size. I do like that they are padded and are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I just wish that they were larger. Most headphones and earbuds have a volume up and down button, this has a slide for volume. It is silent and very easy to use. There is also a play/pause button too that works for music and phone calls too. This is great pair of universal headphones!

I hope that this review has been helpful to you!"
1515,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: though they broke after 4 months, after posting my review the ailihen customer service team contacted me within a day. They were very apologetic and quickly sent a new pair which are working well.
They come with a good warranty which I didn't realize.
These were great while they lasted. Took into consideration other reviews so we'lre gentle with them. Then not quite for months later the left headphone stopped working. Problem is at the volume switch on cord. It only works when twisted a certain way, which is useless. Very disappointed as these are good looking and my son had loved them."
1516,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I would have really loved these except that they stopped working only a few months after I bought them. The cord bent or pinched or something and so the sound is intermittent and I have to hold the cord a certain way and keep moving it around to hear anything. Needless to say, that is not optimal. So while I liked the looks and the level of comfort on my head and ears, I won't buy this product again because it breaks easily."
1517,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent headphones, but not without issues. The bass is good, but not as good as I wish it would be. The sound overall is good, but not as good as I wish it would be. These are over-the-ear headphones, but they get pinchy after a couple of hours. The padding is comfortable, but the headphone structure itself is not really adjustable, and it sits just slightly askew on your ears, putting pressure points in the wrong spots. The cord is super long and fabric covered, so it seems pretty sturdy. I've only been using these for two weeks though, so I'm not sure how they'll hold up months from now.

Overall, I like these headphones, and they're better than ear buds. These are not top-of-the-line, so don't expect them to be. But for the price, they're a good purchase."
1518,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a pretty basic set of headphones that do not sound all that great. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear and the cable is long enough for most uses. It also includes a microphone so you can answer a call if using the headphones with your phone.

►► SOUND QUALITY ◄◄

The sound here is fairly lacking across the board from fairly weak bass to a mid-range and high-end that never quite feel like they're crisp and clear. Listening to various things with these headphones I got the feeling everything was just a bit muffled as the headphones tried to keep up with the music. The sound here might be better than the earbuds that come with most phones but it is not far and beyond better.

►► COMFORT ◄◄

I am a big guy, at 6'6"" I have a larger than average head. I did have to extend these as far as they would go but once I did they fit comfortably. The earpads are nice and soft and are comfortable to wear.

►► CONCLUSION ◄◄

The overall sound quality is just not there with this set of headphones. If you really want an over the ear headphone I'd suggest spending a few more dollars and getting something better. If you're ok with earbuds I've tested out plenty of in-ear headphones in the $20 range that blew these away.

1519,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for my 12yr old son to use for playing music/games on his laptop, tablet, and phone. He wore them one time and stopped using them. I asked him why, because they actually looked nice with a modern tech appearance. My son explained how the headphones didn't fit good on his head and began hurting shortly after putting them on. I decided to try them on myself... and found that the headphones are really stiff on the head. When I say stiff... I mean stiff! There is no horizontal movement built into the earcups whatsoever that would compensate for a more comfortable fit. No matter how I positioned the headphones on my head, there was always a small crack between the earcups and my head... therefore never providing a complete seal around the ear. I gave 2 stars for the appearance and the fact that they did play music, but these headphones need to go back to engineering for re-design."
1520,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones do not have good sound quality. They were tinny and the sound was dim. The noise cancelling feature was nice since they fit on the ear, but that didn't make the sound quality any better. I returned these headphones and bought a different pair from a reputable brand."
1521,3.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: THEY DIED!! :-( 2/6/2018 About a year and a half of usage and they finally started to fade in an out, the left channel in and out. The mic ended up working really well and no one could tell I was on headphones during a call (iphone) so that was impressive. After about 3 months they broke in a bit better and the mids sounded better. They served their purpose and remained comfortable for their nearly year and a half of usage. They lasted longer than I thought and ended up being pretty comfortable after the break in period 3.5 stars

I bought this for around 10, as running/exercise headphones. Worth it for the gym but if you want to vibe on your lossless audio skip it, don't do it. .

I directly compared these to the sound quality of Monoprice Dj Over the Ears which are the golden standard of bargain headphones.

Extra details:
Headstrap from top of ear cup to top of ear cup is 12"" expandable to 14.5""

Pros:
Good bass when EQ'd, (not heavy, just good)
Soft Comfy Ear Pads
The volume control sticks out a bit which makes it easy to get the correct output level
Cord is sturdy
Nice Color (mint/grey)

Cons
Mids/Highs are muddy, I highs sound like mids.
Top band is thin rubber on hard plastic and uncomfortable
Plastic everywhere!!!
Folding is stiff and feels like I could break them if not careful.

Overall: Bargain beat em up headphones with a bargain sound. After boosting the Bass in EQ settings they sound much fuller and less flat. Sound is muddled with no distinction of lows/mids. It feels cheaply made, which I expected, but I can't find too many weak spots on the construction. They look decent. The ear pads are surprisingly soft and well padded, but the top of the head strap is a bit hard. The clamp of the headphones is adequate for most movements and only slides around a small amount. Monoprice headphones are still leagues better. These are my goto now when I listen to audiobooks or podcasts while working out.

I will post again when these inevitably die. Cheers!"
1522,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These would be a five star headphone set if they cancelled out all background noises when having them on, like if I'm watching a tv show on my iPad I can still hear my kids bickering in the background, which I'd prefer not to hear if possible. Other than that they fit comfortably, I really like the way they adjust automatically to your head size so there isn't any playing around with sizing it properly, and all the features are easily accessible and in convienent places. The orange color is a nice solid vibrant color, the cushion on the ear pieces is comfortable for about an hour or so and then I need to take them off for a little bit and give my ears some free space before putting them back on, it does start to irritate my ears after about an hour or so, but most headphones do that so it's definitely not a deal breaker for me. The price has got to be one of the best features about these headphones, as they do multifunction with a mic built in, the fold up, can adjust the volume and skip back and fourth thru music and shows easily with the touch of a button on the headset and not have to access the device, and to do all that, and comfortably with decent sound quality at this price is a steal in my opinon. I'm no expert on sound quality, but it's definitely not bad, especially at this price.
Pros:
Fold up easily, little to no effort
Auto adjust to your head
Cushion comfortable for about an hour at a time
Sound quality about a 7 on a scale of 1-10
Mic option built in
Volume control button as well as fwd/rew
Corded so no running out of battery, and the cord is reinforced at the meet of the cord and headset making it ideal for wear and tear
Durable, have been dropped many times, even stepped on a few times and still together working just as great as day one.
Price is just a deal in my opinon and def worth noting in the pros for this headset with all these great features.

Cons:
Starts to irritate my ears after about an hour or so of wear, but that happens to me on most headsets.
Doesn't have any sort of travel pouch or case to keep them in, which would be nice for when not in use.
The sound quality obviously could be better, but to expect better than what it is, I would expect a significant price increase as well and therefore not really a con to me, but for some it may be with it not cancelling out background noises as well as I had hoped they did.

Overall I would have to say, honestly I'm impressed with these headphones and very happy with them. I would recommend them to my friends, especially for kids/teens since they do appear to be decently durable thus far. I have 4 boys and they have definitely been tested here and there and they still are intact, with nothing broken or damaged and working great still, which is key for me when buying headphones. I did recieve these at a discounted price, in exachage for my honest opinion of them. I'm very happy with this purchase, and was not compensated in anyway to purchase and test this headset out in anyway."
1523,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bottom line up front: The color of these headphones are very cute and will grab the attention of others. I would rate the sound quality as medium and the comfort of these headphones are okay as long as you do not wear them for extended periods of time.

It did not currently own a pair of over-the-ear headphones and wanted to try out a pair. Because of this and the fact that I loved the color, this was perfect product to try out and was very eye-catching at the same time. The following are my thoughts regarding this product.

**Pros
1. Color - The best thing about these headphones is really the bright teal color. The color is very vibrant and will certainly grab your attention.
2. Design - The design of these headphones is quite neat since it does fold into itself. So although this headphones is much more bulky in comparison to earphones it does compress in size based on its folding capability. I also like the packaging that it comes in and would make a perfect gift.
3. Sound - I was not sure whether to make this a pro or con but in the end I do think that the quality matches the list price of this item. You are able to hear the sound fairly clearly however if you listen to music at higher volumes your sound may become slightly distorted. For every day listening however this product will provide you what you're looking for.

**Cons
1. Comfort - This call may be more due to personal preference but I found that overtime the headphones become uncomfortable to wear. It may be due to the shape of my ear trying to conform to the headphones but I find that after more then half an hour, my ears start to hurt. You may not have this issue but depending on the shape of your ear, this became an issue with this particular headphones.

1524,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The bottom line first: I would not buy these again.

Broke in three months, after very light use. Bought them in January, tried to return them in March, but they are no longer returnable.

Used them for a few business calls on skype and to listen to music on the phone. The microphone still works (people can hear me on skype) but there is no sound coming out of the speakers. I've bought lots of headphones, expensive and inexpensive, and these have been by far the least-lasting.

In terms of the design - my hair gets caught in the adjusting mechanism and I've lost a few strands that way. Other designs adjust higher up which don't pull my hair.

Review updated on June 3 2017 - Alihen sent me a new pair. Change from 1 star to 4 for excellent customer service. I still think there are better designs out there."
1525,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So packaging first.. The AILIHEN C8 Headphones came in a nice looking retail display package, which surprised me. Based on the price, I was assuming that they would arrive in a plain cardboard box or inside of a plastic bag.

I excitedly opened up the box and checked the headphones out. The headphones seemed to be made to a decent quality. They fit on my head well and adjust easily. The earphones indeed have a decent amount of cushioning on them. The cord measures approximately 5 foot in length, which was long enough to put my iPhone inside of my pant pocket. I then plugged the headphones into my iPhone; the sound quality was rather good. I really did not expect the headphones to sound satisfactory at all, but they actually sound as good as my last way pair that was way more expensive. The cord has almost like a shoelace texture to it, and feels less likely to tangle up than a standard rubber cord. They have a microphone that I haven’t tested yet so can’t comment on that. They also have a volume control, which I have used and can say that it worked on my iPhone 5s. The headphones stayed put on my head comfortably as I roamed the house doing my chores.

My Final Verdict : I was simply looking for an inexpensive pair of headphones to wear while watching tv or to listen to music on my iPhone. I’m so glad that I found these AILIHEN C8 Headphones, which look pretty similar to beats headphones at just a fraction of the price. Now I really wasn’t expecting much from these headphones, but they actually impressed me considering the price. Awesome deal considering the price!

1527,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality was awesome . I got this headset set for one of my little nephews . Theres 3 of them ( all brothers ) and they love playing video games . But when you play online you need a microphone in order to be able to communicate with other players to be able to accomplish the missions and tasks ,etc. Well they only had the regular little headphones that go in your ear before and couldn't communicate with anyone so they kept getting frustrated. Thats where i came in . I came across this headset on amazon and knew i just had to get some for them. I ordered a few different kinds but must admit that the lime green ones were the coolest ones i ordered. It was simple enough for them to be able to figure out how to use the mic . And they fold compactly so they don't take up much space. The cord was well made and made with a braided fabric material over the cord so its very durable and it was very long a lot longer than i had expected it to be . They are very good quality considering that you get them for an awesome price. Well worth the price in my opinion. Theres a lot of cushion around the ears and they cancel out excess noise well. Theres also a small about 1/2 in strip of soft material as cushion for the head to make them more comfortable for wearing them for hours at a time .They look much better in person and shine alot . My camera couldn't seem to capture that aspect of them. Sorry about that. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. It did not in anyway change my opinion on the product. This is simply my own personal experience while testing out the product.

1528,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfort: 5/5
These headphones are comfy to wear, block out a lot of outside sounds, and don't overheat your ears. I wore them for hours on end, listening to jazz while reading on the beach.

Controls: 3/5
This headset has a mechanical slider for volume control. To my surprise, it never got accidentally nudged all week. It's stiff enough not to shift just from moving around. I can't say what happens if you take these jogging, but when I mow the lawn next weekend, I'll see if that causes the slider to shift. It doesn't adjust the volume on my phone - just the headset. That has its pros and cons, but mostly cons.

Sound Quality: 2.5/5
The sound is a bit tinny, and there's not a lot of bass. It's noticeably low-end. By contrast, I used it for audiobooks, and the mid-range clarity was very good. Also, the cushions isolate the sound very well, so you get less outside interference. That's a pro. If your top priority is sound quality, go with something pricier / higher end.

Appearance: 5/5
These look pretty slick. I'm not a fashion guru, but I like the look.

Convenience/Folding: 5/5
I have 3 sets of folding headphones, and these are the best. They don't fold super small (not like jeans pocket small) but you could stow them in a large purse, or in my case, a beach bag, easily. They are quick and easy to fold, unlike the Skullcandy ones I have.

Durability: 5/5
These stood up to high winds, sand, and wet hair pretty well. They were kicked around by a toddler, baby, and preschooler. They were shoved in an over-packed car twice and made it out alive. They took a beating and were unfazed. They FEEL pretty tough, too.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I spent a week testing them at the beach in the outer banks, just to report back on them."
1529,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the black/orange version of these headphones as a surprise gift for my young adult daughter. I knew she was in need of new ear buds or headphones and because this set also features a microphone and can answer phone calls I knew she would really appreciate it. I was right! She absolutely loves these headphones! The sound quality and clarity when making or taking phone calls is actually pretty impressive.

These have a really sleek, modern design. The cable is braided and seems to be of high quality. I actually purchased a similar set of headphones around this same price point for my son at the same time as I purchased these, the only difference being that his doesn't feature the microphone and volume control. After trying them both, this pair of headphones definitely edges out the other we purchased in comfort and overall sound quality. These also do a better job of blocking outside noise. I appreciate that they fold up nicely, which is great for transporting, packing, and on-the-go.

Overall, this is a pretty great little set of headphones. Audio quality is impressive and they are super comfortable. My son always needs to ""give his ears a break"" after wearing his similar headphones for a couple of hours, but my daughter doesn't with these as the fit and padding is better.

I received the neon green ones .What I like a lot about these headphones is one wire controls both speakers and the wire is braided so it’s less likely to tangle up .The speakers are adjustable to about 1 ½ inches and have a thick padding to cover your ears The headphones have a rotating and folding design which makes storing or carrying around a little easier.These headphones deliver a clear hifi sound with a strong bass and block out noise that's around you, I personally listen to hard rock and rap music and the bass delivers to my standards and for my obligation to test and write a honest review I listened to some classical and easy listening music and you can hear every instrument clear and precise .Finally I plugged into my computer tower to play some games and the headphones did not disappoint me, the AILIHEN C8 stereo headphones sound very good with the volume on low or turned up. I was very impressed and plan to purchase a pair for my daughter. My final though is, these headphones are average size but comfortable and they are collapsiblie with a single nylon wire which I like, and for around $20.00 you are getting a good deal ."
1531,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These AILIHEN C8 headphones can play your music LOUD! I found myself quickly turning the sound on my computer down from where I normally have it when using my ear buds.

The padding is very nice, and the fit on my head is snug. I personally would like it to be looser, I want to feel like there is nothing on my head, but I may be asking for too much there. The snug fit allows this set to work for children as young as a tween, up to men with moderate sized heads. They do stretch quiet wide if needed, but the length might of how far the ear pieces come down may not work for a very large head. On my head, which I hope is moderate, it fits fine and snugly and still has a small amount of slide left in how much lower the ear piece could go down.

Really everything about these headphones, aside from wanting them looser, is just awesome. I hope it helps you decide if these are what you are looking for.

1533,2.0 out of 5 stars,"***EDITED*** One side stopped producing sound not long after I posted my original review.....

I will update this review should I experience any problems. I am pleased with these overall so far. That being said, I am only using them to listen to shows I watch on my Kindle Fire. So as far as actual sound quality goes, I can't really attest to that. The one con that I did notice immediately that could be a huge issue for some people is that these headphones are not at all adjustable. Originally, I thought my 7 y/o might be able to use them with the school's iPad, but they'd be too big to stay on her head. I do notice less sound coming from the right side, but I've noticed that with other headphones as well, and am unsure if they're supposed to be that way or if I have a hearing problem. I really like how these headphones fold up when not in use; however, they are still bulky. I don't expect them to last for very long as it is obvious they are of a cheaper quality. I do feel that the listed price for these headphones is too high. I don't think they should cost more than $10. They also don't come with instructions, but they arrive boxed up very well."
1534,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love these headphones! I've been using them every night for about two months now and they are perfect for my needs.

I listen to ASMR videos on YouTube every night as I'm falling asleep so trust me when I say they are super comfortable. More than half the time, I wake up listening to nothing but leave the headphones on because it's comforting to me. I know that's a tad weird but hey, whatever works right? The padding on the ears is great and I wipe them down with just a tad of Purell once a week just to keep them nice a clean.

The sound is great and I like that I can adjust them on the headphones themselves as well as whatever device I'm using. I have the headphones turned all the way up and then adjust the volume on my device. I've used these while on the phone with my husband and he says my voice is more clear when using the microphone on these headphones.

I didn't pay attention when I purchased these so I was happily surprised when I saw that it had a braided cord! My old head phones got trashed because the wires and little bits of fuzz were starting to poke out of the cord. This won't happen with these!!

I ordered the grey and teal color. The color is beautiful and just as pictured. They are super cute!

When my hair is up in a bun I can extend them a bit and they still fit great. I wouldn't say this size is for toddlers but older kids maybe 10 and up will have no problem wearing them.

The folding feature is cool and will come in handy for a big move we have coming up. When folded they fit nicely in the car door or even my purse.

When my husband came home he liked mine so much I ordered him his own pair!!

I definitely recommend this headphones and have already purchased two pairs now. I think these would make a great gift for a music lover or really anyone who prefers the classic over the ear style headphones."
1535,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got it yesterday and so far I love them! I originally ordered them because I have a crap pair that hurt my ears when I want to watch with my noisey family around, but this pair is more than I expected. First, they got here fast. Secondly, the sound is so good and the ear parts don't hurt my ears after several shows on Netflix. Thirdly, They're cool as heck. The fold up feature is awesome, the texture of the cord is like a shoelace, the volume part on the cord actually controls the volume while watching (unlike my crap pair), and they seem durable like they will last! 10/10 so far, good job with this one."
1536,5.0 out of 5 stars,First off I love the color orange so 1 point right off the bat. ALIHEN folding stereo headset headphones work wonders when you want the full head phone experience on the go. I ordered these specifically because I seen that they were a folding headset and there were many times that I wanted to take my larger headphones with me where I was going but decided against it because they were too bulky to carry around. The ones I ordered were in blue and I was very happy with the design and look of the headphones. They seems to be well made and not cheap and easily breakable which I was happy with. They are partially plastic and partially metal and it gives them a very cool look. One thing that really impressed me was the fact that the cord was very strong and had a cloth covering over it instead of the normal plastic or rubber coating. This makes them much more durable and I like that because I am very rough with the things I use. The sound is awesome there is complaints about that and the microphone also works just as well. Overall I couldn't find 1 bad thing about these so I gave it a 5 out 5 . Disclaimer: I purchased these orange headphones with a promotional voucher for a fair and unbiased opinion. Everything expressed in this review is based off my experience using the product.
1537,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the headphones for my daughter's birthday and she really likes them. She basically chose them due to the bright green color that matches her phone. The head band is adjustable and the part that covers the ear is softly cushioned and very comfortable. This headset works nicely with Iphone or a Droid phone. (I tried them with both.) The sound quality is very good. When wearing the headphones and listening to music, it is difficult to hear what someone is saying to you. That is a pro not a con. The headphones seem to be a nice quality set and my daughter uses them daily."
1538,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sounded okay when they worked - but they stopped working after a couple of months. Slowly, the sound got scratchy when moving the cord around and then the sound started going out completely on one side and they are now totally not usable. This seems like a big waste of money for headphones that lasted 4 months with only occasional use. I emailed customer service at Ailihen - we shall see how they respond and I will update the review based on the response."
1539,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had this for a few months now and purposely have waited to report on the quality/worthiness of this set of headphones. Brought these for my 9 year old daughter and although she is pretty careful with her stuff, I've notice the cable does get tangled up from time to time. So far, no problem. She likes the sound quality (and I've checked them out as well and they are very good.) Seem to be well built and I especially appreciate the way the headphone are attached to the head piece. I think these will last just as long or longer than previous sets we have gotten for her. I have them saved on my wish list and will buy them again, if the occasion comes up."
1540,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were a great price and I like the way they look. Works very well for phone calls. I would have liked the volume control on the headset to work differently. I had previous headphones sets where if the volume was on low, it was the same volume as the device it was plugged into. This set, if you lower the volume, there is none - so it definitely is not loud enough for me when listening to speech files, etc. for work."
1541,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product at an awesome price. The sound quality is great and they are very stylish. I love the color. They are comfortable and can be stored away in small spaces, since they fold. I would have given 5 stars, but this product does not work with my Amazon Kindle Fire.I assumed that it would work.(My fault, I should never assume anything. I forgot that.) Since it is combatable with so many devices, I thought it would work with that too. I use my Kindle a lot, so that is a disappoint. Overall, it is a great product. It was delivered fast, securely, and safely."
1542,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, these are a decent pair of cans. I needed something to wear at work that could also be used to make calls and I didn't want a pair of earbuds. These have good sound quality, especially considering the price point,and the Mic provides decent voice quality for calls. My only gripe is they do get a bit uncomfortable after a couple hours of wearing them, the headband squeezes my head a little too tightly and my ears get a little sore."
1543,2.0 out of 5 stars,"We have had this item for two months. It worked great for a little over a month, now it has static and the sound goes out in one of the ears randomly. We love the look and over all feel of these headphones, but the quality is lacking for the price."
1544,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Be prepared to return these. They worked for the first few times we used them, then the sound became muffled and vocals could not be heard. Also, when folded, the headphones do not stay put. Instead they kind of dangle. Pay just $6 more the the Sound Intone headphones. We've had those for a month and are super happy we purchased that brand instead."
1545,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This review will be broken down into pro's and con's to expedite effectiveness of review.

PRO'S:
- Product arrived in timely manner
- Design of product is nice. Colors are bright and vibrant.
- Cord is hidden within the extension of the headband for the most part.
- Extension of headphones are adequate.
- Cord is of almost shoelace material, providing unique but pleasant texture and support over strenuous wear and tear use vs other cord materials.

CON'S:
- Sound leakage: This product has terrible sound conditioning. Any bystander can easily hear what you are listening if volume is at a high level. Even with headphones on head, the sound can still be heard and nice loud volumes. User must turn down music to really escape any sound leakage, but that defies the point of listening to a headset with music/gaming.

- Material: While the headband is cushioned for mitigating any discomfort, the product gets extremely uncomfortable after long duration. Tried for 2 hours and ears were hot, and sore afterwards. Extremely uncomfortable to wear.

- Sound: Bass is terrible, even at loud volumes, sound is extremely hollow and faint. Mixed music produced same results."
1546,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My Ailihen C8 headphones arrived earlier than expected which is always nice. I gave 3 stars due to the fact that I have had these headphones for less than a month and the sound sometimes goes in and out or has a strange static sound. I have noticed this on multiple devices (my HP laptop, Android phone, car CD player) so I can only assume it's an issue with this product and not my devices. But for the cost they aren't bad.

I love the style, color, foldable over the ear parts, and that you can manipulate the volume from the cord. Speaking of the cord I love that it's fabric and not just a plastic cord which I have found tangles, tears and damages much easier."
1547,5.0 out of 5 stars,"ok so I've had the chance to use these headphones a few times at the gym. So far on the elipitcal , treadmill and just casually sitting at homeThey fit comfortably and have an adjustable band. They are designed very sleek so I do not look totally stupid walking around with big huge headphones. I use them at night to watch tv while hubby sleeps. The noise canceling is o.k but occasionally I would get a feedback type buzz. All and all these are a good value keeping in mind they are not ""Beats"" or ""Bose"". I have used them only for a short time now and will update my review if anything drastically change As an active person I felt this fit right into the type of product I can review with experience with similar products"

This is a really nice pair of headphones that are working really well for me and my family. They produce some pretty great sounds that are very clear with no static or hissing even when turned all the way up. They are made well and the cable is nice and thick and attached to the earbuds really well. I have no problem plugging the 3.5 mm jack into my Samsung Galaxy S6 and my wife's iPhone 6, even with a case on. They fit my ears nice and are comfortable to wear even for long periods of time without causing any types of ear aches or pains. It has inline controls for playing or pausing the music. The headphones also fold up so they are easy to store or travel with. Love these headphones.

I am a fan of the mid sized over ear headphones. These fold down for storage and have a nice braided cord with an in line volume control and a single button that functions as your home button on an I phone but also plays/pauses and answers calls. There is an in line mic as well that has decent audio quality as well. I appreciate the low profile 3.5 jack that fits around cell phone cases. Sound wise these work out well with clear highs, appropriate mids and, tight punchy lows. The low lows are not completely there but overall the soundscape works well. These wear comfortably. I will be using these for my kids tablets mostly. I hate having to mess with Bluetooth pairing for them and the cords just work.
I had been looking for foldable headphones for the gym. I often use Bluetooth ones, but I like having corded ones for long bouts of cardio after having a few instances where my Bluetooth ones died and left my bored for the remainder of my cardio session. These are perfect for my needs. Here are some brief thoughts after getting some use out of them:

-Sound: The sound is on par or above expectations for headphones in this price range. The sound is clear and crisp. The bass is medium, but better than expected. When turning my phone to max volume these are loud. No worries about them being loud enough.
-Comfort: These have ample padding around the ear. When wearing them for longer periods I forget I'm wearing them.
-Style: In my opinion these look really good for a $20 set of headphones. I got the lime/gray color and I really like how it looks.

Overall, there's nothing bad to be said about these. They work great, look nice and are super comfortable to wear. I was sent them for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on my rating or review of them.I got the Lime Green and Grey colored headphones and they match the online pictures perfectly in color and design.

I purchased this product at a discount / free for me to test and review. I am not affiliated with this company and make no promises of a good rating while reviewing the product. I test the product thoroughly and do my best to provide detailed reviews to other Amazon customers so they may make informed decisions."
1549,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I Love this! Very nice...This is cool.Perfect for me.. having away from home I can use this not only for gaming but can use perfectly through skype with the built-in Microphone.
-Headphone is just right its not hurting in the ear..its so smooth, foldable and it's too easy for me to bring anywhere.
-The color is so natural and nice so pleasing on the eyes.
-Even the design and the making of this headphone is remarkable. very fashionable.
-So easy to used compatible to my Samsung Galaxy Note4, MP4 and even in laptop
-Its so hands-free can received my call not holding my phone... the volume is so loud and clear with the adjustment of volume you desired.
- Highly recomednded. Perfect for gift. Received this product with discount"
1550,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight delight. While some reviewers worried these may be too small, I find them perfect for me at the smallest head setting. They block outside sound well. I like the non-kinking braided cord in a gray color that won't show dirt. The ""mint"" is more of a vibrant teal and I love it. I'm not an audio expert, but have used headphones to listen to music for years and these deliver better tone than others in this price range. And while I did not buy these for phone call use, they work well for that, too."
1551,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter who has managed to break three or four pairs of headphones with what seems to be ""normal"" eight-year-old use. So far, they seem to be solid. Mostly I like that they fold up, so they are less likely to suffer the accidental fate of the others.
We tested with a laptop, android phone, and iPad; no problems with any of the devices."
1552,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been through many pairs of headphones and earbuds, trying to find something comfortable. I had several pairs of Sony earbuds found in store for $8 that are super comfortable and have decent sound, but they were dropped and broke. So I was in need of a good inexpensive pair for Netflix and Pandora. I got this pair for $9.99, so I thought it was a great deal. They look adorable. They seem good quality. I like the design and the cord. The sound quality is very good and they are doing a great job at noise-cancelling. I love the color and I have to admit that it was a deciding factor, since I love anything teal. I bought the mint/grey ones, but they are not mint. They are teal. I think they got color names a bit mixed up. Anyway, I love the color. The biggest issue is they are extremely uncomfortable. I cannot even wear them for 30 minutes without my ears hurting really, really bad. I do not have huge ears or a big head. I am petite and proportionate, so I don't know what the problem is. It seems to me that they might be designed for children. If the headset was slightly bigger, it would probably be comfortable. I was unsure whether to return them or not, but I figured for $9.99, why bother. I can use them for short term, like to watch short youtube videos or listen to a song or two. I will keep looking for a perfect pair in the meantime."
1553,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones work well. They do not cancel out all of the sound but they do a good job. I can still slightly hear things close to me. The sound quality is great and everything sounds like it should. I use these daily and I would purchase these again. These you would make a great gift for anyone.
1554,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: They stopped working properly. I returned them. I guess they weren't so durable after all.
They seem to have decent sound quality. The earpieces block noise but that makes it more difficult to hear someone speaking to me more often than it helps me hear music. Cord is durable and has a volume control and play/pause button, so that's good."
1555,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love them. Before I purchased I read the reviews about being comfortable and the great audio sound, the audio is wonderful however no two ears are the same. They are somewhat comfy for an hour or so but I wouldn't fall asleep in them. But like I say all ears are shaped differently. Other than that I love them as well as having the volume switch on them verses going to my device."
1556,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These were for my son and he has only been using them for a few days, but we've tested the functions and overall are very happy with the purchase. The cord covering not being plastic or silicone coated is great because it doesn't get wrapped around itself and tangled up so easily. The microphone works well and I was able to hear him clearly when we did a test video call. The volume adjuster on the mic piece is nice to quickly adjust. They fit well and are comfortable for him. Here's 9.
My husband also bought a pair for himself and he has enjoyed them so far so well."
1557,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having used them for several days now, I like them. My only concerns are, will the ear foam break down and peel, will the controls fail, and will the cord break. These issues will only show up over time so I just have to wait and see. So far I like them."
1558,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great! Sounds quality is awesome for the low price. I am a college student who attends online, so I use then to submit my oral assignments, microphone works great and I always have a clear audio for my work. Super cute style and color!! I am in love!!"
1559,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality is amazing. Well built and of great durability. Sturdy and aesthetically pleasing, as well as very comfortable. Noise cancellation is well above average. When headphones are on, you cannot hear anything but what is played through the speakers. As well, when the sound is up inside the headphones, those around cannot hear in the same room unless you are sitting literally right beside them and that is with them up quite loud. They are adjustable. The cord has a mic on it so that you can answer your cell phone when listening to music on your phone. They go up, maybe a little too loud, as my son could potentially do damage to his eardrums. The bass is fantastic, the clarity is phenomenal, and the treble is perfect with great balance. The mids are good, the lows are good, and the highs are good. I literally have nothing bad to say about these headphones. I have ordered three different pair this week of over the ear headphones for under $30 and these are by far the best ones. I just cannot say enough about the sound quality. Even when speaking normally during a phone conversation, my voice is not muffled and neither is the caller on the other end. You definitely cannot go wrong with these headphones. Although I received a discount for my review of this product, I, as many other Amazon shoppers, rely heavily on the un-biased opinions of other reviewers. This review is an un-biased, 100% accurate review of my personal experience with this product."
1560,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are only okay. The pros are they work like headphones should and the sound quality isn't bad for $20.00. It's mostly mids, but it's tolerable. The cons are they are made from cheap materials and a possible fire hazard. I assume many products are made cheaply and sold for more, but when it's obvious the materials are cheap it makes one nervous (light plastic). Especially since the poorly translated English warnings mention possible fire (when plugged into a phone adapter on airplanes). So uh...I won't be plugging these in to my phone anytime soon or taking them on airplanes, but I'll keep them as a throw away pair until I can afford something better.

EDIT: I changed my review to 2 stars because they are now BROKEN after 2 months. I've barely used them and the sound has gone out in the right side. I can't even return them now. You get what you pay for, but it's not worth the risk. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1561,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgrade from earbuds!! Bought for my daughter, she LOVES them!
I got these for my ten year old daughter who likes to listen to music and is a novice gamer. When she first spotted the headphones right out of the box, she loved the bright, fun colors; but then she put them on and she really fell in love! She loves how comfortable they are, and more importantly how they muffle the background noise of her siblings so that she can enjoy her music and gaming experiences without the sounds of toddlers interrupting her. She also likes how easily the menu bar on the cable operates; she notes that its simple, easy to reach, and allows for all the functions she needs to access whether its pausing her music, answering her phone or skipping ahead to her favorite song. I love that her music helps her focus and that she has been able to work more efficiently on her homework when she's not distracted by outside racket! I also love that the headphones fold to store away easily in their box!
Important to note: these headphones fit really great on my daughter, but when I tried them on, they felt a little small on my ears. I highly recommend for younger (teen - pre-teen) / smaller folks but would buy something larger for myself. The headphones do cover my whole ear, but I personally prefer the kind that encase my ears completely.

1562,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice headphones for priceless. Comfy and sound good. Until 2 days after return window closes. Then month old headset has short in cord near plug. So that sound comes and goes. Better off buy something last more than just long enough they won't stand behind it
1563,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Dear AILIHEN, I am very disappointed to inform you that I purchased these lovely headphones and they worked beautifully for the first three weeks. Then the plastic adapter broke and they no longer work. My Mother had bought the same ones (the only difference was the color) and she loved them as well. When I saw mine had broke I looked at hers and noticed that her adapter was metal and solid, where as mine was cheap plastic and broken in less then a month."
1564,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my son. He loves them he said they are super comfortable the sound is really good and they cancel out alot of noise!
UPDATE sound always goes out after a couple weeks, we have replaced them 2x already.It was a waste of money we now have to buy yet another pair of headphones"
1565,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work great and they look good. They aren't noise canceling - but I didn't expect them to be. These are good for listening to Netflix or music or for conferences over Zoom. I've recorded a few lectures on these as well and they sound fine.
1566,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After spending all night on the road with these headphones (Vacation baby!) I have to say these headphones are OK at best. The look sleek from a distance, but the silver color on them just LOOKS like cheap plastic. They feel like a toy but are somewhat comfortable. The colors are really nice but I am not quite sure i can tell my friends to pick them up. The looks are ok, the feel is not. The sound quality is OK but i get the same sound quality out of a cheap pair of 5 dollar earbuds from walmart.

These are OK at best.

1567,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for tween daughter who was thrilled with them as they do look great. Unfortunately, only a month later the sound began to falter, strangely couldn't hear vocals any longer, just the music. Then one earphone failed completely and we haven't used them since. Switched to angled earbuds too for more comfort as after a while her ears would be sore from these."
1568,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Our young son is fairly picky about how headphones feel on his ears when wearing them. We ordered these headphones last year and he has really liked them! He needed a new pair for school this year so we made sure to purchase the same kind. We really like that there is padding on the part that sits on your ears, that the cord is covered in a nylon fabric (does not get tangled) and that the headphones fold easily. They are great for traveling!"
1569,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these July 18, 2016 for my son's birthday and he loved them using them while playing games on his tablet. But it is now December 18, 2016 (5 months later!) and there is only sound every once in a while in one side and that's only after messing with the volume slide for a while. VERY disappointed. They are going in the trash."
1570,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these and so does my 6 year old! We have used these for several months and really enjoyed them. Sound quality is good, volume control is easy for my kiddo to operate and comfortable on. The fold up feature is nice for storing."
1571,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my 5 and 7 year old boys. They were so excited to get them. They look great. They have very impressive sound quality. Both boys have been constantly wearing them for the past week. They must do a good job drowning out sound because they can't hear us when they are on...not that they would come running before when we called them! They are a little big on my 5 year old but he doesn't seem to mind. Mainly got them for plane ride, but haven't left yet, not confident they will work great. Highly recommend"
1572,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought three of these headphones for my kids. twin 11 and 9 year olds. All failed the same way. They worked when we got them and the kids liked them, but one pair failed within weeks, the second pair a month later and the third shortly after that. The first started with one ear stopping to work, then eventually no sound at all."
1573,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones. Got them for both of my boys (tween and teen). They love them. The foldability is a nice feature. Also the cord is more like a fabric nylon, so I imagine that will hold up well to the rigors of teen boy product testing."
1574,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing quality for the price!. The noise canceling aspect makes them great for studying and the wire is braided so it wont bend easily. Also I love how they bend easily to fit in my bag.
My only issue is it fits a little snug around the ears, but that is more of a personal preference.

Update: I lost sound in the right ear after a month and now the right hinge broke off...Its to late to return but overall its not as great as I first thought"
1575,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for my daughter and they broke with in a few weeks. The end piece broke off inside the laptop. Apparently, this is common for these headphones. Do NOT waste your money."
1576,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality for the price is phenomenal and better than Beats (not that that is difficult to do). The microphone is weak and in a bad location but it's decent audio.
1577,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Got for daughter. Worked for about 6 months. Then the Bluetooth stopped working, then the cushion on the right side cane off."
1578,4.0 out of 5 stars,The color of these headphones is just gorgeous! I just wish the bass was stronger and the overall volume was a little louder instead of me having to jack up the volume on my phone.
1579,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had these for just about a year now, and they’re holding up well! The only issue I have is that I wish the parts that cover the ear were a little bigger or shaped differently or something. After a while, my left ear sometimes gets sore because the padding rubs against my cartilage piercing."
1580,4.0 out of 5 stars,Captians Log...Star date 1/23/2017...My headphones arrived recently and I have found myself intrigued by the product. Good product. Just what I expected for the money. Delivered quickly and in great shape when they arrived. Would buy again. Kirk out...
1581,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these headphones on October 6th 2016. These headphones are beautiful and seem sturdily constructed, as far as the body goes. That is where the positive aspects end. They do not work for someone with a big head. They are too snug. Even worse they pinch my ears terribly. I have pretty small ears maybe even smaller than most adult women and though the ear pieces are very padded they pinch badly, especially if I am wearing glasses. This is not due to the band size but something in the ear cups construction. Now the review gets worse... The sound initially was very muffled and quiet, I noticed the only way to get these things sounding reasonably loud enough was to hold down the talk button or at-least I am assuming that is what the little knobby button is as its unlabeled. Then the sound was clear. But the button does not stay depressed so you either have to hold it or find a way to gently secure it... So you can hear your audio, their sole function. I should have returned these off the bat because of the discomfort issue but I didn't, now they have forced my hand and they will go to the great dumpster in the sky. Both speakers have gone out, I struggled with one side working for about a week and today the remaining speaker has died. RIP headphones you were terrible but will be missed.... only because now I don't have any working headphones."
1582,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product is very durable. Even the cord is wrapped in a wonderful fabric that is usually the point at which she sings fail. I keep this next to my living room chair so I can quietly listen to things on my computer without disturbing family members nearby
1583,1.0 out of 5 stars,The jack broke off in the ear phone slot not even a week after we bought them! Very sad about the quality of this product.
1584,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound quality!! I got these at a special price. I think like $13.99 or something like that. If i see it for this price again, I'm definitely getting another one. I still have my N-Tune Headphones but it seem like the sound quality on this is a little bit better in my opinion. Well, to me sound quality is different for everyone. Some people like loads of bass and some people like a little bass with more treble. Anyways, just got them today and i hope they at least last a year or more. Love it!!"
1585,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was just what I was looking for. The ear covers are much more comfortable than the ones I previously had. The color is very close to the color on my computer screen. I especially love the working volume slider. I still get head aches but that's usually due to how I wear them not because of wearing them in general.
1586,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great! Clear sound, no problems with the cord, comfortable and adjustable headphones. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a decent pair of headphones. It is a little odd that the cord is on the left, but not a deal breaker."
1587,1.0 out of 5 stars,After two days the jack that goes into my daughter tablet broke off into the jack insert in her tablet now her tablet is damaged since I don't know how to get the jack out of it. Now I have a three hundred dollar tablet that you can't hear any sound. Very upset!!
1588,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphone are nice, but not very comfortable for long use. I really don't recommend these. If you are wanting something quick then go for these but look for others. They started to hurt my ears some after a few days. To me they seem cheap, not will designed. My headphones broke. I was only getting sound out of one site and not both. I am extremely unhappy with the product. I also don't want to pay the extra costs of shipping them back. I do not recommend these headphones at all. Look at other headphones don't get these."
1589,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones looked high end but they weren’t. The headphone jack ended up breaking in my daughter’s iPhone so now the phone believes headphones are in so now you can’t get any calls. She can’t hear people. Headphones just not built to last, cheap and when you buy cheap you get what you pay for👏"
1590,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty, functional, sound great and are comfortable. I like that they fold and fit nicely in the case (bought separately). Can't hear much around me when wearing them. They block outside noise very well."
1591,2.0 out of 5 stars,"they were good headphones for about 5 months, until suddenly on a phone they would start pausing, unpausing, skipping, and opening siri by itself with no way to stop it. they worked fine on the computer until the audio wouldn't work unless you positioned the cord a certain way, and then it only played out of one side and then they stopped working completely!! so yeah i'm pretty pissed right now"
1592,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased a pair for my daughter and a pair for my son. My daughter’s cord broke after a few weeks and I returned for a refund. My sons just recently stopped working for u known reason and now the window has closed to return it. I wasn’t expecting Beats or Bose but was hoping they would last longer then a few months.
1593,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a few VR headsets, from simple Google cardboard to plastic headsets. This is a step above the standard Google Cardboard, in the same class as SamsungVR. If you aren't aware of Google Cardboard it is a neat little gadget that takes the price of the VR experience down from $800-$1,000 to a manageable price for a non-essential gadget. While this was on the way I thought it would take a long setup time and be cumbersome and require special hardware to run properly that I didn't have. Turns out nearly any phone can run this and setup is as easy as scanning a QR code and downloading the app. In the future I see VR playing a role in education and instruction as it allows you to get up close and personal with historical events, animals, planets, in a way you may never have been able to before."

1595,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Super cute colors, I use them to watch tv on my iPad so they work great for my purposes. They’re a little bit tight on my head though, so if I wear them for a while they start to hurt."
1596,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these from my daughters wish list for her birthday on 4-3. She was so happy because they are also noise canceling, something she needed for a college class she is taking."
1597,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these headphones for 6 months. I though I'd give them a try because of the reviews; I was wrong. The microphone and the right ear-piece stopped working after a month of use. Unfortunately, and coincidently, it was right after the return service ended. Save your money and buy something else!"
1598,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for Christmas presents for my 2 & 7 year old daughters. They have used them from December through now (mid March). One set had the ""plug"" become detached when it was being pulled out from the headphone jack of our iPad & the other just no longer works. They didn't even last 3 months.

I did give 2 stars because I do like the concept of the folding headphones & being able to pause/control the volume on them as well."
1599,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super high quality! I love the look and feel of these headphones. The sound quality is awesome and the headphones have a noise cancelling quality to them. They are great for the gym!
1600,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My 9 year old daughter received these as a Christmas present. She opened them on December 27th and on 12/29 the one side of the headphones didn't work. On 1/1 the jack plug broke in half. She's careful with her electronics and keeps them put away when not in use. She's very disappointed that they didn't last more than week. My sister in law wasted her money on this product. My other children's ""kid"" head phones are still going strong with a lower price point."
1601,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are comfortable and sound great. The mic works very well also. This is the best set of headphones I own and I use them every day. I can't imagine anyone needing anything better
1602,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the headphones. It is larger than I thought it would be.I wanted it to hang behind my neck. the product does exactly what it is supposed to. I love the cord for the headphones they are not easily broken.
1603,1.0 out of 5 stars,these headphones are horrible the same day i got them they started shorting. they are very cheap and aren't reliable. disappointment.
1604,1.0 out of 5 stars,The ear pad came off after 6 months of light use. Short product life.
1605,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered 2, first one broke within a couple weeks. The seller replaced and sent me another one, sadly both of those broke within a matter of weeks. Definitely not durable and NOT KID FRIENDLY."
1606,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these headphones as a gift from my older sister for Christmas. At the time, I was living in a dorm room with really noisy people, so these headphones helped me a lot. It doesn't block outside noise completely, but with music on, it helps. Unfortunately, the headphone jack got bent. So my sister contacted Ailihen and they gave me a new pair completely free. I love these headphones, and they are so cute!! And the customer service is really nice. I think what happened to my old headphones was just a fluke, so don't worry!"
1607,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones which were delivered Jan 30. After only two months, the cord shorted out and they stopped working. I tried to message the seller to ask for a refund or replacement but received no reply, i wasted my money on these poor quality headphones. Buyer beware!"
1608,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very comfortable and lightweight, with great sound. I love the durability of the cord, it looks to be one that should last. I have only used them a handful of time so so far, but am quite happy with my purchase. Especially since the price was go great!"
1609,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke within a week of receiving
1610,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Such cute, quality headphones. My 11-year old niece loves them! (Review is hers — sadly, I didn’t see them)"
1611,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is ok. Very lightweight. BUT, no removable cord at the earpiece means broken cord that you can't fix without taking the whole kit apart.

For that reason alone-- I say stay away. I bought a different set for my son-- the wire broke-- and I just replaced it. simple."
1612,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know how ppl are giving good reviews. Mine suck. The little controller on the chord is way too sensitive, making static, and ruining the music every time the chord it even slightly touched. Pretty frustrated, and disappointed."
1613,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have worn these headphones for almost six hours straight and they haven't hurt my ears. I do have smaller ears and they are sensitive so I really needed something other than earbuds as they tend to make my ears ache. I also get headaches really easy from wearing anything like headbands or snug sunglasses and these haven't caused any problems. They aren't tight but don't flop off my head either. The sound quality is good. Decent bass and the volume can be turned up very loud. No issues with outside noise or having to turn it up in loud areas. I can't even turn it all the way up or it's too loud. They have a real nice look to them as well. I really like the volume control. The mic works great for phone calls. Very good product!
1614,1.0 out of 5 stars,I've had hear for maybe 2 weeks and they just fell apart as I was heading out of the door. No man handling in my part I literally lifted them off of my table. Don't waste your money just buy reliable like the $20 Sony - I bought mostly for the color and now I'm paying for it.
1615,5.0 out of 5 stars,My whole family is enjoying these headphones. Great sound and affordable. Works great with my laptop.
1616,1.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this! The cord was cut when I opened the package. This is what I get for trying to save money and buying used.
1617,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In the past my kids have not liked headphones that go over the head because they are large and bulky. These headphones are bigger than I had expected them to be, but the are very lightweight and fit snugly to their heads. They adjust well for my 9 year old as well as my 15 year old. The sound quality is great and it is nice that you can adjust the volume on the cord. The cord is durable and very heavy duty. I am extremely pleased with these headphones. The only problem we seem to have is that we have one set of headphones and three kids."
1618,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice! Bought these for my daughter who is pretty rough on her headphones & has broken a few pairs already. These have held up well so far!
1619,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Thanks to Ailihen for their support with their product. Complete honesty: First pair arrived and after 1 week of use went defective, Ailihen proactively contacted me for follow up and sent me another pair looking exactly as the previous one, but these worked perfectly. Great customer service. Keep it up."
1620,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay first off, the quality of these headphones are absolutely incredible, and the mic is so great and easy to use! But I was highly dissatisfied mainly because of the fact that these headphones didn't even last me a whole month until the right ear started to cut in and out and now it doesn't even work!!! There's no damage to any part of these headphones. I was hoping that these would last me a lot longer but unfortunately they couldn't hold out. Wouldn't recommend"
1621,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very lightweight and build quality seems decent. It is definitely a good price for these headphones. Not the best audio experience, but good enough for dialogue based audio."
1622,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for my wife, she is very happy with them. Great quality for the price."
1623,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked these headphones when I first received them, but unfortunately they broke almost immediately. About a month after I began using them, there is only sound out of one side. I am disappointed in my purchase."
1624,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gorgeous Color, Perfect fit and Great quality. My 8 year old Daughter is using them at school and She loves them!
Quality and loud sound too😉"
1625,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I only give them 4 stars because they are a Christmas gift and haven't been opened yet. I can tell you packaging is great, color is exact to picture, and shipping was fast. The foam ear pieces look think and comfy for the ears. After they are opened and used ibeill update review"
1626,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are amaaazing! Could do better with a bit more bass but definitely really well made. Good build quality and noise reduction
1627,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound - when it works, is wonderful, as is the microphone. I got mine sent to me via Amazon as a gift for my birthday, and the right headphone doesn't always work. I thought it was my phone at first, until I could test the headphones on other devices recently which proved it IS the headphones. I don't know if it's worth it to get a new pair of these for the price if there is a risk of them coming broken."
1628,5.0 out of 5 stars,7 year-old loves them. They work well. Great color. Mother approved.
1629,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, and ideal for traveling. I am on the road allot, these help maintain sanity by allowing yourself to relax with tunes or a movie. They are a comfortable design, so they wont kill your head when wearing them. The bold vibrant blue is gorgeous, so they are easily unisex. They woudl make a great gift for anyone. I use them with my tablet and phone to listen to videos and music. nice clear crisp sound they are a great headphone!"
1630,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones stopped working after three months of buying. And as of today April 25, 2017. have not been replaced, I have communicated on several occasions and have not solved my problem."
1631,2.0 out of 5 stars,Looks great but only lasted a few days the jack that plugs into the head phones is of poor Poor quality as it bent after the fourth use now the headphones are not working
1632,1.0 out of 5 stars,Loved these when I got them but after less than 2 months of using them the padding on one side detached from the headphone making them unwearable. No way to fix them. Amazon is giving me a refund after some discussion since it was filled by an outside vendor.
1633,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I went through 2 pairs of these. Poor connection with the cord to the headphones, when that area bends the wires inside break. I lost sound in one or both ears. Don not buy these. Not worth the $20."
1634,5.0 out of 5 stars,Always wanted headphones like these love them great quality and love the color the doing is great I also got this product for free or on a discount the wire is long enough and the bass is. Nice
1635,5.0 out of 5 stars,The quality of this product is amazing. I felt like I was back at my clubs days in the 1990s. I am very happy with this product.
1636,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my son and one side quit workin within 1 month. Garbage. Buy something else.
1637,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very happy with these headphones. They are lightweight, and fold nicely to fit into a bag. I am no sound expert, but they sound good to me, balanced and even. They do get warm on the ears. This is good for me, as I bought them for flying, which is often cold. But maybe not for running in hot weather. The cable is fabric wrapped, and doesn't tangle. I love the color too. Overall, these are very nice headphones for the price point."
1638,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cute and comfy. Works for both me and my 5 year old.
1639,1.0 out of 5 stars,These lasted only 6 weeks before they shorted out.
1640,4.0 out of 5 stars,I was hoping for some inexpensive folding headphones for travel but these are a bit larger than expected. Aside from that they seem like a good value.
1641,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice headphones for my grandson - and he LOVES the color!!! He uses these with his Nintendo DS, iPad, laptop PC, LG Android phone - basically all of his devices."
1642,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The end connector broke completely off in less than 2 months of use by my 11 year old, rendering the headphones unusable. Very disappointing."
1643,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the color, folds together nicely, quality product"
1644,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good quality headphones, but they don't fit my head as well as I would like. Still work well for me when I am using my laptop."
1645,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good. Bought them for my daughter, they look good and sound good, can't beat the price."
1646,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband bought these for me. They are Super cute, and they were pretty comfortable, but after about a month of regular use and now they don't work 😭. It started with sound citing in and out of one side and now neither side works. I know things wear out, but that was kind of ridiculous."
1647,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones came as described. They are adjustable and comfortable. Would buy from seller again.
1648,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love the headphones. My problem is that not even a month into own these headphone they broke, I can’t heard out of one ear unless I hold my iPod a certain way and jiggy the area where the headphone jack is. Very disappointed."
1649,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for Christmas, and started using them on December 26th, 2017. As of January 31st, 2018 they stopped working altogether. Nothing is wrong with the wiring outside the headphones, just zero sound now from the headphones when something is playing. I'm incredibly disappointed with this product."
1650,3.0 out of 5 stars,I like the headphones enough but the cord last 6 weeks. Just outside of the return window.. Now they only play out of one ear.
1651,1.0 out of 5 stars,Quality is not there even for the price. Jack cracked and works intimitantly at best.
1652,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far I really enjoy these headphones. I haven't used the build in mic. The only reason I'm going to take one star is the plastic part were the volume control is seems a little on the cheaper end. But thus far have had no issues with it. I would repurchase these again! I also really like the color
1653,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound quality. I like this better than my ear buds as it helps cancel out the background noise. I work quite a bit from home and usually the tv is on which I find distracting and works perfectly to cancel that out. I really like the color. My 11 year old loves it too.
1654,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are very nice head phones for a nice price. Now they dont have to much bass but that doesn't mean they are not good. They have a great sound quality and would recommended them to anyone looking for a compact nice set of headphone for on the go.
1655,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headset! Comfortable to wear, easy to carry on the go! Works very well with my phone and laptop. Sound is well balanced, ear pieces give you good sound with loosing the surrounding sounds you may need to hear (like car horns, alarms, someone calling your name). I love them, far better than those tiny uncomfortable ear buds!! Well packaged, easy to open, delivery very fast. Received a follow up email from seller to be sure I was pleased with my purchase. Highly recommend this product and the seller!!"
1656,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have to admit that I wasn't expecting them to work as good as they do at the price that I got them. They work great!
1657,5.0 out of 5 stars,BOUGHT THEM FOR MY 10 YEAR OLD GRAND DAUGHTER AND SHE WENT NUTS........JUST LOIVES THEM!!!!
1658,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter just received a pair of C8 headphones through Amazon for Christmas. They were comfortable and worked great for her until the left speaker quit working after less than a month of use. Based on our experience, these headphones do not seem very dependable. I would have given these four or five stars if they would have lasted more than a few weeks. Don't lose the warranty card!"
1659,1.0 out of 5 stars,They worked great for the first month then the input jack tip broke off. I went to return them but I missed the return window by 3 days. I'm hoping the company will replace them or contact me.
1660,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, wore them to watch a movie on a tablet, great sound, and very comfortable. Wore with my phone to make a phone call and was very happy they could hear me very well!"
1661,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this as a gift for my dad who is always on his IPOD. He loves the comfort and fit and inline controls. However he complains that the inline control is to high up and awkward to use. Overall a great set of headphones for casual daily use.
1662,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ailihen, thank you for making these great headphones. I can now stay in the living room with my husband at night while he is watching sports and I can play on face book. They work like a charm! The fit is very perfect, they are adjustable and, the sound is precise. I give them a very strong 5 stars and would recommend to anyone."
1663,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones for my girlfriend and they are amazing!! they fit perfectly over her ears and do a really good job of blocking out noise. she works out with them on and keeps telling me how happy she is they stay on her head at all times. and of course sound quality is amazing (i tested myself!). will definitely order from Ailihen again!
1664,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are comfortable and have great sound quality. I would highly recommend.
1665,1.0 out of 5 stars,I've only had them for a few months and they have already stopped working.
1666,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are extremely awesome they do exactly what were said, the color is also beautiful too. Thank you!"
1667,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really loud she said happily. Only had couple weeks but so far so good with my 15yr old daughter.
1668,4.0 out of 5 stars,awesome headphones constantly have people ask me where they are from. work great look great and amazing price
1669,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My son initially loved these headphones but when they only worked for 10 days we had to ship them back,"
1670,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice! Had them for several weeks, sounds great, and no problems.

The headphones are not one seamless color like the product pic, but plenty of customer photos depict this. I like them, though."
1671,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good. Love the color and works great when doing online trainings for work. Haven't tried the microphone feature, as that wasn't a need for me with these. Price was good and so far, so are these."
1672,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Daughter loves it, and i love how the wire is protected and cannot break easily."
1673,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for the price. These have been dropped by my daughter several times and never broken. Very durable.
1674,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They're comfortable, cute and the sound is good but they only lasted for 3 weeks before the sound died in one ear. They brag about their lifetime warranty but I sure hope that you can jump through the multiple hoops they require for you to actually use the warranty."
1675,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my 6 year old son. He loves them. Most of it is plastic but it doesn't feel flimsy. They are on ear but the faux leather is soft so they feel good. The best part is the chord is made of a nylon material not rubber which I love because it doesn't tangle and looks like it can take a beating from a 6 year old. I listened to the sound and its not great for an audiophile but it doesn't matter to a 6 year. They fold up nicely too.
1676,1.0 out of 5 stars,The metal connector broke in half where it plugs into the devise the first time using the headphones.
1677,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfy fit at a decent price. I like that there is only one cord that doesn't tangle. Comes with a neat volume control that slides up and down. The button below can be used to answer calls or pause music. I am happy with this purchase.
1678,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these headphones at discount through the Amazon review club for an honest opinion. These headphones are INCREDIBLE! Comparable to some priced much higher. Love the colors, and the sound is amazing. They fit the kids and adults both. I plug them in to TV, phone, and computer even when I don't need to for the sound experience. Its like having a portable movie theater. We are going to have to get at least one more!"
1679,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a pair for my nephew. The first time he tried to use them, the jack broke off in the computer. Of course this was after the date to return them was closed. If I could, i would give them a zero star rating."
1680,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It looks great and I really like the chord. Pros: color matched the picture, material was soft and comfortable. Arrived really quickly too. Only con is that the ear-phone size is a little smaller than I thought it would be. It kind of presses my glasses and ears a little too snugly so I cannot wear it for too long w/out breaks."
1681,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones because my old $200 dollar ones were breaking down. The sound quality was ok but I was used to headphones that sit around the ear and not on it so I found these uncomfortable but fine for $20 but then after just over two weeks the sound gave out in the right speaker. Needles to say I am returning them.
1682,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm INCREDIBLY pleased with these. They are so much better than beats, as they are sewn together, rather than glued. The sound quality is excellent , and is also is great with smart phones to use to speak on the phone.

So wonderful for such a low price!"
1683,2.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty sure I received a defective unit. Constant feedback in the form of humming and any time the wire is twisted it pops and crackles.
1684,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality and powerful little headphones! The foldable part helped very much on a trip we took recently. Sound quality was great!
1685,2.0 out of 5 stars,My son loved these headphones! Unfortunately they only lasted about two weeks before the cord on them broke.
1686,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for Christmas. Shipping was as expected. I like how it folds and the wires are covered with material. They fit comfortably as well.
1687,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The earbuds that come with my iPhone have better sound quality. Songs come through faded, tinny, and lacking any depth."
1688,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves these headphones. She was complaining of pain from earbuds that she had and now no more pain and she loves the comfort of the soft foam. Very nice!
1689,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. Green is one of her favorite colors and she said it really blocks out the noise. She's happy, I'm happy!"
1690,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After wearing these for a little while, they make your ears hurt"
1691,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered this as a gift for my little niece as a gift, and it stopped working after 3 weeks. Called Amazon, and they issued my a refund for this defective product. It looks good, but I don't think the quality is good."
1692,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hello, I'm starting up a YouTube channel that promotes products. I'd like to get a sample of these headphones to promote them. Thanks."
1693,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves these! There is a button he can push that pauses the video he's watching ON THE HEADPHONES! Amazing!
1694,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ok they sound great but they fell apart in a month.😩
1695,3.0 out of 5 stars,They were great headphones for about 2 weeks. My daughter went to remove them from her tablet and the end of it bent/broke.
1696,1.0 out of 5 stars,One speaker blew out within a week. Very disappointed
1697,5.0 out of 5 stars,My grandson loves them. He says they are comfortable and when he plays his games the sound is great!
1698,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this item for my granddaughter and she is absolutely pleased with it. The quality is great! They are very soft against the ear. They work very well. The price is reasonable. I recommend these headphones to anyone.
1699,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gift for relative.
1700,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really good headphones. The sound quality is excellent. These are terrific in-ear headphones that look and sound awesome. I really like the look of these, quality construction"
1701,4.0 out of 5 stars,a little tinny sounding but good for the price
1702,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a Christmas gift, so they were used for 3 weeks, and then the audio went out on one side."
1703,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are perfect for my 5 year old. She uses them for her tablet and in the car for her DVD player. She loves the pink color.
1704,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy. Thanks, Tom."
1705,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves watching his iPad and I purchased many headphones that never sounded great for the same price or more.... I now want a pair of my own of these! Great deal! Great sound! Great price!
1706,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with how quickly they shipped and arrived. The quality is good and exactly as advertised. I do like the blue.
1707,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its great and my daughter can't stop using them and did any one notice that the girl wearing the headphones from the sideshow looks fake
1708,5.0 out of 5 stars,Listen to the sounds of wonder... Great headphones
1709,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with the purchase. My daughter loves them.
1710,4.0 out of 5 stars,Everything I expected it to be
1711,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these!!! Excellent for the price
1712,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really, really liked the way these looked, and the sound quality was pretty good too. Unfortunately they broke after about 6 weeks."
1713,5.0 out of 5 stars,A++++++ item these head phones are very lord and fit very well
1714,3.0 out of 5 stars,They looked and sounded great but bought as xmas gift its only january 15th and the 3.5mm jack just fell off end of cord maybe mine were defective comfort was a 10 sound was a 8 my quality was a 1
1715,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound from these are amazing. I am very pleased. The only issue I can report is the padding on the ear muffs starts to become uncomfortable after wearing them for a while. Otherwise, great product and quick shipping."
1716,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ah, I can hear again! After my last pair of headphones ceased to work I ordered these up and the fit the bill. These headphones are primarly used by my son. The most important feature in this case was price as I am sure these will eventually be broken. What I liked about the ALIHEN C* headphones is that they are collapsible and have the volume control right on the wire. The sound quality is great and will serve our needs. The packaging was nice and easy to open."
1717,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my grandson's 13th birthday. He absolutely loves them (he actually told me that). He is visiting for the weekend and has them on most of the time. Score one for grandma!
1718,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
1719,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for my grandson, who is a gamer. He was very pleased with these headphones as the quality of his video chat was significantly better than the much more expensive headphones he had been using. The headphones appear durable and fold for easy storage."
1720,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice headphones! I bought 2 pairs, one for each kid for using in the car with their tablets. They so far have worked great. I love that their adjustable so they fit me too if I want to use them. So far I have no complaints."
1721,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought them for my niece and she loves them.
1722,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are HEADPHONES. The manufacturer wanted you to be sure you knew, as the word is printed in large letters on the top of the headband as well as on each earpiece. Just in case you were confused... The padding on the headband and earpieces suggested a comfortable fit but they were very tight on me (I do have a large head, this is an issue I've had with some other headphones.) The cushions provide reasonable sound isolation.

The sound quality I found rather poor. Distortion was evident at even modest volumes and there was no bass to speak of. There is an inline microphone, but your voice will sound hollow and distant if you use it. Interestingly, the module with the microphone has a slide control for volume rather than up and down buttons. There is a single button that has multiple functions depending on how many times you press it - I don't like this as much as two-button models.

The manufacturer provided a free set for review."
1723,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't tried them myself yet, but they look like what they do in the description. I won't have a better review until after Christmas when my sister opens them."
1724,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really good sound quality but mic quality is low. Not extremely poor but matched to the quality of the headphones the mic doesn't quite match the quality.
1725,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My kids love them. I bought 2 pairs, 1 for ps4 and the other 1 for pc gaming.Great headphones."
1726,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm very pleased with the headphones. They are comfortable and work very nicely.
1727,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am so happy with these headphones! I ordered them becuase earbuds hurt my ears and these are so much more comfortable. I love the color! My kids are already trying to confiscate them.
1728,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these every day for singing on a sing app on my cell phone and they work pretty well. Definitely not studio quality but they work awesome enough. Love how they fold for easy storage.
1729,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice set of cheaper headphones
1730,4.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for my young daughter to use with her chromebook at school. She seems to like them okay. She has trouble with earbuds always falling out of her ears so she really needs over the ear headphones. Sound quality is good and they are adjustable.
1731,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound wonderful, but the wire has a flimsy connection to the microphone and ripped quite easily. Just be careful to not catch the wire on anything."
1732,2.0 out of 5 stars,I got them and I was so happy!!! I used them and the worked just fine. About a week later they started not working. Now the sound is very muffled and if you want a clear sound you have to turn them just right. Not very good quality. :(
1733,1.0 out of 5 stars,So I bought these for my son to use on his kindle tablet. Day 2 and a piece of the part you insert into the headphone jack broke off and is stuck inside. Now we have a useless tablet because he can not use any sound to play his games. Not a happy camper!!!
1734,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable. While they don't have the best sound or carry much bass, they're great for video game voice chat. These aren't Beats or the gaming version of Beats. They're simple and functional."
1735,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!
1736,5.0 out of 5 stars,The quality seems pretty good and the sound is great just what I needed. They are also very comfortable on ears.
1737,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great at first, but now the sound is cutting out intermittently at the tiniest movement of the headphone jack, which makes the sound quality for my commute on public transit especially poor."
1738,3.0 out of 5 stars,"[AESTHETICS & FIT] Rating (Out of five stars): ★★★
I ordered the color Color: Grey/Mint. The earpads have too much yellow in them so these look dirty. I would say the color is more accurately described as seaweed. One of the earpads, out of the box, has a split stitch. I suspect the rest of the stitching will be affected by this one broken stitch over time. The material around the outside of the earpads is painted to look metal but it's plastic. The headband is adjustable and comfortable to me. I don't feel too much pressure on my head or ears and I have a fairly big head.

[SOUND QUALITY] Rating (Out of five stars): ★★★★
The instrumentals have good surround sound quality. The vocals are clear and only low-quality music has audio trailing or echoing in these headphones. (Self-produced YouTube artists have lower production quality and it's easily picked up in these headphones.) I was satisfied with the acoustics, vocals, and instrumentals.

[BASS] Rating (Out of five stars): ★★★
The bass is flat. It's not non-existent but it's not seismic. The lack of bass is distracting to me, personally, because I enjoy a rich seismic bass. My ears are looking for that quality, and it affects my ability to enjoy the music.

[NOISE CANCELLING & BLEEDING] Rating (Out of five stars): ★★★★
Noise cancelling in these is as good as can expected for the price. The louder you play the audio the better it conceals outside noises. The earpads don't appear to buffer out much themselves. There's no noise bleeding, though, which is important if you're listening to music around others.

[CONTROLS] Rating (Out of five stars): ★★★★
These have inline control but there's little functionality. There's nothing to pause, play or skip music. There's a volume slider but it's really hard to control. As in, it adjusts the volume too much with little in between. I prefer to use my device's volume control. As is, I have no use for the controls. I typically don't like braided cords because they create transfer noise while I workout. This cord, however, is the exception to that. I can workout without hearing the movement of the cord through the headphones.

[SUMMARY] Overall Rating (Out of five stars): 18 out 25 Stars *3.6* Star Average ★★★
For the price, these are okay. If you're an audiophile or have discerning taste, I wouldn't recommend these. These are best for kids, tweens, teenagers, and any adult looking for a cheap solution. This won't break the bank if you lose or break them. They work well enough to do the job but don't offer a high-quality music experience.

1739,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far they are working good. My daughter love them.
1740,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves these.
1741,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Can be folded, put on the luggage is very convenient"
1742,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A good set of headphones for the kids. They really enjoyed it. The earpiece does get hot during long hours of usage but that is to be expected. It is lightweight enough for them to toss around and can fold easily into their backpack or storage bins. Sound quality is as good as headphones costing twice times as much, I would say on par with $40 sets of headphones. Construction seems to be above average, with a solid connection from the headphone cable. The pause and volume buttons on the cable work quite well for Ipads which the kids love and they can pause their youtube with it."
1743,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The item arrived in perfect condition, a color that's cute and at a great price. This is a Christmas gift so I won't know how well it functions until end of year."
1744,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The work nicely and I love the color. The silver part is made of some sort of cheap plastic material though, so they do look a bit cheap. But if you just need comfortable headphones in a nice color these are great."
1745,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My grandson wanted these for his birthday. He just loves them, and has thanked me for them many times."
1746,3.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great for a month. Not working so well now.
1747,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have great style, the recipient loved it, but noted that the headband in a bit inflexible and makes wearing this item for a long time difficult."
1748,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. I love that I can control that volume on the wire instead of having to reach in my pocket to get my ipod out. Will buy more for my kids.
1749,4.0 out of 5 stars,These were a gift for my 12 year old sister. She loves them! They seem to be good quality for the price.
1750,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them they work great and down out my boyfriend's rage gaming. They are super comfy and fit in my purse perfectly.
1751,3.0 out of 5 stars,I was very unhappy with them. The wires broke with one week. The wire broke by the ear and then microphone quit wotking. I have a 2nd pair that the same thing is happening
1752,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product.
1753,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headset was purchased for a preteen. It was a perfect fit of cost and quality.
1754,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a teacher of a large classroom of third graders in an inner city school. I created a project on Donorschoose to receive funding for a set of headphones for the technology that I have gotten for my classroom. Although they are very pretty and my students were so happy t receive them, they began breaking within the first two months of use. At this point, we have had 6 pairs of headphones that no longer work due to the same problem (no sound will play). This was a great price and look great but their durability is horrible. I could see that maybe one or two would break, but they are all broken in the same way. Very disapointing and will not order them again."
1755,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the color. Sound quality is adequate for this price. Highly recommended for young ones. Would make a great Christmas gift.
1756,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty, easy to use. I like the pause button and volume on the cord."
1757,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They worked fine for about a week, then they just stopped working. I can’t hear anything anymore"
1758,5.0 out of 5 stars,This a great product. Bought it for my 7y.o. and she loves it...
1759,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work great.
1760,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You get what you pay for..volume control don't work, it is ether off or on very loud, no control over headphone. would send back b ut not worth the trouble."
1761,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap Headphones, They stop working after 4 weeks of use. Sound quality not that great. Don't Buy!"
1762,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well for the kids in the car, they listen to theirs and i now have quiet. Is nice"
1763,4.0 out of 5 stars,They work great. They are light on my head.
1764,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these headphones for my son for when he is playing his xbox so the rest of the world doesnt have to listen. He said they work great for him :)
1765,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived quickly and looks like we had hoped!
1766,5.0 out of 5 stars,They look great and are packaged well. I don't know how they work as they are a gift.
1767,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good! Perfect service, one of my headphones don't work well, they shipped me a new one quickly. My son likes it very much."
1768,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are so sturdy and beautiful.

1775,5.0 out of 5 stars,Item as promised. Would buy from again. Thx!
1776,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great to the price. Love the color!
1777,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter adores these. They work well and are the right color.
1778,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are the perfect size and adjustable. It was an added bonus to have the volume control on the cord for this price. They fit well around the ears without putting too much pressure on them. I'm glad I took the chance and bought them. I plan on getting more for my kids when they have a discount again.
1779,4.0 out of 5 stars,i like it
1780,5.0 out of 5 stars,My niece loved this
1781,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable my wife likes alot
1782,5.0 out of 5 stars,They were perfect. My daughter loves them.
1783,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very lovely headphone, would recommend it"
1784,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought them for my brothers birthday he loved it. I tried them myself and plan on getting one soon myself
1785,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super nice very good quality
1786,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I needed
1787,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect
1788,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great price, just as described!"
1789,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphone for price paid
1790,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very pleased with the quality. Also purchased the Ailihen Bluetooth, so glad to finally find a good product, thank you!"
1791,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these headphones for my girlfriend, Misunderstood that she wanted noise cancelling and that she wasn't going to even listen to music... BUT, these are nice headphones for the price. They have their own volume slider, and can get pretty loud. They may not have noise cancelling, but when you have the music on, I seriously couldn't hear anyone talking around me, so to me that was good enough. They fold nicely, and have a satisfying click when they fold up, but aren't crazy hard to close either. All in all they are great headphones."
1792,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and great for being portable and noise blocking. Only thing is the volume switch is a slide and if it's in the all the way up position when you plug them in you can't put your volume up any further would prefer buttons.
1793,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pair of headsets is an absolute steal for the price. For my purpose (using them at home to watch TV without disturbing others), these work wonderfully. They are good quality and comfortable.!"
1794,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good bit great, and they are comfortable and fold down nicely. Great quality considering the price."
1795,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 9 year old loves it. He listens to audio books on his iPad and pause button works out perfectly for him.
1796,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great packaging and headphones - got them on sale and feel like I got a steal! Love the real color of them as well.
1797,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these recently and for the most part, like them. I wanted something that I can plug into my phone or computer so that I can listen to music or an audio book without disturbing others. I find the ear parts to be a little too tight sometimes. I am happy though due to the price and they are nicely constructed. The volume control is quite handy."
1798,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for a child and they work okay. The ear pad covers fall off constantly which is annoying.
1799,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my 5 y.o. girl to use in school. I purchased it because of the fun colors offered, the affordability and it was being sold by a reputable source. It is adjustable, the cord is an appropriate length, and it worked for her. It stopped working within four months. So the durability is within average but product longevity was below average."
1800,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great so far.
1801,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound and very comfortable
1802,5.0 out of 5 stars,"cool poo lol but it is cool
k done"
1803,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones look nice, work great and have a decent fit but the ""hinges"" where you can fold them up looks poorly designed. These would be ok for an adult if they were a careful person bit definitely not for children."
1804,5.0 out of 5 stars,They're super cute and work great!
1805,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can not hear very loud then the wire broke..
1806,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great 👍🏻
1807,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gift for my granddaughter--thrilled her!
1808,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not at all comfortable and terrible sound quality.
1809,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gave as a gift and am still receiving thank yous!
1810,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent, very comfortable."
1811,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
1812,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for my son. He absolutely loves these. He trys to find reasons to wear them. He is 5, now if I could get something to get him to stop talking to the shows!!!"
1813,5.0 out of 5 stars,practical
1814,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT PODUCT
1815,5.0 out of 5 stars,Such an amazing product! Works so well. Best headphones i have owned
1816,5.0 out of 5 stars,
1817,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
1818,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great thanks you guys are best
1819,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
1820,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its beautiful...awesome i love it!!!
1821,3.0 out of 5 stars,I did give this as a gift to someone else they love the style and sound.
1822,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is such a nice product to have as I travel alot and is comfortable and private for the plane. Light weight and great sound.
1823,2.0 out of 5 stars,one side stopped working within 1 month
1824,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well it just so happens that I don’t have one problem with this.
1825,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
1826,5.0 out of 5 stars,These have a great sound and great style. My only complaint is that they can press my earring into my ears.
1827,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke in first montj of use
1828,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Students love the style and functionality.
1829,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just as described nice compact design.
1830,1.0 out of 5 stars,the wire inside got damaged with use of a few week even though the outside remain good as new.
1831,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The headband on the product is too tight and uncomfortable. It hurts the top of my head despite adjustments. I would suggest using more padding. I cant even get my resilient kids to wear it at all. Also, it would be nice if there was noise cancellation feature."
1832,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to give 'em away as a gift. Not adjustable and too big for my head.
Sure liked the looks of them and wish that it said it was one size only."
1833,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn't even last a month and half. So disappointed to buy a product and not be able to return it.
BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!"
1834,5.0 out of 5 stars,Judi
1835,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work just fine for my grandkids.
1836,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are junk. My daughter can hear music, but not the words when she listens to songs. She has to hold the wire a particular way to try to hear the words. I would return them if she hadn't thrown the packaging away as soon as she got them."
1837,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Cute headphones but I wouldn't call them quality. Good bang for the buck though! I absolutely love the braided cord and the way they fold together. The volume toggle is very touchy and the microphone is sub par, but I didn't order them for the microphone."
1838,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is a little bit tinny, but they are sturdy and they work just fine for my son."
1839,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work great! They are cute and functional...what more could you want?
1840,1.0 out of 5 stars,They've stopped working after 2 months. Very disappointed.
1841,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is so great, plus even without music playing you can't hear people talking to you."
1842,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son absolutely loves these. I am very happy with the quality. Wish I could have purchased more than 1 pair!!
1843,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke within hours of opening the package. Have had no luck reaching customer service for returns. I really am disappointed. Something like this should last longer than one day!
1844,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this for our 4 year old granddaughter. Works, fits, and sounds just fine :)"
1845,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap, great sounding pair of headphones"
1846,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones were the perfect thing for my husband. He loves them and they work great.
1847,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good. My son loves them!"
1848,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound for the price.
1849,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were delivered on time, they work great, and fit well. I like that they're foldable too so they take up less space when not in use."
1850,5.0 out of 5 stars,got it for a 12yr old boy bday gift and he has it on all the time and said its soo much better quality and can't hear outside noise! lol
1851,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These completely broke within the first six months (first the right ear was out for a while, and I just lost the left yesterday). Not durable. I would reference my warranty but I'm out of the states and I'm not sure that would work anyway. :/"
1852,1.0 out of 5 stars,My son had these for about a week. The jack broke off. I do not recommend
1853,4.0 out of 5 stars,The teal/mint gray color scheme is pretty. Sound quality is ok. Be warned that there is sound leakage and the people around you will most likely hear whatever you're playing. It's comfortable sitting over the ears and it's a good headset for the price. I plan to travel with it.
1854,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are perfect. They drown out all noise from my coworkers and have easy controls. The soft cord around wire makes it harder for any breaking/obstruction to occur.
1855,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My headphones don't work after one month, I am very unhappy, the first month the headphones worked great from there the whole thing has been a bust"
1856,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Looks great. Color and all. Feels very comfortable. The sound was okay. I had it hooked to my equipment. That may have been the difference. Maybe they will sound better in my phone. I plugged the jack into a headphone (jack) adapter to go into my Mixer. I had to fight to get it in.
But for the money, it's worth it. Again, feels comfortable and the color is beautiful. It's worth the money."
1857,5.0 out of 5 stars,"decent sound for being a cheaper headphones. works with xbox one, fits over my 9 year olds ears just fine"
1858,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter got a pair of these for Christmas. The cord broke off and got stuck inside the tablet by mid-January. We sent them back to the company, and seeing it wasn't our fault, they sent her a new pair. Those broke within a month and a half that she got them. This time, the sound just slowly cut off. The headphones work great for the first 2 months you have them"
1859,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good looking and the sound from them is very good for the price. However they are extremely uncomfortable as the back of the earpiece presses harder against your ear then the front. If you happen to wear glasses as I do, it’s even worse, couldn’t wear these for longer than ten minutes before having to take them off."
1860,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use these all the time and wore them on a plane for almost 12 hours straight and other than my ears getting hot they worked great. My only complaint being that the cups are just ever so slightly too small for my ears so it can be hard to keep my ears from getting cramps. Other than that they work great and I love the sound quality.
1861,3.0 out of 5 stars,They work. The sound quality isn't as good as my apple earbuds. The volume control is really small so it's easy to accidentally blow your ears out. The ear cups do little to block out outside noise.
1862,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones. The adjustable volume control on the plug wire is a great feature. They are comfortable to wear and fold when not in use. Great product.
1863,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones, the sound quality is fabulous. The volume and controls work great. I absolutely love the mint green color. These are my favorite pair of headphones to watch movies on my iPad"
1864,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice,clear sound with these! :) I actually had to turn my PC down as the old ones were crummy."
1865,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price these are awesome... would buy again for sure... great quality and they sound great
1866,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought them in February for my son he loves the color and for me and mom they work great when in restaurants and my son is playing with our Tablet . We have had them for about six months and they just started not working I'm about to contact AiliHen to see if they will stand by there warranty. I think they will we do like them!!
1867,2.0 out of 5 stars,I was excited to receive these for my son. The sound quality and look were great. They were also comfortable for him to wear. My frustration is that they started to fall about with only a month of use. When I looked into possibly exchanging them I was given the prompt that I missed the window for a return. I don't want a return. I want a product that will last more than a month.
1868,4.0 out of 5 stars,I needed some cheap new headphones to listen to online course study and to play games in my spare time. Working out great for the price.
1869,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I’m not sure what I expected for $20 but I got what I paid for. Cheap plastic housings create a tinny, hollow backdrop for a completely 2-dimensional sonic disappointment. If you think these are going to be acceptable for anything but video games or podcasts, think again."
1870,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are awesome. I listen to them in the office and they are loud only to me. I love them so much I bought 3 others for my children.
1871,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These broke within the first two weeks of using them. It started with one of the ear pieces not working, then with a little manipulating with the cord, it would work. then the wire just came out of the ear piece. No way to fix. Not happy with this at all."
1872,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work great. These were for a person that is hard of hearing and they work great for him.
1873,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Cute headphones but I wouldn't call them quality. Good bang for the buck though! I absolutely love the braided cord and the way they fold together. The volume toggle is very touchy and the microphone is sub par, but I didn't order them for the microphone."
1874,5.0 out of 5 stars,"excellent product for the money love the color , I use these for my job taking calls. crystal clear no static. love these ."
1875,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was a GREAT success with my 14 year old grandson! He was thrilled! Would buy again!
1876,4.0 out of 5 stars,Item was purchased for my son..Was really surprised and the sound quality if the headphones.
1877,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality headphones: nice sound, good material, the cord is really sturdy. They hurt my ears a little bit when I wear them for a while, but most headphones do (i have weird ears?) so I wouldn't hold that against them. I really like the color and style so it's worth it."
1878,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good fit with adjustable sizing. Cute for the granddaughter. Good sound for use with her tablet.
1879,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Received these March 26, 2017. Worked real well for the few months actually used. Seemed sturdy. The fit was pretty good. Sound was good. Actually started using in July. Only used these with my cell phone at night before sleep. Unfortunately they broke completely last night. First the right ear lost sound a few days ago then last night Sept 4, the other ear quit. Would have given 5 star rating if they hadn't died."
1880,1.0 out of 5 stars,"While the sound quality is fine, the speaker wire doesn't appear to hold up. The sounds started fading out of one speaker after a month of mild use, and then the other speaker shortly after that. The only way to get sound was to move the wire around, but it would be scratchy, until eventually they didn't work at all."
1881,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. Nice and lightweight and work great. I use them for a keyboard, so wasn't interested in wifi and just wanted some well-fitting headphones. My head is small and most are too big and too heavy. These are light and fit great and are comfortable and the colors are a bonus. I did have to buy an adapter for the larger keyboard connection, but that was expected."
1882,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these for a few weeks now and I love them. They are by no means high quality in terms of sound, the headphones themselves or the microphone, but for the price they are exactly what I was expecting and work well for me. I just wanted a pair of decent headphones that would have similar quality as my $10 earbuds but not hurt my ears (or my wallet) and these deliver. Plus I really like the way they look.

It seems that after some use, the mechanism that snaps the band into place when unfolding is not as strong as it was when I first got them. Sometimes if I'm just holding them and move a certain way, they will start to fold again. Could just be some rough housing on my part. Either way, folding and unfolding still works just fine.

I would definitely recommend these for anyone looking for a cheap but usable set of headphones. Obviously, if high quality sound is what you're looking for, you shouldn't even be reading this page. If all you're looking for is something that doesn't sound completely garbage and is affordable, then these are probably the headphones for you."
1883,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones accomplished just what I needed. They fit well, can be adjusted, block out unwanted noise, provide reasonable sound quality, fold up for easy storage and the cord is not crap.
I am happy with this purchase after using it for a few months every night when I go to sleep and very often in the afternoon to just relax and listen. I've used it in my CD player, my computer and my Android phone."
1884,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The product was just like it was advertised and exactly as in the pictures! I LOVE the color and the design above most of the other headphones!

The only problem is the size of the ear cushions. They cover all of your ear but they do a little pressure over them since they rest on top of the ear ...so every couple of hours I have to take them off for a while to give my ears a rest because they hurt a bit. :(

They are NOT noise cancelling headphones, but they help to muffle outside noise. I bought them to help me cope with a construction that has been going on outside my house and when I put music in decent levels (I don't like high volumes), it covers up most of the noises! I still hear very sharp/loud noises but they are very hard to muffle.

The sound quality is clear and good! I really like them! I've had no problem with sound quality. The volume control works perfectly well and is a bit sensitive which gives you a good range of volumes. I haven't tried the microphone yet, but I'll write an update as soon as I try it.

I would definitely recommend them for a good on-budget buy! Very good value for $20. It kind of exceeded expectations, except for the ear cushions which are a bit uncomfortable."
1885,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Headphones for price & comfort. Nice and snug cover over my ears with a durable feel cord that does not tangle. Have not utilized the mic as yet - but figure that is always a possibility during my next game day. Might just have to buy another color of these to bring to work for a better listen than I have now with my other brand.
1886,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought them as part of an Easter basket. They use them with their iPod, singing songs from YouTube, and while playing games on the computer. The volume control is great the microphone are a smart addition. the colours choices are awesome. I do not know who loves them more me or them. My only concern is the longevity of the sound within the headphones but fingers crossed this will work out. So far no issues!! The customer service was very personable as the company followed up after I purchased them to make sure everything was working. I would definitely buy from this company again"
1887,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these to use for Webinars, speaker works great. Nice quality, cute color, fit well. The bonus is that I love using them to listen to music on my iPad and the sound quality is excellent with a nice bass to high range"
1888,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't expecting much when I replaced my Bose bluetooth headphones with these, but for what you pay they are pretty decent quality. Nothing special, but definitely listenable. Haven't made a call with them yet so I can't speak to the mic quality, but I'm sure it's fine. If you are looking for a budget set of headphones, look no further."
1889,4.0 out of 5 stars,"overall these are a great value.. I bought them to leave at my desk at work as opposed to leaving beats on my desk overnight. I mentioned the beats a point of comparison. These are light weight and feel good on the head, but they just don't feel as solid. The main reason for the point drop is because of the mic quality. I do use them frequently for webex meetings and I am often told to speak up. That said, for this price point I would recommend them to a friend or some random person taking the time to read this."
1890,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I probably should have done more research, but I purchased these to wear outside while running. The wind noise is unbearable! But wearing them on the treadmill is fine. The color is really pretty though!"
1891,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphone, very soft and feel very comfortable. My son loved them. And they are light weight"
1892,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty cool color and it stands out. Great quality and used it on an international flight. Great price too!
1893,5.0 out of 5 stars,My loves these headphones. She plugs them into her laptop to listen to her homework online.
1894,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter raves about these headphones... she says the sound quality is amazing and she loves the color
1895,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did buy it for my wife and she is very happy with it.
it's a great head phone and I'll buy again."
1896,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It's too big for my head and it hurts my ears which have a lot of earrings. Normally headphones like this don't bother me because the hole for the ear where the speaker is is normally big enough, but the speaker area is a bit small in that regard and pushes against my earrings. I wouldn't suggest if you have earrings, especially cartilage ones."
1897,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just what I was looking for
Fits comfortably. Sound is clear; no outside interference"
1898,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased to test for my supervisor to listen to employees call recordings. So far so good, I have received all good feedback. Supervisors can hear clearly and the large ear muffs drown out the background noise. They are easily adjustable to fit different head sizes."
1899,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality for price. 14 yr old son loves these. He says the sound quality is excellant and loves that he can also use them to talk to his friends over his XBoX. Only thing that would make it better would be a zipping travel case.
1900,1.0 out of 5 stars,They look like nice headphones but my son had these less than a month and they've stopped working.
1901,1.0 out of 5 stars,No stars. Got them at Christmas and no longer working by Valentines Day. Would not buy again. Disappointed in them.
1902,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones fit nicely and are comfortable.The color is pretty. The mic seems to work well. The sound isn't as good quality I had hoped but they work decently and will continue to use them.
1903,3.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones sound great. Bought them for my son for Christmas and he loves them. Unfortunately one side stopped working after 2 months. The wire for the left side broke near the jack.
1904,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product. It is not too bulky. One of the downside is though that if you have your music turned up loud, it's not noise canceling."
1905,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon: Once again Great Deal, Great Quality and a decent price. Very happy with my purchase and would recommend for a pre teen child for Ipod, phone, or tablet use.

R, Navarro"
1906,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones feel quite heavy and my kids are unable to use them since they find it very uncomfortable. WIsh I had not bought 3 pairs without trying one but I read the reviews and took a chance. Not happy with the purchase unfortunately
1907,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are a glasses wearing person like myself, the pressure from the headphones starts to feel uncomfortable after some time. Mostly used for work so perfect sound quality isn't needed, these get the job done for the price. Would recommend for recreational use."
1908,5.0 out of 5 stars,We got these for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them. They fit great and sound great!
1909,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just what I expected---and that's a good thing! Very light, good sound, can answer my phone while listening to a book. I walk two miles everyday, no problem hearing traffic."
1910,5.0 out of 5 stars,these are for my daughter and she is 9. they fit her perfect and she loves the color.
1911,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these to use at work. These were inexpensive and was not expecting anything great. When I opened them, i immediately loved the color. They are more of teal shade than mint. The sound quality is excellent. Once these go on, I hear nothing but my music. I drowns out all office noise & chatter and once a fire alarm. Very happy with my purchase."
1912,1.0 out of 5 stars,We are still looking for good quality headphones at a reasonable price. We tried Ailihen C8 but they lasted two weeks of daily use. Now the headset produces no sound unless the jack is wiggled.
1913,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones! I actually bought two pairs: One for myself, and then another pair for my boyfriend after I tried them out (that should tell ya somethin'). I was very surprised by the sound quality, it was honestly better than I expected (nice range, great bass). Of course, these can't compare to the $100 and up headphones you might buy elsewhere, but for the price, definitely worth it!!"
1914,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect design, comfortable and nice sound out of them! My daughter loves them!"
1915,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter is over the color pink and wanted some teal headphones and it looked like these would be perfect for her. And so we ordered them, they came on time and she loves them. She says the ear piece is comfortable. And they work well."
1916,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought as a gift for my grandson. He is happy with them and has made no complaints, so good deal!"
1917,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones had great sound quality but they started hurting your ears after about 20 mins. Also, something broke in the cord and that made it so only one ear speaker could play. Okay for the price but you might want to spend more money on something that will last longer."
1918,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good sound quality, especially for the price. I love that they fold up and can travel in my bag. They are comfortable, and the rubber inside the head strap thing keeps them from slipping off my head, but after using for a couple of hours, they make the tops of my ears hurt. Maybe I'm using them for too long at once, or maybe I just have big ears. Either way: very good!"
1919,5.0 out of 5 stars,They fit great! Music sounds great in them. I love that they fold up for easy way to transport them or even just to put them away.
1920,5.0 out of 5 stars,these headphones work awesome. I especially love the cord it is a cloth cord which helps in not tangling. love the color looks exactly like the picture and the sound is great.
1921,1.0 out of 5 stars,These were a gift for my grandson. He no sooner plugged the ear piece into his ipod and the end came off in the ipod. We don't know how to get it out of the ipod. If I send them back can I get them replaced? Other than that they seemed very nice. My grandson liked them but they broke right away.
1922,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The package came very dirty, the box was semi flatten... and the tapes to seal box was not shut tight, looked like it was a return product. The padding's color was not bright, looked used. I am upset about it, but my daughter needed it right away to do her computer tests in school so I couldn't return it. Wish they would do a quality check before they shipped to customers."
1923,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They worked good for about a month. Now, they've started making a buzzing sound and the volume is very low no matter how much it's turned up. It also restarts my daughter's phone when you plug it into the phone jack. I am unable to return it now. My daughter spent her Christmas money on it, so she's pretty disappointed."
1924,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are comfortable, sound quality is decent. And the microphone works great with phone calls, love the color and style of them."
1925,5.0 out of 5 stars,I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.I STRONGLY RECCOMEND THESE.
1926,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them light weight so not at all heavy on my head...volume is adjustable on the headphones. Very pretty color too.
1927,5.0 out of 5 stars,"very light and comfortable. Can hardly tell they are on your ears.
Quick delivery and a good value."
1928,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality. Got this for my nephew as a gift to go with his MP3 player.
1929,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones fro a great seller. I bought two pairs of these and my boys love them. Highly recommend for ages 8 and up. They were delivered quickly and came very well packaged.
1930,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, but the ear parts are at an awkward angle so it hurts my ears after ~1 hour. Overall , I'm satisfied, just wish the ears were adjustable."
1931,2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones were great! Except for the fact they stopped working only after about a month. The part of the cord that plugs into your device must be positioned just perfectly or the music won't play through both speakers. Definitely no good at the gym. Disappointed because I really liked these!
1932,1.0 out of 5 stars,"headphones started out well, but 3 months in and one side doesn't work anymore. cheap garbage. I would attempt to fix it but I don't see any way to disassemble them. Apparently you really do get what you pay for."
1933,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They look great and sound OK when they work properly, but the build quality stinks. With less than a single day of use, the speaker in the ear cup that has the wire attached began to crackle with the slightest movement. I determined that the connection at the in-line volume control was the problem. These are getting returned."
1934,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I order a pair of these last year for my son, and while I wish they had lasted longer the 12months I did not mind buying another pair. They are EXCELLENT!!"
1935,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the headphones nice clear sound and bass the cord is very durable and long and having volume control is a +
1936,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these last week after my trusty earphones bit the dust. Honestly, the only drawback is the fact that they fold; the headphones don't quite come down far enough to cover my ears all the way. Not even mad about it though; they work well for the price."
1937,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good and lightweight. Sound quality is good. They do get pretty warm the longer you wear them, although fair warning this is the first non-earbuds I've worn for as long as I can remember, so take that with a grain of salt. Also, the cord is particularly long, maybe too long for most, but I'd take that over the other extreme for sure. I use them with an MP3 player, they work great. I would recommend them for sure."
1938,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible item, lots of static for no reason too small for my little ears. I thought after reading the reviews I would get a great deal NOT!

Don't waste your money folks,"
1939,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've only had these a short time but so far they seem to be a fine product.
1940,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is terrible. Earphones don't trap sound. Ear pieces don't even fit head or ears properly.
1941,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for the price. Sound quality could be better but again, good for the $"
1942,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Product arrived in time in fantastic shape. I like that the cord is protected by this braided fabric type stuff. Sound is great. My only problem so far is the size of the part that goes on your ears. They don't surround the ear, but put a tiny bit of pressure on the ear and after about an hour my ears hurt so I keep ear buds on me as well when I travel so I can switch them out when they start hurting."
1943,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones broke in the first week of use. The sound was not so great, but then only one side of the headphones worked. My son feels so disappointed. A bad product."
1944,4.0 out of 5 stars,"At first the connection from the wired in volume control seemed loose, but after finding my preferred setting I haven’t really had an issue. They have great sound and are comfortable to wear on the ears and around the neck. I took them on 15 hours worth of flights! They made it, and fit inside my carry on. For the price, definitely worth the buy."
1945,5.0 out of 5 stars,"very good, fits head nice and is comfortable and has good sound and great service."
1946,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and one side stopped working 6 months later. Extremely disappointed, she LOVED them when they worked."
1947,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken within 2 months - can't return. Don't waste your money buy a better pair
1948,5.0 out of 5 stars,This headphone is perfect. No complaints. Fast shipment and I love the price. Thank you.
1949,1.0 out of 5 stars,Second time I used them the ear cushion came off and now I am unable to use them. There is no way to get it back on.
1950,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter for her piano class. She loved the way they looked and initially they worked well, but they quit working just outside of the return window."
1951,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never write reviews, but these headphones deserve it. My older daughter got a pair of Beats for Christmas and ever since, her younger sister has been begging for a pair. Not wanting to spend that kind of money on an 8 year old, I decided to give these a try. We couldn't be more impressed! They are the best pair for the money. I'm actually shocked they were so inexpensive because they rival a quality pair. You won't be disappointed"
1952,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headset was just what I was looking for. Very compact when folded and the sound was great on the plane. Very good purchase.
1953,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really debated to get this or not but after reading mostly good reviews I decided why not and bought a pair for the holidays for my tween- Just stopped working 2 months in -crickets that's what you hear nothing, nada, zip - Not to mention that the silver is really painted plastic not really metal! What's most upsetting is that my daughter really loved these and well now all I can do is warn other parents. Don't do what I did-instead spend a bit more for a better known brand that won't do this! Absolutely disappointed! I'm hoping amazon rectifies this as I bought 2 of the same brand different style and both stopped working within a week from each other :/"
1954,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great! I love the way they fold. Have used for a few trips and have had no problems.
1955,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Initially, the headphones worked wonderfully. On day 2, the sound coming through the HD microphone became very static, and we are unable to stop it. Disappointing."
1956,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These were great headphone on the way to our vacation but by the time we got off the plane, one earpiece of foam was missing already. I only have older kids so not sure how it fell off already... was very frustrating because we didn’t come home for a month and by then it was too late to return the broken item."
1957,5.0 out of 5 stars,my son loves these.. they suit his PC gaming needs just fine and he thinks they look cool too.
1958,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is terrible.
1959,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These were great at first. Gorgeous color. Comfy. Braided cord was great. All in all, I thought they were a solid purchase. Fast forward a month and a half and the headphones barely work. If I don't have the cord a certain way, the sound cuts out completely. Pointless to buy if they're only going to work for a month and then you have soundless headphones."
1960,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am very happy with these headphones. Wonderful product. I got them for my daugther to keep her own in her classroom. She loves them and I will be getting more for the whole family.
1961,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Only used them for a few days, but they feel great and work well. I have not used the mic but the audio is better then most. I think I got these for around $20. If you find headphones for less then that they are usually pretty poor quality. These are a good value at twice the price."
1962,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these for my daughter who needed headphones for school. The price for these were nice and I trusted the reviews when I got these. My daughter love the colors. We will see about the longevity of this item and will update my review and rstings as needed.
1963,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These work as advertised. They are really light, foldable as mentioned, and have decent sound quality for the price. I use these at work to bang tunes to drown out the distractions and my son uses these to play on his Xbox."
1964,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones!!! I use them when I workout and run and they are the most comfortable headphones I've ever had. My workouts sometimes last a few hours and these are weightless, snug, and have perfect cushion and support. I would buy this product and recommend it over and over again!!"
1965,1.0 out of 5 stars,First pair broke after my son wore them a couple of times. Ordered a second pair and they broke as well. I give up. This is a poor product.
1966,4.0 out of 5 stars,Even though they were described for kids they are still pretty big. These. Were bought for grandchild for school.
1967,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good headphones for the price. Package came in great condition. If i had to compare the sound, i would say they are basic just like the earphones that come with your iPhone. Great for listening to music and talking on the phone as well. Just make sure when you get them you put the volume all the way up on the actual headphones."
1968,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally headphones that don't squeeze my head like a Facehugger.
1969,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the headphones! I use them for work and personal use. Love the color, color is exactly as described. Fit perfectly. I have tried several other headphones, but these are by far my favorite. I work as a medical transcriptionist, they block out background noise and have a great sound quality. Best price out there! Very, very satisfied!"
1970,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These break almost immediately with minimal use. I contacted the seller after the first one started working and then not working depending on how I held the cord. They replaced it. The replacement pair is now breaking in the exact same way. I want a refund, honestly."
1971,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this as a Christmas present. It seemed to work well for a couple of weeks but then we had problems with the sound. Suddenly completely stopped working. We tried a couple of different devices but no luck. These will be returned.
1972,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is great! Love that I can answer my phone with the headphones. Only downfall is I wish I could get them a little tighter. Maybe I have a small head because they fit hubby fine.
1973,2.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loved them. But the whole foamy part that rests on her ear came unglued in two days. Can if be re glued. Probably. My husband is checking. I was just disappointed that they didn't last more than a couple days.
1974,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are great headphones, but do get uncomfortable after a short amount of time. I like the color. The wire that runs from the headphones is a little annoying since it is a fabric cord wire, and it gets tangled easily."
1975,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Had this product for about 20 days before they stopped working entirely. I don't feel like I was particularly hard on the headphones or the cord, but within two weeks the right side only worked if the cord was held in a specific place and just today both sides died on me. To contrast, I paid $20 for my last pair of headphones and they've lasted more than a year and still work. Very disappointed."
1976,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't mind my brothers face…😂, The color was exactly what I was expecting, it's a little brighter, but it looks great, but it completely stopped working after two months,and I didn’t even use it that much,so yeah..that sucks"
1977,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound quality and comfortable to wear. I didn't know what expect. These are great for the money. The fit and finish feels cheap but i assure you these are great headphones. I have had good quality sound. I even dropped them a free times and the sound is all good.
1978,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for my 15 yr son to game with. He says the sound is ""perfection"". He'said happy and I don't have to hear all the gaming battles so I'm happy too!"
1979,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
Good mic even when used outside in the wind.
Good sound for music for under U.S. $20.
Shoelace style wire which does not become tangled.

Cons:
Wire stopped working after 2 weeks so returned promptly.
Somewhat uncomfortable wearing over 4 hours per day."
1980,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is an updated review. They DO NOT last long. I'm late in updating this but the headphones went out about 2 months ago and I did not get much use out of them. I took a chance but never again!
1981,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fits a little loosely for my head, so the ear pieces don't sit right on my ears, rather one has a small gap between the padding + ear. Minor annoyance, but they still stay on my head just fine. Volume controls are nice (sits on the cord about breast level) so placement good too."
1982,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice fit very decent sound for the cost. Will have to see how long it lasts. Good shipping/packaging. Positive so far.
1983,4.0 out of 5 stars,"love love love these headphones, they are comfortable and fit well. They do their job well. The sound is good not great, wish I had more control over the settings. But they fit my ears so well. Makes up for other defiencies. Would buy again."
1984,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Item purchased as a gift for my daughter. She seems very happy with them. Item broke in less than 2 weeks. Returned, have not found a suitable replacement."
1985,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really great headphones. I bought the for my son when is second pair of really expensive headphones broke in the exact same spot each time. I refused to once again buy those overpriced headphones and thought I would try these. He loves them. Great sound, same features of more expensive headphones. Would recommend these."
1986,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two pairs for my daughters and they love them! Their older cousins were definitely eyeing them as well. They have great sound range, comfortable fit for tweens and above! Also, you can't beat the price. The quality of the product is solid."
1987,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. Good quality sound. Microphone in cord.
1988,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are of good quality and no regrets on the purchase. However, one of the headphones has an issue with the input jack, it has to be twisted in a certain direction for both sides to work. If it wasn't for that I would give this a 5 *.

I would return it but we went overseas for a vacation and really wanted to use them during the flight..."
1989,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value, they look and sound expensive without the high price tag!"
1990,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was nervous to purchase these as some of the reviews said that the wiring was bad. I have to add the caveat that I only really used them for our trip for 2 weeks. But during that time, I had them folded up, wrapped the chords around them, unwrapped them, etc... lots of times. They worked well for what I needed! I don't like in ear buds and these were comfortable enough to sleep with while wearing. They don't quite cover my ear completely, but almost do!"
1991,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones for my son who is on the autism spectrum and has ADHD. He rides a monitored bus to school every day with other students with disabilities. He recently complained of the noise level on the bus. Changing him to a different bus is not an option and it was suggested for him to use headphones with his phone on the bus. These headphones have done the job we needed for them to do. They block out the sound of the other students and provide good quality sound for him. They are also sturdy enough for his use. I'm very happy with my purchase.
1992,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have started using them and they work great. They seem well-made and are comfortable. Purchase was rather recent, but I will update if they fall apart. Color and appearance match picture. I love that they are foldable. We use them in an office environment for training, so storing them easily is important for me."
1993,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: headphones are lightweight but feel solid. The black and orange color looks great. The photo you see is a great representation of the colors that you get. The sound quality is very clear and very bright. It's a rope type cord that feels good. length is good, quality feels good, nice gold connectors. volume control works well answering phone calls ending phone calls, Button works well. I have an LG L90 phone which is an old phone but I cannot go to the next track it will only let me pause not a big deal. The earpieces swivel up and down so that they sit flat around your ears very comfortable. The folding ear cups is a great space saving feature Works quite nice.
Cons: not enough bass or bottom end. When you have the headphones on there is not quite enough pressure to create a tighter seal around the ears to give a fuller bottom end to the sound. For me this was an easy fix.headphones collapse to fold all you need to do is shove a small wedge in the Gap to keep them from opening all the way you can still collapse um but the wedge prevents them from opening which creates a tight seal around the ear giving you a fuller sound and more Bass. I just cut a piece of velcro put it in the slot now there's plenty of pressure around my ears to keep them tight so I get that full sound and full Bass."
1994,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these! The ear cushions are soft and they really dampen outside sounds. I think these headphones are great (and stylish!).
It also came in a great box (clear front, sealed, gift-worthy). I could easily slap a bow on the package it came in and gift it as-is, that's how nice it looks. :)"
1995,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful headphones. Fit around my ears so they don't feel smushed. The sound is clear and oftentimes I have wondered if i had them properly plugged in because it doesn't feel like you are listening through headphones. When being used they completely cancel out sound around you and give you a surround sound experience.
1996,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality feel and comfort of the headphones, they cover my ears quite comfortably and the sound quality is not a problem at all. The cord is not like those flimsy plastic wires that easily get tangled so I'm never dealing with knots, and the headphones adjust easily to fit over your head without you having to hold it to your ears or anything. It's solid quality, and a great price, and the picture and color match so it's not a case of getting something different to what you're looking at. Highly recommended if you want something other than cheap in-ear headphones that gather dust in your pocket."
1997,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were great when I first got them, I was using them all the time and loving this! Then after about a month or so (so after the 30 days return policy...) one of the sides stopped working. Over the course of another month, the other side slowly stopped working as well and now if only works if I twist the plug in a certain way. All in all, these headphones fake you out into a sense of security for about a month, but as soon as there is no way to get your money back they start breaking. Will not buy again. I thought they might be too good to be true. Will stick with Sony headphones in the future because mine worked well for at least 3 years before one of the sides stopped working. I think they spent most of the budget on looks for these headphones and not much on actual sound quality to lure you in. Sony doesn't look as nice, but at least they work for more than a month."
1998,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the mint color and I must say that they are more of a teal in real life. That said, they are very nice to look at. I love that the cord on these headphones is braided so that it does not get tangled. These headphones are also very good at blocking outside noise and they have very good sound quality, especially for the price."
1999,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones in the start of summer, and fell in love.
The Bass is phenomenal, just as good and better than my Sentey earbuds (which have been through the wash more than once)
They are also stylish, and go with many of my outfits as well as enhance my facial features (Have gotten many comments)
I highly recommend the C8 headphones to all my friends.

My only complaint is the length of the cord, me, being quite short and very active, not to mention forgetful stepped on it all the time.
to prevent this I had to wrap it around my body, which was less than comfortable.

Also, I did not get a warranty card or user manual. Today I stepped on the cord and the jack was bent at a nearly 90 degree angle, I was very upset to find no warranty card in my box as the description lists. I will buy another pair because I love them so much."
2000,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously owned the Amazon Basic headphones so I'll compare it to that

Sound: Amazon
Sound isolation: AILIHEN
Design: AILIHEN
Comfort: Amazon (this is the biggest factor for me, AILIHEN would hurt my ears if worn for more than 30 mins at a time, this may not be a problem for people with smaller ears)
Portability: Equal"
2001,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my headphones! I use them for my online classes, while my husband is watching TV and my four kids are running a muck.t hey sound great. My only issue (which is with all headphones and hats alike) is I have a smaller head then the average person. They are not as snug as I would like, but they are the most comfortable I have found yet."
2002,5.0 out of 5 stars,THese headphones were exactly what I was looking for. THey are light weight and have great sound quality.
2003,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They make sound. The volume slider works, but is interesting. The fold up design is a little strange. Its made of really hard plastic, and the ears aren't to comfortable. Works well for maybe 2 hours, cant wear them much longer than that."
2004,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would recommend having a pair of these head phones for anyone who wants quality of product and sound. The head phones can be adjusted accordingly, and has a fit snug that I don't have to worry about outside noises. The best part is not only the color design, but that it is also collapsible, making it easy to carry around ether on your neck or in your pocket."
2005,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this two months ago, and used it lightly. However, the left side no longer plays any noise."
2006,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought them as a gift so I didn't use them but they came on time and were cute.
2007,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I BROUGHT THEM FOR MY HUSBAND HE JUST LOVE,LOVE THEM THE SOUND IS GREAT."
2008,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! Great sound quality, especially the bass. Volume was excellent also. A good buy!"
2009,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter was a bit disappointed that these would not work on her phone because of her waterproof case. But, she uses it with her Chrome book just find and they are comfortable for her."
2010,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great item high volume quality almost like beats our son love them
2011,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this head phones. Nice padded ear covers and I love that the head band is adjustable. I would recommend it.
2012,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great for a couple months then one side quit working. Disappointed since my daughter loved them and found them ""super stylish."""
2013,5.0 out of 5 stars,this was bought for my 11 year old grandson. he loved the color combo and loved everything about them until our puppy chewed the cord and now they won't work. We will get him another pair of these. Good product.
2014,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Microphone was VERY soft, even when turned to full volume. Colors were very cute, but these didn't last through the school year, which was the goal. It's off to electronic recycling."
2015,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones! They are awesome for music and for phone calls. They are not completely noise cancelling, but I prefer that as it is safer to be able to hear surrounding sounds in the event of emergency."
2016,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough volume.
2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone who loves listening to music, but is not a confirmed audiophile...I find it difficult to quantify headphones correctly. I've owned SHURE phones in the past, and have had a couple of good off-the-shelf pair, but I've never been someone who NEEDS perfection.

So, that said...for the average person who doesn't want to spend a fortune on headphones, these are pretty awesome. They have really good range. You can hear the bass, but it isn't fuzzy and the upper range isn't tinny. They fold nicely, and the joints don't seem like they're weak spots in the design. I really like the cloth braided cord, and the inline mic and volume control is pretty cool too. They feel comfortable on my big head, but still adjust to fit my toddler nicely.

The one thing I don't like, and it's small...is when something is made of plastic but is painted to look like metal...like the rings around the speakers on this pair. Oh well.

I received this product at a discount for an unbiased and honest review. I *did* however buy a second pair for our family at regular price...so I do like them quite a bit."
2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Daughter has used the heck out of these. She really liked them for watching YouTube, Netflix and what not."
2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my grandson for Christmas. As far as I know they work great and he loves them
2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and comfortable. Would definitely purchase again.
2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far my son loves these for the PS4. I had gotten him a different brand that didn't last a month, so we are very happy so far with these."
2022,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had it for about a month or two, I only use it at work at my desk, and it's already broken. The cord is short circuited and only one speaker consistently works now. I would've returned it, but my window closed to return it like 20 days ago. Also, the headphones are so tight that my ears were sore after using for half an hour or so."
2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for my granddaughter and she lives them.
2024,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones with great sound. A little big for my head but that's no problem since I just use them while sitting. The microphone is great & the controls are fantastic and easy to use. The Mike is close to your mouth so folks can hear you without having to hold it up to your mouth. I got the mint\grey & i love the color.
2025,1.0 out of 5 stars,These look good and are comfortable but after only eight weeks of light use there’s no sound on one side. This seems to be a common defect based on the reviews.
2026,4.0 out of 5 stars,not sound proof but descent headphone for the price if you like your base
2027,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have purchased 3 of this companies and they only last about 10 days if that.
2028,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not working :(
2029,5.0 out of 5 stars,They looked good as they were purchased for a church give back for school children in need.
2030,1.0 out of 5 stars,The foam ear parts do not stay on and I have to keep putting them back on every time my son takes the head phones on and off. The plug in bent on our first and only trip. This is not an item that was used for more than 4 hours and it didn't hold up. Unfortunately it's beyond my time to return them or I would have. He's 6 and responsible with electronics. The item simply just isn't well made.
2031,1.0 out of 5 stars,Both pairs of headphones I purchased stopped working after 6 months.
2032,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought them for my daughter and she loves them. She says the sound is great and they are comfortable to wear. She has recommended them to her friends.
2033,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are lightweight but the sound quality is aweful. I'm literally surprised at how bad even for the price.
2034,5.0 out of 5 stars,"comfortable fit, love the color, and most importantly they sound really good."
2035,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my grandson who is visiting for the summer and his olds broke. He loves them and uses them every day. I haven't heard him complain about the sound or the quality.
2036,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality was alright, but it doesn't block out noise entirely. These also only lasted about 2 months before one side stopped working. Kind of a shame that I paid about $20 for 2 months when earphones for $6 lasted over half a year."
2037,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is really nice on this headset, and it blocks out the noise really well. I just have a minor issue with it sliding on my head whenever I move around a lot. I blame this mainly on the fact that I have smaller head. Other than that I would definitely recommend this headset."
2038,2.0 out of 5 stars,One side of the set went dead in 3 months! I have a 2md set & hope this lasts longer.
2039,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ii like them, but noticed that if I unplugged and re-plugged I may not hear anything without turning my phone off than back on."
2040,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great. My grandson loves them. I purchased 3 different pairs and colors so he always has a pair where ever needed.
2041,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones arrived quickly and work great. Sound is good especially for the price. Happy with the purchase.
2042,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for my daughter. She loves them and the color is very bright and pretty. However, ear padding started to tear less than 24 hours of having them."
2043,5.0 out of 5 stars,Son loves them. Nice color and comfortable on the ear.
2044,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for my nephew, he absolutely loves them! Great sound clarity."
2045,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything you need without breaking the bank. Solid sound and a good looking product.
2046,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased two of these, this one broke within a month of purchase."
2047,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones. They are comfortable and the sound quality is pretty great.
2048,5.0 out of 5 stars,A gift for my Grandson!! He loves them!!!!
2049,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great set of headphones, noise cancelling, clear crisp sound."
2050,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not quite as good sound quality as the I35 headphones, but there's a volume slide thing and you can actually skip songs with the button, which is neat. Also blocks out more sound than the I35

I'm not sure if I would pay $20 for it again but it's pretty okay (and I don't want to go through with the hassle of a refund lol)"
2051,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great - my son goes through these things like water.. I am hoping they last longer than a few months... so far so good>
2052,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works really well. My daughter loves this item
2053,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones. The volume is good, and the mic sounds clear and good. I just wish the volume control were buttons instead of a lever."
2054,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is good. Hurt my ears a little after long period of time.
2055,5.0 out of 5 stars,Did not have to wait long for it’s arrival. Really like the way the item folds up.
2056,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are attractive, durable, and life savers when it comes to my boys playing on their Kindles and 3DS's. Definitely a great value!"
2057,3.0 out of 5 stars,Its cute but after a time only 1 side worked
2058,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my 9 year old and she loves them. They fit her head pretty well (collapsed to the smallest size) and are comfortable on her ears. The cord is pretty rugged and they fold up easily for storage. Very happy with the purchase.
2059,2.0 out of 5 stars,While we loved them when we got them 5 days into use the headphone plug bend and almost snapped. So angry about it simply because stuff like that shouldn't happen and it hasn't happened with any other headphones set we ever owned. Lets hope they will still make it through our trip becaue I have no time getting new ones.
2060,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is really good and I received my order faster than I expected. I was hoping I could plug it into my landline phone but unfortunately, it doesn't fit. I'm going to try and find some kind of adapter."
2061,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones work great at canceling out noise and are comfortable to wear. The color (orange) was also appealing due to the fact that I am a student and it is easier to misplace things and with orange, they are easier to locate. The fact that they also fold helps keep my already overflowing backpack neat and organized."
2062,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Considering the price, it exceeded expectations. Comfortable on the ear, great sound quality, and folds up nicely too. Very happy with it so far."
2063,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been looking for a pair of headphones with a good mic that I could use for calls on my Smartphone. It may be too soon to tell but so far all feedback on the other end has been very positive.
2064,5.0 out of 5 stars,We have one pair of these and liked them so much that we ordered this pair!!!
2065,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They are great looking, but these headphones lasted 2 1/2 months."
2066,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased these for my niece for her 10th birthday and she loves them! Very well made and good quality!
2067,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very comfortable and they sound great. I really like that the cord is covered in a tough material so you don't have to worry about tears. They fit my head perfectly which is particularly nice as I've had problems with headphones being a little too tight (and my head is normal sized, presumably)."
2068,1.0 out of 5 stars,Only lasted 2 weeks. Metal piece that plugs into tablet broke off in tablet. Headphones useless and tablet has no sound.
2069,4.0 out of 5 stars,After I bought it i seen that it only works for smartphones so i was a bit concerned but i got it early and used it on my computer and it worked so i'm satisfied with it. I haven't gotten to use it too much since I just got them but so far pretty good.
2070,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and allows great sound while providing ample background reduction.
2071,4.0 out of 5 stars,"We love these, my son uses them for the phone, and to listen to music and they're noise canceling on top of that! Great Find"
2072,5.0 out of 5 stars,They worked great until my dog ate them lol
2073,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones look good and my son seems to like it.
2074,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty, sound is perfect and adjustable, comfortable"
2075,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my 5yr old daughter. They have good sound for her and the price. The color is very pretty. The folding is nice but it feels a little stiff like one of these times it could catch and break...this has not happened though and like I said they are perfect for the price and our application. I’d buy them again.
2076,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and lightweight.
2077,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these yesterday. Ordered to listen to music and movies on my computer. I was pleasantly amazed at the sound quality, appearance, and construction of these headphones."
2078,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kid uses them for gaming and skyping. She loves them. She wanted foldable headphones and says these are great!
2079,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This product has been purchased for a 10 yr. old for Christmas. They look great, but, they are a gift (I have not tried them out for sound quality).
At this time I would say, yes, I would purchase this product again."
2080,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones and really cute
2081,3.0 out of 5 stars,They sound good but they are big in size. And there is no way to make them smaller.
2082,5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect. my kid loves them. the sound is perfect.
2083,5.0 out of 5 stars,"these were a gift to someone else, but came great was a beautiful color, and from what i heard from the person they have great sound quality, and long cord."
2084,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really loud and good bass. It's for my 8 year old so he has to keep the volume down but it does have a very easy volume knob that's really convenient.
2085,3.0 out of 5 stars,OK fit but volume control is on or off. Not much control
2086,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my 10 year old son and he is very happy with them...easy and comfortable to wear and he thinks the sound is great.
2087,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, works and looks great. Right as expected."
2088,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product for a great price.
2089,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for my fiancée and he loves them! He said sound is good and works when we travel. Love how they fold and easy to pack (also bought case for them).
2090,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Although the headphones arrived quickly and nicely packaged after using them for three days I really can't use them. They keep sliding off my head, the button is terrible to use and the sound quality horrible. Completely tinny and no bass to speak of. All and all a waste of time and money."
2091,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is fine for my needs and the headphones are comfortable. The cord is sturdy and the length is enough to comfortably plug into a PC. However, as an adult female the headphones barely fit me on their smallest setting. I feel like there should be just one more size option"
2092,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super comfy, very durable. I like the volume control on the headphones. They pack easily into my backpack. I ordered one for myself months ago, and they are still great. I just ordered two more recently for my parents. They look good too, so far."
2093,1.0 out of 5 stars,"2nd set in a year
Can't remember what happen first time but this time the plug pulled apart
Had to get pliers to pull out of iPad"
2094,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice headphones, cool color and solid sound."
2095,5.0 out of 5 stars,My mother needed these for her chemo treatment and they are exactly what she was looking for. Arrived earlier than expected and provide great sound and quality!
2096,4.0 out of 5 stars,We got these for my 11 year old daughter. She loved them! The sound is really good and the best part is how long the cord is. You can adjust the sound on the cord. They also fold up which makes them easy to put away or take on a trip.
2097,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received Oct 19th and my
Daughter has only used a handful of times and they are already broken! The sound cuts in and off and we have to mess with the cord into the headset to get it to work. After if she moves her head it cuts back out! Not happy as she has had them a little over a month and we already have to buy a new pair!"
2098,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this headphone set to replace the one I received with my Yamaha Electric piano - mine had worn out. This headset is terrific, rich sound, comfortable to wear! I am very pleased!!!"
2099,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great sound, durable design."
2100,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I appreciate the sturdiness of these headphones. The cable seems to be covered in some material that makes it more durable and less susceptible to internal breakage. I always appreciate a volume control and look for hat feature. What I would change about them is the plastic leather like pads. They do help to muffle external noise but they hold in heat and sweat. Sweaty ears is not my favorite sensation. If the room isn't noisy, just position them slightly off the ear for air flow."
2101,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are affordable with sound quality to match. I bought these for my little sister since she likes to listen to the same song over and over. Despite her leaving them on the floor, kicking them around, and just in general being a kid, they are still in good condition and work just fine. The cord not getting all tangled up and the folding for portability really add to the durability, I think, since my sister likes to bring them everywhere.

My only complaint is purely cosmetic. The colors could maybe have more variety, or just a different set entirely as none of them were particularly nice, at least to my sister and me.

Pros:
-Affordable
-Durable
-Good sound quality for price
-Cord rarely tangles
-Easily packed

Cons:
-Bad colors"
2102,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were a gift and the recipient loved them. After learning how good they were I ordered a pair for myself.
There was one downside. The original purchase included a coupon for a discount if I ordered more that I did not know about until after the second order had been placed.
Not the sellers fault but it would have been nice to know before hand .
Perhaps with the multiple emails from the third party seller wanting feedback for the product this could have been mentioned.
Que Sera Sera"
2103,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones for this price. Now I can listen to my music with disturbing (or being disturbed by) others when I'm working or on the lightrail. The microphone works much better than I had expected for something under $20. This is the second pair that I have purchased because my first pair broke (you could only hear music if you held the cord at a very specific angle) and I didn't know about the lifetime warranty. *facepalm* I'll definitely remember this time!
2104,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am contemplating on purchasing a second pair just cause! I love these headphones. They work great and are a bit noise cancelling but not so much! very comfortable and usually I am the type to have to keep adjusting due to all of my ear piercings but never with these.
2105,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let it be known that I wasn't paid in anyway to write this review (I also wasn't sent the product for free to review it).

For the price, these are pretty great. They are comfortable to wear, have adjustable ear pieces (for bigger/smaller heads), the cord is amazing because of its shoelace-like durable nature, and the color (teal) is poppin'. I like the on-wire controls for volume as they come in handy when you need to turn them down as fast as possible. Oh, and the microphone works swimmingly.

The only thing I find lacking is a good bass sound... But really, for how cheap these were, I can deal. Everything else is pretty sweet.

P.S. As a full-time student who also works a few part-time jobs, it's awesome that these fold up well; I can put them in the top of my backpack and not worry that they'll break."
2106,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have not been impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. There was a short in the 1st pair I bought so one side didn't work. It fell within the warranty period and so were replaced. The same thing happened to the 2nd pair--a short in one side so you cannot hear. Kinda important in a headphone to be able to hear. I have been impressed with the customer service. They noticed the 1st pair still was within the warranty period and sent a replacement.
2107,5.0 out of 5 stars,"so far my 14 yr old hasnt broken them and it has been a 2 weeks! He even brings them to school, and if u knew him you'd understand my excitement!! good sound, fits well, and an added bonus for him is the outside noise blocking- not a bonus for mom ;-) thank you for a good product so far. ..here's to hoping they last longer and i can share the second set u bought as a backup, expecting they'd break."
2108,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these headphones in May. Love the fit and the sound quality. 7 months later now, the sound is cutting out from the right side. Really sad as I use these all the time between my computer and tablet. Will probably buy another pair but might just dish out the money for a wireless set. Rather sad because I really did like these a lot.

Update: After speaking with their customer service (who was very helpful btw!) I will probably just end up ordering a new pair of these same ones as I really do like these headphones."
2109,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely loved these headphones at first. But after about two months of use, no sound at all comes out of the left ear.

I'm a little disappointed, because I really wanted to like these, and they seemed to get pretty good reviews. But now I see that all the bad reviews say the same thing about the sound not working. Such a bummer."
2110,4.0 out of 5 stars,We bought these for the start of the school year. My daughter is entering middle school and wanted something a little snazzier than the standard black headphones. The color on these is great and they feel quite substantial. I listened to them for a few minutes and the sound was more than adequate for the price we paid. Overall I am quite happy with the purchase.
2111,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great, except the cord eventually got loose or something? I have to buy new ones and it's only been 6 months."
2112,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and works great
2113,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son enjoy it he like it
2114,5.0 out of 5 stars,Daughter loves them! Nice quality!
2115,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was satisfied with the bass sound but the mid wasn't quite strong enough for my liking, which is of course a personal preference. If you like an emphasis on bass and are not too picky about the rest of the dynamic range, these headphones would probably be fine for you. They folded into a compact size and were soft on the ear. Also, the noise cancelling feature works well, and I loved the aqua color, stylish look. Very satisfied with the company's customer service."
2116,5.0 out of 5 stars,Update: Customer service contacted me immediately after I posted the review about an issue with the product and will send a replacement soon. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this. My daughter absolutely loves them!
2117,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best $20 I ever spent. I wasn't looking for anything fancy or anything expensive--just something I could use to listen to music around the house (ear buds are too big for my ears and won't stay in) I use these all the time not only to listen to music on my iPhone but also to play games on my kindle. and the added bonus was the color matched my iphone case! :)
2118,2.0 out of 5 stars,This was actually my second headphone purchase. The first 1 still works had no problems. I took this 1 out the box and it only worked twice. Because I have a child on the ASD Spectrum and she is constantly chewing things I always have a back up. She never even got close to it.
2119,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really like these headphones. They are very comfortable and I especially like that I can adjust the volume with the headphones.
2120,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pleased with these -comfort and quality
2121,1.0 out of 5 stars,I haven't had them two months yet and they already stopped working
2122,1.0 out of 5 stars,It broke leaving a piece inside the iPad.
2123,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I teach English Language Learners. In the spring of each year, we give them a test to see how their language has improved. For a portion of the test, the students must complete a speaking section. These headphones with microphones were AWESOME! They worked out GREAT and picked up the students' voices very well. I will be purchasing more of these headphones with speakers!"
2124,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good for its price. I was mostly looking for headphones that had volume control and this one does the job fine. You can slide the control up and down, and it operates separately from the volume bar on your phone. The sound quality is all right, I usually need to go to high volumes to hear my music clearly. The headphone wire is very long but it's a minor detail. Overall, it's a nice purchase."
2125,3.0 out of 5 stars,They didn't hold up not pleased
2126,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love them so great !!!! sound really nice will buy again for sure !!
2127,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very clear sound, very affordable and the color is great!!!"
2128,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good for the price. I like the controls on the cord. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars are the round ear pieces. Hate to say it, but I have a big head. :-). And those ear pieces pinch after a while."
2129,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound for the price! I wear these when I work out 5 days a week. They are easy to clean and fit snugly.
2130,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound and microphone. Bought them to use in a busier office setting for phone meetings. The headphones block out much of the background noise and the microphone seemed to work well. I highly recommend.
2131,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones. Ear buds always fall out of my ears. The headphones are light. Great sound and the color matches my cellphone case!
2132,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have been used lightly for 3 months, mainly when the kids are laying in bed watching a movie. The sound is good and they are comfortable. I give only 3 stars because they have stopped working after only 3 months. If you twist the cord just right the sound will work but that shouldn't have to be that way."
2133,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for me! Good quality for the price!
2134,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are a Christmas present for my son. I cannot give you an honest opinion just yet. Hopefully they work good and last long.
2135,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones with nice features at a great price. What's not to love?
2136,2.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap headphones that conked out on me w/in two months😕 Not worth the money.
2137,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this pair knowing the Audio quality is poor, actually after hearing them, they are real bad, but I modified them using a pair of 40mm, 50 Ohm, Sennheiser HD-559 drivers. Perfect fit in less than fifteen minutes I replaced both drivers, including soldering the new drivers and locking them in place. Talk about the ""WOW"" factor, they sound incredible, at least 90% better than the original ones, you can't even tell they were modified, until you listen to them. No cutting, no hastle everything fit in place, if you have older beat up broken or ugly pair of higher end Headphones, then theses Headphones are perfect!!! I'm going to try and upload pictures."
2138,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 9 year old daughter got these with a gift card and seems very pleased with her purchase.
2139,5.0 out of 5 stars,great color and size
2140,5.0 out of 5 stars,Suitable for a child
2141,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great looking and comfortable. Sound is not as rich as I would like, but good for work."
2142,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter loves her new headphones.
She's happy.😁."
2143,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice fit, good sound."
2144,4.0 out of 5 stars,Gave these to my 6 year old nephew for Christmas. He has already managed to break the audio end off in his iPad. Honestly I don't know if it was him being to rough or of this product wasn't up to taking on a 6 year old boy. When he opened it it looked to me that this product would hold up under his wear and tear...
2145,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use these at work all the time they are comfortable and don't make my ears sore.
2146,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice design. Love the volume control function as a slider. I am still searching for a compatible case for these headphones but I don't think they are as fragile as they look, which is a great thing."
2147,1.0 out of 5 stars,These stopped working after two months of very light use. Next time I'll spend a few extra dollars for headphones I won't have to replace after just a few uses.
2148,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't blame the seller, but the auxiliary prong snapped off after first use (no unusual bending, etc.). Sound quality was good for the 10 minutes they worked."
2149,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The padded ear cover came off within 2 days of using it and it couldn't be put back on. I know they weren't very expensive but I expect more than 2 days, and if this part coming off is a problem then the part it goes on to should be removable so it can be put back on."
2150,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seem to be working out really well so far. No complaints
2151,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Product lasted 3 months of minimal use. Sound great and look great, just don’t last!"
2152,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for running, they are ok - not good, nor bad. The music doesn't turn up really loud, but loud enough, and my ears sweat a lot when doing cardio. The fit is what you would expect, ears didn't hurt from having them on for more than an hour. I love the neon green, it's the same as it is in the picture."
2153,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am pretty OCD when it comes to overhead headphones, I have about 20 pairs, maybe more. The two biggest issues I find, not concerning the sound, are usually the cord, it's either too short or it just breaks over time causing buzz and other problems, and the size of the headphones themselves. Even ones you can extend tend to be too small for a guy with larger head, especially ones that come in all kinds of funky colors. That said, this product is very well priced and there are several other reasons why it deserves good rating:

PROS:
- price! These are cheaper than 90% of the other ones that I have, currently priced at 19.99
- modern, original design
- adjustable band, will fit a child as well as a grown up (however if you are a man and have a larger head, these may be slightly uncomfortable for you, with the band pushing on top of your head)
- good sound, its not perfect but keeping the price in mind, i believe its about a 4/5
- comfortable padding
- smaller earpads, this could be both a pro and a con, depending on what you prefer
- volume button on the cord
- built in mic on the cord
- you can fold them up for easier storage
- great noise isolation
- the cord is woven, not coated in rubber. those tend to last longer plus it also looks way better

CONS:
- personally i prefer larger earpads, this depends on personal preference
- the cord isnt detachable, could break over time and you cannot replace it
- even though you can extend the band, it may be too small for a person with larger head
- quite some noise bleed (other people will hear what youre listening to when youre using them)

MEASUREMENTS:
headband: 1.25"" wide on top
earpads/speakers: 3"" in diameter

Sound wise these are very good, the bass is about 4.5/5, pretty much as good as it gets when it comes to headphones in this price range, I was surprised at how balanced it sounded. The noise reduction is great, when you have them on, you dont hear sounds from your surroundings (which could be dangerous if you're walking or riding a bike in traffic, so be careful ;) such as tv, radio, people talking etc.

My favorite part is the design, the silver details on the side are very cool. overall I like them, you do get a Great value for your money plus the item comes well packaged in a box."
2154,5.0 out of 5 stars,We love these! Sturdy and cool.
2155,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for the price, they aren't really over ear and are a little uncomfortable. It's kinda in the middle of over ear and on ear and its awkward because of this. Look great and sound good for the PRICE. Volume/pause control is way to high up you cant see while adjusting if the headphones are on your head."
2156,2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are huge. Even on a huge head they are uncomfortably big and keep sliding back and off my head and this is on the smallest setting. Sound quality is a little quiet. Microphone works great! They also aren't compact at all.
2157,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves it! I so do I no noise!
2158,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work great. I use them with my Kindle. Very happy! Thank you.
2159,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived QUICKLY and on time! Excellent condition...excellent sound...love the color! Thank you!
2160,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these a birthday gift for my son who just turned 12 and he absolutely LOVES them! ""Best headphones ever"" he said. Thank you AILIHEN for the quick turn around and great product!"
2161,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 3 of these in different colors for a Christmas gift for 3 of my kids. Unfortunately, as of right now all 3 are broken. 2 of them ended up breaking the tips off in their kindles, and now they can't plug any headphones into it. And the other one, the plug in tip is bent and will not work. I know kids can be rough, but really? All 3? Very disappointed in these."
2162,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter is liking this.
2163,2.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones worked for 3 months then started having static in the audio. poor quality
2164,3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice for the price
2165,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect! These headphones fits on my ear very comfortably. Theses headphones are soft and nice to listen too. Don't let the price fool you, these headphones are so good. I already order one from this company, but I accidentally broke it, so I ordered another one. And I'm gonna keep ordering from these guys again, and again."
2166,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves them! Made the perfect gift
2167,5.0 out of 5 stars,I gave this as a gift to my 12 years old and she loves it as it is light and very comfortable. The size is comfortable for adults too. I must add that the company AILIHEN has provided great customer service when I needed it.
2168,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my husband, then bought me a blue set. I like these, but if I wear them for a long time (more than an hour) my ear starts to hurt on the outer part."
2169,5.0 out of 5 stars,Folding headphones are so portable!!
2170,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds great i have a big head fits snug but everything does;)
2171,5.0 out of 5 stars,They look great but it is a gift so don't know how they work.
2172,2.0 out of 5 stars,"good sound quality for the price. headset width is not adjustable, reduces overall comfort."
2173,3.0 out of 5 stars,Covers keep coming off.
2174,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best headphones I have ever bought. I love the way they look, feel, and sound. I love the way you can turn down the headphones themselves without touching your device volume. If your buying depends on this review, then there is no doubt that you are buying this!"
2175,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these headphones for my son for school. He has several classes where he uses his iPad and the teacher requires the students to wear their headsets. Headset is light weight and comfortable. My son says he enjoys wearing them.
2176,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves these. He takes them back and forth to Nana's house so we really like that they fold. The sound is great and these have a microphone.
2177,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones! I use them for my CD player!
2178,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones for work (just listening to music while I input data). They are comfortable and the sound is good. I've had them for a few weeks and I would definitely buy them again. The teal and gray colors are BEAUTIFUL.
2179,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this all the time now for my online classes to listen to videos. They are very comfortable.
2180,4.0 out of 5 stars,My son really liked these for school
2181,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exactly what I had been searching for, for my 9 year old! She loves them. And doesn't complain that they hurt her ears!"
2182,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good headphones for the price.
2183,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is good, love the color. However, within 30 minutes my ears were hurting. These seem like theyd work better for a child."
2184,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are comfortable and reduce outside noise. Great sound.
2185,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these with my hearing aids listening to music on my IPhone SE.
2186,5.0 out of 5 stars,We bought these for our 4 year old son to use with his tablet. He's had them since Christmas and they work great so far!
2187,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great for the price. I was surprised at the clear sound. I am very pleased with them.
2188,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for my 10 year old. At first glance, they look big, but they fit my 10 year old and myself perfectly. Excellent sound and easy to adjust volume control."
2189,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The product came on time, which is much appreciated. Foldable headsets are the way to go. This is a great product."
2190,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these headphones! The sound quality is great and I really like the color. I've gotten many compliments on them.
2191,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clear and great buy for the price
2192,4.0 out of 5 stars,7 year old son seems to love them
2193,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered these for my son to use on his Ipad- They are very nice for the price! Sound quality is not on par with a higher end headphone, but Honestly fro the price you shouldn't expect Beats or Bose. They are comfortable and have no bleed out of sound, so I don't have to listen to his Minecraft videos :)"
2194,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like it very much. I love the color and it works very well.
2195,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical of these. Once received the quality was better than I expected and my son loves them !
2196,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality is great and the ability to block out other sounds is great. My child loves them and so do I.
2197,3.0 out of 5 stars,NICE Sound😊
2198,5.0 out of 5 stars,Son loves them
2199,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought as a gift for a friend, she loves them."
2200,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 12 yo son loves these headphones with his tablet! They arrived promptly and packaged securely. A great buy for a great price :)
2201,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones. They do run a little big, but that is my only complaint. I love the cord, it is more of a fabric type so it doesn't tangle easily."
2202,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price point, they're pretty good. I wish they could be adjusted to go smaller, but otherwise, sound quality isn't bad."
2203,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like what I got! I bought this mainly for my granddaughter to use with our Roku 3, and I'm very happy with this product! Plus I love the mint-green color as well!"
2204,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They work great for myself, but would not recommend for a man, because they just fit me perfect. They block out other noise great, I bought them for when I have migraine mainly,so I can have quiet with just soft music. Suited me needs great"
2205,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the color look and feel of these. Great buy
2206,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't last long
2207,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you
2208,5.0 out of 5 stars,Visually agreable and with a very nice sound. I'm satisfied with the product.
2209,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Looks cool. Love the green. Very modern and chic looking. Reason it gets only 2 stars? First, the ear muff parts are kind of small for adult ears. Second, with a normal bass level, you could HEAR the speakers struggling. These things are cheap for a reason. Third, and the biggest reason; it says in the description that it controls ""ipod, iphone and ipad."" This DID NOT control my ipod. Theres no comprehensive list of what models they do work with, but the manual says, ""some models not compatible."" I wish they would tell you what those models are, instead of just saying they control ""ipod, iphone and ipad."" So, 3 minutes out of the box, they are getting returned. Still, they look nice."
2210,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I've had these for a couple of weeks to make sure they are as good as they first appeared, and they are. As a college student in a triple dorm, I often find myself using them for extended periods of time to focus on my work. They're comfortable, relatively portable (obvioisly not as small as ear buds, but they still fit in my bag perfectly fine), have great sound quality, and block out a good amount of background noise. I would asolutely recommend these head phones to anyone looking for a great pair on the less expensive end of things, like a fellow college student."
2211,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Initially bought a pair of these because they were affordable and I really liked the look and vibrant colors that were offered. Unfortunately, the pair I had seemed to have a loose wire connection and would cut in and out when the wire was moved. Wrote a quick email to the company and got a full replacement no charge. Extremely satisfied with the customer service. You're not going to get 10/10 sound quality like you would with some Beats or Bose headphones but for the price these are offered at they fit the bill and with a 12 month warranty its a good buy especially if you are very active and likely to damage your headphones."
2212,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works perfectly on my new fire tablet. What a handy little button right on the cord within easy reach. I must have a small head though because the fit is a little loose. Wouldn't probably be a good purchase for a younger child.
2213,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones were good and arrived as depicted in the photograph. They worked great and the sound was clear. The ability for it to work with the Galaxy S7 was a great feature. I ended up returning it b/c I felt they were defective and squeezed my head way too tight. I couldn't use them for more than 20-30 minutes without having to take a few minute break from wearing them.
2214,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously in love with these headphones. I purchased them to use on my prep time at school and they do the job. Great sound quality, beautiful color and pretty good noise cancelling quality though I wouldn’t use them solely for that purpose. I also purchased the amazon recommended case to bring travel with them. Both are great , quality items for an inexpensive price that I wouldn’t hesitate to buy again."
2215,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and super comfortable. My son picked these out because he loved the color, and I could not be happier. The adjustment range is awesome. the quality of the cable is amazing, it’s not flimsy at all. Will be ordering another set for my daughter."
2216,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son has been using these for about a month and we're both happy with them. The cord and connector seem sturdy and won't break quickly. We've had issues with this part in the past with other headphones. Let's face it, kids are hard on things."
2217,2.0 out of 5 stars,"One ear went out within a weeks time. Instead of replacing, I returned them to Amazon, as the sound was not what I was looking for. Very dimmed down.
However, with a fully functioning set they could and would be good for monitored children's use, without breaking the bank. Beautiful green color and they conveniently fold up, smoothly. Came packed well enough is a box with a clear top. Just wish they would have lasted longer and had better sound for music. Regardless, great for children or travel, if functioning properly."
2218,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Less than a month after buying these headphones they suddenly decided to quit working.
They worked great when they did, but one morning they just wouldn't play any sound from any of my devices anymore.
Which really sucks because now I've got to go get new ones in the middle of the week when I commute 2 hours.

2 stars because they didn't break or anything, just quit."
2219,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great, especially for the price. I ordered 2 pair for my kids to use with their iPads for an upcoming plane trip. They look ""really cool"" according to my kids and the sound quality is good. They seem study and my kids have thrown them around quite a bit in and out of backpacks. They fit my 6 year old comfortably as well adults. I'm going to order a pair for myself and highly recommend these!

I do wish they came with a case, but it's hard to complain for less than $20."
2220,2.0 out of 5 stars,It broke after one week and I returned it.
2221,5.0 out of 5 stars,"very comfortable; sound quality is much better than old stereo phones (which were 6 years old).
I like the color package; I try to avoid getting everything the same color so this makes it easier to find."
2222,1.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones were very bad the first ones that I got broke within 2 months and the I emailed the warranty and they sent me new ones and they lasted a couple of weeks I don't recommend getting them
2223,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke after 6 wks.
2224,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great head phones
2225,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The product arrived on time. I would have given this product 5 stars, but the headset is tight on the ears with no adjustment other than that it is a very good product."
2226,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones! Bought them for the kiddos for Xmas and love that they come in different colors so that I don't have fights over which ones are whos... my daughter will even wear them and I didn't know if she would because she says she ""doesn't like things on her head"" (she's 11 yrs old)."
2227,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice design and fit.
2228,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They fit well, and with no noticeable distortion."
2229,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these as an inexpensive replacement - so far - so good. No complaints. Good product and decent price.
2230,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter does like her new headphones
2231,5.0 out of 5 stars,There are extremely cute and comfortable. I wear them all the time.
2232,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's not 5 stars because if you have a big head, it's difficult to adjust it."
2233,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son said ""can you give them more than 5 stars"" so I'm guessing they are awesome! He also said other kids have broken theirs already and his are like new, so I would say great quality! Also he is a very picky 7yr d on how things fit/feel!"
2234,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these as a gift for my daughter after reading the good reviews. They are cute and comfortable but sadly they only lasted a few days. The jack that plugs into the device was bent and I’m afraid that if they continue to be used it will eventually break off all together. Disappointed.
2235,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought as Christmas gift.
2236,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these for running in the morning. The earbuds that I was using before keep falling out of my ears, these work wonderful and sound amazing."
2237,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these for a teenager. He's had them for just a few weeks, but, I am told he loves them and is very pleased. He wears them everyday for several hours while doing homework."
2238,5.0 out of 5 stars,Remarkably good for the price. No issues at all
2239,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband loves these! He likes to watch videos and play games he can't hear anything around him so he isn't disturbed.
2240,5.0 out of 5 stars,Granddaughter loves it.
2241,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Covers for ear cups, both, came loose in three days. They emailed instructions for repair. Sounds quality great otherwise"
2242,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately, I received a faulty pair which really bummed me out, but Ailihen was really cool about it and issued me a refund :) Before my pair broke, they were good headphones with good sound quality, I really liked them! They look exactly as the photo shows as well, and the cord is a pretty long one."
2243,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good headphones, my daughter loves the color."
2244,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product for the price. Pretty good sound, seem durable. I would recommend if you're looking for inexpensive headphones."
2245,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these to replace a Bose I got as a gift. Every bit as good as Bose at 1/10 the price.
2246,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They work fine but after an hour or so they hurt my ears. I looked at returning but I would have to pay $7 to return. Since they only cost $20 to purchase, they are fine but I wouldn’t purchase again."
2247,4.0 out of 5 stars,Is been working but now is really not working for both sides
2248,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product great service
2249,5.0 out of 5 stars,thank you.
2250,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and it's so nice to be able to pause/play videos with the button on the wire, as well as volume control right there at your fingertips. Very comfortable to wear. Bought one for my hubby and myself, we both love them."
2251,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product voice comes in clear as a bell.
2252,5.0 out of 5 stars,Christmas present for my nephew and he loves them. Orange is his favorite color and they are reasonably priced.
2253,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for my daughter who just started kindergarten, they fit her well. I tried them on first and gave them a test run, very good sound quality and construction. If I didn't already have high end headphones I'd buy some for myself"
2254,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased as a gift for my 11 year old son for Christmas. He liked them just fine when he first received them, however unfortunately since then (less than two months later) he can only hear out of one side and the sound on the remaining side is going in and out."
2255,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my 9 1/2 yr old son who loves music and he absolutely loves these headphones. He ran to me saying ""mom you gotta check out this sound!"" He was right. The sound was awesome! Great quality, very durable and he loved the color blue (his favorite color). I would definitely recommend these to anyone."
2256,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones for my 9 yr old as a birthday present. He absolutely loves them especially the color, very unique. He had asked for Beats because a few friends had them, but after he saw these he was like I'll keep mine. He said the Beats his friends had were black didn't look as cool.

Also the sound is great for his phone and even when playing his PS3."
2257,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They have a good design and seemed great at first but with standard use (and no visible signs of distress), one ear stopped producing sound within 6 weeks and the other a week later. Cannot recommend these."
2258,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clear sound and soft ear pieces.
2259,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my five year old and he absolutely loves them.
2260,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most excellent headphones for all listening experiences.
2261,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived on time, look nice, work well"
2262,2.0 out of 5 stars,"i am very disappointed with the sound of these headphones, pretty comfortable to wear but the sound really lacks, i use them primarily on my iphone 6, i keep them only as a backup pair"
2263,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love them they work with any phone I can answer calls with the headset, hang up, puase and unpause shows, and talk through the headset. I need to get another pair because my son took over mine :)."
2264,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphone are soooo great! Very koud and clear!
2265,1.0 out of 5 stars,I received this item today and the right headphone is rattling like something is loose inside. The volume in the right headphone is low as well even when I turn the volume all the way up.
2266,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are too bulky. I do like the color.
2267,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband said they're cushioned enough for him to wear comfortably all day.
2268,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was for my son, but he seems to be very happy with the purchase. They're comfortable and the sound is clear."
2269,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headset and customer service . This headset has outstanding performance. Noise cancellation works super.
2270,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They were great for four months, now they don’t work. To my knowledge I haven’t dropped them at all and have been pretty careful with them so it’s disappointing.

But, anyways they were comfortable and reliable during the past four months."
2271,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They seem to have a high-end finish, which makes the connection and bend points redistent to my children's prying! Happy with the product."
2272,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Work great, comfortable to wear, no complaints. Would recommend / buy again"
2273,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Set of ear phones!
2274,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cable broke after light use after 2 months and outside of return window.
2275,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great for my daughter
2276,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones sound great!
2277,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These were great headphones... for exactly two months of light use, then the sound output became garbled and fuzzy. I'm tempted to buy them again because they did feel sturdy and good quality, but I feel badly that these are going in the landfill."
2278,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value.
2279,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones for my grandson were perfect. They are easy to use, feel solidly built and were true to the bold blue color in the photo. I bought a soft case too, to protect them from dust and dirt when traveling in a backpack. Again, fast shipping, great packaging and quality product."
2280,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!~ Clear when talking to people connected to my cell.
2281,1.0 out of 5 stars,They lasted 2 days longer than the return period. One side doesn't work anymore except randomly when twisting the cheap cable at the base of the headset.
2282,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the first set of headphones that I bought for my Android phone and tablet. They are much lighter than stereo headphones that I used with my stereo system years ago. They have good sound.
2283,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the volume control feature on the headphones. I have a small head and they are almost too large - but I like them.
2284,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for myself they are great would recommend them to anyone
2285,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter picked these for her birthday and is very pleased.
2286,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves them. They work really well and she loves the color.
2287,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke after 3 uses.
2288,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke within the first day but I missed the return label deadline. 😕 I honestly think I just got a lemon. I have several other pairs of this brands headphones and they are amazing. Wish I could have this issue made right.
2289,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yes
2290,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap and is not loud at all
2291,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these for my teenage son. He really liked the sound, the long cord, and that they fold up."
2292,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Supposed to be new, was not. Arrived unsealed, with plug broken, and someone's name written on the inside of the headband in LARGE black letters."
2293,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for listening music from devices, wouldn't recommend for DJ use, not great with any outside sound cancelling. But it does what it's supposed to do."
2294,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This are great headphones! They aren't very noise-cancelling, but they do have very good sound quality. I would give five stars, but the headphones are a little too big on my head, even when adjusted to the smallest position. I wish there was a way to make them tighter on my ears..."
2295,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They really sound as good as the beats, I could not get them to fit well, to wide across the top of my head, wouldn't seat right"
2296,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok for the price. Not super comfy to wear but they do the job.
2297,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This item is one of the OK headphones I've ever had. And that's bad, the sound quality was decent and the outside noise is still unmuted. But it looks cool and worked fine...... until the jack got stuck inside of my phone and I had to pull the leftover part out of my phone, this was less than a month after I got it. 😵😵😵😵😵"
2298,4.0 out of 5 stars,Item as promised!
2299,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works perfect as described and good quality.
2300,5.0 out of 5 stars,very comfortable earpieces. I wear this around the house attached to my phone and when I am walking outside. I definitely recommend this product.
2301,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price the best headphones we own. I got these for my daughter to use with Rosetta Stone, my son quickly confiscated them for use to listen to music. They now both want their own pair for listening to music. To them the quality is superior to earbuds I've spent twice the $ on."
2302,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They look cool but the sound quality is lacking. They are also, apparently, not meant for people with large heads. I only got these since I can no longer wear earbuds but they're tight enough to give me a headache."
2303,1.0 out of 5 stars,When they arrived they were far too wide for my head and kept falling off. They seem to broken already. Very disappointing.
2304,5.0 out of 5 stars,great i love them
2305,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these! They look trendy and sound good however, if the volume is loud others could hear it around you. I love making calls with these, I feel like I could hear the person in HD. Good buy for the price but the headband could be more adjustable they do fall off my head a bit."
2306,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My granddaughter loves these headphones!!!! If she's happy, I'm happy!"
2307,2.0 out of 5 stars,"worked great, but after about a year one side stopped working. Don't know why."
2308,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and easy to fold up and take where you are going. These headphones are very nice.
2309,3.0 out of 5 stars,ya get what ya pay for. but they do the job
2310,1.0 out of 5 stars,Left ear stopped working after 4 months. What a shame since they are comfortable and have good sound. Would not recommend since there are durability issues.
2311,5.0 out of 5 stars,I received these quickly and I am very pleased with their performance and fit.
2312,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They have a great sound quality and you can barely hear any outside noise when you put them on. Only thing is, I wish they were like my dad's sony ones because the ear pieces can flip out so you can listen to your music while being able to hear someone else.Instead you have it basically hanging off your head looking completely ridiculous."
2313,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working just after my return window ran out! Only used a month!
2314,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately when we opened the headphones, one didn't have the ear piece fully attached. Came off while trying to fully attach it, won't got back on."
2315,3.0 out of 5 stars,They worked great..for 2 months. Then they didn't work anymore. Seemed like a weak wire connection.
2316,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my 13 yr old son who had been wearing ear buds. He likes these headsets so much better. They are comfortable and the sound quality is excellent. Great value fo the money
2317,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Tween loved the look but the ear pads came off just past the one month mark, making them impossible to return. Wasted money."
2318,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great.
2319,2.0 out of 5 stars,Well it shipped and arrived very quickly which was the good thing . I had ordered these for my boyfriend and everything was great except for the headphones itself the volume went up and down it had great sound it was the volume and one of the speakers that were the problem .
2320,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these--love the color. They work well, are comfortable and a reasonable price. I bought these because I developed tinnitus (a constant ringing in your ears--yes, it's maddening). I don't know what caused it (could be a lot of different things), but I'm convinced for myself that wearing earbuds was a contributing factor; so I bought these."
2321,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great! They block out sound so well, I don't want to use them for work because I want to be able to hear people coming up to my desk. If blocking out sound is your goal, these work wonderfully. They fold up great and the color, while listed as ""mint,"" is a pretty aqua/turquoise, just like the in picture. They are very comfy and love the cord covering. The only thing I would change is to have the volume control a little further down the cord (away from my face). I have not used it with my phone yet, this has just been on the computer."
2322,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If I had my druthers, I'd hear every piece of music in KC's acoustically stunning Kauffman Center. But I'm a mayor with many responsibilities, which means I can't always have my druthers and frankly I'm not even sure what druthers are. What I do know is that these headphones are quite good. They're collapsible, which is convenient, and they come in a wide array of colors including one resembling Royal blue and four other colors that are not nearly as good."
2323,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They were awesome when I first got them. I thought the durable cord would make for a long life span. Dead wrong! there was a short so annoying that I had to hold the cord in the most absurd positions including having to put it in my teeth to keep it from cracking out. It was like when I was a kid and had to all but hold the antenna up with tinfoil to get tv reception. (dear younger folks, that was before even cable) Annoying as hell so here I am looking to get a new pair in less than a couple months. Glad I waited to review these...."
2324,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love everything about these headphones. They're very high quality. The cable is braided so I won't have to worry too much about it wearing down over time. The covers are very soft and make wearing them enjoyable. The sound quality is crystal clear and the microphone picks up perfectly. I'm really glad I found these! Definitely worth more than the price! Highly recommend!
2325,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Was looking for an inexpensive set of comfortable over the ear headphones. Read the reviews and decided to give them a try. Thank you A-prime I had them quickly. So far they have worked great for casual listening around the house and for when I'm out walking my dog. Seem sturdy and well built. I especially like the braided cord. Very comfortable with above average sound quality. Even isolates you very well so you don't have to contend with ambient noise ruining the experience. I ordered the 'grey and mint' and reviews are spot on that it's a nice teal color. For $20, these are a steal. Very happy so far with my purchase."
2326,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves them. Great sound and perfect price
2327,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Awful headphones. The buttons to lower volume and pause/play songs stopped working after 2 weeks. A month and a half later, one side doesn't always work (I have to twist the cable around to get sound in both ears and it doesn't come out often).
Total waste of money. Honestly if you can afford it, buy Sennheisers or some other brand of headphones. These ones are straight garbage.
WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
2328,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones for the money. You really can't hear any outside noise when you put them on. The ear pieces are very comfortable and they feel like really sturdy headphones.
The buttons work great with an iPhone 6s. The volume knob is a little useless as it is independent from the volume on the iphone. The mic sounds great and the function button works as stated.
The only thing I would change is the cord. I would have a detachable cord and also a carrying case for travel."
2329,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been extremely pleased with my AILIHEN C8 Folding Headphones with Microphone...!!! Awesome sound quality and comfortable fit, easy to adjust. My only regret is that I did not get around to giving the seller, AILIHEN, at least 5 Stars! The headset arrived promptly and was packaged very securely to help prevent any damage in transit. My sincere apologies to the folks at AILIHEN for my neglect."
2330,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are great
2331,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use this with conference calls on my cell phone. Good sound quality and it reduces surrounding office noise. Plus the company contacted to to make sure I was happy with my purchase ... wow, actual customer service! I am very satisified"
2332,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I should had paid more & got something better.as the sound I'd not that clear.
that you any way."
2333,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones for my daughter for Christmas and when she opened them and Tried them on the sound was really muffled and she couldn't hear anything. Worst gift ever!! DONT BUY!!!?
2334,2.0 out of 5 stars,The fit is good. But there is a short an only one side of the headphones works unless you keep turning the cord until the other side works. An even then it only works for a couple minutes.
2335,2.0 out of 5 stars,"cheap, cord broke at the plug. Buttons do not work with apple devises"
2336,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my son
2337,3.0 out of 5 stars,Noise isolation? Nuh-uh. Not a chance. The sound quality was meh. It didn't suck but it wasn't anything special either. It was comfortable and the cord was nice. 3 stars for mediocrity.
2338,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave these earphones to my granddaughter. The button to pause and replay did not work. There were no paper instruction, but on the box it said what should happen with 1 click or 2 clicks or 3 clicks. I guess the button did not work because we did not get the stated results!"
2339,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect.
2340,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love that it folds up. Makes for easy storage. And yhe volume control helps with volume control without going into the settings of said device. Its a very good and cost efficient choice for headphones
2341,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son got these for Christmas and he loves them with his new kindle fire hd...The cord is even made with a different material so that it does not fray.
2342,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable
2343,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was super excited to find a pair of orange headphones, but I am sad to report they only lasted one trip. The foam around the earpiece has come off and I am not able to get it back in place. Now I have to purchase a new pair of headphones for the return trip home....... :-("
2344,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered these headphones and in 2 days they are broken. No sound coming from them at all and I've tried everything I can to try and fix them. Very disappointed in this purchase. Save your money and don't buy these
2345,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Within a couple months the padding fell off which we glued back on. Within six months, they are no longer working well. They will not connect well. My daughter can not hear out of both sides."
2346,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are very comfortable and the sound is very good.
2347,2.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible product do not buy broke easily
2348,5.0 out of 5 stars,A bargain. Impressive headphones I wasn't expecting such good quality of sound especially for the price. Highly recommend.
2349,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These only worked for about 2 weeks, then only the right side would work. Now neither side works. There is definitely a short in the cord somewhere. If I wiggle the cord around it will cut in and out but never stays playing."
2350,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It was good for a while until it started randomly changing my songs and turning up and down the volume on my phone. I tried with other headphones to see if there was a bug in my phone, but the others worked normally. Its pretty much a piece of junk now."
2351,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These arrived exactly as most of the reviews indicate. These are lightweight, have great sound. I love the extra long cord and the user buttons on the cord. The color is right on, I can't wait to use these on my next trip. For the price on these, you really can't beat them! Highly recommended."
2352,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. Thank you
2353,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were a perfect fit for our grandson and he loved them immediately. His mom liked the volume control.
Nothing against these headphones but I do wish I had gotten Bluetooth instead for this little guy. He likes to dance to his music which doesn't work well when you are tethered to your iPad."
2354,5.0 out of 5 stars,kids love them
2355,4.0 out of 5 stars,My son loved these! The only reason it is a 4 not a 5 is that the cord did pull out so they stopped working after about eight weeks so I felt like that part could have been a bit stronger. They look fun but are much cheaper than other similar headphones.
2356,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves it. He uses it at school and home. It is very comfortable.
2357,5.0 out of 5 stars,They were great thanks
2358,5.0 out of 5 stars,Present for granddaughter. She loved.
2359,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son told me this headphone is great! The sounds is very good.
2360,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable; much more comfortable than the ones they replaced. The sound quality is good, as well (I use this with my iPads)."
2361,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones - they drown out the noise around me at work and the playback sound is great!
2362,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love using these headphones, the sound quality is top notch and having a volume adjuster and being able to skip/pause songs is great. There is a function to go back to the last song but I haven't been able to do that not that I've needed to though."
2363,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for the price. The band is a little longer than I expected and not quite as padded as I'd like. They work well and sound good, though."
2364,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with the purchase!! Good quality product and the sound is just right! Packaging is cool also. Thanks a lot.
2365,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter and she’s used them for less than 2 months and they already have a short in them. I love the color and the design, but they are useless since they don’t work."
2366,4.0 out of 5 stars,yes i recieved package thank you
2367,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for our 5 year old to use. Fit is good, they fold up nicely. They have stopped working after only 6 months of infrequent use. Sound hasn't been great from the beginning, now you can barely hear through them and they cut out all the time."
2368,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Much nicer quality and only a few dollars more than other kids' headphones at about this price point that I had previously purchased at Target. My 6-year old loves them. They fold, which I didn't expect, and makes it a bit easier to fit in a backpack."
2369,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones where great but the wiring was pretty bad and the wire in the grey cored came loose inside and they no longer worked
2370,2.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working within a few weeks.
2371,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke very quickly - only one side has sound now. They broke after 5 weeks.
2372,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones look nice but the sound coming out of the left ear is 2-3 times louder than the right ear. What a joke. I wasn't expecting much for $20 something dollars but at least make the sound level the same in each ear.
2373,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones!
2374,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones perfect for my husband...work great and arrived on time!!
2375,3.0 out of 5 stars,Love the available colors and they have a really good sound for inexpensive headphones. The only problem I had and the reason I had to return them is the earpieces were too small and hurt my ears if I wore them for any length of time
2376,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good for the price. The ear flaps are pretty small so they hurt after a while. Used for a 7year old.
2377,3.0 out of 5 stars,Really cute. Slightly loose on me and don't seem particularly adjustable. Unfortunately the arrive with a broken headphone jack (literally looked like it was busted off) so I didn't get to try them. Going to try a different brand.
2378,5.0 out of 5 stars,they seem real good so far
2379,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones exactly as describes. Good sound and love having volume control in the cord, esp. for the commercials on Spotify. It makes them so easy to avoid ;)"
2380,2.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter has these for about 2 weeks before they broke.
2381,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They don't get any bigger... The sound quality is ok i guess... The wire doesn't come off. If you're looking for something thats like ""meh"" then this is it!"
2382,5.0 out of 5 stars,My grandsons love them and I also get a break from hearing the loud sounds of their games.
2383,5.0 out of 5 stars,"GREAT DELIVERY, VOLUME ON COMPUTER WAS NEVER THAT LOUID, IM LITTLE HARD OF HEARING PUT THESE NEW AILIHEN C-8 PHONES ON AND WOW THE VOLUME WAS SO LOUD I HAD TO TURN THE VOLUME DOWN.THEY ARE LIGHT WEIGHT COMFORTABLE IM A VERY HAPPY CAMPER AND WILL HIGHLY RECCOMEND THESE THANK YOU. PS ALSO VERY CLEAR SOUND AND NO STATIC"
2384,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my son to use while using the computer at school. He loves them.
2385,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones! The sound is very clear, volume adjustment is great, and they are super comfortable! I've worn them all day at work and on several long flights! As other people mentioned the mint green color is more of a teal, but they're very pretty. Great product overall, but even better for how affordable they are."
2386,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality
2387,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones have been great for late night music listening sessions. My bedroom is situated under a 3 year old (upper flat tenants) so listening to music after 8pm has been a no go. I wasn't looking to spend much and these were everything I needed in headphones. Would recommend.
2388,5.0 out of 5 stars,super
2389,1.0 out of 5 stars,They worked great for two months using them everyday at work and now the right earpiece no longer works. It gives me a headache when I try to listen to music having only one side of the headphones working. Do not recommend purchasing this product.
2390,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work better than expected! 9 year old loves that there is controls on the cord to pause. Comfortable fit and good quality for the price.
2391,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice lightweight headphones that work great.
2392,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Work great, a little to big for my head."
2393,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for the price! Comfortable and great sound. Have been using for a few weeks and experienced no problems with them.
2394,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty cool. My kid loves them. !!!
2395,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful color & very lightweight headphones . I bought them as a Christmas gift for my son.
2396,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great at first, but quickly started shorting out somewhere internally; first one ear, then the other."
2397,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought as a gift for my granddaughter. She loves them!
2398,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter for Christmas, and one side stopped working in the middle of February - she didn't even get two whole months of use from them."
2399,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked wonderfully for about twoish months. I wore them everywhere, but suddenly now the left ear is fading out if I turn my head at all. I do like them and I'm really bummed to have issues. Wore them to work out, go to work, and just hang around the house. Maybe should have gotten the protection plan or something."
2400,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight. Great sound and very nice quality for price. I have 2 sets and highly recommend this product. They are very well padded and very comfortable. I have several piercings in both ears and have a hard time with ear buds.
2401,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these in replacement of a pair that had a separated cord. I like the sound quality and the folding option. However I did find the material that touched the over the ear uncomfortable from time to time depending on where it's creased
2402,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good enough for my middle schooler. They fit very confortable and like the feature of been able to control the volume.
2403,5.0 out of 5 stars,My granddaughter absolutely loves these headphones. They were delivered when expected and at a very good price.
2404,1.0 out of 5 stars,Was great for a week and the stopped working completely .Save your money and get a different brand
2405,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works good.

2407,5.0 out of 5 stars,love it
2408,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work excellent!
2409,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great basic pair of headphones. I wear them while walking so that I can listen to music or talk on the phone. When it is really windy, it gets noisy, but other than that, no problems."
2410,3.0 out of 5 stars,After wearing them for a while my ears start to hurt
2411,2.0 out of 5 stars,"You get what you pay for. 2 months after purchase, one of the ear pieces no longer produces any sound. Trying to fiddle with cable connections didn't produce any change. I think these are ultimately a pretty cheaply made pair of headphones. But at this price I should have known..."
2412,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headset. My daughter really loves it. Cuts out outside noise and sound is wonderful compared to the kids headphones that are out in stores.
2413,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update:
After just a few months the microphone stopped working which was main reason for purchase. Disappointing.. They still sound good just can't use them for work calls any more..
;-(

LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!!! Except my ears get hot.. other than that.. I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES"
2414,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my wife. She LOVES them! A great buy!
2415,2.0 out of 5 stars,Husband was not happy with these and we are sending them back Sorry
2416,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been looking for foldable headphones for the gym. I often use Bluetooth ones, but I like having corded ones for long bouts of cardio after having a few instances where my Bluetooth ones died and left my bored for the remainder of my cardio session. These are perfect for my needs. Here are some brief thoughts after getting some use out of them:

-Sound: The sound is on par or above expectations for headphones in this price range. The sound is clear and crisp. The bass is medium, but better than expected. When turning my phone to max volume these are loud. No worries about them being loud enough.
-Comfort: These have ample padding around the ear. When wearing them for longer periods I forget I'm wearing them.
-Style: In my opinion these look really good for a $20 set of headphones. I got the lime/gray color and I really like how it looks.

Overall, there's nothing bad to be said about these. They work great, look nice and are super comfortable to wear. I was sent them for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on my rating or review of them. This is my honest opinion."
2417,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't bother buying these. They are cute headphones, but I only used them twice and the left ear stopped working."
2418,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my 11-year-old, who loves them. I like that the cord is thick and sturdy, he likes the microphone in the switch. Good headphones for kids."
2419,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect size for my 7 & 10 year old. The cord is extremely flexible, but durable, not just plastic - and the sound is great! Very happy with this product."
2420,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased for a child who just had to have beats. Comparing reviews and prices purchased these and he loves them. They are stylish and great quality.
2421,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and I particularly like the coard ( more durable)
2422,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought these for my daughter for Christmas, and they are already broken. Plus the window to return has closed. A HUGE waste of money. Products should last longer than 2 months, even if they aren't top of the line products."
2423,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with my new head [hones
2424,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my uncle and he loves them!!! Didn't take long to get them and he has used them about every day sense then. Every time I see him he has them on. I had to show him to turn the volume up but other than that perfect!!
2425,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They’re cute and comfortable, but if you want them for longer then 2 months, don’t waste your money on these. The button on them broke and randomly pause and skip songs. Now I have to hold the cord a certain way for the audio to sound right. Waste of money."
2426,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Tried 2 of these. Just not durable. The first one was broke (the jack) when it arrived. We gave it a second chance and that one lasted about a week before the jack bent and broke off from normal use.

Sound was nice but just not durable."
2427,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality for the price and I love the unique color. Sounds are clear and my students can hear me easily with the built-in mic. So far, so good!!"
2428,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound and color
2429,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for my 10 year old daughter and she loves them! The sound quality is pretty good, very clear and live. The color is amazing. Happy with this purchase."
2430,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These worked well when I first bought them 3 months ago, but now the wire at the headphone jack is damaged and I can't hear out of one ear. I dropped these headphones once two months ago, and these defects are happening now. They're just ok. For 20 bucks, I can afford to get another.

Oh, if you wear glasses, then don't wear these headphones for long periods of time. They press against the frames of the glasses and squeezes your head. Ouch."
2431,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these for my daughter for Christmas. She loved them. She is a musician so that is a compliment. However, after two months the wire came loose and she was sad because the sound would cut in and out. I contacted the company to see what we could do. They sent us a replacement pair! Great customer service. The new phones came fast! Now my daughter is happy again. Thanks."
2432,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this headset. It looks and feels really expensive. It has great noise cancelling and isn’t too tight on my ears. The sound is perfect too. The cushion on the ears are soft and very comfortable. Even though it has a cord, I like it over the wireless headsets I have tried. No charging necessary, plug in and it works."
2433,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If I could give it a zero, I would. This is a very cheap item and I do not recommend it at all. I bought 2 of them at the same time, one for each of my children. The first pair broke within the 1st week and the other pair broke within the 3rd week. The plug is very weak and both of them broke while plugged into an iPad!! The plug is buried into the headphone jack so I have to figure out a way to get the broken piece out! I compared the plug with a Sony pair of headphones I got years ago and I immediately saw the difference. The Sony plug is very thick and would not be easy to break. This Ailihen headphone, on the other hand, has a plug that is very thin and apparently made out of very cheap metal and plastic."
2434,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got them at the start of January, not even 3 months and I have to get a replacement because only one side works. I bought these for work, I never traveled with them or threw them in a bag or folded them much for that matter. They were plugged into my computer at my desk since they were opened. I guess you get what you pay for."
2435,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 5 yr old son loves these, maybe because one of the kids from Walk the Prank had similar looking ones. But, my son wears them even when their not plugged into anything. Lol! They do cancel a lot of the outside noise he says and he likes how comfy they are on his head."
2436,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superb headphones! Great bass, excellent noise cancellation. Controls are awesome, I can do everything without having to touch my ipod or phone. Wire is different texture, but helps prevent snag and tangling. Loved mine so much I bought one for mothers day!"
2437,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered these for my 2 kids for a long airplane ride to Europe. One set broke on the way over (you could not hear anything unless the wire was held taut in a certain way... a huge disappointment for my son who now had no headphones on the trip). I returned them when we got home and then repurchased another pair thinking it was a fluke since the other pair had worked fine. Needless to say within a few weeks the second pair stopped working and then the replaced pair stopped working. That is 3 broken headsets in a 2 month span; totally unacceptable. Don't waste your money.
2438,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really enjoyed the comfortable fit of these headphones. Unfortunately the pair I received were faulty at the microphone attachment and when I contacted the company for a replacement pair, after several emails, they only sent me a refund. The sound quality was really lovely and I would have been very happy with just a working replacement pair."
2439,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not a headphone aficionado or anything, I just like stuff that works well and looks cool. These headphones are better than I expected in both departments. I just got back from a trip across the country and the headphones were great for listening to music and dampening ambient noises on the plane. The braided cable is really nice; it seems significantly more durable than the cables of other headphones I've owned. The option to fold them down for storage was also quite handy. Altogether, it's a really solid product for the price point."
2440,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and fits perfect. Light weight and is adjustable.
2441,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can not beat for the price outstanding.
2442,5.0 out of 5 stars,"super set, very heard of hearing Amplies well hightly recommended"
2443,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You won't be disappointed with these. Comfortable, cool color options, options, and the price won't bankrupt you."
2444,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice looking headphones. I bought these for my 6 year old daughter and they fit her very well. So far, we've had no issues with this set. We did purchase the bright green for my son and he's having issues with the sound."
2445,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Granddaughter loved the color , great buy"
2446,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These were for my daughters class, they weren't adjustable to her head as she has a smaller head. I tried them on and they didn't grip around my ears like I thought they should. I get they wouldn't fit her head, but they should have fit mine just fine."
2447,2.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones aren't tight enough on the head and easily slip off. They also have a mind of their own and click on siri or change the song while wearing them. I wouldn't buy them again.
2448,3.0 out of 5 stars,Product did not last very long. The connector and the cord began to separate after about 3 weeks.
2449,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for my kid to hook up in the back of the car if she doesn't want to listen to what we are and she absolutely loves them
2450,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones broke after roughly 45 days of use. The connection started to go bad, until it stopped making connection all together. Steer clear of this item."
2451,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product and right on time!
2452,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not happy that I could barely hear any sound
Returned."
2453,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price!!
2454,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered one for my husband and one for me. We both like them a lot. We use them for watching TV and have to clip the microphone button down or they won't work with the splitter. But otherwise, they deliver good sound. It's nice to have individual volume control, too."
2455,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality was good. Dropped them once while at my desk and the whole right side broke off. Not durable at all, also they fit a bit loose."
2456,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love them
2457,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this for my son who loved it until 2 weeks later the tip of the plug became slightly bent and the headphones are no longer usable. He used these almost every day during those two weeks, so I'm not sure if it's a question of quality or durability. Very disappointing."
2458,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my 9 year old daughter and she loves them. They are comfortable for her and a great quality for the price!
2459,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these as a replacement for daughters old headphones, she loves them and every night after work I have to take them off the bed and place them on her stand. Thank you"
2460,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i would like to say out of all the headphones i bought, these are the best functioning. the only minor problem i have is that it sometimes pauses/plays videos and music on its own and summons siri. often than that it is awesome."
2461,1.0 out of 5 stars,They were great.... for a week but they are staticky already. The sound comes in and out. I've taken great care of them as well. I'm very sad/disappointed.
2462,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I was looking for our grandson!!
2463,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My headphones are great! I can hear my music perfectly clear, Great sounds, easy to adjust the volume, a reasonable length of cord, forward switch and beautiful happy colors… What more can you ask for?"
2464,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love these, because they sounded great, felt great, and my kids liked them. Unfortunately, they didn't last. After just a few weeks they started shorting out and sound goes on and off. Haven't checked into a warranty or refund yet."
2465,2.0 out of 5 stars,I liked these headphones at first......however they eventually stopped working after around a month.
2466,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful headphones! Purchased these as a gift for my son and lately I've also been using them to listen to my online college course. I'm able to listen and focus on my class without hearing what is going on around me. These headphones are also very comfortable. Great product. Both my son and I love them!
2467,2.0 out of 5 stars,I love the color. I like how soft they are. But. I’m an adult and I have fairly tiny ears but these are still just a little too small. They put too much pressure on my ears and the sound quality is already beginning to fade after 1 month.
2468,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are just what i was looking for.
2469,2.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter use these all the time and the end broke off about three weeks later and it is stuck in the iPad.
2470,5.0 out of 5 stars,Item was fine
2471,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter love it!!!
2472,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are amazing and the sound quality is superb!!!
2473,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for gaming
2474,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great their not to loud
2475,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son loves this product! He says that it works fantastically and there are no flaws. These headphones can fold, making it easy to store. The color is very nice; it isn't as bright as it is in the picture. I would recommend buying this product if you want an affordable choice for headphones."
2476,2.0 out of 5 stars,They're ok. Not adjustable so slips off head. Sound quality ok but not great with volume or blocking outside noise
2477,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved the color, it was definitely not that BRIGHT blue and I don't mind that at all. I must say that if you have a small head they might be slightly loose but they still have an amazing noise and a cool folding feature and are super comfy!"
2478,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Fit comfortably over my ears and I wear glasses. Music sounds crisp, like meditation music or nature sounds, but any words or lyrics in a song sound very far away."
2479,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Completely loved them, worked great with really clear sound, unfortunately after 1 month they stopped working all of a sudden, very disappointed as they were a Christmas gift for my 15 year old son"
2480,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, it is working good. I like the color and model. Of course, for that price, you get what it is fair."
2481,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Kids love them and they're holding up really well. From backpacks to school, at school and home again."
2482,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are for a salvation army angel tree gift so I don't know for sure but certainly appear of great quality!
2483,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Really disappointed in these headphones. I gave them to my daughter for Christmas and she loved them, but after using them for about a month, they shorted out and no longer work."
2484,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My child loves them, it was his birthday gift...13th...nope don't have to have beats! Great price, great sound, and insulated very well so we aren't listening to his stuff also :)"
2485,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son was thrilled to get these! He wears them around the house even when he isn't listening to tunes! They fit well, are light and comfortable to wear (obviously!) and I would buy them again."
2486,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it, clarity and comfort is outstanding."
2487,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great. My kids love them.
2488,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great and had good sound, but after less than 2 months, the soft ear cover fell off and the wire is compromised and only plays in one ear. Headphones were cared for so I am assuming it is faulty construction. Would not recommend this purchase."
2489,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome as described
2490,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter. They were not mishandled, yet the cord broke within 2 months. Will not replace with these."
2491,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves them
2492,4.0 out of 5 stars,No problems so far
2493,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice design my 6yrs boy likes it a lot. Reduce Volume control is nice thing for little one like him!
2494,1.0 out of 5 stars,Warning: The headphones are not adjustable. It is only one size. And the sound was off. It seems like it was off balanced. One side was lower than the other.
2495,5.0 out of 5 stars,MY 7 YEAR OLD LOVES THESE HEADPHONES
2496,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked this pair, but after about 6 months, the left side when on the fritz and then a few weeks the whole thing died."
2497,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones worked at first but if you're someone like me and can somehow go through headphones and earphones fast, this isn't really for you. After a few weeks, the sound wasn't working properly and I had to put the cord in a certain angle so it can work."
2498,5.0 out of 5 stars,My kids love these and they were actually better qualitiy than I expected. I think I need a pair as well.
2499,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter has been using these headphones for about 2 weeks and she loves them. Unfortunately, one of the ear pieces has stopped working. So disappointed because we leave for vacation in 4 days and she was hoping to take them on the trip."
2500,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m loving my headphones! It has great sound quality and the mic works well. This was a really good purchase.
2501,5.0 out of 5 stars,"doubt you can beat these for $20. Sound good, comfortable, decent volume controls. Arrived super fast especially considering shipped for free. Adjustable so they fit my big head lol. Would buy again..."
2502,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are perfect for kids or adults. The volume only goes so loud. Which is nice for kids. They work well and sound good.
2503,1.0 out of 5 stars,They stopped working after a month
2504,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My 10 year old son loves these. Comfortable, clear, not so isolated that when I cal him he can't hear me, that's ok with me :-). Easy to carry around, look cool, great product for the price. However, 2 months later the ear piece came off so I removed 2 stars"
2505,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Unless I hold the wire at a certain angle, the sound will only play on one side (left). It’s very disappointing... I guess I’ll have to go look for new headphones.
(I received this earphone on 12/16 and only used it once on 12/17.)"
2506,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't last a month.
2507,4.0 out of 5 stars,they fit nicely and look great. The sound is great and its easy on the ears
2508,5.0 out of 5 stars,I just recently bought these. Speedy delivery. Sound quality is great they are very comfortable and when it comes to storing them I love that they fold up! Great buy would for sure buy again if need be.
2509,5.0 out of 5 stars,👍
2510,4.0 out of 5 stars,The item was purchased as a gift. Everything looked great from outside the box. The item arrived almost a week later than expected. However when it arrived it was exactly what was ordered and nothing appeared damaged.
2511,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's really really nice product but it was big on my head! so i'm returning it :((((
2512,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a Christmas present for my teenage daughter. The color is wonderful and I love how the earpieces fold inward. My package arrived on time and in excellent condition. Buying another pair for my other daughter
2513,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work great
2514,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are exactly what we needed for my son. Great quality for the price.
2515,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These work really well and the price was great. I'm only giving three stars though because the black lining started to come out on both sides. I was able to get in back in, but it was pretty difficult."
2516,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works, good sound quality. Pausing from the ""pause"" button initiates a fade-out stop--nice to not be so abrupt and leave your ears ringing. Can get a little uncomfortable on ears after wearing for about 4+ continuous hours."
2517,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the colors. Works well with my Galaxy S7
2518,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was perfect and arrived on time!
2519,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son really likes these headphones. They are comfortable and he's happy with the quality of the sound. Color is super fun and they seem pretty sturdy overall. My other son likes them and for the price, might buy himself a pair."
2520,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grandchild loves them
2521,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, nice sound insulation but poor cable quality stop working right after 2 weeks"
2522,3.0 out of 5 stars,These stop working within 2 weeks of buying.
2523,3.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted a whole month sounding perfectly . now ive lost hearing in one of the headphones which is rather annoying.
2524,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Within a two week period, only one side produced sound. Amazon returned my money."
2525,2.0 out of 5 stars,"One side stopped working after 13 months of regular (but gentle) use. Otherwise, it was a perfect set of affordable, comfortable, good-sounding headphones. I really wish it lasted longer."
2526,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just purchased these last week and not only were they early(I wasn't due to get them until Tuesday), but they came in some great shape.

They are very comfortable around my head, which is nice, and the mic works great!"
2527,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are awesome for the price! Great sound quality!
2528,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are a Christmas gift for my 7 year old daughter so I have no idea of the sound quality or durability yet but they seem to be a very good product for the money.
2529,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pleasantly suprised for the price. Good mix between mids, lows, and highs"
2530,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these. My gym is super loud and I like to walk and watch shows on the treadmill, I can really really my shows with these. Unlike my earbuds."
2531,4.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased these for my 10 yr old son and he seems to like them.
2532,4.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for my 11 year old daughter. She seems to like them very much and wears them quite a bit without ever complaining about discomfort. They seem to be reasonably well built so a good buy for the money. I would recommend them.
2533,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT SOUND!! WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!
2534,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quite nice exactly what I needed for a good price.
2535,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves these
2536,4.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves hers.
2537,5.0 out of 5 stars,These were true to color and my granddaughter loves them.
2538,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones work great!
2539,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These were a great value at only $20 - They cancel noise pretty well, but after more than a few hours of continual wear, it can feel like theyre crushing your ears. Sound quality is great, non-rubbery cord for fewer tangles!"
2540,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like them but the problem I had with them was that sometimes, when you hit the top part of it while listening to music, you'll hear this loud resounding noise as well as it hits your ears. That shouldn't happen but other than that, they're okay."
2541,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality was ok got the price Idk what I was expecting but probablylike a month in I noticed the Jack piece of the head phones that plugged into my phone was cracked, so they don't work anymore Idk it was possibly my fault, can't really give a good review since I didn't have long with them."
2542,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They look like they're for children, and I was led to believe that they would fit my 9 year old's head, but they didn't. So my mother took them. She liked them, and they fit better. I bought new ones from the same company that many people put in the comments were small enough for smaller heads."
2543,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really great. they have excellent sound and I tested them on music and video on my tablet. The only design flaw I see is that they are a bit stiff so if I lay back with them I feel them push up a bit. For normal everyday use, however, these definitely do exactly what i needed. I will be testing the mic later - but I have no doubt it'll work just fine."
2544,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Order came as expected. Color was as advertised. Cord is fabric coated, so something to keep in mind if you're tough on your headphones. These were a good deal overall, the treble is a little tin-y, the bass is not very deep, but present enough. The treble is fair the sound overall is fairly crisp and clean. For such large headphones the sound exuded from them seems much smaller, the the tin can effect. These are not sound proof or sound dampening headphones. Also the sound does go outwards and you can clearly head the noise if you're not wearing them. Overall I would say these are affordable, stylish headphones. I would recommend them to a friend. I would also consider repurchasing them. Cheer.s"
2545,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated review -
Purchased these for my son in February 2017. By June 2017 one head phone no longer had sound anymore. Per seller and headphone box there is a 6-12 month warranty. Messaged seller in June 2017 to see if they asssist with the warranty or I need to go directly through the manufacturer. It's now August 2017 and the seller have never responded to my inquiry/issue.

My initial review February 2017 - ""Great quality and sound. My 8 year old is using them for computer work at school. He loves them. His dad says the sound quality is just as good as his $200 Beats. Will definitely buy again."""
2546,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Theses a great headphones. Love the color, they are adjustable for adults and kids! Not five stars because when you bend the wire, at all, the should will cut out. Totally recommend theses headphones, but just beware of the cord issue."
2547,2.0 out of 5 stars,"at first I really enjoyed them... they work perfect for TV and podcasts. for music, the are pretty good too. everyone says they can hear me really clearly on the microphone when connected to my phone.

A month later, I can only hear from one ear piece unless I wiggle the cord. I was not harsh on them so I feel that maybe the quality could be better."
2548,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are looking for quality headphones on a budget, these are perfect. Haven't had any issues so far with these pair. I wanted to find a cute pair on the less expensive side while also having a good sound quality. I use these nearly everyday for music and phone calls. The shoelace like string is very durable (I have a 9 month old and he's chewed on the string, they still work as if nothing happened!). I will probably be buying another pair soon in lime green :)"
2549,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are nice-looking headphones with good sound for the price. However, one of the ear cushions came off in less than two months of gentle use. Amazon informs me that they're ineligible for return as that's only allowed within 30 days of delivery. So yeah, that's what passes for a warranty."
2550,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Would be five stars if sound came out of both speakers.
Pros: Great fit (soft and light on the ears), compact design folds up, and optional volume control/mic button.
Cons: I can barely hear noise out of the right headphone. Might try returning for another try."
2551,5.0 out of 5 stars,These were for my grandson for back to school. He loved them so much that I ordered another pair for my granddaughter in purple. Thanks for the quality of these headphones!
2552,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too much plastic. Horrible ear cups. Sound quality sucks.
2553,3.0 out of 5 stars,A little uncomfortable. The sound quality is decent. I would buy them for a back up pair or a pair you just use it you don’t want to lose another pair on a trip or something. Would I buy from these again? Eh probably.
2554,4.0 out of 5 stars,these are fine for the price.
2555,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound great
2556,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice for the price. Everything I was expecting. Very happy with the purchase.
2557,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for my son for school. He loves them and really likes the volume control on the wire. They seem like they are well made!
2558,2.0 out of 5 stars,"There is a reason it is very cheap. It is very uncomfortable and hard for your ears, and it looks big but its not, and however adjusting it is a real pain because you have to have the biggest head in the world to wear this."
2559,2.0 out of 5 stars,My son bought these with his own money. These lasted a month before the sound starting going in and out then became static.
2560,1.0 out of 5 stars,Only semi-functional after three months. Wiring is poor quality.
2561,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones were exactly what they said,they would be they look and feel great and the sound is amazing as the price was. I also loved how fast they arrived despite it being Christmas time as some sellers are using that as a reason for items taking longer"

2564,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great buy on these headphones. They fold up easily, braided cord, volume adjuster and noise reduction. Sturdy for a 7 year old and great color choices! Very happy with the purchase."
2565,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. I use it almost every day and I had no regrets about buying them. Hear perfectly clear and definitely seems like I can't hear anything outside of these headphones. I love it.
2566,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this headphone for my son and he loves it, I also love it, the wire is not the normal wire that comes with all headsets these are more clothy and strong which is what I love most, I'm looking into getting the earphones for myself.😃"

2570,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I want to love these...but the cord broke with normal use, and they no longer work!"
2571,3.0 out of 5 stars,It is good but I can not find the microphone and the pad for the left side is very loose and you can see the glue used to glue the side. I think it was just mine. Otherwise it is very comfortable and the audio is very good.
2572,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is alright. It looks fantastic, and the microphone is great. However, it is not very comfortable on the ears if you're going to wear them for a while, putting pressure on your ears. I wish they were slanted just a little bit, and then they'd be great!"

2587,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are amazing in my opinion. The fact that they fold in makes them great. When I drop them it doesn’t matter. They work perfectly and they make gaming fun.
2588,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the way they fold and can go into my son's backpack pocketseasily! Hopefully this helps them not break in the daily grind back and froth to school !
2589,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these with my iPad Mini4. I like everything about them. Very good value.
2590,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound on my iPhone. They fit pretty good. I do have to adjust them each time, but for me that's a non issue. I like the fabric cord, it seems a lot stronger than a regular plastic cord. I would recommend and buy again."

2593,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was the 2nd pair we bought because the mic went bad, thought it was just a fluke, not it at all, they are junk!!! This set was barely used and didnt last even 4 months! Dont waste your money!"
2594,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very excited to get these... They worked perfectly, however they didn't even last a year =( They lasted less than 6 months before the sound got distorted and then stopped working....."
2595,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well constructed and durable.
2596,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was very pleased with the speed in which I received my order. These headphones are a Christmas gift so they haven't been used yet but they look great. I am sure the recipient will be pleased with them.
2597,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great for $20, and the microphone works well. I use them with the PS4 and the only part that gets annoying is the volume adjustment. It just doesn't have a happy medium between no sound and loud sound. Still, the volume isn't insanely loud, and I can still use the headphones, so 5/5."
2598,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just as discribed

2608,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing. Although they are not completely noise cancelling, the color is great and the sound quality is spotless."

2611,4.0 out of 5 stars,The headphone works really well and for the price the sound is good. I only wish it had a case even a soft case.
2612,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good looking headphones love the style than the caller, but the quality of them is bad not to sound just the headphones themselves. The soft cover that goes on your ears came apart I've only use the headphones for maybe three times."
2613,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. I hope they last!!
2614,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really great sounding headphones for the price.
2615,1.0 out of 5 stars,We bought these headphones less than 30 days ago and they already don’t work. One side stopped working and now both sides stopped working. So disappointed in them.

2622,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. I use them to and from work in NYC, the cord is heavy duty and long, which is convenient. My only con with it is the faux leather, which makes me sweat more behind my ears and my neck, but other than that, great!"

2629,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality item. BUT !!!! I wish the cord had been longer. I chose this set of headphones just because they offered the longest cord out there. Still not long enough to wear comfortably on my desk top computer.

2643,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got them for my 10 year old daughter she loves them . Very good for the price.
2644,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Less than 4 months & the connection jack no longer works. When they were working, good headphones, jut crap sustainability."
2645,1.0 out of 5 stars,Received these less than 2 months ago and already the sound cuts out and I can no longer hear. Super annoying.
2646,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones and they were great, until I was going home in the car and one ear stopped working. It lasted about four months, so they worked for a while. That ear only works if you hold it on different areas on the chord, but I still super comfortable and the microphone is in perfect shape."
2647,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!
2648,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones have really good sound!! They are comfy I use them to work out and they are perfect
2649,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Way better than expected. These headphones are some of the best I have ever tried on. They work as well as any large name brands, and cost a fraction of the price."
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Durable and good sound. I use them in my car for the children's DVD players. Not a single complaint about fit or sound from the 4, 6, or 11 year old."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't take the time very often to write a review. I purchased these headphones for my 82 year old dad for Christmas. He needed a pair of headphones to listen to the TV while running on a treadmill. I saw in other reviews that these headphones block out noise that is around you. Even though my dad is a young 82 year old, his hearing is that of a person his age. He loves these headphones and said they really do cut out the noise of the treadmill so he can hear the TV. I am very happy with this purchase!"
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these headphones for 11 year old. He loves them and they seem to work well. They are compatible with his Kindle.
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift for my daughter, and they work and look great! The black box they come in make them look a lot more expensive than they are. They work with the Xbox 1 controller too!"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,We are happy with these. Sound is good and an affordable price. They extend so if your head is a little bigger they fit well. Me and my husband both use them on our desktop and laptop computer.
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned multiple headphones before and this one is the best I have ever gotten. The sound, clarity, and bass is absolutely good and unlike the other headphones I owned this one doesn't hurt my ears."
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The packaging was nice and was folded into a plastic mold. A plus for the folding! The cups on the headphones are somewhat comfortable and so is the band. The cable that is used to plug into devices is wrapped making it stronger. The sound is not really that crisp but the bass is pretty good. Lastly, the microphone is decent and can pick up sounds of you talking without the mic being held up to the mouth. All in all, it's great!"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only thing I would’ve have wanted more from this headphone is the ability to use the mic for pc as well, which unfortunately you can’t. Sound is really good and you can hear the quality of the speakers. Comfortable to wear and stretchable with soft ear paddings. The body is made from plastic which I really don’t mind since it is durable and the cable is nylon braided which is a plus. Also, the earpads are foldable so you can carry it with you easily."
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a pair of very comfortable blu tooth headphones, but, as with all blu tooth headphones, they occasionally pop in and out. And, frankly, sometimes I just want to plug in and start listening to music without connecting, etc. I'd had a pair of Philips corded headphones with reasonable sound (I'm not an audiophile) that just wore out. So, I went to Amazon to find a replacement. I'm so glad I found these -- they're perfect! Compact (they fold), reasonably priced, and best of all, the sound is great!!"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones were actually very comfortable, even more comfortable than a MUCH more expensive pair of headphones i owned, and i can wear the AILIHEN headphones longer than i could the expensive pair.

Cancels noise pretty well, almost completely. I can skateboard and not hear the wheels clacking over the sidewalk.

Headphone quality was WAY better than the price leads you to believe, it was almost as good, (like 99% as good) as the WAY MORE EXPENSIVE PAIR i bought.

I've only had them a week or so, so i dont know how long they'll last. I'll update you if/when they break. NOTe: Expensive pair broke six months in.

Overall: Great Headphones, look nice, sound nice, feel nice. The red and black were my favorite color, went with gold though, check all colors before you make your decision."
10,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, this is a cheaper version of those expensive ""Beats by Dre"" headsets, and it is modeled to look like them. Speaking as a consumer, and as a father, I'd rather not pay $100+ for a brand name, and so I am glad to go with this option rather than the more expensive brand with identical performance.

Apart from the looks, the only thing wrong with these headphones is the length of the cord. A slightly longer cord, with some sort of soft plastic bracket to limit the length or draw the cord into a bunch, would really have gone a long way toward hitting the 5-star goal.

Sound quality is the same as any non-HD high quality headset. There are not really any noise-cancellation features, other than some padding along the ears, so take that as you will.

All-in-all, great headphones for the cost."
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first read other people reviews I said to myself what? I have expensive headphones people describing this with a great sound and very comfortable. Still I was skeptic but something in the back of my head said to me it is only 20.00 dollars if they do not meet your expectation send them back or just toss them.
I got them first impression counts a lot the package was really neat. When I used them for the first time I was very surprised by the sound. To make a long story short I took it for my workout I have to say I loved the sound I am really impressed, what the heck I paid so much for other headphones that does not have nearly a bass sound, I am very picky when it comes to headphones I need to feel I listening to music in crystal clear way. These phones delivers that, my son who is a DJ could not believe it so I guess I will be buying a second set for him."
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice headphones!! Feel good on my head and my ears, the fit is perfect for me and they sound great. I'm an older person and love that I can finally hear all the sounds in the music again! Beautiful highs, midtones and nice deep base! Pretty good at noise cancelling too, sometimes I don't really want that feature though. There are times when I want to be able to hear the outside world, for safety. But I'll just use another pair for those times. I also love that they fold up so it's easy to tuck them away in a pocket. Another thing I especially like is the braided cord...that was a wonderful idea!!! I took one star off because they won't go up as loud as I normally like, but that's just me. ( I put the 5th star back on because since they won't go as loud as this old hippy would like, that means I won't need another set of headphones without noise cancellation after all! ) This is obviously a good thing!"
13,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for my grandson, thinking he could use them while playing his video games on the XBox. It's entirely possible I didn't read all the information provided. Since I did read it had a microphone attached which is supposed to work with all sorts of devices, I figured it would work for an Xbox too. It does not. To be more accurate, it sort of works, but not well. My grandson says his friends can't hear him well or properly (cuts out a lot) when he tries using it with the video games, so it's very frustrating for him & the other kids trying to play. I count that as being worthless for video games.
At least it IS a good headset for listening to music on his cell phone &/or tablet. Must just be the microphone that's sub-par.

[side-note: I'm pretty sure I initially tried to purchase these as a lightening deal. Has any one else noticed Amazon's lightening deals expire far sooner than the site says they should??]"
14,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This review needs to be split into two sections. First there is the quality of the sound and the base which is actually amazing. The ear pads cover the ears completely and do help to eliminate some exterior noise. As far as the performance with the Audio I was very pleased, however about two days after the eligible date for returning the item past. The cord broke at the microphone. Decor you slipped out of the microphone and Winston pulled and now the earphones are completely useless in complete and total waste of money"
15,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved these at first. They had great sound and they were comfortable to wear. But less than six months and they fall apart on me. I was careful folding them, but that didn't matter. A piece on one side fell off, the cord is hanging out, and I can no longer wear them. Which sucks because they still sound good."
16,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my daughter. As soon as it showed up, I tested it before giving it to my daughter. In just a few minutes of testing it, the cable came apart and the connector appeared to be broken. This one only worked for 2 minutes. Pure junk! I have many other headphones and have never seen such poor quality. It was not worth my time to send it back or to deal with getting a refund. It actually ended up in the trash can before I recycled the box that it came in."
17,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought on January 5, 2017, They sounded great and I liked them at first but after about 5 months the sound out of the left side of the headphones comes and goes sporadically. I have used them with normal use about 3-4 days a week at work and lock them up when I off. Now I gotta find a new pair of headphones which sucks cuss I liked the sound this one had."
18,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter needed new headphones, or rather I needed her to wear headphones so I don't have to listen to her YouTube shows. The headphones are comfortable to wear because they are cushioned which also give a noise cancelling effect. The sound quality is good. The headphones fit my adult head as well as my 3.5 year old's head."
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these for a few months, now, and I love them! The sound is good, the stereo is excellent: it's amazing to hear Left and Right sound, as well as moving sound, while listening to favorite music.
I admit that I am not an audiophile, so perhaps my evaluation isn't meaningful to those of you who are audiophiles, but to the rest of the population: these are excellent, the price is very affordable, and they are comfortable, easily adjusted for different sized heads, even foldable to a degree for easier storage. I highly recommend them!"
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best Head Phones I have Heard, use them on my Kindle Fire HDX to listen to Great MUSIC. Very Crispy Sound, Great Bass."
21,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked just fine for my daughter until today when she disconnected them from her iPad and the tip of the plug pulled free from the cord and is now lodged inside her (school owned) iPad. I will stick with a name brand product going forward rather than take my chances on these again. I'll update this review if the seller is willing to replace but no money will be spent on this brand again.
22,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this for my husband to use while he is on dialysis and he loves it! Says the quality of sound is great. Now he sits at the computer with it too.
23,1.0 out of 5 stars,Items came broken
24,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For price, these are awesome. I bought 1 pair and ended up buying 2 more!"
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My experience with these are amazing. I tested these headphones with and handful of songs, and audio tests. They aren't lying when they say these are good quality headphones, with good bass. I also should mention how I got them replaced when they broke. All I had to do was email support and give them my order number, and they got it delivered. The person I talked to was also very kind. If your looking for affordable, great for their price headphones, these are it."
26,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very impressed by these headphones. They are inexpensive, yet for the price sound really good. Great overall sound including pretty good base and excellent mids and highs. They are fairly comfortable and lightweight. I'm not sure the materials would hold up to workouts or other activity like that, but for normal everyday use it should last a long time. These are an excellent sounding choice for headphones if you don't want to spend of lot of money."
27,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really happy with these earphones until this week. All of a sudden they are causing Spotify to skip songs, prompting Siri, and disconnecting phone calls. I would understand if I had been hard on them, but I only use these at my desk."
28,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very impressed with the quality of sound that these AILIHEN I60 headphones produce. They are comparable to the more expensive ones. They provide a clear and natural sound. The headband is adjustable, and are foldable for maximum portability. The cord is sturdy looking. They are light weight and have very comfortable ear pads for many hours of use. I like that they block external noise effectively. There is a built-in microphone for hands-free phone calling and it picks up my voice without me talking directly into it. I am really happy with the purchase of these headphones."
29,4.0 out of 5 stars,My husband really likes these head phones but a wire broke in the first one we purchased only months after purchasing it so we ordered a second set and are hoping for better results.
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great ear phones! I use they to talk to students over the internet that live in China! Great investment!

36,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and value. I'm pleasantly surprised with how comfortable these are and sound quality is great as well. Everything feels sturdy and well built.
37,2.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is good but the fit is pretty uncomfortable and the sound cuts out of the right side every once in a while and to fix it you have to reposition the cord.
38,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this headphones.. Sound good and for me very comfortable.

55,5.0 out of 5 stars,I think that this beautiful headphone is going be great. I don't have it but I really want it.
56,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable headphones and great at noise cancelling. If you listen to bass heavy music however, it's lacking. I saw a lot of people say it's great and while sitting in a relatively quiet bedroom, it is. However, if you use these while walking to class or on a commute to work/school, you'll find it harder to really feel and appreciate the bass in music."
57,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality for a $20 set of headphones,my only complaint would be that the cord is not removable."
58,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not to the expectations

For te money.. These sound great for sure"
82,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a third grade elementary school teacher. One of my students needed to purchase a headset, so I helped him buy one. The choice was 100% his. He looked on the internet for two days until he finally chose his ""Gold Ailihen."" He thought it was the coolest one out there! I also explained to him that considering the quality, price, and technology he made a great choice."
83,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Robust sound for very reasonable price, good quality, fast delivery, will buy again!"
84,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 11 year old loves these. Only thing I can think of to make the experience better is having them be wireless. But we bought them as is! Still awesome!
85,4.0 out of 5 stars,I just got them an they are a Christmas present for my grandson so I really don't know how they will work. but will let you know little later.. thank you
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price this is a very good set of headphones. The pair I purchased for my grandson has survived months of use and has outlasted similar other brands.
87,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my AILIHEN I60 headphones for almost 2 weeks now and WOW!!! I'm blown away by the performance of them, the bass is great, sound is crystal, noise cancelation stupendous. I put these to a test by playing music from YouTube, my phones music, and a game all at the same time... I could hear everything so clear it's as if I was listening to each one separately. I give a 5 star and would buy another pair if needed."
88,1.0 out of 5 stars,Wire shorted in the microphones after 6 weeks. Sad because it was a gift to my boyfriend to use while he's deployed overseas in the air force.
89,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fine in terms of sound quality, but they seem to be sized for people with small heads. Even extended to their full length, they barely reach to the bottom of my ears. I have had plenty of other ""overhead"" headphones in the past and not had this issue."
90,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones, I really do. My only problem is mine broke about 3 months after I got them. Music wouldn't play correctly and it fully depended on the angle of the cord. Up until this happened they were great -which is why I ended up buying another pair because I love the sound quality and mic on them. If this pair breaks again anytime soon, I'm just done with it."
91,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones serve the purpose I needed.
They are light weight, decent sound and inexpensive."
92,5.0 out of 5 stars,"smooth transaction, quick shipping, awesome headphones, they are just what I needed!"

It came in with the original box and was well protected when shipped. Highly recommended for anyone!"
94,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Although this product is really comfortable even when you wear glasses, do not buy if you think you are going to be constantly moving/bending
the wire(walking). Wire broke within 2 months Not for active people. Im switching to wireless headphones."
95,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really excited to purchase these headphones (a big step up in quality from my normal headphones).

Unfortunately, the sound went out in less than a month. Going back to $15 Sony headphones."
96,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have had it for such a short time and already the left earphone has stopped working. No sound will come out. Disappointing.
97,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE THESE.. granted they are big like the old school ones but they are VERY comfortable and I personally had problems with the earbud type because they always fell out of one ear and I also did like the fact that you could hear the background noise.. My husband was behind me talking and the yelled and I STILL didnt hear him ( hey reason enough to buy them).. and the mic works great as well
98,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's not comfortable at all.. for small heads only.
99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good set of headphone for under $20 I recommend them to anyone looking for a decent set of headphones in this price range
100,5.0 out of 5 stars,In-ear headphones are uncomfortable for kids. This are very comfortable plus have a mic. price is great and the sound very good. U got an extra pair.
101,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They're good, the cushions doesn't put strain on your ears . Its jus the drivers inside that makes the sound not so rich. But overall I'll recommend these. If you want these to sound they're best I recommend getting an equalizer"
102,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these but I bought a Hifi Elite headset at the same time. The bass/sound quality of the Hifi Elite is better, but these are good go leave near my PC for Skype etc."
103,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are great. I have beats as well and these sound just as good! I went back and ordered 4 i more for everyone in my family. Bonus.. I find them sooooo comfy
104,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Used twice now, so far, so good! Headphones are just a little smaller than expected but it's not a huge deal."
105,2.0 out of 5 stars,They did not last one year. One side stopped working
106,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The ear size is too small and uncomfortable to wear, he sound is not good as expected"
107,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great, the microphone is a massive increase in quality from my last one. Fairly comfortable as well for almost constant use. I can't really notice a difference in sound quality, but that is probably because I don't care or pay attention, but it does sound pretty good to me."
108,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice product, my kid was excited. He feels hood now because he knowwwwws not to ask for my Beats. Lol
They are loud, foldable, and stylish."
109,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight. Sturdy. Use for professional radio shows on the road. Surprised at how good sound quality was on play back and record.
110,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had to return it due to poor sound quality.
111,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for work. They are very comfortable, I do wish that the cord could have been a foot longer, but it is not that big a deal."
112,3.0 out of 5 stars,Unfortunately the metal piece that inserts into the device broke off the first time these were used. We did buy others of the same (different colors though ) that work well! Giving 3 out of five because 2 out of three of our headphones were good.
113,4.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are great. Can't beat the price.
114,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. I have an issue with background noise making it very hard to hear while talking on phone. These drown out the noise and the voices are crystal clear. I have had great feedback from my listeners as well who say they can hear me crystal clear too. Over all I am very, very happy with this purchase. I have spent a lot more for a lot less product."
115,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband needed a work headset without a bulky microphone but that stayed on easily and blocked out sound. these work nice.
116,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It was nice the first few weeks, but after about 2 weeks the right ear of the headphone stopped working. And now the headphone stopped working altogether. I bought this about a month ago. I'm not judging but this is kind of unexpected."
117,3.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable to wear. It sounds great for study jams! The microphone though did not last very long. I had this for about 4 months and the microphone just stopped working.
118,5.0 out of 5 stars,"they work and sound great, thank you"
119,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really good headphones. Fairly priced.
120,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase I have made in a long time. Sound is excellent and very well made for the reasonable price. Bought 2 for gifts and they love them.
121,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas. He wanted something with the ""Beats"" look so I told him to search Amazon and he found these. The delivery was quick and my boyfriend absolutely loves them. He uses them Id say 5 days a week when hes on Xbox. Quality and sound are great and couldn't beat the price! Great buy, totally recommend."
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones. I bought them to use with my silent violin. The sound quality is excellent!
123,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are excellent but, did not worked for my intended use. Overall, they are worth the money."
124,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my nephew and he loves them
125,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These worked fine for 2 months then the microphone stopped working. The audio is average, they are pretty low budget. The microphone sound was good until yesterday. Oh well."
126,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They seem sturdy enough and are comfortable. I am a transcriptionist so I wear them for hours on end while I type what I hear verbatim. The sound is clear and they cancel noise adequately enough I can keep the volume low. -1 star because they make a lot of noise when I move my head or neck, more than any other headphones I've ever owned. not really an issue."
127,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones for my husband and they look great as well as function very well. My husband especially liked the fact that the fold for easy packing.
128,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound...I own two of them and would not hesitate to get a third if needed!!
129,4.0 out of 5 stars,"for the price these work perfect..all i want them for is to watch movies they serve their purpose perfectly
they fit the ears nicely."
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves his headphones.
131,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great for about a month and now the headphones are trash. Plays background sounds perfectly but everything is in and out... mostly out! Waste of time and money, Do Not Bother!!!"
132,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I had wanted.
133,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It does the job pretty well, but looks fragile. Must be handled with care I guess."
134,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the Bass I have a ps4 and they work great for being a Mic A Must Buy I'm Going to Buy Another Pair Soon.
135,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice headphones
136,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased it on Jan 3rd, it stopped working today on February 4th. While it worked I was very satisfied with the sound and they were comfortable to wear. However, given this product only lasted a little over a month, I can't in good faith recommend it."
137,1.0 out of 5 stars,bought 3 pair of these great at first. All 3 of them are now broken and unusable less than 45 days later.
138,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these headphones. Very light but produce good quality sound.
139,5.0 out of 5 stars,better than expected!!!
140,1.0 out of 5 stars,The headset came on time. It was a gift for my daughter and I put it in here Easter basket. After a week of uses only one ear works. The left side ear phone doesn't work at all. I wouldn't buy from them again. I will go to a BestBuy.
141,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sound
142,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves these! We actually just bought a second pair so he can use a set for school and home. Very nice and sturdy quality.
143,1.0 out of 5 stars,"3 days after Amazon return window closed, one side completely quit working. Sound is not too bad. But quality is lacking. You get what you pay for."
144,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Safe, suitably packaged and prompt delivery. Sound quality very good. Comfortable to use and handsome appearance"
145,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound and good price level.
146,5.0 out of 5 stars,My god-daughter likes the rich color and the deep bass. The sound is crisp with enhancement of the bass. Best choice!!
147,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work well.
148,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't let the price fool you. These are great sounding headphones. Purchased to replace an expensive pair these sound great both through the microphone and the ear pieces. Works well with the xbox 360.
149,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was fooled by the 5 star ratings/reviews, I should've checked out the 1-star reviews about the weak jack. The jack broke just after the 30 day return period. Just glad in didn't break inside the iPad."
150,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is awesome! Caught them on sale, but are definitely worth the regular price."
151,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seems like well built headphones for the price and the sound quality is very good.

156,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very old , especially for the price!"
157,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I want to like these headphones, but if nothing is playing there's just an awful static I hear instead. I like wearing headphones at my computer, even if nothing is playing.
They do the same on my phone too."
158,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise cancelling is not as great as other headphones I have tried, however the microphone portion is great. I don't find them as compatible for the Samsung Galaxy is they say they are."
159,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great! My son loves these headphones, loves the fact they can fold up and the sound is great"
160,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought one before for my son, my daughter really liked it so we got another for her."
161,5.0 out of 5 stars,All I can tell you is my teen loves it and actually did chores as a thank you.
162,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon delivered as promised. Headphones were a great buy for the price and.they work great!!
163,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great one of the best head phones I have ever purchased for that price. The color is beautiful , It is light weigh and very comfortable. Would have give 5stars if it had a case"
164,2.0 out of 5 stars,"worked great for 2 months, then out of nothing just stopped working."
165,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I needed!
166,3.0 out of 5 stars,It had a really good sound quality but after some days I'm so disappointed! the left side doesn't work!!!
167,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones - excellent value for the price!
168,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product at excellent price.
169,5.0 out of 5 stars,"O..K, these are a screamin deal. High quality construction, foldable, adjustable, and superb, clear, sound. I'm impressed."
170,4.0 out of 5 stars,I wished I knew about this headphones before. They are quite comfortable to wear and carry . Cell phone conversations are head clearly and the noise cancellation feature helps out a lot. These are not Boss quality but a really good buy for the price! I listen to podcast and music with good clarity. I am very happy with this purchase.
171,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my son last Christmas. He loved them and used them all year. Said they sound great. I listened to them and they sound pretty good. I think as far as sound quality they are a steal. Unfortunately about a month ago one side went out and a couple weeks later the other side started acting up & only works part of the time. My son was really bummed.

This son takes care of his things very well. Better than me quite frankly. If he was rough with his stuff I wouldn’t take a star at all but since he treated them like his baby I’d hope they would last a couple years let alone less than one. Still, I’d say it’s a good deal. I’d give 3.5 if I could.

If I hear from someone who thinks get xan/should make it right I’ll update this review."
172,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor quality connectors- BEWARE. I puchased this headphone and the i35 in May. 2 weeks after purchased, the tip of this headphone connector came off in my kindle. I assumed my one son must have been rough with it and threw the headphones away and took the loss. One month later in July while travelling, the tip of the i35 connector also came off in my other son's ipad. This son is older and has never had this problem with headphones. Although both are comfortable, be very careful as I now have to take both digital devices to a repair shop to get the tips out and must now order 2 more headphones. BUYER BEWARE."
173,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are very good quality headphones. I bought two for us to use on a trip. For the low price I was surprised at how well they are constructed. They fold up nicely to put in my carry-on bag. They are also very comfortable to wear with just the right amount of pressure on the ears. I would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for good ones for movies or music.
174,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Right ear quit working after 2 months, with light use. Doesn't mean they will all be like that, but this was my experience. Didn't want to bother with returning, so I just bought another brand."
175,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For the $, it's a good deal. Took a chance thinking these might be better than my earbuds for talking on the phone. Found them to be obtrusive, not comfortable and my ears warmed up fairly quickly (and it's January). They are probably better for listening to music while mowing the lawn. Not so for talking on the phone."
176,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked these headphones initially. The sound is good, they're comfy and I like that they are collapsible. But unfortunately, a few weeks after I got them they started malfunctioning. They randomly activate Siri or pause something I'm watching or randomly start music. Occasionally it's because I've accidentally pressed the remote button, but more often it's just a random occurrence. As you can imagine it gets pretty irritating. I haven't used the microphone and I'd be afraid they'd randomly hang up on someone I might be speaking with."
177,1.0 out of 5 stars,"What a piece of garbage, worked for about a week than sound started crackling one side would work and go out than the other side, had to constantly turn or reinsert plug... Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this product!!!"
178,5.0 out of 5 stars,These were a Christmas gift for my son for gaming . So far he loves them and is very impressed with the quality and the sound ! they came very quickly and the packaging was excellent ! My son and I are both very impressed with the high quality and attention to detail . They appear to be made to last for a long time. I would recommend purchasing these . Update .. I'm sad to say that after 3 months use one speaker has already quit working . My son is very careful with these and can't understand how they could malfunction so quickly. Very disappointing as he loved them. Now it's too late to return through Amazon so I'm hoping I can contact the manufacturer for a replacement . This is the 2nd pair we have purchased . The first ones lasted 6 months but it was too late to ask for a replacement . If I can't get a replacement this time then I will find a different brand for next purchase.
179,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't panic when you first open them! They make a horrid cracking noise when unfolding! If you're like me, you'll panic and think you broke them but for the price they aren't bad! I bought these as a gift for someone going on a long plane ride who otherwise never wears headphones so they're great for that purpose. I did try them on when they arrived though and while I'm not sure I would want to wear them regularly for long periods (I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to headphones so take that with a grain of salt!) they are definitely great if you don't wear them often enough to justify spending the big bucks!"
180,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice
181,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the compactness when folded and the noise cancellation aspects work pretty good for such a reasonable cost.
182,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are amazing! Love the great sound and you don't have to put volume up on your device too high. Music nice and clear with great bass! Very happy with my purchase!!!
183,5.0 out of 5 stars,this is my second pair super plus
184,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is fine, but I haven't found these to be good for listening to music that has any bass in it. You're not going to hear the bass at all."
185,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After just over two months, these headphones are already broken. Beyer beware. These are cheap headphones and you will find yourself buying a replacement before you know it."
186,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality and sound
187,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are excellent headphones for the price. If you are looking for a corded set, I don't think you can beat this deal. They're bulky, but they do fold to stow. I'm enjoying the rich sound."
188,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked fine for two months but now the audio jack is sometimes coming lose while it's plugged in to my phone for some reason and I lose the audio altogether. I take good care of my electronics so I don't know why this issue has come up.
189,1.0 out of 5 stars,"broke after several months and the company will not respond to replace, even though warranty if for a year"
190,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best headphones I have ever purchased. The sound quality was more than expected. Love how they fold together...consume less space...so far so good...These are GREAT.
191,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great! Bought these headphones as a gift & have't had any problems. They are pretty loud in volume not to mention the audio sounds great.
192,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was really enjoying using these headphon but three weeks in the sound just went dead in both ears surprisingly very disappointed I really wanted these to be good but you get what you pay for i guess.
193,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They work great and my daughter loves the color,this was great you don't hear any noise outside of wearing these headphones"
194,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far I'm happy with this purchase. Looks good and comfortable
195,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have nice sound. I have not used the microphone yet so I can't say how well it works. As headphones they have nice bass, and the sound is great. Overall they are a good set of headphones. They also fold up, making it easy to store."
196,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poorly made
197,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the headphones. They look really good. Hardly hear any outside noise and they sound great.
198,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound n very comfortable!
199,1.0 out of 5 stars,"One ear makes an uncomfortable popping sound if any pressure is applied to the outside of the headphone, and the mic being inline makes it potentially very loud for anyone you might be talking to if it brushes up against your clothing."
200,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Given as a gift and the recipient loves them! Excellent sound quality, comfortable to wear and easy to store. Definitely recommend!"
201,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound quality. Good product.

205,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Clear, reliable sound. Decent bass. Mic doesnt always work with computer programs like skype or Hangouts, but maybe i have to change setting somewhere. Mic works well with my phone though!
Solid investment. This is my second pair. > accidentally sat on the last pair:-/ <"
206,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this product used it for 2 weeks at home with iphone6 no longer works can't return because ""return window"" is closed! NOT HAPPY"
207,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones at a great price
208,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They did break in a little over a month, however I think that was more of my fault than the product. Great sound quality and really comfortable."
209,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not using this yet, I buy them for a trip but the sound is good, but do not cancel the noise just reduce a little bit. Anyway I love the can fold and they are not heavy that is important for me because I do not need my headphones get heavy with all the stuff that I need to bring in a trip."
210,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are really nice
211,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second purchase, first was for myself and this is a gift for a family member. I love it! Very comfortable for long hours and quick needs. Easily folds, good quality."
212,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 2 and within a week one of them started working only intermittently, a few days later it stopped working completely."
213,4.0 out of 5 stars,My grandson's love them
214,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones. Nice, thick, weaved cable (instead of rubber). Doesn't snag or crimp."
215,2.0 out of 5 stars,Nice fit but it keeps disconnecting when I make or receive phone calls. Sending them back.
216,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are not beats but they are not $300 either. Great value for the money.

218,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are very good headphones. I am very hard of hearing and am able to hear my Kindle well.
219,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones really exceeded my expectations. Deep bass sound and very stylish. I use mine at work to analyze employee work and also music. Great product.
220,5.0 out of 5 stars,Oh man... I had no clue they would be this good! Just got em today and in the office where folks are loud. Can't hear them at all and I barely have the volume at like 15-20%. Will definitely get me some more for home/travel!!!
221,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality product w/ excellent sound!
222,4.0 out of 5 stars,works fine
223,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bass is extremely disappointing. I know these aren't expensive headphones, but the $9 ifrogz headphones from Walmart sound WAY BETTER. I will be returning these."
224,5.0 out of 5 stars,exactly as described
225,4.0 out of 5 stars,I gave as a gift.
226,2.0 out of 5 stars,"these headphones were pretty good (great sound quality, very noise-cancelling, albeit kind of small) except i had them plugged into my computer and when i unplugged them, the plug got stuck in the computer and broke off of the headphones."

230,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It wasn't so bad... I used it for a few hours before my ears started to hurt, but after a couple weeks or so it stopped working. I suggest it if you are just listening to music or something but I don't recommend it if you want to use it for playing video games."
231,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have paid a lot scratch for big name head only to be disappointed these however are awesome very good sound and nicely built
232,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound ! They are loud and I can't even hear myself speak when I listen to these ! I bought them for my bf and tried them out they are awesome just be careful because when you fold and unfold them their a little stiff so don't break them when unfolding them .
233,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst headphones. Lasted less than a week.
234,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely some nice headsets for the money. I bought these instead of turtle beaches.
235,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wanted a good pair without the big price. So far the I60 has held up great. Sound is crisp and the headphones block about 90% of the ambient noise. Also very comfortable. They do come with a mic but have found that wen I use with my phone I can't hear what I am saying.
236,2.0 out of 5 stars,"""inline volume controls"" ??? Never able to find controls of any kind. Not impressed. Way too big for phone use."
237,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent, good sound, comfy."

242,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these headphones don't get me wrong, but the quality is mediocre on some parts. however the wire feels great and the pads for the ears are good the rest is... eh."
243,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They were pretty good at first but didn't last long, the sound went out on the left ear and then would come back then go out.. We went on vacation and on the plane they both went out.. good while they lasted"
244,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are great headphones & I love them.
245,5.0 out of 5 stars,No problems
246,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son has been very pleased with these headphones. They are comfortable and the sound quality has been great. They are priced at a great value. The gold finish is very nice and unusual and goes with his gold colored laptop.
247,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones with great sound. It mimics a surround sound system and is really nice. My only problem is that after wearing for an extended period of time it starts to hurt my ears. But it might be a personal problem.
248,3.0 out of 5 stars,it headphones but the cable snags and broke. if they had a detachable cable like beats it would be a 5 star
249,4.0 out of 5 stars,great product low price
250,4.0 out of 5 stars,The best.....
251,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product very happy with it
252,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these headphones they were deliver quickly and they have a very rich sound. I'm able to talk over the internet without any problems.
253,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
254,3.0 out of 5 stars,Quality is pretty good but the cushions aren't that soft and hurt my ears after a shorter time than expected.
255,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable. The microphone is great. Hopefully I won't have to get another pair, but if I do, I'll buy this brand. Thanks for a great product."
256,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best out there but if you're looking for good headphones at a typically low price I recommend these.
257,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Seem to work okay, but unless it was repackaged (despite being a new product), there should be a volume control included. The box says that they feature ""volume control"", but they do not.
Also they didn't come with any instructions for the remote, which seems pretty strange."
258,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are very good headphones. Really cuts out the noise from around me while providing good quality sound.
259,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product. I like headphones with a wire, charging wireless headphones is just to much trouble for me. The cost is very reasonable, I loose things to easily. The wire is cloth covered, untangles easily. Sound quality is great. It has good looks and folds up nicely for storage."
260,1.0 out of 5 stars,On our second pair of headphones and the microphone went out within the first month. Very unhappy with this brand. The first pair took 6 months for microphone to go out. Will not be buying these again!!!

264,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality for the price: sharp look, comfortable fit , and great sound."
265,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Can't believe the quality of these headphones. Adjustable fit is very comfortable, noise canceling and the bass is unreal. You won't be disappointed in this purchase."
266,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for an upcoming trip. We'll have to wait to see how it works.
267,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sound and price!
268,4.0 out of 5 stars,work find.
269,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are very very comfortable. Since I use them for my cellphone and still want to hear what is around me I can comfortably adjust the fit so I hear through my right ear, thus ""freeing"" up my left ear. I am very happy with this purchase."
270,2.0 out of 5 stars,They were nice while they lasted. I've had them for 6 months and they are already defective. I have to constantly twirl the input to hear sound. It cuts in and out constantly when I'm moving with my phone in my hand.
271,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it, but doesn't have a volume control"
272,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works good. Breaks super easy though.
273,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband loves these headphones. Thanks for an awesome gift- good quality and color.
274,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is our 3rd headphones set and we are very satisfied with them.
275,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are average I've had better but had worse, they do hurt the ears after just about an hour. They have a cool design and had pretty good sound bass is ok but if u try to watch a movie with them u would think u were in a bathroom with all the echo. All in all good product for price"
276,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got them very quickly! They're for my almost 10 year old daughter and she's going to love them. Silly, but the sleek black box they come in make them looks more expensive than they are. Gonna be a big hit!"
277,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works wonderful, and great customer service"
278,4.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE them! The bass is rich and really good but it doesn't do a good job when you're listening to songs that focus a lot on treble
279,3.0 out of 5 stars,used for school good product
280,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Impressed with the quality of these headphones for the price. We have bought several off brand options before and were disappointed with the fit and comfort, however these are very comfortable both around the ears and over your head. The foldable feature is also really nice. The only reason that I'm rating these 4 instead of 5 stars is that the sound quality is not quite as great as we had hoped and you can definitely hear what someone is listening to when they have them on. I still think they were wonderfully priced on sale for the quality we got and would recommend to anyone that isn't looking to spend a fortune on some comfortable, portable headphones, just don't expect them to be 'noise canceling'."
281,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this head phone for my 10 years old girl for her bday, she didn't use this for two weeks, one side just completely stop working, I'm gonna try to return this product, spend a little more get a better one."
282,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for the price! My only complaint about the design of the headphone itself is that my ears tend to get sore from the pads.

My first set unfortunately ended up breaking (a piece inside must have come loose in one of the phones so whenever I turned my head I would hear a harsh rattling sound from that piece moving inside). I contacted Ailihen. They were extremely helpful. They sent me another headphone free of charge without any issue and the replacement came within a few days. I would definitely consider purchasing other products from them in the future."
283,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have low volume, weak bass and after only a few weeks of use, the plug end is malfunctioning. Has to be wiggled to get full sound. These headphones are cheap and now i have to throw them away."
284,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones! These are my third pair (my husband lost the first two) and I haven't ever had a problem with them. They can even withstand my toddler getting a hold of them!
285,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is great for a non-audiophile. Good bass and soundproofing.

After a couple hours though they seem to hurt the sides of my ears from pressing on them. Not sure if it's the shape of my ears or size of my head but I need to take a break every few hours."
286,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know much about headphones but the sound quality is great. The fact that it folds into itself is really nice for storage or bringing it around. The cord is sturdy and feels like it won't brake. I have not tried out the microphone but I am sure that it will be great like the rest of the product. The only issue I had is that after about 30 min of wearing them, my ears hurt from the pressure. They are a bit too small."
287,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The bass is great and the noise isolation seems to work pretty well. They are also very comfortable. Like any pair of headphones I have ever had I need to take them off after like 2 hours or so because it starts to get a little irritating having something in or on your ears that long, but compared to others these are pretty comfortable for an extended period of time.

By the way I saw a comment posted which said that you can't skip to the next song with these headphones, but actually you can. You just have to hit the answer button twice, just make sure you do so fast enough. If you do it too slow it just pauses the song then plays it."
288,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best $15 I ever spent. Perfectly good sound quality and they don't squeeze my head so hard I get a headache.

Update a year or so later: Still love them. Bought one for everyone in the family, my daughter brutalizes hers and I’ve had to replace a couple for her but they take a beating, last long enough, and are cheap to replace. I’m a fan."
289,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 8 year old son needed a new set of headphones for school as you have to provide your own. I tried them myself and the sound is very good. The headphones are very comfortable; they swivel to fit your ear and lengthen to fit your head properly. It is a stylish design and the blue is very vibrant.
290,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great, until they didn't, just 3 months into using them (and a month after the return window closed) - definitely not worth the money!"
291,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves them.
292,5.0 out of 5 stars,Right speaker went out after two weeks.
293,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great price. Also, great for using on my laptop when looking at Facebook or Videos. The only thing I don't care for is I still hear background noises around me from my husband's TV or microwave, etc."
294,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my son. They arrived quickly and sound great. He uses them for gaming and music and loves them. Great quality for the price
295,2.0 out of 5 stars,Broke right away. Had it for 2 weeks.

299,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Stopped working cord doesn't connect properly returned today, need sturdy connection point"
300,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So so headphones. Sounds okay but no volume control, only a little button for on off. I bought is similar priced product as well for my kids which had a volume control and will give that product a 5 stars for value."
301,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited to finally get these headphones, however after using them for 2 weeks the right headphone stopped emitting sound. Horrible buy!!"
302,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For a pair of $20 headphones, they work very well. Fair sound quality, excellent noise isolation, comfortable, and a nice design to go along. However, the headphones do leak sound when listening to music on high volumes. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase but don't expect studio quality."
303,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I live in hands-free Vermont, we need headphones to use our mobile phones in a car (or truck, in my case) and these work great!"
304,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent product-comfortable-clear-reasnable price-highly recommended
305,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product my son love them. I tried them great sound and noise cancellation.
306,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good
307,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not unhappy with the headphones I purchased except that they do no lock on my head, therefore they fall off when I'm walking around let's say listening to podcasts and cleaning. Any suggestions?"
308,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice!
309,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cool headphones 🎧 just as good as dr.dre beats and dont have to use batteries for them just plug them in i do recommend these to people.
310,4.0 out of 5 stars,This product was shipped and delivered on time. The sound isnt the best but you get what you pay for. I have no problems with the headphones. It does what its suppose to. I would order from Ailihen again.
311,5.0 out of 5 stars,Daughter loves them
312,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was purchased as a Christmas gift for a child. The headphones seem well designed and built. They fit comfortably on both a child and adult head. I'm impressed and would recommend them.
313,1.0 out of 5 stars,Earphones have stopped working already...just under 3 months now I need to b purchase another pair for my....the earphones were supposed to be durable but they could not hold up to daily use only within a little under 3 months. They were a Christmas gift for my son
314,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an audiophile by any means, but... I love these!!! The sound and range / bass is great!!"
315,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe it was my phone but these headphones were very low. If i had kanine hearing i would give it 5 stars but they look good. I just dont like to look at them, id rather listen to them."
316,5.0 out of 5 stars,"GREAT BASS,CLEAR MUSIC, LOVE THEM, GREAT VALUE"
317,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent. Speakers for the cost
318,2.0 out of 5 stars,Had a week. Every item we used the headphones on it worked differently. On my iPad it worked normal. My cellphone only one ear worked. My sons PS4 controller people couldn't hear him talk. When they work they are great.
319,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great...!!
320,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They're comfortable and they do the job. There is a little bit of static when there's no sound coming through, but while listening to something they're fine."
321,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sound!
322,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was not sure what to expect when I ordered this.The price was cheap.I have to say having this now,what a bargain it was.I use it for calling people.Everyone says that it sounds fantastic."
323,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice set of headphones for a price I'm good with. I'm not an audiophile, but they sound good to me. The noise cancellation is nothing major, but it's enough to take the edge off of my bus commute. Plus, they fold up for semi-easy storage. A nice headphone experience overall."
324,1.0 out of 5 stars,Plug came off inside my controller.......
325,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for the money. Use them for recording and they do a great job of isolating background noise and truly reflecting what is being played. Bass is strong, major plus. Better than most more expensive headphones"
326,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great earphones. Sound quality is really good can't complain. One minor thing the cord is really long a plus is some instances a small hassle in others.
327,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome sounding headphones, great fit, great cord length, very comfortable when working out. Great Job"
328,5.0 out of 5 stars,Christmas gift to my grandson--he loved it!
329,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Plug breaks easily along with mic... not recommend for gaming, but for casual listening it will do the job"
330,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound incredible!!! Good as beats headphones, but without the pricetag!!! Great buy!!!"
331,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ear pads are small on my ears ,microphone hard to figure out"
332,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for my son. He loves them. They are great headphones for preteens..Asthetically pleasing, and they don't cost an arm and a leg, and they work great for the YouTube watching, game playing, etc."
333,1.0 out of 5 stars,"At first the headphones worked fine and look great, but they quit working after 2 months. Shipping was poor. Product arrived several days after expected."
334,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headset is nice, comfortable and works well."
335,5.0 out of 5 stars,For my grandson but tried them out and they are great. Well made
336,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works
337,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used more expensive headphones that didn't compare to the Ailhen I60's. Not only is the sound good, the headphones block out most ambient noise, including screaming hollering kids,wife, or many other unwanted noise."
338,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, great look, great fit. I'll let you know in a few months how they hold up."
339,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for my 11 year old daughter, and she LOVES them. She loves what they look like, says the sound is great and says they are VERY comfortable!"
340,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones. Purchased for use on my iPhone, iPad and Mac, they are very lightweight and the folding design makes them super easy to transport."
341,2.0 out of 5 stars,cord went bad really quick
342,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My son really likes these. They fold up conveniently. The only drawback is that they hurt his ears after awhile, but he says that's just a good reminder not to wear them too long."
343,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my grandson and he loves them. He says they are comfy and the sound is clear.
344,1.0 out of 5 stars,one side quit right away. They may look nice but i would not recommend them!
345,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sound Quality
346,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son loves them. Comfortable fit, great sound. Received a 20% off coupon with the order. My daughter likes them, too, so we just used the coupon to order another pair for her."
347,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my husband and used it for a work call, it was great! Buying one for myself now!"
348,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cool love them.
349,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke after just a few months of use. Very disappointed.
350,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Aux cord broke as soon as my son plugged it to his phone, I have to get his brand new phone fix to get the little pieces out...smh(this is my first bad review in 5-6 years)"

353,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones.The sound quality and material are outsanding for the price.. I had bought a pair of Sony ones at Best Buy for a much higher price, which I returned after I tried this one. I also ordered a second pair for my daughter.. highly recommended!!"
354,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones great stereo in really blocks out the noise even if there's nothing playing hoping I don't break them like every other pair that I have gotten in the past
355,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones... Fast ship
356,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent quality for a low price! Great sound quality and comfortable to wear, even for long periods of time (which I do, as I'm a walker). I'm very happy with this purchase."
357,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones, but they broke recently. they are extremely high quality but break easily"
358,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great head phones for a good price !
The head phones adjust to fit the size of your head.. they are comfortable and stay on well not to mention great sound quilty. Definitely buy again"
359,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I needed.
360,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are extremely comfortable and provide good sound quality while doing a good job in blocking out outside noise. I was so pleased, I ordered a second one immediately to have as a replacement or as a gift."

363,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. Keeps noise out well. Very comfortable to wear.
364,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A good headphone for its price. It hurts the ears though, after a couple of hours. The holes for the ears should not be round. It costs just as much to make them oblong to accommodate most ears."
365,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just bought another one.
366,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Heavy, doesn't fit on ear, got ear pain, sound quality is ok"
367,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works as hoped. No complaints.
368,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As soon as I opened the box, my dad took the headphones out, tried them on, and kept them, so I ended up having to buy a second pair. I love them and so does he. They are exactly what I was looking for: comfortable, over the ear, noise cancelling, and sleek."
369,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not only the sound is fantastic, but it nearly cancels out surrounding noise. It is also comfortable and stylish. I'd definitely recommend these headphones to anyone."
370,5.0 out of 5 stars,"fit well, sound good"
371,3.0 out of 5 stars,vary cheap feel but works ok
372,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son (8) bought these and he loves them. Thanks for proving something that has both good sound quality and is affordable!
373,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought them for my son in 8th grade for school
He said they work great.
The price point is good because anytime an electronics goes to school anything could happen to it."
374,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Died before a month, threw away the box..cannot return"
375,4.0 out of 5 stars,loved these
376,4.0 out of 5 stars,Solid purchase. Had it for a few days. I like the material they used for the cord.
377,2.0 out of 5 stars,one of the set of two i bought stop working a day after use
378,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
379,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great design and very good product. works as advertised
380,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is great when taking into account the price. It feels comfortable, has good sound, and looks nice!"
381,5.0 out of 5 stars,"sounds great, am going to order another."
382,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice sound quality. Bought for my 12-yea-old son and he loves them.
383,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones with what i think of as awsome sound quality.
384,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great item, great sound. affordable."
385,5.0 out of 5 stars,I received the item in a timely manner and the sound is good for the money. I like the cord because it doesn't get twisted up. I would recommend this product to a friend.
386,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hasn't lasted that long. My only issue is that the wire that connects the the headphone piece is messing up and won't emit sound unless places a certain way
387,3.0 out of 5 stars,These worked great for about 2 months. Now the sound isn't coming through unless you jiggle the cord around a bit. Pretty bummed about it.
388,3.0 out of 5 stars,Headset came with mic not working properly.
389,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice. I loved them so much. High quality voice and soft to the ears. Also you can fold them and keep them in a small space. On top of that very affordable price.
390,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these on sale, so I can't be too disappointed. They are ok. My problem with them is the right headphone doesn't play as loudly as the left. If any pressure is applied to the right headphone it creates a loud crackling noise in your ear, which sometimes makes the sound come out better... weird and loud, but it works sometimes. Other than that, they are comfortable. You get what you pay for I suppose. Definitely would not buy these for someone else or recommend them."
391,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Holy Moly... I got two of these and they are fantastic.... the sound is good and clear, and it really does block other noises out... I had purchased a cheap model at a retailer and then saw these... the others we keep in the car to use when traveling, but these end up in the car too! don't get just one... get two for that purpose alone, leave one in the car. Helps when I'm online working and the TV is on in the next room... I don't hear it. Great product... may buy a couple more just to have on hand"
392,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is great so far. It's lightweight, sound quality is superb for the price. Earphones are very comfortable as is the adjustable headband. The microphone works, too. It is superior in most respects to the $100 headphones I bought, which has a defective microphone. The only reason for the four stars? Durability is a question mark. The lightweight and low price suggests to me that it's potentially an issue. Yet I did drop it a couple of times on carpet and it seems to be just fine."
393,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift, but the person receiving these headphones was very pleased. Note that the box said for Iphone, Ipad, etc., but the description when ordering said all smartphones and laptops. Luckily the description was right because the recipient does not have the Iphone but another smartphone and the headphones did indeed work."
394,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: The customer service has been great and they got back to me really quickly. The replacement headset works great and I have not had nay issues with it so far.

Update: I have had these headphones for a little over 2 months and the mic no longer works on this. I don't extensively use these headphones so I'm not sure why the mic would just go out. I guess you get what you paid for.

March review:
I have had these headphones for a week now. The sound on it is very good for headphones less than $20. The muffs on them are very comfortable. The mic on it is also very good."
395,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The problem with these headphones is that they are designed for iphones and ipods. They absolutely did not work with my Moto x and the sound quality on my dell laptop was not great, I had to tune the audio settings to strike the right balance. When I plugged it into my docking station I had to change my audio settings again. I did not have to change anything with other headphones. They seemed to work fine with my wife's iphone and when they did work the sound isolation was good. That's the only good thing about these."
396,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Folks a cpl months after i have had this item, it is malfunctioning. What it does is activated ur phones voice setting which interrupts the music or vid u r listening too. It happens so often that i have to take it out. If it's not the voice activation, it sends the volume up and down over and over. I'm not sure if it's the 3.5mm jack or something else..but that's what's happening. Check out other brands, this one gives trouble."
397,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these as gaming headphones for my Xbox One and they sound amazing! I mostly use them for talking with friends and playing sports games, but I'm sure they would be great for those who play shooter games casually. The lows and mids sound great for music and I would definitely recommend them for those looking to find an inexpensive headphone option."
398,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were ordered so my hubby could watch his news programs while I watched another TV program, both of us in the same room sitting next to each other. They keep the noise out for him and I can't hear his program. They are very comfortable and we are both pleased."
399,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It sounded pretty good, blocking most of the outside noise, unlike most headphones I used. Yet, after having it for 30 days, the cord was damaged, and now there is no noise on my right side. I still use it around the house, but I'll have to fix it or purchase another in the future."
400,2.0 out of 5 stars,These were definitely my fave but it's been less than a month and the cord is fraying. I use them when recording and editing my show and I can't afford my equipment breaking just from general use. I'm disappointed
401,5.0 out of 5 stars,I cannot agree more with the soft material it says it is made. Volume is great and easy to put away. Highly recommended
402,3.0 out of 5 stars,No noise-cancellation from my talking colleagues. Audio is good.

427,4.0 out of 5 stars,"You notice the drop in noise as soon as you put them on, even before the music starts. Annoying co-workers? Put these babies on and block them out. Turn the music on and you will be in your own world, getting your work done without wanting to scream at the people around you. I am NOT a big music person who cares about the bass or whatever. I am strictly one who wants to drown out the soap opera going on around me, put on some music that will get me moving and get my work done. I can't answer any questions about technical stuff, but I can tell you that they play loud and you will NOT hear anything but what you are listening to."
428,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, those headphones are amazing. I have a stepson who plays music and these block out drum sounds. A must buy!"

I had originally bought a pair for my 16 yr old daughter for Christmas. However, after seeing them and testing the design, music quality, etc. etc, I literally bought a pair for almost everyone on my list. I'm even planning on getting myself some after the holidays!! I can't wait!!"
502,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For the first few months, audio was perfect and crystal clear. Honestly, these were one of my best headphone purchases I ever made. Sadly, a few weeks ago, audio can no longer be heard from the right side of the headphones, unless I tilt my head in an uncomfortable way and the wires decide to work. I’ve tried to figure out what is happening, but I have no idea and can’t fix them"
503,2.0 out of 5 stars,Item sounded good and microphone picked up background noise. Product stopped working 2 days after return window. I bought it on March 19th and the cord shorted out on April 20th while walking through the supermarket. I used the headset almost daily with the phone in my pocket. I assume that is why the cord stopped working.
504,4.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with headphones. Sound is good. I will vouch for that because my son couldn't hear me when I was talking to him;) only complaint is the ear part is definatly on the small size.

508,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for my kids to use in school. The sound seems decent especially for the price. I like that these don't feel flimsy and would think they should last the school year. They fold up nice and fit nice for kids and adults.
509,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are amazing. They are comfortable, they bump and thump LOUD. The sound is crisp and clear and the noise cancellation is amazing. Also the color is even better and more vibrant than in the picture. My roommate has beats and he is a little jealous of how I got these for only 17$ which was a steal.

616,5.0 out of 5 stars,to be honest i never heared if this brand before. just got it 2 days ago. i like the headphones. very solid. the sound is great ( i use it daily). headphones could be folded and length could be adjusted on both sides. the microphone works great. well packaged - could be a good gift. i hope it will last for a long time :)
617,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As I said they are okay. They work, my grndson can use them but they are nothing like pictured. I would have returned them but they were a Christmas present and he used them immediately. Since they worked, I left it alone but I wasn't happy it wasn't as I ordered."
618,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these for my daughter for Christmas. She loves them. I tried them out myself and the sound is clear and the bass...beautiful!! I was hesitant because I'm not familiar with this brand. But, the reviews are good so I gave them shot. So far, so good."
619,2.0 out of 5 stars,The design and the look is pretty good- these headphones are good to look at but not wear. They were so tight over my ears I could only have them on for an hour tops before I had to remove them. To uncomfortable for me to enjoy my music or podcasts.
620,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are some of the best I've ever had, and for a great low price, these are hard to beat!"
621,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my 7 year old daughter. She loves it because it's foldable and the sound is perfect. Very stylish and durable.

630,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my boys as Christmas gift. he loves it and this headphones has super bass. LOVE IT!!!
631,3.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great for what I use them for which is working out at the gym. They are lightweight and very comfortable. The volume is not as loud as I would like. I like my classic rock and like it loud. The quality of sound is what I would expect from headphones of this price. No real definition of instruments. A bit muddy. For the price they are fine.
632,5.0 out of 5 stars,Plugged them into a iPhone V and use it for hands free phoning. Sounds good and works so far ...
633,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a gift for my son and I was very impressed with it especially for the price I would recommend it

676,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy
677,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I give these four stars. The sound quality is good. Mid-ranges are a bit muddy, but the bass really is surprisingly rich! No major complaints here, however I will say that I feel the sizing on these headphones is on the petite side, better suited for women or adolescents perhaps as my husband's head was too large for these to be comfortable on him. I found them a perfect fit myself though, and plan to keep them!"
678,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the headphones. Ordered a second set!
679,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product. Would definitely recommend.

720,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality, they just kind of hurt my ears after a little while of wearing them. I didn't want to pay the shipping back so I will just give my ears a break now and then. Also works well with my Xbox one and can use as a mic."
721,2.0 out of 5 stars,Broke within a week. Returned.
722,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They are Ok, not very expensive so they will do. I bought them to use on my cell phone for conversations but they sound very tinny and it can be difficult to hear at times so I would not recommend them for this purpose. I tried them listening to music and they work well enough, I am not a big music critic and would not feel right spending big dollars for a headset so I am happy with them for this purpose. The folding option was appealing but even folded they take up a good deal of space so I don't think this is much of a benefit."
723,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible I try on 3 different devices all bad sound and you can't plug it all the in or sound only comes out of one side
724,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, WOW ! Sound is great, I play it with my I-pod,and the sound is great, and if you like bass, well it has it, I'm a DJ and I really like these for the price, and good block out noise. Good job on these, Ailihen !"
725,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent head phones. My wife got these for using around the house. She said they do a great job of blocking out ambient sound and delivers a great sound for the music and games she plays. She even uses them to mow the yard.
726,1.0 out of 5 stars,We bought a pair of these and within less than two weeks the port/sound started going out. After some email discussion the seller replaced the headphones which also stopped working within a week the second pair. Didn't even bother asking for another pair bought skull candy instead
727,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best headphones! Great sound and fits into all my devices.
The least thing I liked was getting it out of the box, What a terrific product!!!!!"
728,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Package came when promised. These headphones are for our 12 year- old grandson who lives in another state. From what his mother says, he loves them! He uses them with his iPhone 5C.. plugs them I,. listening to music. He said they are great!"
729,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is seriously amazing! The sound and ass go so loud unlike my last pair of headphones, so this is definitely an improvement! And I love the mic so I don't have to take out my phone to answer, especially when it's cold. After a while it does feel a little bit pressure with my ears but I honestly just remove them and then put them back on my ear and the problem's solved. All in all, I would definitely recommend this product!"
730,4.0 out of 5 stars,"very comfortable and good quality sound.
speedy delivery too!"

769,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than expected, would recommend"
770,5.0 out of 5 stars,These phones are great. Just what I needed tocover the noise the TV make when my other half that can't hear cranks up the volume so she can hear the TV. I use them on a desk top ans watch Star Wars. I hear all the music that I never knew was there until I used these head phones and they are Exellant for small sounds that you do not hear when you watch a disc thru a player.

823,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son love it
824,4.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible sound.
825,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I own and operate my own recording studio and own several different pairs of headphones ranging in quality. I ordered the i60's after my old pair of Skullcandy Hesh wore out, just as a casual listening pair while I'm traveling, writing, etc.

What must be understood is that these headphones are affordable for a reason. They are not high-end and the sound quality is ok but not great. They are a little bassy as over-ear headphones can be but the clarity is significantly less than what you would get with a better pair of headphones.

That said, the value is pretty outstanding. The cord is long and covered with a sturdy woven material, the headpiece is comfortable and they fold up nicely. For under $20, it's a good buy. Just don't expect them to sound crystal clear or to be good for any serious or professional listening."
826,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked well when they did, i bought them roughly two weeks ago. They recently have been cutting out if the cord is touched the wrong way, and when they don't work, the audio is absolutely horrible. Otherwise, the audio was fantastic and personally the sound cancellation is very effective.
If the problems become unbearable in a short time, I will return these."
827,1.0 out of 5 stars,My kid loved these headphones. The color is amazing and rich. She loved the sound and noise cancelling for watching her favorite shoes on her Kindle. Then she dropped the Kindle which was fine by the way and the encasement around the connector broke. That's that! So much for her favorite X-mas gift.
828,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for the money, their a excellent value. My kids love them, and I'll definitely be buying a few more pairs for my other kids as well."
829,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received these and am already loving them! They are easily adjustable and very light weight. I personally hate earbuds...they are uncomfortable and tend to fall out often. These headphones are comfortable...and since they cover the ears they are better at cutting outside noise and give a deeper, more stereotype sound. Best for sitting and enjoying music, movies, etc. I would most definitely recommend these for anyone who, like me, just don't like earbuds!
Only reason I don't give them five stars is because I don't yet know how they will perform in the long run."
830,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones which I bought for my 11 year old son were a disappointment. They very quickly stopped working properly, he initially was not able to hear voices and they suddenly failed to work at all with the computer and eventually not with his Kindle either. At this time the cord also broke where it would be plugged in to a device. Overall a waste of money, luckily the price had been significantly reduced!"
831,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This headset is comfortable to wear. It looks neat.
The quality is not any less than the other Logitech headsets I've bought before
and the price is about half of those or less.
It is also great that you can fold it."
832,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Tight on the ears. I had too get used to them. About 4 months in the microphone began to be spotty and low volume, now 5 months in the right speaker is completely dead.."
833,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Seem sturdily made. Not real comfortable to wear, especially since it does not have any form of genuine padding where it sits on the top of the wearer head. Sound is a little tinney. However, the price was right."
834,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these to replace a very expensive pair that got broken. I should have bought these to begin with. Good quality, they look really nice and my son likes them better than the $65 one he had."
835,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great earphones for the price. I bought these to replace a pricier pair ($60+) that my kids broke and thought I might buy ones that were less expensive and easier to replace if broken again (LOL). I have been very pleased this these. The noise canceling is excellent and the sound clarity is very good. They are better than my previous pair that I spent 4x the money on. Excellent purchase for $
836,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The look and quality of product is really good. As far as sound quality goes the bass isn't really all that great. I guess that's expected for the price. But it's great to watch videos, movies, etc. I just gave mine to my son who uses on his phone for YouTube."
837,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I normally use it for conference calls and it works great. Superior sound quality. Easy folding option. The microphone has very good quality, and I use it to record some of my music. Been using it for five months and still works very well. Highly recommended."
838,3.0 out of 5 stars,I can't say I'm a fan of the ear cushions on the earphones. I feel like my head is overheating when I wear them.
839,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are so incredibly handy. I live in New York city and wish I could cancel out all of the noise when I walk around. These headphones do that, but also allow me to listen to music and talk on the phone without having to take the phone out of my pocket. Amazing."
840,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked ok for a week with gentle use. Then stopped working entirely. Just ok sound, terrible quality product."
841,4.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these for doing conference calls on my laptop for work. The headphones are excellent. The only problem is they do such a good job of outside noise reduction that I have a hard time hearing myself when I speak. As a fix I just move them slightly off my ears.
842,5.0 out of 5 stars,i purchased these for a friend going to italy for a couple of weeks. he loved them and happy he had them on his 8 hour flight!! great price and definitely were helpful to keep out noise when watching movies. would definitely buy again. maybe ill get a pair for myself too!!
843,2.0 out of 5 stars,I gave this a why CORD. I have to play with it meaning when put it in I HAVE TO PLAY WITH THE CORD. To hear both sides. HOWEVER this MAY BE A RECALL. TECHNICALLY always IMPROVING
844,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After using them two times, they don't work. Very disappointing."
845,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent earphones for the price. The noice reduction quality is excellent, and the sounds are pure. The cord is substantial, wrapped in a material to keep it from linking. Very satisfied with this purchase."
846,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are fine for someone that likes a headphone that goes around the whole ear. I don't. After putting them on I decided I probably won't ever use them. I would prefer a headphone that is soft foam that just sits one the ear. Not around it. Oh well.
847,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ugh! I never do reviews I'm not going to lie. I'm lazy. But I'm so annoyed with these headphones. I should have at least read the reviews. We've had these for less than a week! Already they aren't working. When using to watch videos/movies they crack and cut out and when trying to use them for calls or playing online you can't hear the person on the other end. DO NOT BUY THESE! They are a waste of time and money! Returning!
848,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Buy these headphones while you can, judging from Amazon' huge discount, they will not be around
much longer. Outstanding performance, outstanding quality."
849,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality! I bought these for my twelve year old son for Christmas and he uses them almost every day. They are perfect. Lots of people have marveled at the neat way they fold up and how comfortable they feel.
850,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my 14-year-old son and he absolutely loves them! They are nice looking, have great sound quality, and are very comfortable! The size adjusted easily for my older sons who tried them and also found them to be good quality. Great purchase for the cost!!!"
851,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very happy with these headphones. Good, deep base, the microphone works very well, even in noisy environments, and the headphones do a great job of blocking out surrounding noise. An absolute steal for this price."
852,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves these and little brother liked them so much he begged for some for Christmas so we already have them ordered and on their way!
853,3.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE 9/13/2017: I had to drop a star for low durability. The headphones snapped and broke in the headband while just sitting on my head, 9 months into ownership. I am dissapointed.
*********
So I had to really think about how I wanted to review this product. Here goes:

What you're getting: Really good $20 headphones.
What you're not getting: Really good $50 headphones.

If I had just bought these without reading reviews, I would have really liked them. But having read almost unanimous glowing reviews, my expectations were a little higher... and were disappointed. So the details:

Style: Apparently this detail matters to people. I think they look cool enough, but I don't really trust my fashion sense, so whatever.

Durability: It hasn't broken in the week since amazon delivered it. Its construction seems strong enough that I'm not afraid something will break if I sneeze too hard. Will update if I have worse results as time goes on.

Sound Quality: I'd score it 8/10, or, ""pretty good."" I wasn't really looking for more than that, so I'm happy, though reviews lead me to expect better. It seems like they put a lot of effort [succesfully] in having an effective base, and clear trebles. The weakness is with the mids, which sound a bit muddy and indistinct to a picky ear.

Comfort: This is my main complaint with these headphones. I was particularly looking for headphones designed/reviewed for comfort, because I've experienced the frustration of constant ear-ache 30 minutes into whatever you're listening to. Description/reviews glowed for the comfort of this product.

Well... I got them, and 30 minutes in... ear-ache. They're actually worse than my previous, lower quality earphones. It's improved some since I first got them, as usage has stretched them a little wider so they don't press so tight against my head. But I thought I was buying ""comfortable"" and I got, ""Not as bad as it was at first."" In the future, I'll probably limit myself to ""Over the Ear"" instead of ""On the Ear.""

For anyone interested in the level of noise isolation: I can still hear my baby crying [though muffled], but my wife has repeatedly walked up behind me and scared the crap out of me. So yeah. Take that how you will."
854,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid only $18 for these headphones and I am blown away by the quality of the sound + bass, as well as the level of comfort! I wasn't expecting much for that price, so I am very happy. The box states the sound quality is made for iPods and iPhones, but the sound quality is amazing on my Android phone. I did my research before purchasing these over the ear headphones and feel this must be the best on the market for the price."
855,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received today and used right out of the package. Comfy to wear however I hear ""Snow"" in the background. The caller on the other end didn't hear it but I do on my end which is very distracting while on conference calls. Glad I didn't pay $50 or I would have returned them.

Update review: Now that I had a chance to wear these for a few different conference calls I am updating this review to one star. Not only is the ""Snow"" is extremely loud but I found that after wearing these for longer than an hour I have a massive headache. I was hoping that in time these would improve however they just seem to get worse. I will need to purchase another brand since I can't wear these any longer. I am very disappointed in these headphones. :("
856,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
857,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product!
858,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphone part of the unit sounded great on music. The inline mike sounded terrible to everybody I called. Looking for a different unit now.
859,1.0 out of 5 stars,product was too good!!! sound quality was too well and I formed an addiction to these headsets. 0/13
860,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Doesn't work well with ps4, low sound."
861,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good! Great product for great price!
862,5.0 out of 5 stars,The christmas gift was a hit!!!! thank you!!!
863,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible headset, stopped working after 2 weeks!!! Price was attractive so bought it, worst quality headset in the world, don't waste your time or money!"
864,5.0 out of 5 stars,They fit my 5 year old son head perfect. He loves them and they are exactly what his teacher asked me for him to have for the school year!
865,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought them for my grandson and he loves them.
866,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product good value also
867,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Audio quality is good, but the headphones don't fit large heads very well."
868,1.0 out of 5 stars,Microphone DOES NOT WORK for gaming... Should not even mansion having it...
869,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Seem good, haven't used them yet."
870,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working in one ear in 3 weeks. Poor wiring.
871,5.0 out of 5 stars,Trying to see how microphone works
872,1.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones will only last about 5 weeks then one side loses sound. We've had 2 sets and this happened to both sets. I would not buy these again.
873,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough cushion on head section...painful over small amount of time.
874,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good not great sound quality. Works well enough for intended use.
875,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The shipping was quicker than expected and the headphones exceeded my expectations. My pre-teen is going to LOVE THEM! They are very stylish and seem to be made well. They have a modern ""cool"" look and are well padded for comfort. I can't say how the sound quality is because they are a Christmas gift but I'll update. I can't believe I found these for the price."
876,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a Christmas gift, It is now 3/17 and one side of the headphone does not work and it is beyond the January 31st Amazon holiday return policy. I do not recommend them."
877,1.0 out of 5 stars,The jack Broke within a few weeks.
878,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't buy! Cheap plastic junk!

I literally had it delivered 15 minutes ago, upon unboxing and trying it out , it broke in my iPhone.

The housing had a crack and is very cheaply made!

Don't buy!"
879,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After a week of normal use, the volume control seems to fluctuate on it's own, and the sound goes in and out, loud and soft. This replaced an iSound one we'd bought a year earlier, which were a similar style and price and were awesome. We'll look for a new, better brand."
880,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice well made headphones.Sound they are surprisingly good and perform well on most music types but as the name implies they are biased for a heavy base which is great in most cases ,on the other hand fantastic for big overtures. They sit on the ears, are comfortable and have enough tension on the headband to keep them in place but not so much that it hurts. For the price an absolute bargain and super for commuting/gardening etc."
881,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sad to say that I must echo many of the other negative reviews. I purchased these for my husband who uses them solely at his desk at work. To say that there is minimal wear and tear activity is an understatement. They were not dropped, mishandled, mangled or abused and yet one side stopped functioning about three months after purchase. It also sounds as though a part is rolling around inside the ear piece. A total waste of money."
882,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones provide rich, deep sound without broadcasting to everyone around what you are listening to (he was sitting right beside me and I could not hear any sound whatsoever). The fit is very comfortable and they seem to be extremely well made. So happy with this purchase and would recommend.

Please note: A lot of thought is put into my reviews. I write them as I personally rely on reviews when I make a purchase and there is nothing worse than making a purchase only to find out that most of the reviews are either fake or the reviewer didn't pay for the item. If you took the time to read this review and find it helpful, please click the ""yes"" below where it asks ""Was this review helpful to you?"". Thank you!"
883,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I had these awesome inexpensive headphones that I bought here on Amazon awhile go but my son accidentally broke it. In the meantime, I used an old Skullcandy set to do my transcribing, which I thought were decent and got the job done. But when these arrived, I put them to use immediately and I just LOVE them. I honestly don't think I would have appreciated the sound as much as I do had I not literally JUST taken the Skullcandy headphones off and put these on. It was really night and day. The sound to me is crisp. They're not noise cancelling, but I wasn't expecting them to be. But the biggest difference was that you could hear a huge reduction in excess noise in comparison to the SC I had on. Awesome headphones. I hope they have more colors because I will def buy another. If you've read any of my other reviews you probably know that I'm really big on presentation. These are definitely giftable. The box is matte black with metallic logo. It's very nice that I didn't I actually forgot that I bought headphones and was wondering what I could have bought that looks this expensive."
884,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used these consistently for over a week, and I must say I am quite impressed with these headphones. For $20 these are a steal; these would be a steal for $40 in my opinion. The sound is very clear at almost all levels. There is a little static as you get up there, but the sound is so loud that you won't have worry about it being unclear.
The headphones themselves are very comfortable and adjustable, so the one size will fit all. Each side has a good amount of cushion to the point where they are not too bulky, but is still low key. The headphones also have the added bonus of folding for better storage in a backpack.
The cord is braided so the cord will hold together go a good while, but there is one thing that I do not care for. I wish the cord would unplug from the headphones, that way I could roll it up to store is better. But other than that these headphones are great for music, and dialogue."
885,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very soft and fit your well. They have a nice length cord and are easy to use with any device. I like that they go to a decent volume and block out most of your other background noise. I had them on 25% with my computer/phone and couldn't hear my kids very easily who were watching TV in the same room. They are nice, sturdy, and heavy duty and I love that they fold down when not in use.

The color is a nice red and black. I think these these headphones are comparable to others and I like them just as much as the expensive pair of Ludicris Soul headphones I own or any Beat products. All together I would recommend these headphones to others because I think they are a pretty decent set of headphones for the price - especially if your kids ruin them fast as mine tend to do."
886,1.0 out of 5 stars,"For a few months, these were great. They fit well and the sound was really clear. Now, after only about 3 months of very minimal use (I only use them at work) the right earphone no longer works. I am super disappointed as I'd have expected these headphones to last awhile.

UPDATE 12/14/17 - Now these don't work at all after moderate use by an adult at work. Save your money folks and don't buy these!"
887,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a decent set of headphones that my daughter would like. She keeps losing them or loaning them to her friends which is frustrating. She is super critical of her headphones which I always find a little humorous since she has a hard time keeping track of them. I keep looking for “the one” that she will like and decide to keep track of.

These looked very stylish and simplistic making them a perfect choice. The sound is pretty amazing too considering the price making them an excellent choice everyday use and teens. These are corded which my daughter loves because she isn’t a huge fan of Bluetooth. She wants something she can plug-in and expect to work right away. These are comfortable and have nice padding on the ears without being too tight.

Overall, these have exceeded my expectations. I was provided these headphones free of charge for testing purposes."
888,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They broke after only 3 days and for no apparent reason. The cords are fine, all looks well, no sound....only three days later. I'd say ""no"" to buying these. Now the pain of mailing them back, etc. Ick."
889,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very impressed with these headphones. I received a pair as a gift and they do sound good. The ear coverings are soft and comfortable, they have a nice fit, and an attractive look. There is no volume control, which is not a problem because, they can be controlled with the device volume. They are equipped with a microphone for making phone calls. Even the packaging reeks of professionalism, they come packaged in a nice black box with a formed bubble insert to cradle them in place. They also have a 6 month warranty, almost unheard of now days. The black and red design makes for a nice, modern look with a classic feel that I feel comfortable with. Overall, a nice pair of headphones that I would expect to be priced much higher.
Pros:
Nice fit
good sound
nice look

Cons:
Would love to see a wireless version
microphone volume could be a problem on a windy day
microphone is on the cord instead of being on the body of the headphones."
890,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was expecting much better. The online reviews are generally good, but now I wonder about the validity of those reviews.

PROS: The headphones fold up nicely, and the cord is fabric-covered and tangle-resistant. The headphones have very little creaking when adjusted on your head. There's a fair amount of bass. The tension against the ears is comfortable.

CONS: Muddy sound. My wife and kids all tried the headphones too, and agreed the sound was pretty bad. The top strap of the headphones is poorly padded and gets uncomfortable quickly.

VERDICT: These headphones will make your favorite music sound terrible. Maybe okay for watching movies or TV on a laptop."
891,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My first impression when taking the headphones out of the box was that the quality seemed cheaper than I had anticipated. The original price for these was around $50, and I only paid $13 during a lightening deal. Given their original price, I expected them to be a great pair of headphones. All in all, I wouldn't recommend paying anything more than $20 for them.
Most importantly, the sound quality of these are pretty good (I'd give it a 4.6/5). It's nothing mindblowing, but around the same sound quality as a regular pair of skull candy earbuds. The sound quality doesn't disappoint, and is not a weakness in these headphones.
The quality of the plastic seems on the cheaper end (I'd give it a 3.5/5). Don't get me wrong, it doesn't feel like it would fall apart easily, but for a pair of headphones originally $50, I thought it'd feel more solid and not as light (in a negative way). The quality of the plastic is what makes it seem more like a $20 pair of headphones.
The comfort aspect of these headphones are also a downfall (I'd give it a 3/5). At first, they're just fine, not uncomfortable at all. Nothing superb, just an average pair of headphones. However, after wearing them for an hour they start to hurt my ears from hugging them for so long. It's not exactly a subtle pain, either, it bothers me enough that I have to take off the headphones and switch to earbuds. I would say I have an average size head, too, if not on the smaller side. There's no way to adjust the width of the headphones, so you can't do anything about them being too tight. This really is a pet peeve of mine since the only reason I bought headphones in the first place was the avoid the discomfort of wearing earbuds for too long.
In conclusion, the sound quality is pretty good, but the real downfalls are the quality of the plastic and the lack of comfort after wearing them for too long. If you're considering paying more than $20 for these ($30 at most), I'd recommend looking at other products first."
892,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered 2 of my sons a pair of these foldable headphones so that they would be able to watch movies while we are going places. When these headphones arrived I used them on the computer and I was so excited at the awesome sound quality that they provided. My oldest son has also been using them while gaming and they work perfectly for this also! They have crystal clear sound with no crackling background noise like other similarly priced headphones and the voice quality is just as clear. I am now waiting on a third pair for my youngest son and recommend these headphones by AILIHEN to anyone looking for a great pair of reasonably priced foldable headphones!
893,1.0 out of 5 stars,"EDIT AS OF MAY 25, 2017...

I have had two pairs of these headphones break in the past three months and I am not happy. The first pair I thought was my fault, since I dropped them. But I had suspicions about them no longer working after accidentally being dropped once from hip-height. So I ordered a second pair given the decent price... and they came pre-broken! (With the ""speakers"" inside of the earmuffs having come unglued and fallen out-of-place, causing tinny, quiet and poor sound quality.) I tried to fix them myself having had enough of this nonsense and not wanting to have to wait days or weeks to return them, and they completely fell apart the second I opened them up and tried gluing the speakers back in place. And I wasn't being rough. I've fixed broken headphones before and never had them just fall apart like this. Absolute cheap garbage!

They may be nice for a few days, but they stop working quickly and are absolutely not worth the price."
894,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these headphones for my kids to use with their kindle. They are super lightweight and fold up nicely to fit in the pocket of my son's bookbag. The headphones themself have an adjustable head strap to fit a child's head or adult. The headphones cover the entire ear and are very soft and comfortable. They can also be used as noise cancelling headphones if you want to drown out some loud noise or talking. Great value for the money!
895,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really nice sound for the price of these headphones. Reasonably comfortable. A great deal! I just wanted something that I could use occasionally with my tablet when I didn't want to disturb others. I was more interested in comfort than in sound quality. I was very pleasantly surprised when I received these. Not only were they relatively comfortable for prolonged wearing sessions, but they delivered far better sound than I was anticipating. Sure, they are not 'monitor' quality, but they give a very nice listening experience with adequate bass and highs."
896,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ear buds cause me some discomfort after wearing them for a while so I decided to try these out to see if they worked any better. All in all, I am fairly pleased with them (but I wish the bass was better so I took 1 star away). They hold sound in very well, giving the people around me peace while I can hear my music loud enough to satisfy me and my ear that has partial hearing damage. I love how they fold up so I can just toss them in my bag at the end of the day and go, no having to rearrange my life to just carry them to and fro. I'm glad I didn't pay $50 for them because, as I said, I'd like more bass but it's a pretty good product when you get it on sale. I'd recommend them if you're on a budget."
897,5.0 out of 5 stars,First- these are super comfortable. They are very lightweight and the padding feels wonderful. They are very easy to unfold. They are perfect to pack in my son's backpack for fourth grade which they require him have headphones. He loves the color. The sound is also very good and it is great at working out noise around you. I would definitely buy these headphones again !
898,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought from amazon since it was on sale thinking it is Bluetooth enable headphones. Sounds very good and bass on these are wow. Looks elegant and child likes it. Keeping it despite not being Bluetooth.
Definitely a good buy and stocking stuffer."
899,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible. One side literally stopped working a few weeks after I received it (didn't drop it, get wet, etc.). Had to continue twisting the wire around b/c didn't have time to order a new one before my vacation. Soon after the first side stopped working, the working side left would go in and out, pause music, turn volume up/down ,etc. if the wire was gently moved/touched either on purpose or by accident. Extremely disappointing."
900,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, wonderful fabric cord, adjustable-comfortable headphones. The cord contains a button for ""pause"", but be aware there is no control on the cord for volume. I did not reduce the star rating for the lack of the volume button as I think these headphones are a great value for the money! My son is in the sound engineering business and was impressed with this buy as well!"
901,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have not had the pleasure of being able to listen to these for long at all because our 5 year old daughter has taken them and will not let us use them...Lol! One, they are her favorite color and two (her words), they fit perfect. She brings them along where ever we go along with her IPad so she can listen to her music or play her games without having to turn down her volume or disturbing other people.

What is cool is it does have a volume control on the cord. When I got the few seconds to wear them, they sounded great and fit very comfortable on my head. For the price of $20, you cannot beat the quality of these headphones! They truly are a great buy. Thank you so much #AILIHEN for making such a great product!!!"
902,1.0 out of 5 stars,"no instructions as to what the button on the cord is supposed to do. I had to rig it for headphones to work properly. Update, already broken from brittle cord and bad switch."
903,4.0 out of 5 stars,I just received these and tested them out on Pandora with my iPhone and the sound was really good. I was impressed with the quality of the sound and how stylish the headphones were. I got the blue color and they are super cute. I think this was a good buy and I’ll be trying them out with my laptop and other devices to ensure great sound quality all across the board.
904,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Some pros for these headphones is that they have an amazing quality sound for the price and are very comfortable for the ears (except if you wear studded earrings that poke at the back). The chord is very long and can help with manuverability. It also helps that the headphones fold up and become compact, especially if you have a lot of items you are carrying in your bag.

However there are some cons. I have had these headphones for about 6 months now but sadly, only one side of the headphones work. I mainly use them to listen to music as I'm on my way to my university and as I am walking on my way to and from class. Only one side working is probably due to their everyday use and the fact that I put them in my backpack often so the chord became messed up. I recommend these headphones for at home or for low energy activities where the chord is not stressed. I do not recommend getting these if you are constantly on the go and have to stuff them in your bag."
905,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are a nice solid set of head phones for this price point. I often listen to music to help go to sleep and these are very comfortable and I really like the sound quality. I also use them for on-line telephone conferences with my team or when I want to have a phone conversation with someone but want to be hands free. I would certainly recommend them.
906,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these headphones for free in exchange for an honest review. These headphones arrived packaged wonderfully and look so sleek. They were easy to pull out, unfold, and use right away! I put them on to take out to weed my flower beds and loved them! They are noiseblocking and the bass works well. The sound is clear and loud. My husband wore them for his workout and said they had great sound. Overall, they are an awesome headset and get the job done!"
907,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice, compact headphone design with cans ( instead of earbud/in-ear monitors). I have own several Ailihen sound products, and just like all of the rest, these do not disappoint. When I have ever had any issues (few and far between), they have prompt, first-class sales and suppprt. They stand behind what they sell. Excellent comfort, quality sound for a great price. Five stars!!!!!"
908,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Broken after two months of light use. I think the cord is broken near the connection port. Only one side of the headphones had sound for a bit. It used to work if the cord was wiggled slightly, it's completely dead now unfortunately."
909,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered three of them and only after two months passed, two of them are not functioning anymore. One of them has some connection issues on the jack; the other went silent on one side; typical for cheap products. I was expecting this brand Ailihen being better quality but it's not. I recommend to spend $50-60 and get a medium quality head phones to last at least a year."
910,5.0 out of 5 stars,This pair was a hit with my girls. They have been wanting a certain expensive pair and this one looks a lot like those. The sound quality is superb and the padding really helps to mute all of the sounds outside. There is a mic on the cord for easy handsfree calls. We got these in the gray color and are very happy with them.
911,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gave these headphones to my husband for his birthday and he LOVES them! He uses them when riding the lawn mower so he can listen to his favorite music and they do a great job of blocking out the noise of the lawn mower, while allowing him to jam to his favorite tunes!"
912,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is one of the most amazing headphones i have noticed on relatively low price. The design and appearance is awesome. The bass is great and performed great on surround sound test. I absolutely loved it and enjoyed it as of now. The wires are threaded for durability which is missing in most expensive phones too. Good job Ailihen.
913,1.0 out of 5 stars,I am so disappointed. I might as well hung my money out of the car window. These did not work with my IPhone. Not a sound came through despite many attempts & volume adjustments. Thank goodness I bought them on a lightning deal which proved to be no deal at all.
914,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love them and would give 4 stars save for the ""cord popping"". I only notice when it is plugged into my laptop so it's probably my laptop. I got a great promo on these headphones and it's some of the best money I've spent. The sound is comparable to more expensive headsets and they seem built to last. I love them and ended up buying 2 more pair. The cord popping is a new thing and like I said-it's probably the laptop. Buy them! You'll be happy with them!"
915,1.0 out of 5 stars,I cannot recommend these headphones. It arrived with one ear speaker loose inside the housing. It still worked so kept using. And now about a month later the other speaker stopped working...nothing else to say.
916,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic! I purchased them as a gift for my nephew, to keep him occupied on the plane for a family vacation. When they arrived, I tried them out to make sure they were working properly, and I was blown away by the sound. Not only the highs (or treble) but also songs with bass. The sound is crisp and clean, and I couldn't have asked for more."
917,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sounded good in the beginning. A week later people were complaining they couldn't hear me. Funny thing is this headset stayed at my desk and never left the house.
918,3.0 out of 5 stars,These headphone work great and have great sound. The only bad thing about them is that they have a STRONG chemical smell for about 4 days. This prevented me from using them right away because the smell gave me a headache. That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5.
919,5.0 out of 5 stars,Received 2 of these and we both love them and now I don't need to listen to the hubs YouTube videos with lots of loud machinery and he doesn't have to listen to my cooking ones .. and no more tv/computer volume wars in our happy house
920,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my teen. He said the sound quality was great but the ear padding was uncomfortable to him. He said that they didn't feel too tight just didn't care for the padding. I guess he's more of an earbud guy.
921,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great, they have good quality sound! They are actually pretty loud if you want it that high, my son had them off and I could hear everything clearly from the counter. They are nicely made and fold away nicely and are comfortable."
922,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, sound is amazing. Both my kids (teenagers) love them. Bonus feature the mic. Way to often we get headphones and they don't come with a mic and many calls lost. This makes listening even more the better
Would highly recommend"
923,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter to travel with, they're soft on the ears and the sound is good. Would have given 5 stars but I haven't used it that much and sometimes these things stop working prematurely."
924,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The kids use these with the PS4 to play online with their friends. They have no issues with the quality and I don't hear the game. So far they are working well for us. As long as they last, we'll continue to be very happy."
925,5.0 out of 5 stars,"we love this headphone its awesome we recommend this headphone .
if we had known it would be this good we have bought few of them.
even though its a great product.

no question ask.
we thank you all."
926,5.0 out of 5 stars,"these work very well, the sound is great when using them. my kids love using them with the
Amazon Fire TV Gaming Edition, they just plug it in and mommy doesnt have to listen to them play games on the tv."
927,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are perfect for both my computer and my phone. Actually this is the second pair I bought because my son liked my first pair so much that he took them for himself. The microphone projects a clear voice and I have no complaints about the sound quality for watching movies or listening to books on tape.
928,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The ear holes are made for a child. Neither my wife nor I could get these to fit around around ears. No, we don't have Spock ears either. Never plugged them in to test the audio quality. Headphones that sit on top of your ears instead of around them were a no go for us."
929,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones and plan to give them to my grandson for his birthday in November, if I can wait that long. Will follow up with review when he gets them. For now, they look to be made good and they sound great."
930,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These were ordered for my son, They are great! After about 10 days of use the piece broke in his ipad very unhappy. Now i need to pay for a teck to fix his ipad too. Ipset because it was a Christmas"
931,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones. Not only are they very stylish and sleek--they actually work exceptionally well! They can be broken down for more compact storage which is also a nice feature.
932,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fairly good bargain headphones. Yeah sound quality is pretty great (have yet to try the mic) but the ear cushions are rather uncomfortable if you have slightly bigger ears. Extended use definitely results in some acheing. Otherwise great for the price.
933,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited about these headphones. The sound was great i thought "" this is the best deal on headphones!"" My excitement did not last to long, after the second use i can now only hear sound from one side😢 perhaps mine were just defective?"
934,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these headphones for my son, who is attending college out of our community, he loves them - the built in mic is very nice for him."
935,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable. Good enough sound quality for music and when I use them with my smart phone I can hear the other person and they can hear me.
936,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are comfortable, and fold up nice. But they mess up all of the time. When listening to music or a video it activates either the volume up/ down, or switches songs. This is without pushing the button on the wire. It will also activate the voice assistant. Very annoying."
937,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really hyped up for this product because of the good reviews and price of the headphones. Yet, the first day I used the headphones, I turn to get a paper, and boom, audio cuts off. Whenever you turn or move your head, the headphone's wire caused the audio to turn off or go all staticky. I was also looking for comfort when I bought the headphones, but after about two hours of it on, it gets uncomfortable. Unfortunately I'm returning the product because it's not worth the trouble. The bad outweighs the good."
938,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing headphones! Easy to wear, comfortable, soundproof.. Going to get a pair for my Granddaughter! I love them! Thank you!"
939,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works, sounds good, and inexpensive.

I'm not much of an audiophile but these headphones are pretty good for the price. Lots of bass, for those who love it. I use these to listen to white noise while I'm studying, and they do a decent job at isolating noise.

Headband out of the box is a bit tight, though I do have a big head. Ears start to hurt after an hour of listening due to compression."
940,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really great for the price. The only downside is that you have to have them in a ""sweet spot"" for maximum quality. But I suppose other headphones that don't completely cover your ears have the same fault."
941,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love them so much. Anyone who doesn't try them is a fool. The sound is beautiful & crystal clear. They are super comfortable. Don't be a fool with your 💰 try them. :) :):)
942,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headset, It fits perfectly and has great sound. I mostly use it for my cell phone, but may use it for other listening. Would recommend it to anyone."
943,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They're just OK. Ear part is kind of small, really made more for kids than adults. OK sound quality. They're not dissapointing for the <$20 price. Not many cheaper over-ear headphones available that work with phone calls, most gaming sets have a mic but it doesn't work for phone calls."
944,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones for my 7 year old daughter and was very impressed. Very good headphones at a great price. Sound quality is great and so is the feel. I have Beats headphones wireless studio edition and while this doesn't sound as good as those they come pretty close and are 90% cheaper so don't hesitate if you want good headphones for a great price
945,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got it for my son who plays Overwatch online. He's very happy with it.
The fidelity is fine for speech, no better than you'd expect for the price.
ear muffs might be too small if you have big ears."
946,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great, the cord doesn't tangle, and storage is easy, which makes it very easy to grab and go when I go to the gym with them. Also, they are very comfortable. No complaints here."
947,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, these are great. I wish the mute button didn't require me to hold it and I can't hear myself talk as the mike doesn't send my voice to headset - but that is live-able. Otherwise, totally satisfied"
948,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually bought this so I could use it with my iPhone, thinking it would have the type of connection that fits my iPhone. It does not, although I can use it with my iPad. I am disappointed that I cannot use it with my iPhone. Had I known that I would not have bought it."
949,5.0 out of 5 stars, These have great sound. They adjust so they can be used by anyone. I use them for watching movies and listening to music on my laptop.
950,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i purchased 3 pairs of headphones for my nephews, one gray/black, one red and one blue - so no one fights over them. they loved them!! they were great christmas gifts. everyone was happy."
951,5.0 out of 5 stars,This products sounds great. Bass is really good. I like that these fold in so they do not take up much space when not in use.
952,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Foldable, great sound, includes microphone so you can chat on phone too. Would buy again. Great and useful for a gift exchange item."
953,2.0 out of 5 stars,"While the headphones sound good, my chief complaint is that they are advertised as ""On Ear"" headphones. They are not! They are actually ""Over The Ear"" headphones with large cups/pads. Those who wear glasses shop for ""on ear"" so that the pads don't press against the glasses frame/arm that rests on the ear."
954,4.0 out of 5 stars,tThey are ok but they have a little static every once in awhile. I ordered 2 one for my husband and one for me. I didn't want to spend too much money on a set. So I got them for a great price.
955,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good. I bought 2. One in red, the other in blue. The sound is AMAZING and they seem sturdy. I will update if anything changes."
956,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They lasted me for like 6 months before the right side decided to stop playing music and just only play static. i guess its true, you pay what you get. i got them on sale for 10 dollars. The sound quality was average, and you can't control the volume. Instead you get a button that answers phone calls. Just a heads up for other out there."
957,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Buy this product then.

The line of headphones is made of fabric that does not cut well.

And the It feels comfortable wearing headphones.

Don't worry about your big head. It is also possible to resize."
958,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, and a good quality, holds up to a elementary school age child, which means a lot!"
959,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones. Comfortable, good sound, easy to use and adjust volumes, and stores easily."
960,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shipped on time and arrived exactly as described. Very happy with my purchase.
961,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are high quality & stylish. They produce a clear sound with magnified bass and cancel out noise around you. Definitely recommend these bad boys! 🎧 #jamierski
962,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones ! My son loves it ! It fits perfectly and is adjustable. The color is very nice.
963,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Neat headphones. Should have ordered more, kids fight over these. Work well, sounds great. and folds easy."
964,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used it only 6 times over a few months and the right ear piece stopped working.
965,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had it for 4 days and it stopped working!! Used it for no more than 2 hours!
966,3.0 out of 5 stars,Quality is okay. Hurts and warms up ears after about 30-60mins
967,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones is a gift for my daughter, and if she liked this, all is well, thank you"
968,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my daughter and she really likes them. She said they are comfortable and work great.
969,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Glad I came across this product...great price, great sound quality. Bought it for my 17 year old daughter. No complaints."
970,4.0 out of 5 stars,They get good sound especially for the price. They're a little loose around the ears but they are a nice size and the cord is incredibly long which works out great. If I need more headphones but don't have a lot of cash this will definitely be a repurchase.
971,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones work great, good quality made product, easy to use."
972,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have good sound quality, not crisp clear like higher priced models, but pretty darn good for the price. No need to spend an arm & a leg for headphones when these do the job."
973,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphone comfort and the sound were good. I feel like they're a little bulky, but that's the style for some. My gripe is that they 3.55mm plug broke off inside my phone. Spent the better part of a 2 hour layover in Dallas digging into the port with a pencil to get it out. These good sounding, okay looking headphones were laid to rest in a trash can in the B terminal. Handle with care."
974,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work great in comfort and sound as they are lightweight.
975,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm very pleased with my purchase. They are comfortable to wear and sound great.
976,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! Awesome, amazing sound. Really blocks outside noise. Music tone is rich. Lucious sound. When others wear, can barely hear music playing outside of headset. Comfort is perfect on ears and head. Absolutely love the color gold. So far better then some other pairs I have for 40. Great for working out, my gardening."
977,4.0 out of 5 stars,still getting used to them ...but I like them

988,5.0 out of 5 stars,I received my headphones #AILIHENI60 this weekend. I am very pleased with the quality. I have two boys in my family. Both of them hace used the headphones.

994,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good headphone. Clear music sound. Strong bass. Love this.
995,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice headphones .. however, they worked about one week after the 30-day return date. Would not recommend, especially since they would not honor return nor replace them."
996,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this headphones and it’s very cool, I like to listen to audiobooks, Now it’s my good companion in my spare time. """
997,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great. They look HUGE on my sons head, but the way they fold makes them reasonable for storage. Can't speak for the mic as he doesn't use them for that."
998,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are awesome!!! My son is blessed with Down syndrome. His head & ears are smaller than others. These headphones fit him perfect!!! He can even turn his head fast & they stay put!!
999,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great thanks
1000,1.0 out of 5 stars,I would not reccomend these. Within a few days the sound quality is already bad where I have to rotate the wire to be able to hear well. The connector is too long so it frequently gets hit on things
1001,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones work great! They have great sound quality, very affordable and lightweight! Foam ear pads are also very comfortable."
1002,4.0 out of 5 stars,Blocks out all outside noise
1003,5.0 out of 5 stars,These head phones are very comfortable and are noise cancelling. I like them very much. I highly recommend this product.
1004,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Headphones. Currently one of my favorite sets. I have owned Soul by Ludacris, Beats by Dre...comparable to both and LITERALLY a fraction of the cost. Slate Grey color gives very high end appearance and ear cups are comfortable for all day use (Could be a bit larger in circumference IMO)."
1005,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent value for the price. Good sound and noise cancelling. Super comfortable
1006,1.0 out of 5 stars,One ear did not work right out of the box. I guess you really do get what you pay gor.

1008,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its really cool! The voice is clear and I love this color
1009,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. I got this for my son to use with Roku remote and sound quality is really good. I tried it on with my phone as well and sounds and works perfectly.
1010,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice powerful headphones. Good bass in them, noise canceling is nice too. Wore them while quad riding and didn’t hear much of the outside noise. I like the adjustablity of them too, makes them fit my head well."
1011,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality for an inexpensive product. Also love that they fold up to take up less space when not in use.
1012,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound not bad. Got them to just throw in my bag for going to work, but not very comfortable if wearing for an extended period of time."
1013,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute BEST gaming headset in this price range!
1014,1.0 out of 5 stars,Well my so got the for Christmas and they ae now not working. I cant find the place to contact the seller

1017,1.0 out of 5 stars,They where broke when I received them

1019,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are AWESOME!! I seriously hate earbud headphones but these are comfortable and they sound great!! Love them so much I bought another pair!
1020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I browsed many products on Amazon before buying these headphones, I was attracted by the black-red version and the affordable price. I also want to buy a blue version for my brother."
1021,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, great price"

1026,1.0 out of 5 stars,It broke in 2 weeks! Not recommend it!
1027,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These actually have decent bass to them, just a heads up they feel really light and plasticy so if you are looking for something with some weight to it these might not be for you."
1028,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased red/black and blue headphones. Red/black headphone feels really loose and keeps sliding off my head, blue one works nicely."
1029,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased two of the headphones. They were given as gifts to my granddaughters and they absolutely loved them.
1030,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the design! These can perfectly fit my head and are very comfortable to wear. I usually wear them on the subway to block the outside noise."""

1033,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are very soft and comfortable. I used them to play the video games. It works amazing.
1034,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great over ear headphones for the price!. Light weight and sounds great.
1035,1.0 out of 5 stars,We recently purchase this an the sound is going in and out and no longer working.
1036,1.0 out of 5 stars,Audio on these headphones is terrible. Starting the return.... These are low low quality audio. They are functional but awful.
1037,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price and the bass is good.
1038,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is great especially for the price! It's also nice that they fold because my 3 year old can't break them so easily. They've held up great so far.
1039,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very happy with this product! I was always looking for some cheap but good quality headphones. The price is premium and the quality is great. """
1040,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound! Quite impressed. Definitely ordering another pair!
1041,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing quality! Amazing sound! I've paid 3 times as much for headphones that weren't half as nice. The cord is the perfect length for when I'm on the elliptical at the gym. You've got a customer for life! Thank you!
1042,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for any use. I love it, I want a regard in my next shop xD"
1043,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these headphones for at least one month now, and so far so good."

1047,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted one month and then the sound was no longer working on one side. Junk.
1048,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice headphones. They exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended
1049,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love them. Originally they were for my daughter, but I use them all the time. The sound is great. I actually am getting another pair."
0,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a cute, lightweight and comfortable pair of headphones for kids. The turquoise color is really pretty and the headphones are well-made. My daughter says it is really comfortable and the headphones/headband can be adjusted so the ear pieces fit directly over the ears. The wire for the jack measures a decent 60 inches long. The headphones are also easy to take with you as not only are they light, the ear pieces fold into the headband area so it is really compact. Another neat feature is that the you can connect another headphone to it and two kids can listen to what's playing at the same time! While the built in volume protects the child's ears, I found that when I connected it to the computer and not my phone, depending on the program running, I found the volume to be soft at times."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I teach fourth graders and they have been hard on the headphones I had in my classroom. I bought these because the cords are covered in protective braiding and because this color stands out. Great news: no cords have been broken and no headphones have been ""lost."""
2,4.0 out of 5 stars,Got this as a Christmas gift for my niece! It comes in a nice box and I opened it up to make sure everything was good inside because I don't want to try to deal with a return in a few months. They seem nice quality and feel soft around the ears. I just listened to for a few minutes to make sure they would be good and they were :) I'm excited to see her face when she opens this gift!
3,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my 8 yr old grandson who likes to blast his games. I tried them and found that the volume is loud enough. In fact, I needed to turn down the volume on my iPad. I would recommend this product to people who want to limit volume. Can't really address the sturdiness/longevity as he won't get them until Christmas."
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought these for our daughters classroom due to the existing ones being destroyed and lines being pulled out. These are awesome. Not only are the cords no tangle, they also can unplug and be stored and cleaned. They are very durable and even come with an extra no tangle cord. Very impressed!!"
5,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fit my over-sized 8-year-old (more like the average 13). He immediately remarked on the sound clarity and appreciated the volume limit as he doesn't like accidentally getting his ears blasted when SOMEONE leaves the volume too high. He says they feel good on his ears.
Quality of construction appears pretty good though he's only had they a few days."
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Travelled overseas with these so my son wore them for extended periods on the plane (8+ hours) and he never complained about them being uncomfortable. Love the color options, love that you can pop in another pair of headphones right into these....super great value!!"
7,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered two of the headphones for my children for Christmas. I love the fact that they can plug into each other's and ""share"" what they are listening to. I also like the flexibility of the the headphones. My only disappointment is that I ordered one blue and one green, and received two blue. It wasn't worth it to me to go through the process to exchange one, so I just kept both of the same color."
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased a pair of kid friendly headphones before but they broke because they had plastic adjustable bands. The bands on these are two metal wires which are very sturdy. I love how the volume is limited. These are also light and comfortable. They are on-ear headphones so they can still hear a little of their surroundings.
9,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter loves these headphones - says they're very comfortable and loves the color, sound quality is good. However, just a few weeks after use, the cable started shorting out. I'd expect an item for kids' use would be a little more sturdy than this. I've emailed the company and have received zero response. Buy these only if you have a child who is adult-level responsible for their things."
10,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my daughter. She loves them and they must be comfortable bc she walks around the house with them on all day long. I just wish they could go a little smaller
11,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These block out all outside sound. I have to scream at my kids to get their attention when they are wearing these. Otherwise, we like them. Sound is good, color is true to listing, construction is quality. Ordered 4 pairs, all work well."
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far we love these. My kids say they are very comfortable with their ears. We've struggled to find headphones that stay on their head and are comfortable for them and I think these are it! They seem sturdy, but we'll have to see if they can stand up to kids! We also love the idea that they can plug in to each other's headphones if they want to watch the same thing."
13,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great! My 9 year old daughter loves them! And she has some broken Beats and likes these better!
14,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful. Delivered September 30th. Used lightly to moderately by my 8 year old until it started going bad by early November. Completely dead by November 5th. Unreturnable at that point. Completely waste of $20.
15,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful strong and easily fits both my childrens' head. Love the colour and the way they feel when they are on! Great product.
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the two pairs developed a cord bind up and cause a flaky connection after a couple months. Seller replaced broken pair at no expense. Waiting to see how long they continue to last.
17,1.0 out of 5 stars,Got them for Christmas and the wires already shorted out.
18,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my 5 year old. She likes them, and I like that it won't play too loud. We had trouble with other headphones being too low to use on an airplane because of ambient noise, but these seem to work fine. The sound quality isn't perfect, but it works well for a kid."
19,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful, except, as other reviews stated, they do slip a little bit, so the fit isn’t always great. But I would buy these again despite that and would recommend the headphones to others. My 3.5 year old loves them, and I’m hopeful they’ll last a long time. They seem pretty durable."
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a birthday gift for my son so I haven't opened it yet but I am sure he will love them!

24,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter love her new headphones.
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,now my grandson can play on his tablet and I can watch a show! he loves that they are Green and cushy on his ears!
26,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The main reason I purchased this particular headphone was due to its flexibility; however, it is NoT flexible! My baby girl can be hard on things I am disappointed! The headphone works find although her sisters ear piece came apart but was easy to fix. This is pretty early for anything to go wrong from Christmas to the very beginning of January."
27,1.0 out of 5 stars,The cord was broken; we had to use electrical tape so our daughter could use it.
28,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was byfar one of the worst products I purchased. It was broken when it came in, no aux cable to plug into the computer. I paid really good money for this item, and now I cannot even use it. Please do not purchase. If you know that you do not want to spend any money that will be wasted you would stay away from this. My kids are so disappointed!"
29,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The product arrived very quickly, works well, and just a few comments for prospective buyers out there. I got ""purple"" which is actually fuchsia pink! So don't go in thinking you will get a dark purple. Even the package shows a major shade difference. The cord and headband are made from soft material, probably polyester. The headphones can connect with another pair under the non-cord side, but sound is not always working that way, for some reason. Also I like that the volume would be limited for my small children. I used them at work and they were not louder than some of my colleagues, however they work wonderfully and I feel safer that they are not hurting our ears. I got two matching ones so my kids could not fight over them, and that strategy is also working wonderfully so far. I bought these with a coupon code that reduced the price significantly, and so far they did not cause ear pain when wearing them the majority of the day. They are attractive to smaller children, as well as easy to use. I am hoping that they are very durable too, they are so far."
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 7 year old loves these. It really blocks outside noise. She actually wore them through hurricane Irma and she didn't hear all the noise from the hurricane. I tried them all and was surprised at how great the sound quality was. She absolutely loved the color. I strongly recommend especially for the price. They seem to be very well made. Usually the ear parts fall off, even her $65 pair i bought. These are holding up great so far!"
31,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My grandkids love them! They fit each of them perfectly! I leave them plugged into a spare PC in my office that they use to play their games (primarily Roblox). Due to the way the PC is arranged, I need to use an extension cable for the audio and the plug doesn't fit properly. Since the headphones have a mic built in, it uses a 4-contact plug which makes it slightly longer than the standard headphone 1/8"" plug. I had to push the connector way in (pretty much jammed in), and only get mono audio. It works fine plugged directly into the rear of the PC, but it is about 6"" too short to do that comfortably. The kids don't notice it. I doubt this would be an issue to anyone else, this is a unique case, but ..."
32,5.0 out of 5 stars,These fit my 5 yr old perfectly. She was so excited to get a package just for her and even more so when she saw they were earbands (her words lol). She watches YouTube videos and the sound drives mommy and siblings absolutely crazy. With these on I couldn't hear a single thing. She made mommy listen too because that's how she is and I was surprised by the sound quality. They do not sound like cheap kid headphones. The sound came through really good. It comes with an adapter so you can use with a phone or with a larger jack such as a XBox controller.
33,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For kid headphones, the volume on these is good. My daughter was excited about the color and they are comfortable to wear. My only complaint is the adjustable ear piece slides down sometimes. I bought these for my daughter to wear while she is watching shows on her iPad."
34,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this for my 2-3 year old to use with a kindle. The construction is fantastic the color is her favorite.
THE GOOD: great constructions, seem durable, store small and tightly, don't have to worry as much about the volume blasting on.
THE BAD: the slide up adjustment doesn't ratchet and hold in place strongly, so my 2 year old is frequently asking for help getting them back on as the size expands itself while it's sitting on her head."
35,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great! My daughter loved them and the fact that her brother could plug his headphones into hers and they could listen to the same show. They however do not stand up to a puppy and the chewing stage. So we only were able to enjoy these for approximately a week before we lost them to the dog.
36,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are a good buy for children. I got them for my 3-year-old grandson, and he seems to like them. I will note that he can't put them on by himself because the ear pieces flip up, and he couldn't quite figure out how to get them on. I'm sure once he uses them enough, he'll figure it out. The sound quality is good though. The color is fun and vibrant."
37,4.0 out of 5 stars,My Kindergartener has to provide ear phones to the school for listening activities so I picked these up for her off her school shopping list. Its the perfect price and quailty for school activities
38,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are very nice headphones. The adjustable strap on the sides are very easy to use and the headphones are made with the very comfortable fabric that is soft to the touch. The limited volume feature is perfect for the protection of your ears. I like this feature because children don't always keep the volume at a safe level. This takes care of the worry.
39,4.0 out of 5 stars,I got this for my daughter computer class. Love the color and it fit her perfectly. Great for the price and the headset quality is great as well
40,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really great product. We use them for computer usage and for piano practice (on a keyboard, obviously). They fit my kids (7 and a very scrawny 5-year-old) very well but both kids can get a little confused with them because of the way both of the ear-covering parts fold in."
41,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately these broke. I wasn't able to find a way to connect with the seller to exchange them, so unfortunately I am out the money. My son used these for less than a week and one of the ears stopped producing sound, so only one side was working. Very disappointed."
42,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent for kids, sturdy cord and good sound. Also like how they can link together so two kids can hear the same sound without a splitter. This company also has excellent customer service- quick response when I contacted them. Highly recommended"
43,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my son who’s 3 and he loves them! They work great and are flexible so he can toss them or bend them and I don’t have to worry about them breaking. I love the bright color which makes it easy to find in the car too. Volume control works great!
44,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for my 5 year old grandson for starting school, he loves them, fit is great and adjustable. Won't hurt his ears by being too loud, because they are limited in volume for kids. Great product and great sound quality."
45,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased two of these headphones. I am very happy with them overall. I love the ability to link the two together and the sound reducer for children. The flexibility is great, but the down size is the fit is not very tight."
46,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for 6 yr old grandson's road trip to Wyoming (from Oklahoma)...Mom said they were constantly in use...Grandson, Mom and Grandma were all pleased...bought another set for another grandson for Christmas...lightweight and cushy...survived a 6 yr old boy..."
47,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the volume limiting because we use it for electronic games and piano, compact design, and color.
I didn’t like the quality. After 3 months the jack broke in my phone."
48,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave the headphones to my nephew and he loves it. I also love the fact it has built in volume limiter, I won't be worried this headphone will damage my nephew's ear. My niece likes it too so we are going to purchase a second one for her. Thank you for making a great product."
49,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Product is as described. It is durable, comfortable for my children's ears, and adjusts well to their needs. My favorite feature is that they can plug their own headphones into an opening within these headphones so that they can listen to the same audio without having to ""share"" a single pair of headphones. I bought a pair for each of my three children."
50,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my niece as a Christmas gift. I didn't realize until after I received them that there is a decibel limit. I thought they would be too quiet but I tried them out myself and they are perfect. I love all the colors they come in as well.
51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good. We got these for our 9 and 12 year olds after going thru several cheapos we got from Five Below. These really fold up nicely, too."
52,1.0 out of 5 stars,That's like putting your ear to a lawn mower engine. Safe hearing levels are 80 or below.per the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
53,1.0 out of 5 stars,"just found out headsets may not work with Kindles.... bummer. Have to check each one now. On the plus side, Amazon customer service did give a heads up before Xmas! Thank God for small favors."
54,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love them! Work great for my 2 year old. We're taking them on a flight with us. I like how they fold up and that we can eventually add another set for sharing videos.
55,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these as a Christmas present so will have to update the review after the kids use them. Fast shipping and fun bright colors.

60,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My kids love these, we got two, and they did really well for long flights (12+ hours) and extensive international travel! Our girls love the fact they can listen to same output easily and the cables are easy for storing."
61,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones look good but the sound is terrible, it sounds like going from the cave."
62,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are a nice quality. I like that my daughter can't play it too loud.

72,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for kids! The chord feels like rope/cloth rather than the rubber stuff, so less chance of it getting ruined. And I love that they can be connected so the kids can watch the same movie at once!"

The only issue was the poor sound quality. Made you think your ears were plugged up.
However, this is the feature of the sound limiting feature. But the sound was week, muddy and over all poor.

2.insert the jack completely into your phone
3.keep pressing the play/pause button to see whether the headphone has sound
4.wiggle the wire near the mic or jack to see whether the other side will come out sound
5.check if the headphone works properly on other cellphones or laptop
Did all of the above and still didn't work. Wiggling and bending the wire near the jack randomly changes the sound levels and doesn't produce a consistent sound. Customer service was kind enough to offer a replacement or refund."
194,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are perfect for my 3 year old! I got the blue ones and he loves them. We struggled with blu tooth headphones that just didn’t fit his ears correctly on a flight and paid for expedited shipping so he could use these on the way back. 😬 They’ve only been used once, but are great so far! They’ve held up well to the twisting and fiddling of a 3 year old. 👍🏻"
195,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These were great at first. Loved how they fit, how they packed into a little ball for travel, and we could connect a second pair if both kids watching something together. Seemed like a great buy. Now 2 1/2 months later, sound only coming through 1 earpiece. Worked normally one day and not the next. No understanding why, and the return window is closed. Previous brand lasted 3 yrs, these kaput after 2 1/2 months. Disappointing."
196,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a Christmas gift to replace another pair from years ago ... within a week, the fabric on the cord has pulled apart, exposing the white cord underneath. As I no longer have the box, am not able to return, but am sorely disappointed with the quality."
197,4.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for my daughter to use for school. She loves them. They fit on her ears nicely and the sound quality is pretty good. Would recommend.
198,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We have had this pair of headphones for 2 1/2 months. The end of the plug (about 1/2 inch long) snapped off of the cord today when the headphones were removed from an iPad port. Wish I could find someone to repair it, but it doesn't seem likely. Very disappointed that this simple technology is now so cheaply manufactured."
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Your search for affordable quality kids headphones is over. These have excellent sound quality and are very well made. The ear pads are extremely soft so they sit comfortably on your child's ears. The colors are bright and fun. There's sure to be one that complements his or her personality. It's important to have your children use headphones specifically made for kids versus regular ones because they limit the volume. This prevents your child from using high decibels which can cause hearing damage. The children featured in the photos are ten and seven. These headphones are perfect for watching movies, listening to music, and video calling friends and family."
1,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for my son for his laptop as well as for the iPad when were are on car trips. The headphones have attractive fun colors, are well-made and made mainly of plastic. It is adjustable to fit the head size and also foldable for ease of transport. I like that the audio cables are detachable from the headphones as when the kids tug too hard, it just pops out and can be put back versus those that just get ripped out. This way even if the cable stops working, I can always find a replacement for it and the headphone can still be used. This headphones come with two audio cables - one which has the mic and one button for controlling pause/play, previous/next, answer/hang up call, and the other just a regular audio cable. The sound is quite clear, and the volume is not too loud so that it doesn't hurt his ears."
2,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying that I bought similar headphones (Intone Ms200 Stereo Low Bass Folding and Adjustable Headphone Earbuds - White / Green) from the same seller (MUJI SHOP) a year and a half ago, and while the looks and sturdiness have been good, the sound quality was appallingly bad right off the bat. I gave it 3 stars as a compromise.

The HD30 here are similar, though with some improvements. The cord is now detachable, and there is an extra cord in the box. They're also volume-limiting, though it actually turned out to be a negative.

The gist is that for $17 and in 2018, the HD30 sound just as bad, if not worse, than the Intone Ms200 from a year and a half ago, except now the volume doesn't even go up as high. This means that my kid wouldn't even be able to hear what his cartoon characters are saying in anything but almost complete silence. Sound quality would be possibly OK for him at his age (5 years old), but I can tell just how awful it is.

And here's the nail in the coffin - I also ordered a pair of comparable Noot K11 headphones Kids Headphones - noot products K11 Foldable Stereo Tangle-Free 3.5mm Jack Wired Cord On-Ear Headset for Children (Navy/Teal) for less than $10, and they sound an order of magnitude better (and are louder). I am returning the HD30 and getting another Noot K11 in a different color instead. One thing they don't have is a replaceable cord, but at <$10, who cares? I'll just buy another when they break.

If the HD30 sounded better (way better), the star rating of this review would have been completely different. I'm docking 3 stars for audio quality and leaving 2 for the rest of the package being not totally awful.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The color of this headphone really pops and very easy to find when it's misplaced. The cushions are soft the the ears aren't red after an hour or 2 of use. Compare these to the regular headphones, the volume aren't as loud, but pleasant to their ears. Especially nowadays kids are clue to the phone or tables. The parents love it, and they can tell the difference, when they use this or the beats. For sure when the beats are in used. they will not answer to the parents call, but with this one, they will.

If you don't want overly loud music being played on your little ones eardrum this product is recommended. Not for a long period of time of an hour should be good."
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These kid headphones are working out great for us for several reasons. First of all, they are loud enough to actually hear but the volume is limited a good amount to protect my toddler's ears. Second of all, it came with 2 headphone cables which is a very nice surprise since my toddler destroys the cables about once a month but I still need my kids to wear headphones so I can have peace and quiet in the house. Third, I like that the headphones fold up so it takes up less space in my bag."
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter for our first airplane trip.she insisted on the pink ones, and ,well...she is the only grandbaby....
Anyhow, I received this within a couple of days. I can't tell you how pleased I am with these headphones. The product shipped fast,was packaged very well,included extra cord, and the headphone are perfect in construction with volume control for little ears and padded nicely. I highly recommend to parents and grandparents, if you want a quality product at a reasonable price, these are the headpbones for your child!"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SUPER HEADSET!
I cannot thank the makers enough for limiting the volume so these cannot be turned up too loud! I am constantly telling the little ones that they are going to ruin their hearing, but they don't understand the depth of that statement. The colors of these to choose from are perfect for the little ones - they love all of them! The only problem is that I only ordered one set, so now I need to order more as they seem to not want to share! Highly recommended!"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are excellent. They're comfortable to wear - my son loves them. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality, too - it's excellent and very clear. He could hear his music just fine on a noisy airplane. I am tempted to buy a pair for myself because the sound quality is better than my earbuds. You can't beat the price for such a great product. I also love the nylon covered cord, it doesn't tangle like silicone cords do! And the extra port for a second set of head phones to plug in to and share the audio is pretty ingenious."
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Our 7 year-old twin boys love these, and they use them with their new Fire tablets. It has volume limiting, but they still seem to find a way to have it loud enough to block me out when I'm speaking... Not sure that's the headphones' fault, though.They seem pretty sturdily built while still being collapsible for packing away easily. By far, my favorite thing about these are the detachable cables (yes, plural) that come with it. Both are sturdy braided cables too. Even if your kid figures out a way to break one, there's another in the box to trade out! Genius!"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great and just right for my 6 year old grandson. The ear piece is super soft and cushiony and he doesn't complain about them hurting his ears. I love that the volume will only go so high so not to damage his hearing. I was looking for a good set for him when we travel and he uses his ipad to keep him occupied. This is just what I was looking for.
10,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lovely vibrant colored headphones. I always worry about kids turning up the volume a bit too much and damaging their ear drums. The volume seems to be adequate for protecting the sensitive ears of young kids.
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I would like to say that I really appreciate the nylon cover over the headphones wires. The ear muffs fit over my sons ears and he says they are comfortable. The headphones break down for better storage and requiring less space. The sound is nice and clear and the cords are long. It’s a good product and I am very pleased with my purchase"
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very colorful vibrant headphones for kids. I gifted it to my friends kid and he loves them a lot. He uses it with his tablet and yo he is all set. Sound quality is really and kid friendly.
13,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these headphones for my 3 year old grandson who loves watching movies on his ipad. I needed something that would adjust volume and avoid him being able to turn it up too loud. These headphones are perfect. I also like that they have a L and R inside so we can quickly know which way they go.
14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughters iPad and she loves them! They fold down so when there in her book bag there not bulky, they have great sound and fit perfect. She also loves the color. These are great headphones for kids I will be buying a pair for my son. I would suggest these to parents looking for kids headphones"
15,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones do exactly as the description says and keeps it low for kids ears but it seems it's a bit too low as then you need to turn up the device almost all the way up just to hear it.

On the plus side as I've experienced with lots of headphones are the cord breaking inside and suddenly your headphones don't work again, not with these! If the cord breaks just buy a new 3.5mm cord and you're all set."
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"so far they work great. I don't let my grandson use the ipad very often but if he gets very impatient when we are at the restaurant, I let him watch Dora or Mickey and use these so he can hear and no one else has to listen to it. He loves having his own headphones!"
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for a 5 year old who has broke 3 pair of other brand headphones. I cords are so much better than the others and they come with an extra cord as well. She loves. These are a keeper!
18,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these as a Christmas present for my son so he would have earphones for his tablet. Shipping was prompt and they came in good condition. He has been wearing them non stop for about three days now and I have heard no complaints. They are a little snug on his head but he says they are comfortable and they don't feel tight. They are also pretty easy to adjust. So I would definitely order again.
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super impressed with these headphones. User friendly and my daughter seems to enjoy them. I purchased them so I would be able to help my daughter get use to having head phones in for traveling purposes...love the colors!

62,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son needed a replacement pair of headphones for his kindergarten class. These were perfect. He loves the color and the sound is much better than his previous pair. If you are looking for a pair that would be good for school, these are them."
63,5.0 out of 5 stars,Our 6 year old daughter loved the feel of the headphones. They are a tiny bit too big still so will grown nicely with her. She had no sense that the volume was limited. Sound quality was good.
64,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too quiet for road noise.
65,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my 6 year old to have at school. Her 1st grade school supply list requires headphones not earbuds. I decided to invest in a more durable set after my son broke a cheap pair I bought him last year and ended up replacing 3 months into the school year. These head phones look and feel like they will last. They are heavy duty, the sides clasps inward for easy storage in her desk (plus it saves space), the ear pad is a thick soft, cushy, comfortable material that my daughter loves. I bought the pink and it is a really pretty striking color. She loved these so much that she was using them everyday before school started to listen to her music. She begged me to let her keep them for our house. I explained that she needs a good set for school so these have to go to school for now. I may end up buying another pair because this would be a great headphone for home and expecially road trips."
66,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two sets of these for my daughters for Christmas as a black Friday deal. I specifically bought these for them to use when we go for long car rides and they watch videos on their kindles. Unfortunately they couldn't hear anything with these headphones because they are VOLUME LIMITING. My bad for not fully understanding what that meant. So, do not buy these for your kids if they are to be used in a vehicle, on the highway. Otherwise they are comfy and stylish. My kids liked them before they tried using them in the car. Note to self, do your research before you jump on a Black Friday deal."
67,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought these for our daughters classroom due to the existing ones being destroyed and lines being pulled out. These are awesome. Not only are the cords no tangle, they also can unplug and be stored and cleaned. They are very durable and even come with an extra no tangle cord. Very impressed!!"
68,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome. I think, the best headphones I had yet for my kids. I think they work best for elementary age, with the volume control, but my 13 year old has been caught using them. They are the new hot item in my house.
These are great quality!"
69,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My three year old loves these. We use them for movies in the car and for her tablet. They fit her great, which is nice because she gets very frustrated when headphones are too big and fall off. I also like that she can't turn it up too loud."
70,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great! They love wearing them and they're comfortable. I like that they are volume limiting to protect their hearig. They come with two cords, one with a mic and one without (so don't accidentally toss it with the packaging!). I also like that the cord unplugs from the headphone (better for storing and so the jack doesn't get torqued or bent from wrapping). Would definitely ourhase again!"
71,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my Granddaughter. Her first headphones to use with her kids Kindle. She loves them and they are pink. I love them because they protect her hearing. So many children have hearing loss thats presentable.
72,5.0 out of 5 stars,There are perfect! My daughter is 4 and always want to blare the volume on her tablet. I love that these actually limit the volume as a safety feature and the actually fit her head. I have bought other children sized headphone and they simply would not stay on her head. These are a great fit. Impressed with the easy fold feature as well. She can fold them and stuff them in her bag easier... she has broken another brand that did not have this feature. Awesome product!
73,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are awesome! They are volume limited which I love and the kids love them because they are super comfey. The ear pieces have nice padding and they don't hurt my kids ears. I love that there are 2 cords because my kids always break the cords or the cat shreds them. I would purchase these again. Highly recommend.
74,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked awesome on the airplane. The max volume is just right in terms of not being able to blow your kids ears out, but loud enough on a plane that he had no problems hearing at all. The ear muff pieces do well to keep out other noise...darn kid never even acknowledged me when I tried to get his attention while wearing these. Ha!"
75,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are cute and a great size for kids. My daughter loves the color. The limited volume is a nice feature to protect her ears. They also stay on a child's head well. Overall these headphones are good quality and ideal for home use or traveling on the go.

88,3.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought these for our boys to have for an upcoming vacation.

This product was not as I expected it to be. For it to die so suddenly, the product is awful. I am extremely disappointed. I hope that there is a warranty on this headset or if I can get a replacement. The head set was hardly used for it to even die like that. If anything, the headset was maybe used a dozen times by a 6 year old with the help of parents. Again, there is nothing coming out of the headset any longer. Just dead air. Extremely disappointed."

Thirdly, I have tried to call the phone # listed on the manuals and the website.

128,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were perfect for our family vacation! Simple, uncomplicated, and a perfect fit. Headphones are super comfy so she had no complaints on ear pain was a plus! Love the limiting volume and the color was vibrant. Great sound quality but volume was safe for her listening pleasure. Very happy parent!"
129,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated: contacted seller with pictures of issue and they replaced headphones so I am upgrading to 3 starts.

Works well enough except the cushion came off of the ear and now way to get back on. If made for kids it should not fall apart in about 60 days."
130,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought 2 pairs 1 for school one for home. Home pair broke on first use. Was no longer able to from it. Of course the school pair which she uses multiple times a week is still functional. Never contacted seller for refund, just chalked it up to a loss."
131,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect gift for children. The volume control is a huge plus. I really like the fact that I can control how loud it goes to protect our child's hearing.

133,5.0 out of 5 stars,We originally bought headphones for my daughter To Target to use at school with the iPads and they didn't work because it wasn't a straight plug in. These are perfect as it is a straight plug in and doesn't interview with the cases.

142,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These were a birthday gift for a child. The noise control setting does not work as described when listening to music. It does lower the volume when listening to audio/video without music. Overall they are nice and for the low cost, are a decent value."
143,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best part of these headphones is that the cord detaches from the headset, so you can use them as a mild noise-canceling headset."

145,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love these, but after only having them a few months, the volume control is not working. When connected to a device, the volume automatically goes to mute. When you try and turn up the volume, it immediately returns to mute. Very frustrating."
146,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I brought this for my daughter's birthday. She absolutely loves it, I like the fact that it's come with two listening cord and she likes that it can detach from the earphone as well. Overall nice product for me."
147,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased two pairs of these for my 6 and 3 year old. And I am pleasantly surprised! The quality is great! I like the fact that the cord is longer than most. My kids are a little rough on things but these seem to be holding up really well! The colors are great too!

155,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality, even have an extra wire in the box. This item’s band is long enough to fit older kids and adults, much better than other kid headphones I bought before which the bands are too short to fit even the little kids. Very pleasant experience."
156,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Daughter loved it, I purchased two!. I also tried it myself and the sound if very good. there is 2 cable included, one with the microphone, one without. Used the microphone one on face time and it work very well. I definitively recommend this product and this seller"

188,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Work well, just a little big for my 1.5 year old unfortunately."
189,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good size for the kids.Like how it folds to save space. Great for travelling.

194,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good! Not so high. Me and my son love this head phones
195,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great. My son loves them, they fit him perfectly, and we dont have to fight over his tablet being too loud"
196,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased the purple style for my daughter. She is a big fan. Sound quality is good, they feel sturdy."
197,5.0 out of 5 stars,"bought them for my daughter!! She loves them, plus I am very pleased with the fact that the volume is controlled. beautiful color."
198,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love everything about these headphones; the fit, the color and most of all the volume! They cannot be turned up too high for my little ones ears!!"
199,1.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones started working intermittently less than a month after buying them. Now they have stopped working entirely. The company that sells them won’t allow me to return them.
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love them. I cannot say enough good things about them. The color is adorable, they comfortable, the sound quality is amazing...I would highly HIGHLY recommend them. Good price and great quality. They block out the sound around me and allow me to focus on what I need to."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Deep bass, my music sounds awesome through these headphones!! Super pleased with these! Sometimes you just want to plug in a set of headphones and not worry about charging or bluetooth, and these fit the bill!

Exterior sound cancellation is great, can't hear someone talking right next to you.

I didn't realize these folded when I bought them, which is a great plus. Makes storing them a breeze when not using them.

The metallic brushed pink color with white earpieces makes the set look very high end. I love them!"
2,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice. These are comfortable to wear and soft on the ears. They are adjustable on the head to accommodate for different shapes. The sound that projects from the speakers is clear. They work with my iPhone, iPad, and Mac. I look forward to using them when I travel."
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a pink one at first, but changed my mind once I saw this one. This headphone looks exactly like the picture, and prettier! It is a soft and beautiful rose gold color, and I like that the headband is adjustable and very lightweight. I have to say I brought it for the color at first, but now I love it. Great quality and very affordable!"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very impressed with these headphones. My husband bought me similar headphones a year ago (Sony brand for almost $100) and I actually think these are just as comfortable if not more. Plus, they're pretty! Whereas, my other headphones are black and boring. Since my children are always using my other headphones I decided it was time to give another set a try. Originally these were going to be for my daughters, however, now they are mine. :) I highly recommend you try these!

If my review has helped you in any way please feel free to click the helpful button for me. Thanks!"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love these headphones. I have a giant head and it is quite tough to find headphones that fit over my head and don't pinch at the top but these are great. The inside top of the band is nicely padded for comfort and the padded ears make wearing them even for long periods quite comfortable. They adjust easily and fully cover the ear to block out surrounding sounds. The cord is sturdy and plenty long for most uses. The color is very pretty as well. The sound is nothing spectacular, but they're great for listening to audiobooks, videos, etc.

Overall, these are comfortable, attractive, and have good sound and I certainly recommend them."
6,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is nice on these and the cord is a nice length! I use them primarily for watching shows on my phone and listening to nature sounds before bed.
The only negative is that they don't have a way to adjust the volume or pause/play the music! Otherwise, very nice headphone for the price!"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought a pair similar to these several months ago. Same brand but slightly cheaper. My son is pretty hard on headphones and earbuds and we go through pairs pretty regularly so I wasn't willing to spend much on replacements. We have been very pleasantly surprised though and the Ailihen headphones have been super tough with plenty of quality So, we wanted to grab a back up set before we forgot what we had bought that worked. This time we went ahead and bought this mid price set.

I really would have loved the rose gold but since these are for my kiddo, he got to pick the color and of course choose green. It's a bright lime color but the metallic sheen makes it really pretty. The volume is very good and preset. Along with the ear pads that reduce any external noise, the volume is significant for a set of headphones. It is also very clear. We use these mostly for video games on the playstation, or youtube on a tablet. Both sounds and voices are extremely clear and easy to understand. The tension in the headband part and the padding on the earpads are very comfortable and allows the headphones to be worn for longer periods of time. The box says it has an inline microphone but I do not see it. Possibly it is built in in a way that I don't notice. These also fold up for easier storage than typical big, bulky headphones. We can easily put these in a small compartment of a backpack.

I'm thrilled to have two sets now and to have found a brand that seems kid proof. lol"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing! Gorgeous & sleek, extremely comfortable, sound quality is beyond phenomenal and they fold together for easy storage/carrying. I honestly am SO impressed with these, especially for the price. My husband and my son also agree, even though their rose gold/pink, both of them steal these from me every chance they get, they love them!!! I’ll be buying them both a pair very soon! Highly recommend!!!"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to admit, I bought these for the color only. But wow, I was surprised at how good they sound. I use them with my digital piano and the sound is rich, clear and they have just enough bass. They are comfortable even after a couple hours."
10,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of these for my daughter a couple months back, and after only a few weeks they begin to fail. Oddly enough, you could only hear the background music and not the lead vocals. Weird failure, but it was directly attributable to the headphones. I then ordered a second set of thinking the first ones might’ve just been defective, this time the left speaker kept fading in and out. You could readjust the headphone jack to get it to work, but it was certainly not reliable. I tried to headphones on other devices and found the same issues, so it’s not the device my daughter is using. I won’t be buying another set of these, but will be exploring other options."
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are really lightweight, good for children too. I let my 4 year old wear them some times. At first I thought they wouldnt expand out to fit my head but found out if you pull them a little harder its (hard to notice at first) they do adjust. And the mic works well. The sound is nice, but for my ears I cant wear them for more than a few hours. Otherwise, theyre good for normal use if your not going to sit all day with them on."
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones have a great sound quality to them. Great fit that’s perfect for my 14 year old. Love that the cord is on one side.
13,1.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are not sturdy and the wires are not good!
14,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the color. The print on the box said that there is an inline microphone, surprised me because I specifically didn't want a mic and ordered this because there wasn't one. It doesn't have one, which I'm happy with. The cord isn't much longer than earbuds cords, it could use another foot if you're using it with a PC."
15,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very disappointed in these headphones, I loved them when I first got them but I've had them for less than two months and the sound quality has already deteriorated. I'm guessing that the internal wires are loose, as whenever I move my head slightly the sound fades and becomes distorted. I only use these at home while studying, they are not subjected to a lot of wear-and-tear."
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound. Stylish. I bought the violet color for my LG/Android phone and tablet. I like the cord which is wrapped in woven mesh type matetial so it doesnt tangle as easily and not cold or irritating against skin. No sound conteol on cord or earphones, but for simple earphones nice and expensive looking without price!"
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this for my son to use at school. Sounds pretty good and I like how the cord is a shoestring material and that they are foldable hoping it will last longer then his last pair I bought him
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Can't beat it for the price. I tried to buy a bunch of wireless headphones even noise canceling, however unless you spend 350 dollars for a pair they all have a slight mechanical low tone under the music. These sound perfect, and even cancel out the noise better than the cheaper 80 noise canceling phones I bought haha. Just be smart, don't wrap the cord around it tight so you don't break it like with any cord. A+"
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones for the price! They fold up compact allowing for travel. They have a rope cord which feels quite sturdy. The blue matches the image perfectly. They earmuffs aren't the comfiest but they fit well on my son who is using them. They have great sound with great base.
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,"PRO:
Good construction. Color is bright and pretty.
Deep bass. Not an audiophile headphone but not bad considering the price.
Light, not heavy like Beats.
Covers the ears to block out outside noise.
Does not put too much pressure on the ears and head like Beats.
Braided cord is a nice touch.

CON:
A little small for my head. The Beats headphones can be stretched longer to fit me.
No microphone for smartphones."
21,5.0 out of 5 stars,This headphone is so nice! I bought this for myself to listen to music. The color of this headphone is so beautiful! It's a great gift for friends.

25,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones are awesome with great sound!
26,2.0 out of 5 stars,We’ve only had them for 3 months and they’ve already failed 😕
27,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful. These were perfect for my mother. Would by again.
28,2.0 out of 5 stars,Info given states that this will work with I-phones. The part that plugs in is not compatible with my I-phone. Seller not accurate in decription.
29,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all, the sound is great! They look awesome and feel good on your ears. Their great!"
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought them for my daughter- they are perfect with good sound quality. Comfy to wear and fits both kids and adults

32,1.0 out of 5 stars,I only had them for a month and they are already broken. Waste of money DO NOT BUY!!!!!
33,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ok not the best quality and not the best sound
34,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a really nice pair of headphones that are working well for me. Pretty good sounds.
35,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am stunned by the sound quality of these earphones. The bass is ripping, the highs are clear and piercing but not tinny. I listen mostly to rock music though am a big fan of acoustic flamenco."
36,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They work well and the color is great. I can still kinda hear what's going on around me, which I don't mind:)"
37,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, very comfortable, quality sound and noise cancellation. Highly recommended for the price."

54,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stop working 2 days after I got them.
55,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have headphones attached to my head for more than half the day, everyday. I listen to podcasts, music, videos, everything, while I do my artwork, while I clean, while I cook. I've used great many earbuds, and killed every one of them. These little 10 dollar troopers last me usually around 3-4 months, but I get sick of the little things in my ears. So I decided to treat myself to some decent overear headphones in a cute color.

Time till death: 1 week

These were delivered to my April 7 of 2018, and tonight, at 11:30 pm April 14, the weight of the wire falls in such a way at the connecting port that the audio sounds like it's underwater. The only time I've had a faster kill time were headphones that were unusable right out of the box.

The headphones are cute! The foldable aspect is very useful for taking them to school! They are comfortable!
But that wire isn't replaceable, and so do these headphones meet their death.

2 stars."
56,2.0 out of 5 stars,No real bass. Sound quality is meh. Skull Candy headphones are a lot better.
57,4.0 out of 5 stars,I was looking for a cheap headphones for my laptop and the color of this headphones caught my attention. It looks like a beats hp. The sound quality is decent. But don’t expect that it will be the same as the expensive ones. The only thing that lacks is the attachment cuz i cannot connect this to my cellphone. All in all for the price it’s a great buy.
58,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones. The headphones sounds really great, and are comfortable to wear. I do have a iPhone and using the adapter doesn’t minimize the music."
59,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
60,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter for Easter. I ordered the purple/violet, and she absolutely loved the way they looked. They're actually even better in person than the photo. However, she's only been using them about 2 weeks and they aren't working properly- they are glitchy and go in and out. I'm done with buying cheapo headphones from Amazon. I'm going to go with a brand I can trust next time."
61,3.0 out of 5 stars,I would recommend this for a child because the ear padding isn’t that soft for an adult. Gave to my niece.
62,5.0 out of 5 stars," My 12 year old needed headphones for school and chose these mainly cause of the color options. They are not bass headphones nor the best for music. For all around headphones, they are great. They are comfortable and great to wear for long periods"
63,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are so cute! I have them in blue and I absolutely love the look of them. They are super comfortable too. I wear glasses so I if headphones are too heavy or too tight they start to irritate me and give me headaches because they are squeezing my glasses into the side of my head. I use these to edit my youtube videos so I've worn them for hours at a time and never had any issues. The quality of sound is great too. The cord is nice and long and because it's the cloth kind it isn't stiff and getting in the way. The fold up as well which makes them easy to travel with. Overall I am very happy with these, especially for the price."
64,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones to have a spare set and because I love purple. They are just as beautiful as pictured. They also work very well. I like the soft padded earpieces. I like that they are foldable and can easily be packed in a suitcase to take with you. I still prefer a wire-free set but these come in handy when you can't be wireless. They sound great too.

65,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones! They cover your whole ear, helping to blockout other sounds! I love that they fold up super small! I’ve been letting my 8yr old use them in the car, and they fit perfectly in his small activity bag! Nice solid color!"
66,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are the most aesthetically pleasing budget pair I've ever owned. The headphones are lightweight and have comfortable padding. The best detail is the braided wire because it prevents tangling and provides a more durable usage over time. Just be aware that the sound quality is so-so, when in a call, the other person can not hear me well, and it might feel uncomfortable after using it for a long time. It is a good budget pair for an everyday usage. Overall, I can't complain because of the price."
67,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Basic headphones, I got them for my 6 year old because he needs them for school. Nothing fancy with these, you get good sound and they're pretty comfortable to wear. They fit his head which is a plus for me, and don't tangle."
68,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They're pretty, the cord is good and they do a decent job of blocking outside sound. Unfortunately they are very tinny. If your music matters to you these are not going to make you happy. If you're using them for youtube or games they might be ok. For now they'll suffice until I can afford something better. But honestly, I've had better sound on cheaper sets in the past."
69,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are cool looking headphones with great sound and very comfortable even when leaning on the earpiece. I am not giving them 5 stars because their earpiece position does not adjust but they are still a great product and value.
70,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love love love love these! So cute! And the wire is lace like which makes it very comfortable. Now I wish it had a microphone, but I knew it didn't so definitely a five star purchase."

78,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonably priced for the quality you get. Mostly for casual listeners. Nice present for young nieces and nephews. Color and finish is actually very elegant.
79,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use them to work out with. Speakers sounds great and clear, helps me drown out everything around me. I love this color."
80,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. I was worried they were gonna be cheap because I'd never heard ood the brand and they were pretty inexpensive. But the sound quality is great, cord is long enough to have my phone away from me, they fold up to an easy travel size, and I love the colors."

85,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed a pair of headphones to use every morning while playing games, watching youtube, and editing videos. These work very well and have been good for every day use. I find that they are very sturdy and feel like a much more expensive pair. I really like the way the cord is encased with the reinforcing covering. They have worked with our desktop, my cellphone, and our iPad very well. They fold up and I am able to store them away (hide them from my kids) easily."
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very cool, I like the color"
87,5.0 out of 5 stars,"these are great, just like pictured. sound quality is good."

94,4.0 out of 5 stars,Feel the quality is good.
95,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really good sound and comfortable fit, I use them at the gym and they don’t get super sweaty. The jack has extra metal around it, I assume to protect from bending? Great for the price.

Please note, there are no controls on these headphones."
96,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken within weeks...
97,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphone lasted me a little over a month before I could no longer hear out of one ear. The sounds isn't great, and I've found that they seem to absorb all the noise of the wind. The color is cute, the cord on the headphones is white fabric, so it both gets dirty, and starts to get messed up at the point of connection for your device and the cord really fast."
98,5.0 out of 5 stars,I know my cousin like the rosegold headphone. I decided to buy it as a gift for her. She loves it. She told be this is what she need it in a while. Good base. Easy to use. You can fold it to make it smaller so you can bring it anywhere you want.
99,1.0 out of 5 stars,it has only been less then 3 month and 1 side of the headphones don't work. My son is 9 and he takes very good care of his electronics . I am very disappointed I have no clue how people rated these a 4 star I would not recommend these for anyone. Its only an matter of time before I have to replace my daughters who ahs the same pair just different color
100,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these headphones with my Casio keyboard. The sound quality is great. They are fully adjustable and they feel good on my head. They look good too, the picture is accurate for both the color and the product."
101,5.0 out of 5 stars,These have a great fit. They are easy to wear and they have quality sound. Easily fold for placement in a book bag or gym tote.The soft ear piece allows for you to hear the music and no extra back ground noises.
102,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is pretty good. Its comfortable for extended usage. Colors are as is. Good so far.
103,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work quite well! I love the color and it’s great to play music. I’ve been using it for weeks now and I still love it. I’m planning to get another one for my sister. Good sound quality and lovely color.
104,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I mostly liked these. But now the sound will cut out on one side or the other and it's jarring. Sometimes both sides will work together, but usually it's just one or the other now. It's sad. Also it's not as noise cancelling as I hoped. Which is a bummer, because I thought otherwise they were really good. Haven't had trouble with the chord at all."
105,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have to say these headphones are quality and the sound is so crisp and clear. The band is also comfortable and adjustable. They also collapse which is great. I’m buying more for family and friends.
106,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this girls headphone for my friend's daughter as a birthday gift. she absolutely loves it! And when she receive it just screaming for excitement. I am so glad with this purchase.

108,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected plus they are small and uncomfortable.
109,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased the rose gold to my teenage daughter, she likes it very much. Pretty color, decent stylish design, very good sound quality, comfortable ear buds. Great for this price."
110,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The color I selected (purple) didn't turn out the way it looked in the picture. It looks more like a blue color, although I still like the color. When I wear the headphones for too long, my ears start to hurt from the pressure of the hard fabric. Otherwise, the sound is good quality, I like the cord (although I wish it was a bit longer) and they are okay quality. I would buy something else if you are a gamer, otherwise, they're fine."
111,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are really cute! While they don't have a lot of bass, they seem quite well made, and I won't hesitate to use them."
112,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing rose gold color! My daughter loves it. The sound quality is good when she watches youtube videos. The length of the cord is enough for daily use as well.
113,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are VERY nice not cheap looking or feeling. One suggestion I have is I would like them to be a little smaller to fit my skinny head. They adjust well to my husbands large head so he will be getting his own pair. NOT cheaply made.
114,3.0 out of 5 stars,"its Ok nothing special, I actually just brought it for my nieces and nephews to use when they are watching videos on the tablet"

116,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a little worried to buy some cheaper no name brand headphones but at the same time couldn't justify to spend hundreds of $$$$ for the big brands...typical female as I am I ordered them because I loved the way they looked! But omg the pictures on Amazon do them no justice!!!! I had to upload my own to show them off!!!! They look and sound high end! I bought the rose gold and they are a little on the pink side which is perfect for me, but teenage boys may not like that..."
117,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Headset are convenient to carry, perfect for backpack, sound quality is, you know, not bad for this price, my little girl really like this."
118,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones fit very comfortably and look nice, but I had them for less than two months and they now only work in one ear. I've bought headphones from this brand before and had the same thing happen, but decided to give it another chance since this pair had high reviews and were a bit more expensive. But now that the same thing has happened, I will not be buying from this brand again."
119,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these for my 3 yr old son. I was really hopeful they would fit his small had, but they are to big. They say large inside, so I'm disappointed there. I did try them on trying to make them smaller and they sound fanatic. The color is nice I just thought they would be smaller. My girlfriend has a pair for her daughter that are much smaller same brand and they fit my son perfect, a size choice when ordering isn't available so if you need a small pair beware they are not small..."
120,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In our house you cannot have too many headphones, and these are certainly a crowd pleaser. They are sturdy and will likely hold up to a simultaneous sister grab."
