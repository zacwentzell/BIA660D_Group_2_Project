0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Benson here again, continuing my reviews of USB Type-C legacy cables, adapters, and accessories. Today I am reviewing Otium's USB Type C to Micro USB Adapter, Otium USB Type C to Micro USB Adapter. This adapter is a MicroUSB female to Type-C plug adapter, putting it in the class of devices known as ""Legacy Host Adapters."" This product comes in a convenient 2 pack.

Let's check spec compliance :
I'm using my trusty Chromebook Pixel 2015 with the Chromium Twinkie USB-PD Sniffer, available on Amazon from Plugable : Plugable USB 3.1 Type-C (USB-C) Power Delivery Sniffer

For my first test, I've got the Otium MicroUSB Adapter plugged into a good quality (itself capable of >2.4A) Micro-B cable from Belkin. (this one: Belkin 6-Foot 2.0 USB Type C (USB-C) to Micro USB Charge Cable, USB-C Certified) That is then plugged Apple proprietary (MacBook) charger capable of 5.2V at 2.4A.

The Type-C end is plugged into Twinkie, acting as a pass through to Chromebook Pixel 2015. Picture attached!

First let's run the ectool command from Pixel's command line to check what Pixel thinks is happening on its USB-C ports :
localhost ~ # ectool --dev 1 usbpdpower
Port 0: SNK Charger Proprietary 4612mV / 2400mA, max 5000mV / 2400mA / 12000mW
Port 1: SRC

So far so good. Pixel identifies the charger as a Proprietary type adapter, and has negotiated 2.4A.

Let's see what Twinkie (the USB PD sniffer) says :
> tw cc
CC1 = 18 mV ; CC2 = 421 mV

The tw cc command reads the current voltage values from the CC pins. As you can see here, CC2 pin has a value of 421mV. Referring to the USB Type-C Specification Table 4-25 Voltage on Sink CC pins, this voltage falls right in the middle of the range allowed for vRd-USB, meaning that yes, this MicroUSB adapter has the correct 56k' pullup resistor!

One more Twinkie command :
> tw vbus
VBUS = 4750 mV ; -2440 mA

The tw vbus command uses twinkie's current and voltage meter ability. As you can see, the laptop is pulling just around 2.4A of current at 4.750V from the Apple charger over the Belkin cable + Otium adapter.

For a HighSpeed USB 2.0 data test, I’ve hooked my Nexus 5X to my Chromebook Pixel via the Otium MicroUSB adapter + Belkin cable to test large file transfer via MTP. It just works, no problem!

Now for more subjective judgments of this adapter : The Type-C plug on this adapter is a stamped metal part that's been wrapped around to the shape of the plug. It does have a seam on one side. This is good, but not great like the stronger deep-draw plugs from other manufacturers including the Google and Apple 1st party plugs. What definitely makes the Otium adapter stand apart from other adapters like it though is the shell, which is anodized aluminum and a step above the plastic shells of similar adapters. It feels durable and fits in with the all aluminum bodies of Pixel devices, Nexus 6P, and MacBooks.

In conclusion : A high quality charging and data sync MicroUSB Adapter from Otium! The adapter is a great safe way to breathe new life into your old A-to-MicroUSB cables for use with newer USB Type-C devices such as Nexus 6P/5X or Pixel devices. It is also future proof for fast charging USB Type-C devices to come!"
1,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a nice temporary way to get around getting a new phone that adopted yet another ""universal standard"" which means all your old chargers and accessories are garbage. I buy Android phones to get away from the Apple experience of proprietary connectors release every other generation, but now I get the full Apple experience with a different user interface.

EDIT: this review was written for a different product than it now shows. I bought an adapter piece for USB cable types, not these headphones. My star review has changed because of this which seems like a dirty sneaky practice."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These adapters work great for converting all the existing micro USB cables into USB-C for the new devices in our house. We recently upgraded to the LG G5 and the Nexus 5X. However we also still have a number of other items (Amazon Kindle, Kindle Fire HDX, Kindle Fire 7, etc.) that need to be charged via micro USB. This is a great solution. The only problem I see is these are so small they can be lost when removed from the micro USB cable. Perhaps a small zip tie or lanyard that can be secured to the cable so you know they're always on the cable?"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These set of three Micro USB-C type Charging Adapters were purchased to cap off some or my regular USB chargers in order to connect to my Galaxy Note 7. They fit well and are quality made. However, be aware that they do not provide data transfer, just charging of your phone.
I have no problem with these adapters, and do recommend them. The price is reasonable."
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered this because of the positive review by Benson Leung.

When the product arrived, one of the two adapters didn't work (wasn't charging my wife's Nexus 5x). I sent a message to OtiumDirect, and they sent me a replacement free of charge. The replacement works great.

Overall, a really nice product, especially for the price, and very good, responsive customer service. I highly recommend this product."
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently changed my phone and was thinking about buying a USB-A and USB-C cable but since I had tons of micro USB cables, I figured buying this adaptor will save me some money.
So I bought this based on the famous Google engineer's review. There are so many similar products and that was the only way to find the proper one. The product itself is actually good quality but be careful as it comes in a small package and I almost threw it away with a garbage.
Anyway, I am overall satisfied with this adapter. I recommend this product."
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a different set of adapters previously and only got 90ma from a 1ft micro USB cable plugged into a 1.5A USB socket, switched to these and get 1.3A with my Nexus 5X phone which is on par with the Nexus 5. So this is a must get if you are using USB Type C with Micro USB cables."
7,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased ""USB Type C to Micro USB Adapter (2 Pack) Otium® USB-C to Micro USB Female Convert Connector for New Mackbook 12"", Google Chromebook Pixel, Nexus 5X /"" and the link brings me to this page.

The adapters never worked. I bought more USB C cables and gave the old cables away instead."
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great way to use old Micro USB cables. It could be my imagination that they don't charge as fast as true USB C cables or it could be a safety thing since Micro USB cables might not be up to the task. Either way they work.
9,4.0 out of 5 stars,These work great if you have any new samsung. adapts to fit old plug. I dont think it charges quite as fast as with the original charge but work great if you need a charge and dont have the original cord
10,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the few that really work with any cable. It will not allow a ""turbo charge"" from my micro usb cable charger, but it will allow transfers. It is a very sturdy connector!"
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for charging my OnePlus 2. Haven't tested if it does data or not, but I only bought them to use on some existing cables for charging purposes & in my car in case someone without USB-C needs a cord. Works wonderfully."
12,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Order as USB-C OTG adapters. Works ok for charge, data does not work. Now item number shows headphones."
13,1.0 out of 5 stars,"For what ever reason, neither of the 2 type C cables I have would fit these Adapters made of hard plastic."
14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well built adapters that feel sturdy when plugged in on both ends (usb-c to micro-usb). Haven't tested specifically, but data transfers speeds will suffer from this, but at this price point, they are well worth the buy. As with most new standards, once the market catches up, usb-c cables will be much more available for everyone."
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good size (a hair over 1in long, fairly transparent during actual usage), and saved all my micro usb cables from being useless.
2 adapters in 1 pack (1 in the car and 1 on my desk)
Will probably buy more for other places."
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"USB Spec Compliant (Has Proper Resister - Checked via Current Monitor)
Solid Build Quality
Charges Phone Rapidly 1.5A+
Metal Casing
Good Connections at Phone and Micro USB

I purchased these for $5.99 at the time because of a coupon promotion. Great deal."
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great, i use it on all my micro usb wires. Bought a 2nd pack too. Highly recommend if you need to buy usb-c."
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome product !!! Works well !!! And, they are comfortable !!!"
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very very good. Firm fit on any USB micro cable, even old worn ones that wobbled in my older phone, and fit snuggly in my new USB-C phone. Overall, my old cables are nicer to use with adapter than they used to be when used alone. I bought a set of two a few months ago and am now buying another set to allow me to reuse more of my old cables."
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super awesome and has saved my bacon more than once.
21,5.0 out of 5 stars,Never purchased this item !!!!!
22,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work well
23,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great. Bought one set initially, but I have so many micro USB cables. Just bought another pack. And they come Benson Leung approved.."
24,5.0 out of 5 stars,Doubles the uses of chargers and cords.
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great little adapters that save me from rebuying all my cables.
26,4.0 out of 5 stars,Do what they are supposed to do.
27,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great solution, better than buying new cables"
28,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the answer to not having to buy all new charging cords after switching to a new phone!!
29,5.0 out of 5 stars,cool
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super sturdy and well made. The finish is great and the connection is very solid and secure.
31,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works as advertised.
32,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works good, bought it because of the tech review assuring that it had the proper resistor."
33,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Benson approved, works great"
34,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does exactly what I needed them too
35,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Build quality is good. And as Benson indicated, it works as expected.

Very useful as I have a ton of legacy micro USB cables around."
36,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's been a good adapter for me. No issues.
37,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These work perfect with the micro USB chargers that I already have, the turbo charge doesn't always work but it's not a big deal. I use the adapter to charge over night because I don't need the turbo charge for that"
38,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works. High quality feel.
39,5.0 out of 5 stars,Benson Leung approved: good enough for me.
40,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Product, came and works as described."
41,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work exactly how I expected. Quality product.
42,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't realize the Nexus 5X used USB Type-C when I upgraded from my Nexus 5 a couple months ago. All of my phone's chargers - in my car, the portable power brick in my backpack, the three dozen of them lying around my house - were basically useless. I couldn't even connect my new phone to my PC! This thing solved the problem though. I just leave these two attached to my car and portable power brick unless I need to remove them for anything else. Their small size makes them super portable - which is nice until you forget them in your jeans and they go through the wash and dry cycle - whoops. But hey, it still works! Not bad for a tiny little thing."
43,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome little adapters
44,4.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable and good quality.
45,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great little adapter. But it comes loose pretty easily from my phone.
46,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nicely made, although it is folded metal on the insert."
47,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fits great on my mico usb cables. Easier and cheaper than buying all new cables. Plus, since it's a 2 pack, you can carry one around in case you need to use someone's charger, etc."
48,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great. One is a little looser than I would like but no big deal. I had some long mircoUSB cables I didn't want to replace so these did the trick for my new phone.
49,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great
50,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great! The only thing is missing is a lanyard to get 5 stars.
51,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work great. Just attach one end to the existing micro charger and the other to the device.
52,5.0 out of 5 stars,works great with my Nexus 5x and my Nexus 6P. No complaints!
53,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great on every cable I've tried it on and seems VERY durable. It's nice to find quality accessories like this!
54,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price! Looks and feels good. Seems to connect on 'micro' side very well.
55,5.0 out of 5 stars,The tiny adapters work great. Quality product for helping your micro-usb mate with your usb3.1
56,5.0 out of 5 stars,It fits in the phone and it charges so that's all I can ask.thankyou
57,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to lose them
58,5.0 out of 5 stars,Save money buy these adapters rather than new cords.
59,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great with my old cord.
60,5.0 out of 5 stars,Feels solid.
61,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Doesn't work for OTG on the OnePlus Two, but it does work for other devices."
62,5.0 out of 5 stars,works as expected
63,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The ""sleeve"" that covers the actual adaptor came off upon removing it from the packaging. It still works, but makes the think the quality of the build is pretty low. Time will tell, at least they were inexpensive."
64,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for use in the car far in our phones. Both my girlfriend and I have LG G5s. While the physical connection seems very solid, the phone regularly disconnects/reconnects from the charger unless the phone is held in just the right way. Which results in effectively no charge."
65,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It works, but does not rapid charge Nexus 6p

Pros:
-price
-makes use of micro usb charges (i have like 20)

Cons:
-does NOT rapid charge Nexus 6p (even using fast charge Samsung charger)
-charges slowly"
66,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was pleasantly surprised at how small and compact this adapter is. It will be easy to keep several on hand and stowed away in my laptop bag, car glove box and desk drawer so I'll always be able to charge my phone with any of the numerous micro-usb chargers that I own. I'm impressed with the quality of this adapter. The case is made of metal and it appears to be precisely manufactured and durable The micro-usb plug fits very snugly into this adapter so it won't fall out. I gave the adapter a quick test by plugging in a micro-usb cable in and using it to charge my Nexus 6p phone. My Nexus 6p charged just fine and the Current Monitor app showed the charge_type as a fast charge. I like that the adapter came in a 2-pack. Another huge pro for this adapter is that it is ""Benson"" tested and approved. I wouldn't purchase a USB-C adapter, charger or cable without that important qualification.

I received this product at a discount for evaluation in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

I try to write helpful reviews so if you found the information in my review helpful please hit the ""Yes"" button beside the ""Was this review helpful to you?"" question below! Thank you!"
67,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered the wrong item.
68,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because on my motorcycle I have a micro USB cable routed through the innards of my motorcycle, from the battery to my phone mount on the handle bars. Since getting my Nexus 6P I didn't feel like routing a new type C cable through the bike. I couldn't take a picture of it plugged into the phone because the phone is my only camera.

This converter works well and charges my Nexus 6P well. I would advise this converter to my friends.

The size of the converter is .75"" when it is plugged in.

This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
69,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because I have an Asus Zenpad S 8.0 tablet with USB-C port for charging. I have 3 different chargers for the devices but even then, it's is annoying to deal with as it is the only device I own with USB-C. Having to own a separate cable to charge this device can become a burden. I use a slingbag every day but for others, it's not something they do so carrying a charging cord for their devices might be difficult if you have more than one standard.

This product comes in to help deal with the situation. I've tested on many micro usb cables and all have been able to charge my tablet just fine. I tested plugging in the micro usb cable to a PC and was able to access my files so data does work with this adapter. The fact that it comes with two is even better. These things are tiny and can be lost easily so I'd prefer to have a back up. Anyone with a USB-C device that still uses many other devices with micro USB should get one of these adapters. They'll save your life when in need of a charger.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
70,4.0 out of 5 stars,"What?: Otium USB C to Micro USB Adapter that allows you to use your existing Micro usb cable to connect your USB C devices with ease.

Why?: I bought a new tablet and phone that both have USB C connectors and I have a ton of Micro USB cables that I use. I wanted to find something that would allow me to still use these cables with my new devices.

Well?: I didn’t expect these adapters to be so small, I thought they would be bigger. Of Course, I am glad they are so small and they work perfectly. They are sleek and fit perfectly together with my micro usb cable and into my devices. I haven’t had any issues with these and I think they work very well.

Updates will follow if any changes occur

I did receive this product free or at a discounted rate for my honest review. All my reviews are my wholehearted opinion, regardless of discount or price paid for the item.

If you have any questions about this product, I will help as best as I can"
71,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these! Not much to say here - they do exactly what they're supposed to do! If you've ever had a need to convert a micro USB to a c-port then this is a great deal for you!
72,3.0 out of 5 stars,It works really well but using it a lot tends to loosen up the USB-C end. Now one of them can not keep connection for long and is loose. I'm now using second one only when when I don't have my USB-C cable around.
73,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only used one of the two adapters, but it seems to function as expected with my LG G5. Pretty happy overall, certainly cheaper than buying all new USB C cables so I'm a happy camper."
74,5.0 out of 5 stars,After carefully reviewing USD guidelines I exchanged all the cheaper adapters with these. No issues.
75,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product. Works just like it is suppose it. Easy to carry since it so small. Great price.
76,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works perfect!
77,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works as intended, lets me make full use of my retractable micro USB cables as I carry them around often and need multiple tips as I keep around a portable power bank and the free LG G5 spare battery+cradle on me often."
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Does exactly what it's supposed to, no surprises. All my existing micro-USB cables fit well into the adapter, and the adapter fits right into my new phone. No need to buy a whole bunch of new cables, just a few adapters!"
79,5.0 out of 5 stars,These adapters have worked really well for me so far. I am able to fast charge my HTC 10 no problem.
80,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works as advertised, Benson approved, reasonably compact, not much else I could ask for."
81,5.0 out of 5 stars,works with my cigarette lighter usb adapter
82,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are ok, a little better then the xiydai (spelling) ones I got. Still a bit slow. Maybe 50% charge over two hours."
83,5.0 out of 5 stars,It looks better than I expected.
84,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my Nexus 6P
85,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. Easy to carry. Great price
0,1.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I was really happy with this slick looking headphones. They lasted a week only and I just used to talk on the phone in my house: never to go to the gym or run. The control panel started acting weird and all of a sudden it stopped working; it wouldn't stay connected then it wont turn on. I had to spend at least 15 mins every time that i wanted to turn it on and then it only lasted a couple of seconds and it crashed. I guess it goes to stand-by mode by itself, and I say I guess because instruction manual and troubleshooting faq is useless. Company does not have a call canter in the US and you have to dial an international number (dial +86) and when you write them an e-mail they never answer you back. Please do not waste your money in this cool looking headphones that actually dont work."
1,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received item on October 9th, 2017. At first these were great. Sound was good, battery lasted a good while but went to use them today, November 26th, 2017 and they won't turn on and won't charge. I have maybe used them a dozen times, keep them stored in the storage pouch, have not abused them, and have charged them after use. So I guess I'm stuck w/ a $20+ pair of broken ear buds."
2,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldnt connect to to my Samsung phone or tablet, something $10 cheapies can do. no online support either"
3,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had the earbuds for less than 2 months and today they stopped working. When I originally got them I was very excited and they were great. So great that I ordered a second pair for my son the following day. Now, this morning as I'm working out it just died on me. Not exactly happy. This product says that it is sweat resistant and again up to this point it was working fine. Read the details, look at other options if you want something that's going to last more than 2 months."
4,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these earbuds on the recommendation of my brother. Package was cool, but missing USB charger. No worries as these are everywhere in my house so I used my brothers. Once fully charges I could not (nor could anyone else) pair these to any smart phone/ ipod. All the devices used never picked up the earbuds. Disappointing."
5,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good. Crackled and terrible connection. If you put your phone in your pocket forget hearing music. Bought another pair of cheap Bluetooth headphones from another company and they work fine.
6,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These were by far the greatest pair of headphones I have ever had. They were extremely light weight, I would forget they were in my ear or around my neck. The sound was truly amazing and when using the mic to talk outside in the wind there was no distortion or wind noise over the mic which is a problem I've had with other hands free devices.

With that said, I have had them for about a week now and have used them mildly. I have had trouble charging them, after having them plugged in over night it appears to be fully charged but after a song or two I get the low battery warning and they shut off. Also the control unit on the head phones themselves has started to gets extremely hot while briefly in use.

Sadly I am going to be returning them, preferably for a new pair but if not a refund. I really hope that it's just my pair that's malfunctioning and not the standard product."
7,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had product for a month, used three or four times, charged the headphones because battery was low and now they won’t turn on. Don’t waste your money on this item."
8,1.0 out of 5 stars,Wouldn’t pair.
9,5.0 out of 5 stars," When the box says ""Lighter weight"" they were not kidding. I originally wondered if anything was even in the box because it was so light. They come with a carrying case that clips using a carabiner. I always like when items come with cases so you can keep all the cords and accessories together. I can clip it on my purse handle and use the headphones any time I go out. The sound quality is really nice. No complaints. And the headphones charge up in less than 2 hours. Comes with 3 sizes of ear buds so you can find the right fit to your ears.

Very satisfied and definitely recommend them to others."
10,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to get another pair because my son stole mine! These come with several sized fittings so they fit both mine and my son's ears perfectly - which is very hard to find. The rubber looping tucks under the ear fold to keep it secured in place. I was worried about the magnets being too heavy and causing them to fall out but that is not the case. He runs with these in and has zero problems. If you've had any kind of Bluetooth earbuds these are really about the same to pair them to your phone/tablet. There is the volume up and down buttons and the multi function button. You just hold it until the white and orange light alternate, at that time your device is ready to be paired with earbuds. Just make sure your Bluetooth is turned on on your device.

These charge with an included USB and there is a notification on your device that shows you how much battery life is left - a feature I really like. It charges fully fairly quick and the charge lasts for several days of average usage.

The sound is perfect and very clear. Zero static or interference noise. It really blasts loud on max volume and is still quite clear on min volume."
11,1.0 out of 5 stars,"it cannot be find on my iPhone 7 Plus, or other devices
(Even after I fully charged it )"
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a little skeptical about these at first. I have wireless headphones and decided to give this one a shot. For the price, the sound quality is amazing, I love the carrying case and extra rubber buds. I don't know if I'll need waterproof headphones but I do work up a sweat in the gym. I love the feel of them and how secure they are over your ears. The previous one I have annoys and agitates the inside of my ear after a while like when I'm flying but I love how these wrap around the ears.

I don't regret the purchase and I'm sure you'll be surprised how great these head phones are. Great buy!"
13,5.0 out of 5 stars," I have owned and tried a bunch of different ones. These are by far my favorite ones and here's why:
-They fit perfectly in and on my ears, comfortably
-They have a beautiful look and finish to them
-The sound quality is amazing for this price point
-They connect very easily to my phone
-Does not take a long time to charge
-Definitely lasts for a long time

I would recommend these headphones to anyone who needs a great, inexpensive pair to work out or just for leisure. They are great!"
14,4.0 out of 5 stars,"All I can say is....WOW!
Best wireless earbuds I've ever owned!
The sound is out of this world!!!🎉
I received the package in the mail in excellent condition, well stored in the case..... I will be purchasing at least 3 more for the family since they can't keep their hands off of mine!
One piece of advice though, do not wear these earbuds on loud volume when you are amoungst other people for example, at work, you will NOT be able to hear them... The noise cancelling technology is incredible!....my husband was literally yelling at me to gain my attention and I didn't hear him, the volume was less than quarter the way up on my phone volume scale. Needless to say you can't go wrong purchasing these but only if you're looking for chrisp, solid treble and bass sounds all at once.!😉
Excellent performance, excellent technology!
One thing I must add however, upon opening my package I noticed the little pouch that the earbuds are housed in the zipper is broken if it wasn't for that I would give the whole overall five stars!
I must add, These blow Beats Earbuds out the water...
hands down!!!"
15,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give this less than one star if I could. Won't pair, and it didn't come with anything to charge it."

Introduction

Ok, so the thing is I love headphones, like, to the point that I buy new headphones just to have new headphones, not necessarily because I need them. You know, some people like purses, others like cats, I love headphones. A few days ago I decided to order three new pairs of headphones, and get a replacement for an old pair that broke. Yes, that's right, I ordered four pairs of headphones. Guess which one I've listened to? That's right, these. Guess which one I'm listening? That's right, these. Guess which ones are sitting in a pile somewhere, that's right, not these. So, without further ado, let me do what I can to paint a word picture that does this beautiful sound machines justice.

Product Description

The headphones are your standard Bluetooth headphones in appearance except they have a remote on their right side. Bluetooth earbuds typically either a) hook on your ear, b) have a necklace that they hook to, or c) have a remote on one side. I have about four of model a), they're great but annoying when I want to listen to one ear only (which is quite often), so I don't tend to use them. I have two pairs of option b), but the battery doesn't last very long so I don't tend to use them. I believe I have about three of model c), and they are typically my preferred method. The remote is nice because it's easily accessible, the buttons are easy to navigate, and it's great.

These headphones also have a little tab that helps them stay in your ear very well and very comfortably. Seriously, the only reason I took them off recently was the battery died, not because of discomfort. The battery, by the way, lasted my first time for about 4-5 hours, but I do not think that was a full charge.

The magnetic part is cool and all, quite strong actually, but not extremely useful. It does help when you're putting the headphones away as they tangle much much less than normal headphones, but why would you put these headphones away? They sound so great I'd prefer to just keep them on.

In terms of audio quality, I literally cannot convince you enough how great they sound. Nearly every set of bluetooth headphones I own have this slight distortion sound to them. They either sound like someone blew out the speakers ever so slightly before sending them to me, or that the speakers need to be broken before they sound great. The thing is, the sound never goes away. My (previous) favorite pair even had that sound, but they had great sound on top of that so I did not notice much of a difference. Guess what are the first pair of Bluetooth headphones I've owned that don't have that annoying background noise (that possible only I can hear)? That's right, these ones.

On top of not sounding slightly distorted, these sound about as good as my all time favorite pair (Sony Extra Bass earbuds), except those were wired, designed by a sound company, and had the worlds best grips. These headphones compete with my audiophile headphones while being Bluetooth and having crappy grips. Yea, the grips are nothing great. They're not bad, but I've definitely had better. Most people won't care though to be honest, or even notice a difference by the way.

Again, I highly recommend these headphones. Honestly, these are truly wonderful headphones and I am absolutely glad I bought them. They are basically the headphones I have been wishing I had since I lost my old Sony headphones (Rest in Peace where you are!) and are officially my new favorite headphones.

Conclusion:

The best pair of headphones I currently own. Highly comfortable, great sound, awesome headphones."
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are the best I've ever used, and that includes the iPhone earbuds that come with all Apple products. The sound is great! They stay in my ears during long, sweaty runs, and they're easy to adjust volume and turn on/off. It does take quite a long time pressing the on/off button for them to actually turn on/off so you have to keep them in your ears and wait for the buds to tell you they're connected or disconnected but it's not bothersome.

I don't really need the extra little piece of silicone that keeps them in your ear, but that's probably useful for some people. I've used these for about 2-3 months almost daily at the gym while working out, running, walking, etc as well as outside on walks. They do a great job of staying in the ear and delivering great sound.

I haven't used them for phone calls so I can't speak on that part but as a bluetooth sound delivery system, they're perfect. They even come delivered with charge so you can use them right out of the box! I use them about 30-60 minutes per day and get about a week or two out of every full charge. That works very well for me. Great product!"
18,5.0 out of 5 stars, love these headphones they are really comfortable and versitile great to be used anywhere any time connects to bluetooth.
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these magnetic headphones! They have many accessories and fittings to find just the right fit for comfort! They come with a compact durable carrying case as well! The sound quality is amazing! Great bass and the highs mids and lows are all on point! They are light weight and extremely comfortable! I highly recommend these to anyone looking for a clear crisp and concert like headphone experience with the convenience of sweat resistance!
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear buds are excellent. Easy to work, holds a charge for a long time and comfortable. Great value!"
21,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great price, great sound-"
22,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound breaks up and if you turn your head or move wrong it cuts out. Sometimes the sound is solid and great but most times it's bad. I can't seem to pair it with more than once device at a time. If it's paired with my laptop I can't pair it with anything else. even if I'm nowhere near the laptop. Not happy. I would return if I knew where the box was. The ear buds themselves are good. Shape and feel, but that alone can't make these worth the buy. I normally switch to my old pair with a cord for reliability."
23,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a lot of base, but for $25 dollars you can't expect much more."
24,3.0 out of 5 stars,after a few days only right ear worked.
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound could be better but for the price these works great.
26,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got em quick in less then 24 hours annnd they totally work better then I expected totally worth it
27,5.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t think you’ll ever spend $13 and be happier.
28,2.0 out of 5 stars,These last ONLY 5 1/2 hours! I am not impressed
29,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product at a good price!
Lord bless!"
30,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good earphones, comes with a little case to hold the extra ear buds"
31,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that these headphones are magnetic if I can just say that first - so cool! I've had another pair of magnetic headphones in the past but they had trouble sticking together, but that is not the case with these.

The cord that connects the two earbuds is long enough so you don't feel like one wrong neck move will make the earbuds come out, but also its spaced far apart enough that you don't feel like you may accidentally rip them out of your ear while jogging. I like to use these around the house while chatting with friends and cleaning or cooking, as well as for runs. These are great earbuds and also have great and clear sound! :)"
32,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earphones to use during field work and for general excercising. First thing I should say is that I was immediately impressed by the quality of the earphones. From the presentation, to the included case, everything seems to give the impression that these are high end esrphones. For the price, they are definitely a great buy they did not have any problems staying in my ear, and I found the magnetic feature very useful. Connecting to my phone was a breeze, and the battery seems to last a very long time - they even came with a charge out of the box. All in all, I am happy with my purchase, and would not hesitate to buy again."
33,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
34,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them
35,5.0 out of 5 stars,
36,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it
37,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headset
38,5.0 out of 5 stars,"received it 10 days ago. waited for couple days before I post my review.
I searched a lot of bluetooth earbuds, and then purchased this due to the high star rating and reasonable price.
it is impressive
easy pairing, loud and clear sound, good base!
The battery life is soooo long!
I am not a heavy user, just 2 hours per day during I work out in gym. It has been 10 days after the 1st time charged, but the baterry level is still high."
39,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using these headphones at the gym and love them! They fit snuggly in my ear without causing any discomfort, but dont budge which is the biggest issue i have had in the past. They are lightweight and sound awesome for the price point. Setup wad suoer easy and I was also impressed that they came with a cute carrying case that keeps them protected. Definitrly recommend these!"
40,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can now experience the joy that are wireless ear buds! I can't wait to use them when I'm at work so I'm not stuck to my computer. My office will now be accessible to me from all corners while still being able to listen to my music. I tried them out as soon as I got them and boy, was I ecstatic. Easy set up, GREAT sound, and the fact that I can go anywhere with them in is just... Joyous!"
41,2.0 out of 5 stars,Its says that any phone can connect this?i guess not.its not working with my samsung j5 prime.it cant recognize it.
42,5.0 out of 5 stars, Great earbuds. Came with smaller sized buds which is perfect for my smaller ears. I love that they're magnetic so I never have to worry about them getting caught on anything in my purse. They also came with a case and charger
43,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good quality. I like the different size ear tip. I choose the smallest and it is very comfortable. Another thing I like is the container. I don't worry the cable will be tangled and mess with makeups, keys in my purse anymore."
44,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not enuff stars to rate these. The sounds whoaaaaaa superb,build gr8 quality,fit perfect neva fell out my ears, setup was super easy,packaging super delivery in 2 days fastttttt. I'm buying again. 10 star product n seller"
45,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The ear buds were heavy, but the grip were surprisingly comfortable and I can go through my days without a problem. Battery life lasts me for a good 4-5 hours no problem. For its cost, a great product!"
46,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good product for the price nothing to be unhappy about. They work and work good in the gym, the magnets are too big for a motorcycle helmet."
47,5.0 out of 5 stars,It looks expensive and works well. I have worn this pair for two hours straight and they don’t hurt my ears. Highly recommend.
48,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought theses for my nephew he loves them he said their great quility and they stay in his ear wile running and working out
49,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound quality they fit perfectly in the ear and don't fall out very easy to use and easy to read instructions. Has a very long reach too
50,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work perfect and sound good. Can't beat for yhe price.
51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived as promised, in perfect condition, with clear directions for use. Really like the Latin name: otium = leisure."
52,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, easy to pair, easy to control"
53,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are by far the best Bluetooth earphones i’ve Ever had. If you want wireless earphones that sound great these are a Must buy
54,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The packaging is very nice and professional. The earphones come with a black case to store them in along with different sets of ear plugs to suit your needs.
The head phones are feel comfy and are easy to connect to Bluetooth.
Great for its price!"
55,3.0 out of 5 stars,They have good sound quality. Battery lasts a good amount of time. Good sound cancelling quality. My struggle with these is even using the smallest covers they are a bit big for my ears. I can still use them just not for long periods of time. Would make great workout headphones. They stay in place very well. Edited to add: the sound quality is terrible for phones calls. It sounds like the person is a mile away from you. Even with volume on max it’s hard to hear. So soft sounding.
56,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really love these headphones. They sound good and for me the charge on the headphones lasts 8 to 10 hours. I usually have them in at work. But I would buy these again.
57,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If sound and comfort is your preference then this is a definite must buy, noise cancellation and comfortable fit with great bass"
58,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have owned many pair of bluetooth headsets and these are by far the best dollar for dollar and they are relatively cheap.
59,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Earphones are amazing, i use them for the gym, noise cancellation is perfect, overall well design. Do recommend them."
60,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are very clear however they don't hang on the neck properly. Still overall nice sound quality
61,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not connecting to my iPhone 6 at all.

Update: Didn't connect to my boyfriend's iPhone 5 either. They did connect to my dad's Galaxy. I'm guessing these are just for Android devices. Sucks for me, but at least dad likes them..."
62,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is not bad on these and the connection seems to extend pretty good before it drops. But these lasted 2 weeksish and now are totally dead. They won't charge, the won't connect, I tried multiple cords nothing works. I was listening to music at work, went on lunch and plugged them in to charge so when I came back, they would be good to go and totally dead. The charge is only good for about 4-5 hrs which is why I charge them on my break. I did it the same way everyday and today dead. Sucks cause I like to listen to music while I work. Nothing crazy happened while at lunch, no storms, power flicker nothing. I am giving two stars because the functionality was not bad when they worked. Glad it happened while I could still return them. Buy at your own risk."
63,4.0 out of 5 stars,I am really pleased with the excellent packaging of the product and really love the quality of sounds that it gives off. Don't exactly know if they are 100% sound canceling headphones but they do seem to blur out outside sound giving you everything you need to enjoy your entertainment. But I would say that there should be a clip on how to adjust the fitting. For example when the headphones are being used they kind are spread out and it just looks a bit awkward when the wire is so spread out. Just wished there was a adjustable clip because that would really give this product that finishing touch. Overall this product is very satisfying!
64,4.0 out of 5 stars,If you want a clean overall sound it's definitely great for the price. Highs and mids come of well. Bass is ok as long as you're not such a bass junkie. I mostly only use earbuds when I am working out. During my workouts I want bass heavy DnB and Hip Hop. It only does an adequate job for this type of music.
65,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't even work
66,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst Bluetooth ever, I cannot put my phone in my pants pocket without it cutting out. Your phone needs to be so close. Useless if you want to put your phone in your pocket well working out. Terrible product"
67,4.0 out of 5 stars,I really like these earphones except for the fact that they fit uncomfortable in my ears. I used the smallest attachment but they still fit big and bulky in my ears. Sound is great and easily connects to my device. The magnetic earbuds are also great. My only complaint is the fit. 😕
68,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kinda sucks had it for not even 2 weeks before it broke and since i didnt pay the warranty im out of luck great otherwise and good noise canceling
69,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall okay headphones. They work well for the price and have a relatively long battery life. However, the charger cord that they came with doesn't actually fit and won't charge them. I had another one from a different device that I tried and it happened to work, but otherwise I would be unable to use them. Also, they cut out sometimes for seemingly no reason. The headphones themselves are fine, but the charging cord issue is ridiculous."
70,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality and battery life on these earbuds are surprisingly good! Overall I’m very pleased with them for the price. I mainly use them at the gym or listening to music/podcasts while doing chores at home. I can usually go a room or two away from my phone without noticable static, which is great.

The only reason I give 4 stars is that none of the loops that came with them were a good fit for my ears - they all seemed too big and just didn’t fit properly. All of them make my ears sore after about 20-30 minutes, so I don’t use them. They stay in place pretty well without the loops, so this isn’t a deal breaker. Just a heads up for those with smaller ears!"
71,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is really good - but the build feels overly cheap even at this price point. Feels like it would break after a few weeks of use. Ended up returning and picking up one of the competitors for a few more bucks but feels far more durable.
72,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They're good, but they have an odd effect on the bluetooth capacity of the iPhone7. The phone could not detect the earbuds until I reset them AND forgot the other bluetooth devices that had been paired with my phone. Then, my phone couldn't detect my bluetooth headphones until I made it forget the earbuds. Basically, the phone can never have both in memory and whenever I want to switch back to the earbuds I ALSO have to reset them, which is annoying. It's 2018 people. This should be easy.
Another stupid thing is that the instructions for the reset are useless. I had to contact customer service and the instructions he gave me were not the ones given in the manual but they worked. Update the manual so that customers don't have to go out of their way to extract information from the company."
73,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, not great. The chord behind the neck catches on my shirt and when I turn my head, they will yank in my ear so that's uncomfortable, I'm not sure if this is an issue with just these or any other similar style, I have not tried any others.

Pairing can be a bit of a pain. I was unable to reliably use them with my windows 8 laptop. And if you're thinking about pairing with laptop and phone and being able to switch between the two, forget about it."
74,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my first pair or wireless and they are great. I use solely for the gym and keep around the back of my neck. Completely out of the way and stay in ears. Only thing is it messes up calls - sometimes they go onto speaker but not into earphones. Only sometimes so I can’t figure out why. But great earphone
75,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable and reasonable sound quality. My main gripe is the terrible short battery life. My bad, but when running a half marathon they (being fully charged when I started) gave up after 90 minutes with ""low battery"". Would trade a litle more size for a bit more reasonable battery life."
76,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these. Easy to set up. Nice and light, sounds pretty good for such a low price. I like the shape of the ear pieces, they stay in my ear great. I love the case that comes with it."
77,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was surprised by how well these work. They are fine for audio or for voice calls, and the battery lasts several hours of use on a charge.

Note: the headphones cannot be used while charging.

The cable could be thicker - just for durability - but I'm fairly satisfied already."
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is very good for phone calls and music, and the charge lasts forever. It also recharges quickly. For the price it exceeds expectations."
79,2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are alright. They keep falling out of my ears and cant seem to get them to stay put
80,2.0 out of 5 stars,The audio quality for running is good. I charge it every 2 runs. For me the audio control button pulls to the right side when the cord is resting on my neck. It's a little off balanced because there's more weight on the right side of the control than the left. I feel like the cable ends up unevenly placed on my neck.
81,5.0 out of 5 stars,"lovely , sound is crystal clear during phone call"
82,5.0 out of 5 stars,Messed up my first review so lets try again. Everything came in fine and once I figured out the pairing the sound is actually the best I have had from ear bud headphones. Solid product. Loved my old cheaper Otiums too.
83,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed. Bought 2, one for the hubby and one for me. Hubbys still worked great, but mine crapped out after a month. Won’t turn on, won’t charge. Now can’t return for refund because it’s outside the refund date."
84,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, good sound and nice microphone."
85,1.0 out of 5 stars,The magnets on the earbuds are so big and heavy they won't stay in my ears. I would have returned them but I had to pay shipping and wouldn't get most of my money back. Very disappointed.
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most satisfied I have ever been with a product ever!These are just amazing headphones for under $30. I can run with them and the sound quality is quite good. Certainly worth the money!
87,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable feel, no trouble pairing with Android, no static/noise, battery lasts more than expected. What else could you possibly ask for?"
88,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A gift for my niece, she said she loved it"
89,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow just got them they sound soo good they are great headphone to get highly recommend you guys get these thank you very happy COSTUMER
90,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great. It is nice that they are magnetic which makes them hard to lose.
91,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t even last me a month. The left side headphone went out.
92,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are actually really good. The bass is fantastic and they dont fall out of my ear!
93,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good!"
94,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When it comes to bluetooth headphones, these work well. Some parts of the function I don't understand. The back of the earbuds are magnetic. I would love for someone to let me know what the situation calls that would need for the earbuds to be connected together(as in the photo I posted). The control box has buttons for volume control, power button, and the usb charger. There is also a small hook that, for some unknown reason, hooks together the two sides of the wires. They do work really well. Sound quality is pretty good. They are easy to pair the bluetooth with your device. It also comes with a cute carrying case that can keep them safe while in bag and on the go. They are nice, I just personally feel that some of the features were not necessary."
95,5.0 out of 5 stars," This is what I use whenever I go to the gym. It connects to my phone right away after I turned on the Bluetooth which is a plus because my previous headphones take a while to connect. It took me an hour and a half to charge it for the first time which is okay. The sound is crisp and clear whether I use it for music or talking to someone over the phone. I haven't done any extreme running in the treadmill so I can't say if it sticks to your ears that much but overall in my experience it doesn't fall.

One thing I like about it is that it has a nice and sleek design casing. It also has some extra ear plugs if that's what you call.

I'll continue to use this headphone as it is."
96,4.0 out of 5 stars,"sound: 8/10
durabiliry: 9/10
convenience: 6/10

good sound compared to higher end products, with the right mixture of trebble and bass they arent too ""tinny"" and are pretty comfortable to listen to especially if you use them with an equilizer app. The magnetic backs on the sizable drivers are convnvenient, but the one problem I have wih this product is that one earbud in and one earbud out just doesnt work. if you put the cord behind your neck, and let one earbud dangle on your chest, it slowly droops until it takes all of the cord and it limits your maneuverability until you pull the earbud highet up closer to your neck. if you try to put the earbud on top of your ear, the earbud again drops too far and you end up looking like a dingus. A simple fix for this is to include a small clip in the middle of the earbuds so you can clip then to your collar and they will not fall too far."
97,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fabulous set of earbuds. They did not come charged, but they were quick to charge, and then they connected to my android super easy. They came with such a cute carrying case too, which was an extra bonus. They sound wonderful, and they block out most of the outside noise, which is also great. I turned it up pretty loud, and I didn’t hear any distortion. Overall, this is a great set of headphones!"
98,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned multiple types of wireless Bluetooth headsets from multiple manufacturers and to be honest I have hated most of them. These Otium Bluetooth Wireless Headphones are a different story. I really like these headphones and have been using them everyday since I received them, and here is why:
-- They fit very well on my ears without falling off, and fit will within my ears as well.
-- The sound quality is much better than I expected. Lows are low and Highs are high.
-- They have a very professional appearance and look like a higher end product, compared to the price that I paid.
-- These headphones connect quickly and automatically to my device. With some of my other headphones it can be a battle.
-- Charges quickly (fully charged in less than 2 hours)
-- Once fully charges these headphones last for hours.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone who needs a great, high quality pair of Wireless Bluetooth Headphones that won't fall off of your ears while working out or while relaxing. I wear these headphones to listen to Binaural Sleep Meditation Music at night and they work great!"
99,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Used these worth my Android.

Have had wireless headphones before, and the other headphones had a loud beeping noise Everytime you pressed a button and I was super happy these didn't have that 'feature' however after using them a while I realized having that feature was helfpul as there is sometimes a delay between pressing play and the app actually playing. Without the beep sometimes I wasn't sure if I pressed the button or not. This was annoying but not a deal breaker.

Weird thing, these headphones would work to advance or rewind my audio books (it was reversed, you pressed volume up to rewind and volume down to advance) but it would not advance songs in Pandora or Spotify. Again annoying but not a deal breaker.

Battery life is great! Never had it die one during the day. I don't typically used them continuous but I use them for my hour to hour and a half commute each way and sporadically during my 8 hour work day.

The distance I could walk from my phone was much greater than my old headphones which was great. Noise isolation was also better than my old headphones.

Fit was also good. I recently lost these headphones though and given the relatively minor issues I listed above I will be looking for a different pair. However if I hadn't lost them, I probably would not have bothered to replace them."
100,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my goodness, shame on me for waiting to buy blue-tooth buds , I'm serious, since being a 3-4 time a week gym rat since 2011 and dealing with tangled cords or pulling cords out of your ears on a smith machine or pull-up, these buds are EXCELLENCE .

And I use them for over 90 minutes -2 x's a week and charge them to play it safe, but they have yet to run out on me.
Plus they sync in 2-3 seconds via your blue tooth phone
Once you click on they audibly notify you ( headset on ) and the same when you power off.
Also has a simple + - volume control near your right side.
Nice addition is the round zippered case and that the buds are magnetized back to back creating less tangles.

As soon as customer service tells me how to sync with my TV sound-bar via blue tooth I'll be ecstatic !"
101,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the most comfortable in-ear/wireless earbuds I've tried so far. The rounded loop seems to go ""in"" my ear with the least effort and I really like the magnetic clasp feature for when they're not in use. My only major complaint is power management. They don't seem to turn off automatically the way others I've owned do. One time I forgot I left them on while removing them to talk to a store clerk. An hour later when I got home and thought to check, sure enough, they were still on! For something so advanced, it seems pretty old-school to have to actively manage on/off power states..."
102,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this because I do running after work and I need a pair of headphones to listening to music. Running with these headphones are really amazing, they will not fall out from your ears. Putting them in your ears doesn't get pain like the others that I've had. It's the best wireless headphones I've ever used! Nice looking! These are really comfortable even if I have it on for a long time, my ears do not have any irritation. Highly recommend!"
103,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These wireless buds are pretty amazing. The feel of the materials are definitely a quality found in higher end products. They stayed in my ears and didn't hurt me. Sound quality is excellent for the price. No issues with reception from or to the phone. I do wish they came with and clip so the wire wouldn't bounce on my neck when running.

Comes with and small, round zipper pouch, along with different size speaker covers with little extenders to help the buds stay in place. I usually have issues with the comfort of the extenders, but these are seemingly designed for me, the extenders are very flexible and soft but strong enough to stay put."
104,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome, best Bluetooth earbuds for the price, battery life lasts the entire day with mild usage, with continuous , say like at the gym, it lasts about 4-6 hrs. Volume gets pretty loud, I usually keep the volume around 50-70% and the audio can still be heard by someone next to me. Build quality is good and it fits snugly in my ears. The compact carrying case is great too. Only thing I didn't like is that the small black plastic piece that used to tie the wire together/ adjust the wires, comes off too easily. In fact, after the first week I already lost the plastic piece. Luckily it doesn't matter too much and I get by just fine without it, but it does suck that it came off so easily. I'll probably just end up making it or just 3D printing one myself when I get the chance. Overall this is a great product, obviously can't be compared to something like the jaybirds, but these are still great Bluetooth earbuds for the price. Hope this helps."
105,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had two pairs of Phaiser Bluetooth buds and so far, both have broken on me- eventually a wire breaks and one ear goes out, and there's no fixing that. These sound just as good as the more expensive pair of phaisers for half the price. I'm not an audiophile so, while these surely aren't the best sound quality available, they're great for the price. I only use them to listen to podcasts and tunes at work where I'm surrounded by loud machinery, so that would all be wasted on me anyway."
106,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Earbuds are very unique! The design is different and also the way it fits into your ear. They sound crisp and get really loud. They fit inside instead of the traditional outside of the ear. If you can get used to the feel then you will like them. The way they are magnetized when hangin from your neck is great so that they don't go swinging everywhere. Nice buy
107,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First, I love the magnet that keeps the buds together around my neck while I am not using them!! Easy to sync to my iphone and great sound quality. Nice price too. you can move away from your phone quite a bit before it starts breaking up. I go 2 rooms away with no issues! Then are very comfortable and don't pull in my ears. The charger looks durable. Nice product!"
108,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the headphones. Great fit and they do not pop out of your ears...no matter how sweaty you get! I love the sound. Since I ride the bus there's a lot of noise and the headphones definitely give me the privilege to listen to my own music without any interruption. I love these wireless bluetooth earbuds, and they seem to do what's advertised. Good product!!"
109,5.0 out of 5 stars,The earbuds are awesome. They look and sound good. Metal construction and light weight. I've bought many bluetooth earbuds but these really stand out. I listen to them at work. I work in a warehouse and i can get through the whole shift with one charge at 75% volume. I would definately recommend these earbuds. These earbuds are worth four times their price. You won't be dissatisfied.
110,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have several pairs of earbuds, each for different things. buy this one for my wife workouts. I bought this pair because of the over the ear design, hoping they would stay in better ,i feel The sound quality is good, the price was right, Pairing was simple and the controls are easy to navigate. Very happy with my purchase."
111,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have been my favorite ear buds so far. They are extremely comfortable and the sound is excellent. The charge actually lasts for a good amount of hours, I don't know maybe four hours of straight listening?....maybe more. They definitely stay in without budging during during sweaty runs, and that was my most important need, besides the sound of course. If these ever give out I will definitely be ordering them again."
112,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great, the sound quality is good, and I love that they have magnets on them so if I need to take them out for a few minutes I won't accidentally lose them. I only wish the battery lasted a wee bit longer before needing a re-charge!"
113,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually have very little faith in Bluetooth headphones and am pretty much an AUX cord loyalist. These headphones showed me that a quality pair of BT earbuds can be made for under $50. Now, don't get me wrong, these don't hold a candle to more expensive wired sets, but these are pretty amazing for the price. And they don't look, feel or operate like they're cheap! Will be back for another pair when I (inevitably) lose them."
114,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the most comfortable earphones I have ever owned. The ear loops are soft and flexible, the earbuds are at just the right angle to fit the ear properly, unlike most I have tried, where it goes straight into the ear. These earphones are so light and comfortable you almost forget they are even on. The sound is perfect. I am very satisfied with these and plan to buy more for use as presents. Thank you"
115,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great earbuds. Crystal clear sound. For the price you can't go wrong. They even have a microphone! They fit very well and don't fall out even when I work out. These are definitely worth the money. I highly recommend!
116,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought more than 3 Bluetooth headphones, I think this one is the best for noise cancelation. Also tonight I take it to the gym and spent almost two hours there, the headphones are still awake. I am very satisfied with this product."
117,4.0 out of 5 stars,Stays in ears better than jaybirds. Good quality sound. Connects with ease. The only reason not 5 stars is I wish the sound got louder. Great product for the money. Really worth it. Sound like a 100$ pair easily.
118,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these Magnetic Design Bluetooth headphones,very easy to pair to my phone via Bluetooth,I use them during workout,it fit my ears very well,I have no problem to wear them while doing my workout,the magnetic design is fantastic,that can hold them to my neck while I am not listening.the sound is very good as well.
Recommend it."
119,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So I have a pair of Powerbeats 3 that I got for Christmas. I am a chef and I wear one earpiece at a time. 3 months after I received them the left ear clip completely broke off. Powerbeats 3 have a 12 hour battery life which got me through so many rough times. I ordered these because I didn't want to pay 120 to replace my beats and they say the battery life lasts 8 hours listening/calling. I call bs. I fully charged these and they lasted 2 hours at most. I wouldn't order this product for the battery life and I'm sending them back for false advertising. Sound is not bad, but j can't charge my earbuds every 2 hours"
120,3.0 out of 5 stars,These work well on devices that are compatible....they are comfortable and seem to hold a charge for a good amount of time. I am giving them 3 stars because I purchased them to use with my FireTV and FireStick and they are not recognized by either. Evidently there are multiple bluetooth technologies and FireTv and FireStick use A2DP and these earbuds do not support this protocol.
121,4.0 out of 5 stars,My ears are still too small for these even with the smallest buds :( but I use it because I paid money but they fall out a few times while working out.
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This are my husbands favorite wireless ear buds that we have. He uses them for everything from gaming, listening to music, and taking phone calls. He also takes them with him everytime he travels by plane. They hold a charge for a very long time he used them for 5 straight hours while gaming with no problem."
123,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Received today started to hear distortion on both sides after few mins of listening to music. Don't know if this is manufacturing defect, expecting to receive a better one after returning this or refund.

Update 9/14/17: Working fine after resetting and sound is good for price point. Will update again after few weeks of use. But the battery dies in 2-3 hrs could be improved. Thanks."
124,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very nice clarity earbuds. I'd definitely buy another pairs again. Had to have the magnetic feature. I'd be crushed if I lost them. I'm not big on paying doubled the price for lost items, especially if I like the product a lot. This is one of a kind product! I really love it!"
125,3.0 out of 5 stars,Design is not good and the fit is uncomfortable . Sound quality is good.
126,5.0 out of 5 stars,Earphones came in this nice case to keep the charger and changeable buds in and the earphones in which is nice so that they don't break when not being used. The earphones have a very nice sound and fit in my ears nicely and get very loud. Definely love these for the gym connected right to my phone with no problem!

129,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this item from Amazon Oct 2017 and started using Nov 1 2017. This product started to transmit a crackling sound at the beginning in Jan 2018 and stopped working on Jan 15 2018. Charged completely but now the device does not turn back on. I attempted several times with no luck. I really liked the device and it had pretty good reviews on Amazon, unfortunately for me this is a huge disappointment."
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work surprisingly well for the price. I use them for working out (aerobics) and they are perfect. They stay put, stay connected, and function flawlessly. Battery life is at least five hours. Never tried more than that."
131,5.0 out of 5 stars,This bluetooth headphone is so cool! The back of the earbuds is magnetic. They are easy to pair the bluetooth with your device. You don't have to sit over the desk because of they don't need to plug into the laptop. Sound quality is pretty good.
132,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is incredible! I have a favorite pair of headphones that I bought a second pair of and now I wish I knew about these before I did. They have extremely clear sound even at a higher volume, the style is better then headphones you would buy for $150, they fit perfectly in your ear without coming out. I don't understand why people are paying so much for high name brand headphones when these are equivalent or better in design and quality. I will be buying multiple sets of these headphones! Cheers the manufacturers, thank you."
133,5.0 out of 5 stars,great little earpiece. charges quickly and lasts for hours with great sounds. also comes with a nice carrying case with multiple size adapters to fit different size ears. would recommend it to the others.
134,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These were really great for the first 4 months I had them. Now they won't connect to my phone easily. I have to remove them from my blue tooth menu and then reconnect every time I turn them on. After charging them, they only last half the day. They're starting to not even charge. It takes quite a bit of effort to get them to charge and it seems like it takes forever for them to fully charge, which makes the 4 hour battery life not worth the effort."

136,5.0 out of 5 stars,I needed a set of Bluetooth headphones for work to use while cutting grass. I came across these hidden gems. The sound quality is amazing and clear. The microphone cancels out background noiseand they are light weight but of metal construction so they are durable.

139,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was just looking for a cheaper backup working gym working pair for work. Didn't expected it has better sound and loaded with tremendous bass than my old Jaybird X2, and it's very light and comfortable too. With this new magnet clip design. I enjoyed my Jaybird X2 ($150+) for two years, I think I'm going to enjoy this pair more. I hope it has good battery life (9 hours as advertised) as well. Then it's going to be perfect."

Initial build quality is great, sound quality is good, and I definitely would have paid more for them had they been more expensive. Totally recommend."
143,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Red and Blue ones for $19.99 are way more comfortable and sound a way better. Plus the controls are easier to access.
144,1.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life on these headsets is dismal at best not worth the time of day
145,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and do a great job of noise cancellation. The buds are magnetic and snap together nicely. My only 'issue' is that the buds themselves are pretty large, but they do still fit in the ear nicely. Very easy to connect to iPhone 6, instructions were simple to follow."
146,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really great headphones for the price, last longer than 8 hours for me, charges fully in a little over an hour, only problem i ever had was when I went snowboarding and it was pretty cold and the headphones cut off a couple times, but besides that the sound quality and quality of the headphones itself is really great!"

149,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great! The sound is really good, and the buds come with a few different sized ear bud attachments (which is good for me because I have really small earholes). Also, when the earbuds are in, they really cancel out a LOT of ambient noise. I love these."

0,5.0 out of 5 stars," This Otium X6 have amazing sound so clear even if it's low and high frequency and the quality is perfect. It's easy to use and fits perfectly. It includes different size of ear-pods that is great! Battery life takes 9hours, its also water resistant.

I also use this on our television since I have a Bluetooth receiver so to avoid noise when somebody sleeping at night."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very lightweight headphones, sound quality is clear and loud, headphones feel secured in the ear, no problem running or exorcizing while wearing them. Easy to pair, and microphone works great for handsfree. Great deal for the price"
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this bluetooth headphones for several days, and it meets all my needs.
Pros:
* It's equipped with wings which prevent the earphone from falling out of your ear.
*The sound quality is good enough at this price. I think it is at least as good as Apple's earpods (Not airpods, I don't have it...)
*Details of the earphones is perfect. Their factory does better job in the earphones' exterior than Bose. (Shame on Bose!)
Cons:
* I haven't tested it's battery life. It definitely can't last 24 hours (which Apple said they can). My estimation is about 7 to 8 hours.
*It is not completely water-resistant. The seller says it is sweat-proof which means it is safe with only a few water. It is Ok to me. I will not wear it while taking shower or swimming, but someone may.

Conclusion:
If you're look for a cost-effective wireless headphones, here it is. With 80% less price, you get 80% performance comparing to other famous brands' earphones."
3,5.0 out of 5 stars," I have had these headphones for a few days now and really love them. They are great for my active lifestyle. I have used them whil running, biking, lifting weights, and mowing the lawn. They have stayed in place perfectly.
They are comfortable and lightweight. They also pair very easily with my iPhone and sound great. I would strongly recommend."
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was my first time switching from wired headphones to wireless headphones since I have been listening to music via Iphone or Ipod. I wasn't really sure what to think since it was new to me but these headphones gave me a good opinion. They were very comfortable to wear and they fit inside the ear nicely. I wasn't sure how I would feel about something resting on me but it didn't bother me at all. The only con I had was that the part of the headphone on the cord with the power buttons and volume became a bit annoying as it sits on the back of my neck and was harder to access. Pairing the headphones was a breeze and have a pretty good battery life Overall sound quality was great. It was not dull or faded but sounds crisp and clean. I enjoyed these while I was working out and they never fell out or had any issues at all. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of wireless headphones.
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price you can't beat these Bluetooth neckband style earbuds. I have a few different brands of this style of headset. This one is by far the most comfortable. Many have an issue where the earbuds will fall out when you turn your head...these have long enough wires from neck and to earbuds that they do not pull out. They also connect to each other via magnets in the earbud portion.

The sound was good, but initial sound quality left a little bit to be desired on the bass end, but was certainly adequate at this price point. Connection was easy and quick with my phone and never dropped the signal throughout my use. I expect the sound to improve after a break in period.

I highly recommend them for anyone looking for a necband style headset."
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphone for running or doing other exercises! The design of it is perfect so it won't fall down when doing exercises. After charing, this headphone can almost last for three days for normal use."

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This might be the Otium's best product yet. The SoundBuds Life model is remarkably well built and looks extremely modern and sleek. The audio, being my biggest concern, is actually very dynamic and clear. The bass, mids and highs are all well balanced and the volume is plenty strong enough. The noise cancellation was surprising.The controls are all intuitive, the construction being superb, so I don't foresee any major damage or part malfunctions. Everything is either encased or sealed. The product is completely worth the cost.Recommend!!"

Long play time. I played movies on this all day and the battery lasted for 11 plus hours. Plus it’s Sooooo lightweight, I didn’t realize how heavy my headset was until I wore this one and saw how light these are. I also never realized My old one pulled on my ears which could possibly be the reason I’ve been getting headaches.

This headset has a Handsfree calling feature and noise canceling is wonderful. Has a remote right on the side that turns up, down, on, off, answer, hang up and lots of other stuff.

Water resistant but I’m not going to try that but if I accidentally do I’ll let you know.

It’s really cool that the earbuds have magnets on the ends so when you want to have the headset just hang around your Neck you won’t loose it. It’s really nice so you also don’t accidentally bend over and get your headset in your food and stuff.

They also say it’s resist to water, but do not put it in water on purpose to test. However if by chance I accidentally do I will let you know.

10,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband love listen to music when doing experiment.This wireless headphones is easy to connect and very comfortable!
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Otium X6 was reduced a bit during the Prime Day sale, but it listed all of the qualities of comparible higher-priced bluetooth units, without any unbelievabe claims attached, so I felt it was worth the risk to order a brand I'd never heard of. I am very pleased with the materials and solid construction of this headset. The first unit sent proved to have a glitch in the control button response/funtionality, which unfortunately didn't resolve with extended use. Disclaimer; I haven't used the X6 for taking/making phones calls, since all phone calls do is interupt ones enjoyment of listening to music, sorry). After contacing OtiumDirect, they kindly and promptly provided a replacement X6 headset, which exhibited none of the symptoms of the first unit. The replacement was completely free from glitches and has operatedly flawlessly, so it gets the review. Since other reviewers have added good photos of this unit in their reviews, nothing could be added by duplicating their photography.

The X6 was packed well, in a form fitted plastic insert placed in the outer box, with 3 pair of various sized extra inner ear-tips below the insert, with a USB charging cord, warranty card and tiny manual (too small for me to read). The 'Airwings' hold the earphones in my ear and keep the headphones in the proper direction Although I don't jog or exercise with them, I suspect the 'Airwings' will be useful to those that do. The extra eartips will allow you to have a custom and comfortable fit. After an intial charge, the X6 paired effortlessly with the assistance ofvocal prompts. The magnetic attraction of the earphones keeps them from becoming unduly tangled when you set them aside. In practice, Bluetooth 4.2 definitely seems to have much-improved tonal qualities regardless of volume. The X6 battery life offers around a relistic 4-6 hour playback time, depending on volume used and program/music material. I'm unsure how many button presses for volume and track-changes affects battery life. The audio response of the X6 is amazing, considering it's price, It takes 40-80 hours to break-in a headset, but from the first time they were powered on, I've loved the sound of the X6. I never expected to hear such deep clear bass or crips mid and high range at any volume from a bluetooth set, much less at this price. The reception distance of the X6 is better than other Bluetooth sets I've owned, without any discernable dropout or lag when going from one room to the next. Even with a thin paneled wall between the source and X6, I found no sonic diffence. I've reached listening distances of approximately 35-45 feet from the tablet which should be plenty of range for most users. It doesn't matter which transmission source I use, the X6 receives easily, the exception was an ancient anidroid mini-tablet that kept dropping the signal. I love my closed AKG's for studio use, and my wired SkullCandy takes a close 2nd, but the Otium X6 is now my favorite wireless headset, hands-down. I can't think of a reason to pay more for any similar type of semi-wired/wireless design. Otium also offers completely wireless earpiece models which I'm interested in trying at a future date. Otiumobile.com's website was offline and difficult to reach, but when it was sorted out I was able to properly register the X6 for a longer warranty. The only gripe, was the extremely small lettering in the tiny manual; keep your magnifying glass handy, but at least it was included!

I'm happy to give both the X6 headphones and the distributer, OtiumDirect, an unrestrained 5-Star rating for a great product and for the courteous, prompt customer service thy've provided. I'm not a paid product endorser/reviewer; I always offer my honest opinion. Anyone who enjoys listening to music will enjoy having a set of these headphones, at such a great low price. I hope this review helps fellow Amazonians make good purchasing decisions."
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: I still really like this headset, but after a couple weeks of use the recharge frequency has gone up. I only get about 1:30 to 2 hours of use between charges.

The headset includes 3 different size adapters to allow them fit comfortably in your ears. The headset is very light weight and I hardly noticed I was wearing them after a few minutes. The sound quality is excellent playing back clear high frequency and speech as well as great quality low frequency at low and high volumes. Unlike the ""Otium Best Wireless Sports Earphones"" that I also tested, these do not distort at high volume and delivers a clean crisp sound.

Although the booklet does not state this, the headset can pair to 2 devices at a time and it easily paired to my Pixel XL & Samsung S7 at the same time. If you receive an incoming while listening to music on your phone the music is paused and you get a notification played back for the incoming call as well as the calling number being read back to you. With the headset connected to my laptop and was able to use it for music as well as the audio device and microphone when making calls from the Skype for Business client.

The Bluetooth range on these are slightly better than the other model I tested, the booklet says 10 meters, but I was able to get about 20 meters away before losing audio. The box says sweat proof, but unlike the other model it does not state that it is waterproof in the booklet.

I am extremely impressed with this headset, very comfortable, easy to use excellent sound quality."
13,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are extremely comfortable right out of the box. I use these almost exclusively for the gym, and they're perfect for that. The headset itself is light in weight . The magnets built into the earbuds are pretty strong and have no problem staying together and keeping them around your neck when not in use. Please note, that the instructions say to hold the button for 1 second to turn them on, but for me, it was closer to 5 seconds. Calls are clear and people have no problems hearing me. So far battery life is excellent but this will totally vary on how you use these. I use for music maybe 2 hours a day and hours of phone calls. Right now i charge every other night regardless. These are really great for the price range and extremely easy to use and sync. I'm sure the sound isn't as great as more expensive ones, but for walking, jogging and working out, they get the job done, don't look bad, and fit well.
Above all, these are really good for the money, and I'd rebuy if they broke."
14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: sadly after about a the audio out of the right earbud stopped working after about 2 months. Should've gone with the BeatsX I guess 🙁

Just got these last week but I think I FINALLY found the perfect balance of quality Bluetooth headphones with a slim neckband and magnetic earbuds. After literally about 8 to 10 cheapish headphones I was really considering coughing up the $100 - $150 for some BeatsX (Depending on if I could catch them on sale). Just happened to come across these - which have a very BeatsX ""inspired"" design at a much more reasonable price. The main difference I can see us if course these don't have Apple's fancy new chip (w2 I think they call it) that connects to icloud and pair instantly with iOS devices. Oh yeah and these don't charge with a lightning cable. I'm willing to forego those couple of things to save about $125!!! SO glad I came across these. Battery life so far is great. Stylish design. I'm not a crazy audiophile but I'm happy with the sound and they are much better than other similarly priced headphones I've gone through."
15,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Showed up to my door within 1 day of order. I followed the instructions in the box, but Bluetooth did not connect to any device I tried pairing with. I tried an iPhone, ipad, Microsoft surface book, and a galaxy."
16,4.0 out of 5 stars,This wireless headset from Otium the X6 gave me the freedom to move and it sounds fantastic. I have been looking for a pair of Bluetooth earbuds that's light weight and low profile and most importantly long battery-life. Phone calls are crisp and clear. The mic also works great for me. They also sound great. They will turn off if not used after awhile if not connecting to Bluetooth to save the battery. The ear buds are very countable. They fit my ears perfectly. The magnet is super strong to keep the ear pieces rogether.
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were easy to connect and worked good in a noisy environment.

Turning them way up does seem to not work great for these but even that level was way too loud to be good for you.

Using them as a normal person would =) they worked great.

If you like this design I would suggest trying these."
18,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't had these headphones for more than I week and will update my review if my opinion about them changes, or once I test battery life, but for now I can say that these are my favorite pair of headphones! I love headphones and have had several pairs of all kinds, shapes and technologies. The sound quality of these Otium headphones is great for the price and they are very comfortable. I like that the earbuds design keep them from falling off my ears and the location of the microphone allows people to hear me clearly. The controls are very easy to reach and not on the same side as the battery, which keeps the weight balanced. The magnets do a good job at keeping the earbuds together when not in use. At first I thought I would hate these because I don't like things around my neck, but they are so comfortable that I can't even feel that I'm wearing them. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the description is inaccurate. The manual says battery talk/play time around 8 hrs, while description says 10 hrs. Also, nowhere in the manual says that they are sweat proof. It actually tells you to avoid them from getting wet. I'm not sure exactly how long the battery lasts yet, because I haven't used them for many hours straight, but it does last a lot longer than my previous ones. Overall, these are great headphones and very affordable! I will most likely buy more if I don't encounter problems after having using them for some time."
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds good, on par with Samsung Level U Pro. Very lightweight. I wanted this one because the wires do not tug on my collared shirts like the Level U does because they have the wires reaching all the way to the back of the neckband. Also the Level U Pro gets my neck warm and sweaty because the battery right there at the back of the neck.

Range is not as good as the Level U Pro, but it's fine with me.
The magnet is very strong, unlike the Level U Pro which the buds keep coming apart.

Highly recommended over anything else."
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price and sound is great. Work just as well as my wired headphones. Battery life is really good; charged once and still playing after 4-1hr workouts.
21,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super comfy, even the wings, which I wasn't planning on using, but you can't feel them! Sound good, good range, and more convenient than the retractable ones with a band. And they work while in my pocket (unlike Soundpeats). Love them and the style. Controls are easy to use. Highly recommend."
22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are pretty good
.They don't slide aroud or feel like they will fall off during my runs.The sound quality is good .
The neckband is convenient too"
23,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this headphones for my son. He inmediatly connected to his phone with no problem. Excellent sound easy to connect and carry it around the neck. Unfortunately he lost it a week later so I can't say much.
24,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This wireless neckband-style headphones is extremely light to wear but don’t lose any of its durability. It comes with soft cushioning ear buds, it is manage to sit comfortably in the ear. When I wear it to run, I barely noticeable and stay secure. Thanks to the well-designed flexible neckband, I love it so much."
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it for my friend who loves running on the street. It is stable when running and the sound is quite good as well. With this kind of price, this is the best you can get."
26,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I love them as long as they worked.. 2 months of usage and they stoped working, I think they are not sweat proof, because when I used them it starts beeping like if I was pressing a bottom and music starts changing song from song.."
27,2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones worked great for about a month. Now they drop the Bluetooth connection after about 15 minutes every time I'm working out. The sound also gets scratchy. This happens despite being fully charged and having my streaming device less than 1 foot away. Very frustrating. I'm going to have to buy a different pair or go back to using my wired earbuds. Save your money and buy a better quality set of Bluetooth headphones.
28,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is great, they last for all day - no problems. The mic is pretty good during phone calls and they look great! I like that they stay in place around my neck and that they have the magnet so they don't get tangled around other stuff as I'm I'm moving. This is the second pair we bought, my girlfriend liked mine so much I bought her a pair as well. 6 months and going strong!"
29,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are great. They are very comfortable, easy to pair with my phone, easy on and off, and they work well as a phone headset for phone calls also. My main use is listening to music at work. The battery life has adequate for an 8 hour shift. The earbuds have a magnet on each one which holds them together on your chest when you take them out of your ear to keep fthem from getting tangled. These are great."
30,2.0 out of 5 stars,So I updating my review. They worked great from july to November but as of Nov 18 one ear bud has gone out. Hope they would of lasted me a year at lest. They surely didn't last. 😣😖😞😞😟😟
31,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I especially like the magnets that enable them to stick together. That way when the fall, they'll just stick to each other and not bounce around like regular earphones"
32,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE these headphones! They are awesome. Great battery life, sweat and water resistant, and very sturdy. I wear them at work everyday. So far I'm very happy with my purchase. I'll never go back to wired headphones. They pair with my smart TV too. I'm going to buy another pair to keep at work."
33,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality. I'd buy again. I've been using every day since they came in.
They fit perfectly under collars such as button ups or polos

Short charge time.
Long play and standby time.

Great for sports or active lifestyles

Like riding a motorcycle or skateboarding"
34,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality, comfortable to wear, most importantly when I talk to somebody they can hear me clearly. Very happy with the purchase"
35,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These Bluetooth headphones look good,are easy to wear.They are easy to connect to my cell phone.Sound quality is wonderful and has a comfortable fit in the ears.I love them."
36,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best I used the Bluetooth headset, sound quality is very good and charge can be used for a long time. I like the magnet on both sides, you can put the headphones hanging in the neck will not be lost."
37,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the sound and the fact that these a very light weight. I do have a issue though, when the left ear piece is moved, the sound goes away for a few seconds then returns. I emailed customer service THREE TIMES and no response yet. Three days is plenty of time to respond to my question. I'm not sure if this is normal or defect."
38,5.0 out of 5 stars,I enjoy listening to music at the gym but my headphones always find themselves falling off or hooking a machine. The neck stiffness is great so that there isn't a huge mess of wires around your neck and the magnets easily wrap around the front of your neck.
39,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first bluetooth earphone purchase and I'm very satisified. It has excellent sound quality for music and calls. The setup was very easy and they sit comfortably in my ears. Overall, these earphones are a quality product and I recommend them!"
40,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are great, I bought it for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves them. The customer service with this company is top notch!"
41,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphone is awesome! I got this for exercising. It fits great with my ear. Some of the other headphones I got, they got off easily. But this one, I don’t have to worry about it anymore. Love it!"
42,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good design to use when I sit in the train. Wireless headphone is safer. Easy to carry on, just put it in my pocket. Good listening enjoy."
43,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought 2 of these.. first pair wouldn't charge.. sent back.. 2nd and 3rd (replacement for 1) work awesome! Clear crisp and not $100.. great product!
44,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great! The instructions are wrong though. It says to continuously press the MF button to pair the headphones with your phone. Hold the MF button down to get the light to blink. Good sound quality and sound blocking!
45,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these earphones. The sound quality is very good. I had no problems getting them to stay in my ears, once I changed the ear pieces. it is very good to run. It is easy to connect to my phone. I really love it."
46,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought a few months back and satisfied the fit, sound quality and sturdy construction. For some reason the sound 'clips' (harsh on-off clipping) and also looses the Bluetooth link (""Lost (?) Link"") at times when connected to my iPhone 6 (only feet away). If I could find a solution, I would give it a higher rating."
47,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great even after 6 months. I bought other kinds before and they break after 3 months. The sound is awesome. The function and syncing is great and stay connected at a distance, about 20-30 ft. The battery lasts a long time.. I've never ran out of battery, at least 5-6hrs at a time. I take extra care to hang them when i'm not using so they don't get damaged. I'm here buying 2 more so i don't have to worry about finding another kind for a while if something does happen to these."
48,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are excellent. I've had them since November 2017 and they held up great until I dropped something heavy on them and broke one of the ear buds.
Pros:
- Bluetooth 4.1 - The battery life is excellent
- Super fast connection - As soon as they turn on, they are connected.
- Long cables and great sound quality

Cons:
- Using them for phone calls is not good. The microphone doesn't seem to be sensitive enough"
49,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this set for my wife to use when out and about. Very light weight and had issues connecting with her iPhone. Sound quality is solid especially at this price point and Bluetooth connection has had no issues when used with phone nearby. Happy wife happy life.
50,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable, great battery life, zero issue with them popping out, and no complaints about the sound. Definitely not for running though. The part that rests on your neck will bounce and will create a loud THUD in your ear every time you land."
51,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality product for the price! Bought my girl the Beats X, borrowed them and did not like the bass quality. I like to hear all dynamics of the beat! Then I bought the Jaybird Freedom, and those did not stay in my ear. I seen the Best Selling Otium X6 so I decided to give these a shot, and I am extremely happy at this point! I haven't had them long enough to determine the quality of life of the battery but I also know as long as you don't leave the device plugged into the charger after it has reached it's full charge your battery will last longer."
52,5.0 out of 5 stars,None of the ear tips that came with didn't fit right. Put some foam tips on and they sounded great for a 23 dollar set of Bluetooth earbuds.
53,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The earbuds performed as advertised. Pairing to a smartphone was easy and reconnect feature works extremely well. Sound is better than expected for the price point. Only drawback, more of a personal preference, the collar type feature which causes the earbud cord to loop. They seat in the ear well and come with multiple sizes of buds for different size eats. The ear hook is removable."
54,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones I had black ones and they work perfectly they are quite fragile but other than that the headphones are great they have an excellent battery life and the sound quality is amazing they are worth the money! They are quite simple to use and comparatively the pairing process is quite simple.
55,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones is very good. Easy connected and voice is wonderful. The Battery can use two or three days. I like it very much.
56,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought some headphones for my family, They are comfortable. I couldn't be more pleased with the product and the price."
57,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for the price!! Battery lasts about 5 hours, easy to connect to bluethooth and not wobbly on ears when i run! Really like them"
58,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the wireless headphones which have good quality.The sound is very beautiful when I use them to listen musics.
59,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had them for a solid 36 hours until my young puppy decided it was a wonderful idea to use the earbuds as a chew toy. For the short time that I had them, they worked very well. Very solid product."
60,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing headphones. Have had them for a few months now and love them. I really wanted to get the BeatsX but I found this in the process and decided to give them a try. These are a fraction of the price and I have been extremely happy with them so far. They charge up very fast and the battery lasts for what seems like 20 hours as long as I don’t have the volume very high. Really good headphones. I recommend to anyone wanting good fitting headphones that are tough and won’t break your budget
61,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality for low price. I use them when I ride my motorcycle and it fits perfectly in the helmet. I also use them at the gym and have no problem with them falling out. I had to read the comments to figure out how to change a song though. Hold down the + or - to skip or go back. Would definitely recommend
62,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable and stay in your ears - perfect for the gym. Bluetooth connectivity was simple and range is decent. Sound quality good, not great, but these are not $300 headphones. If you are looking for a budget pair of bluetooth earbuds for working out, etc. I recommend these highly."
63,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very upset I wish I could get ahold of the company. Bought 2 sets of headphones. Like them a lot! But today
One pair will not power up and sync up with my iPhone.
And yes it has been on the charger all day. I would like a replacement. I’ve only had it for two months. I thought it was better quality than this. I hope the company I bought it from will get ahold of me thanks"
64,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are really great earbuds. Sound quality is great and it doesn't feel cheap. Only problem so far is that they don't always stay in my ear. Charging and syncing is very easy. Really great overall. Definitely recommend!
65,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than I ever expected. The battery last forever. It can withstand all my activities. Workouts, hikes, mild sweats & my everyday use. Buy it while you can. It's 10 times as good if not better than those over priced name brands earbuds."
66,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this for my husband. After used for 3days, he said it's not bad. Easy to connect. Long lasting power . High voice quality."
67,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP. I am so disappointed I can't give a negative star rating on these. They lasted a little over 1 month. Absolute garbage.
68,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The good: It's cheap, it's comfortable, and it works... for a while.

The bad: Microphone sound quality is crap, and one of the earbuds died (loose wire) within 2 months.

If you think of them as semi-disposable then they're fine."
69,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very convenient headphone, I'm using it for running. So far everything works great. I'll update if i have more to say."
70,1.0 out of 5 stars,I just bought these on Saturday hopeing for them to be pretty good earphones I received the package rather fast in two days and as soon as I opened them up and connected them they started having issues right side ear bud would come in and out and within minutes stopped working left side ear bud would get loud and then come in and out as well 10 minutes in they Bluetooth disconnected and it happend one more time contacted amazon for a refund and a send back label I do not recommended these headphones to anyone ...
71,3.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable headphones for a short time. It’s nice that they have magnets at the end by the ear piece. I found this convenient when I was in a rush to put them away. The marterial isn't the best quality. So if you don’t want to spend a lot and will use them for a short time...these will work. I later invested in other headphones.
72,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered them for a friend. He used them lightly, mainly for homework, yet the piece that actually bonds with the ear bud started cracking. Sounds okay, and pairs easily enough, but the quality apparently isn't the greatest. Was hoping for better, and now I'm 1 month out of the return period."
73,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid construction and great sound for what you pay. They connect via Bluetooth no problem relatively quick and without hassle. Charge time is quick as advertised. My only gripe, and this could just be an issue with the set I received, battery life is horrid. I would say that they only last 2-3 hours of continuous music playback. Not sure if others are having this issue. I may send them pack and grab another pair."
74,1.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I accidentally purchased this product by pressing the ""buy with one click"" button, but bc I needed a pair, I let fate handle it.
Well, fate said this pair of ear buds suck.
It won't connect to bluetooth. The bluetooth won't even turn on. The magnets are annoying, as well, and I never even got to use these earbuds. Just slipped them on my head for 30 seconds and they wouldn't stay in my ears."
75,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Works ok, sound quality is clearly low but I use them for audiobooks which is harder to tell the difference. The convenience of a wireless headset with microphone and audio controls is nice at this price"
76,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this headphone because it's quite light and very comfortable to wear. The sound quality is definitely better than many headphone I used at this price level. Connecting to phone and PC both work smoothly and it has the convenient alert after connected or disconnected when I control it.

The package includes extra earplugs and it's very thoughtful."
77,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably the best set of earbuds I've ever owned. Sound quality is great for the price. But the REAL thing I love about 'em is the shape and texture of the cord behind my neck.Before I got it, I am worried about if it can stay in my ears. It keeps the buds in place, but loose enough to where they don't rip the earbuds outta my dang ears if I turn my head or move my neck. So I use it everyday now. Want to bought two extra pairs for my wife and brother."
78,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Doesn't connect to my iPhone 7.
Doesn't even show as a device in the Bluetooth options! Crappy!!"
79,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this wireless headset for seven days. I paired it to both my iPhone and iMac pro. It’s sound quality is superior, crispy and balanced. The earbuds are conmfortable to wear. Noise canceling works well too , I sometimes wear it in work place when I need to be very focused on doing something but surrounding is kind noisy."
80,5.0 out of 5 stars,Slim and comfortable headphones. Easy to pair with my iPhone 7 Plus. Offered good sound quality and easy to adjust volume. It always connect to my phone. Quite Good battery life too. Overall I am happy about the purchase and will buy it again
81,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very surprised by how amazing these are! They fit comfortably, sound is amazing, and they even work with Siri! I also like that the buds are magnetized so they’re not flying everywhere if you have to take them out for a bit. This is ded a must by. Well worth the 20$."
82,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am very pleased with these headphones. I received my delivery promptly. It was easy to set up. The quality seems good so far and the wireless set up is great during workouts and multi-tasking. I would purchase the product again and from the same seller.
83,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These buds sound,fit nicely. They are nice and long and have a flat cable instead of the round wire. The cons in my case is that they don’t vibrate,skip or go back on tracks,the pause button doesn’t work on all apps. Other than that they are good bit don’t work for me."
84,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve own about 10 different lg Bluetooths over the years. Lately they haven’t been holding up too long. I read the reviews on this cheapo... oh well for $19 bucks I’ll try it. It is absolutely unbelievablely good. People say they’re not hearing my background noise as much. I hear them so well I have to turn it down. Not as bulky around the neck. I just got a 2nd pair for someone else after only having mine for 2 weeks.
85,1.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones looks like Beats but the quality is nothing like it. Music listening is ok but call quality is really really bad. Person on other line can’t hear you at all. Returning!!!
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For $20 I think they are pretty high quality.
Very easily to connects with bluetooth and gets caught at great distance。I have small ears so it was a concern for me that they would fall off. I went to the gym and tested them out and they worked out great."
87,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With convenience, the quality is good, and the ears will not feel uncomfortable."
88,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The earbuds are easy to pair, they are crystal clear and comfortable, great sound and volume, convenient and blocks external noise well. So far they work well and I'm happy to have them."
89,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved these headphones when I got them- they stayed in place when I went running and and lasted ~8 hours per charge. However, they stopped working for me suddenly less than one month later. At first I thought they just needed to be charged, but they still do not work. I will be buying a new pair of headphones that is a different brand."
90,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a $270 pair of wireless head phones that wore out over a year and a half of normal use.
These Otiums are great because the investment is low. They are definitely worth the money you will spend for them. Solid quality."
91,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to use, great connection. It doesn’t have unstable connection like some other wireless earphones that will be disconnected while I’m running or exercising."
92,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones worked well for about 3 weeks. I don't use them every day as I have several different types of headphones. When removing them from my ear one of the buds came apart in my hand. I don't know if it is a product flaw or if I received a dud. I have contacted the seller and am awaiting a response.
93,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, decent sound and pairs nicely with my phone for music and calls. The neck portion is flexible and very comfortable even with my neck issues"
94,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have bought as a gift for my brother. The heasdset comes well packaged and gift ready set. The quality looks very good. My brother said it works very well and he really likes it.
95,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After using the headphones for about a month, they started cutting out the sound. Now, they don't even produce a sound. I don't even know if it is on or not."
96,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these attractive and light bluetooth headphones. Using it during workout and listening to audible books . It comes with magnet behind earbuds which help in keeping headphone safe when not using.
97,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality. Nice not to have to worrying about snagging wires.
Very comfortable, it is suited for anyone to move around a lot when listening to music. Wonderful Bluetooth headphones."
98,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very satisfied with this purchase! These earphones are great for running and just much more convenient than my old plugin ones. Super comfortable and great sound quality. Totally worth the price!
99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased. Excellent sound quality. Syncs with my Android phone and tablet perfectly. Battery life is good as well - lasts me through the day. More than worth the price tag of less than $25!
100,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these headphones for when I got to the gym, other wireless headphones I bought died on me. These work great so far, the connection is good, they are comfortable and have good sound quality. Only downside is that they don't stay in great when doing cardio, but that was expected. I didn't like the feel of the ones made for jogging so figured I'd roll the dice on these."
101,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've tried some other headphone but they weren't long enough and would bounce when I ran. These are the perfect length and the controls are easy to reach. I think they are as good as my friends much more expensive ones.
102,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a very high quality. I am extremely happy with this purchase.
103,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these in high hopes of be able to workout with them but when I went to connect them with my phone they don’t work and they don’t work on my laptop either. I fully charged them and they still don’t work. You’re probaly better off getting ones at your local dollar store that work better than these save you $10.
104,4.0 out of 5 stars,Was looking for an inexpensive wireless headset for around the house and this fit the bill. I had a little bit of difficulty synching but managed to figure it out.
105,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones almost melted while I was charging them! They are slightly bent and the charginv port will no longer close. If I hadnt had been there they could have easily cause a fire bc the was so hot I couldnt touch them .
Plus within 2 days the right side started shorting out."
106,5.0 out of 5 stars,this wireless headphone is really useful and look fancy ， totally worth dat price！
107,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm pretty sure they're defective, they're always cutting out and it's a shame, they're really comfortable physically, but electronically they suck :("
108,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's okay, doesn't go as loud as I would want but still okay for the price, the neck band is too flimsy, and not long enough to go around my neck."
109,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It sounds great, fits in my ear great, connecting it to my phone was super easy, but the controls can be a bit confusing, and there is a delay when you push pause and when the music actually pauses, it is about a 1 second delay. It also has great noise cancellation, but took a week and a half to ship from a neighboring state."
110,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones fit my ears firmly and comfortably. The sound quality is better than my expectations. It’s very comparable to those expensive headphones my husband bought.
111,1.0 out of 5 stars,No stars. These things are amazing for 1 month... then utter failure
112,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Poorly made. The left ear bud is dead. There is no visible sign of a problem. Just no sound. They lasted about a month with minimal usage, on average twice a week for about 45 minutes to an hour at the gym,"
113,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought a pair to try; liked them so bought a pair as a gift. The sound quality is good, for the price and the Bluetooth in the area works well, so it's a great set up. The headphones fit nicely and are comfortable at staying put. Great deal all around."
114,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing! So I purchased theses headphones for when I train , let me tell you they are awesome! I tried the Jaybird Wireless headphones, Bose , Skull Candy and a few others, The Orion X6 blow them out of the water. The price is untouchable compared to any higher end headphones the preform and stay in your ears better then any, The sound quality is just as good or better then the Jaybirds. I hope this review helps. I'm super happy with my purchase!"
115,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought two pair. Both work great. I get 50-60ft line of sight range and 15-20 through walls. 9 hours of play time fully charged. Mic can be a little weak if the ambient noise is up. Works great though.
116,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful and practical, sound quality is also very good, the battery is also durable. like very much"
117,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable , good sound quality. Good noise blocking quality. I use these primarily at work but they work well at the gym as well."
118,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the headphones so that I could charge my iPhone 7 and listen to music at the same time. They seem to get the job done - sound quality isn't great, but holds a charge for most of the day. Charging cord is SHORT - maybe 3 inches? Tough to trade in and out of USB ports. But decent for the price."
119,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The speakers just don't sound pleasant. Very little low-end and just flat. Stock IPhone headphones sound way better, and they're not that great...

They do have a pretty decent range and the unit itself is reasonably light. The earbud fitment can be finicky, however. Not sure I'd recommend these to anyone other than to those who want something really cheap to use as a handsfree device."
120,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It was easy to pair the headphones with my phone and the magnetic ends of each ear bud will definitely keep these from falling off my neck or at the very lease keep me from being aware that they did fall off. My only complaint is that the volume up, down and the power/pairing mode buttons are all the same size and I'd totally prefer a track to roll to change the volume instead.

These headphones will be used at work and should there be any issue with the item I will update my review."
121,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The main reason I bought these is because they said it would work 9 hours without recharging. The next best I could find was 6 hours.

The first 5 months of use they worked great and I always had at at least 9 hours of listening without having to recharge. Then suddenly the ear bud on the side without controls started go in in and out. I found a way to get it to stay on, but if I moved it would go out again. A couple of weeks after that the other side started going out too. It's short was were the wire went into the hard part around the neck. The other side's short was were the cable entered the ear bud.

Considering the reviews of similar items I guess I'm lucky to have gotten 5 months of quality use out of this pair. I did use them several days a week during that time. But I expect more quality than that."
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first thing I noticed on this bluetooth headphone is that the headphone is very light. I feel like I don't have it in my neck when I'm using it. I have my old LG bluetooth headphone and that is heavy compared to this one. The magnetic earbud is a plus feature, it secures the headphone by connecting together when not in use and just hanging in my neck. The ear wings helps secure the headphone when I'm using it to prevent it from falling off when I'm in my threadmill. Another plus is the sound quality, I didn't have to crank the volume all the way up to get to my desired listening level. For the price and the good quality of this bluetooth headphone, I definitely will recommend it to my friends."
123,5.0 out of 5 stars,This wireless sports earphones are very nice... I bought this for my friends birthday and she really like this... it works perfectly.. the sound is very clear... included charger... higgly recomended...
124,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really happy with these so far. I've had them around a month or so and I've been impressed. As a woman with a narrow neck I was concerned that the fit would be really bad but they stay in place pretty well and really stay out of the way especially compared to other around the neck bands. I swapped out the earbuds for memory foam for preference but the original tips din't seem bad.

The ear fins move around quite a bit and I've actually had them fall off once. Not a deal breaker but sometimes causes problems if you take your headphones in and out a lot.

Battery is definitely not as advertised. I would say I get closer to 5 or 6 hours without turning them off but for price and fit, thats really not too bad.

I'll see how these hold up as time goes but so far I'm really happy with these and I'm ridiculously picky when it comes to my headphones."
125,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my earbuds for phone calls, during long distance running, and while lifting weights and training. After testing many BlueTooth styles and brands I found the Otium ""neckband"" earphone design stays in my ears the most securely; isn't easily dislodged or lost; they don't interfere with most exercise body movements; and the batterylife is longer than any other BlueTooth earbuds I've seen. The Otium X6 was excellent for me and suited my needs perfectly!

The first set of Otium X6 earphones I purchased were excellent, but only worked for a few weeks. They stopped transmitting sound and would not hold a charge.
The second set of Otium X6 earphones I bought arrived with an unstable right ear connection, resulting in muffled sounds or none at all.

I am extremely disappointed by the poor quality and weak durability of the Otium X6. While I'm hopeful for a pair that will work, I'm hesitant to repurchase another set of X6 earphones.
I will be much more wary of any Otium products in the future."
126,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are pretty good! Not excellent, not great, but pretty good. For the price, they're a great value. The audio quality isn't very high, but if you're just using them for phone calls, podcasts, audiobooks, etc. -- they're fantastic. Music? For exercise they're fine, since quality isn't super important when you're jogging or riding your bike with all that road noise, etc., but otherwise -- these are comparable to $10 Skull Candy earbuds, as far as audio quality. Great for spoken word, not so great for music.

Battery life seems good -- 6-8 hours, depending on usage, but fine for me.

I do really like how they work with Siri on my iPhone, though -- just a double-tap of the center button and she's ready for me to ask her add something to my calendar or reminders list. The fit and finish is really nice on these as well. No weird, cheap, plastic whose finish kinda rubs off on your fingers after a while. Very solidly built and great for wearing around the house, the office, while exercising -- basically wherever, which is the point of these, right?!

Overall -- these are an excellent purchase and I've been using them for about a week now around the house, listening to podcasts. Really, really great for that!"
127,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I really like these. My old bulky set died and I was looking for a set that was lighter and smaller. I ordered 2 different brands and originally these were not my first choice because the ear bud wires come out the bottom of the necklace and there is no magnetic storage for the ear buds on the necklace. However, after using and listening to them I consider these the best set I have ever owned. The design is well thought out and they have a look and feel of quality. The 3 buttons are well separated, and easy to find with your fingers. I am no audiophile but I am very happy with the sound quality. The other brand that I bought sound a little bit ""tinny"" and are a little short on bass, but this set seems to have hit it just about right. The ear buds do hang down when not in use but they have strong magnets and lock together tightly. Supposedly these are designed to be sweat and water resistant as well. I really don't think you can go wrong with these, especially for the price. I am going to use these for a couple of weeks and if all goes well I will buy another set as a spare."
128,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve bought a fair share of Bluetooth headsets, I would lose them or the battery would last only for a few hours. Most of the time they are used when I run and it gets frustrating when these headsets don’t work. This one just died and stopped working after a couple of weeks using.

Though there are some positives for this headset. I do like how the neck band isn’t a huge piece of plastic and fits nicely around the neck. The ear buds fit comfortably in the ear and doesn’t fall of when running. The magnets with the neckband will guarantee I won’t lose these headsets.

Now the negatives. My first time using them was amazing, actually it did stop playing for a few seconds, but that’s common with all Bluetooth headsets. After that these headsets brought the following problems: just stops playing, refuses to power on, volume suddenly turns down to 25%, and refuses to pair with device. Sometimes I’ll be running and no audio is coming out. I tried resetting, disconnecting the Bluetooth and pairing again, resetting my phone and none of these solutions work. It would suddenly works the next day to only cause one of the problems listed above.

Then it finally died, won’t power on or charge. Amazon was awesome and gave me a refund. I love how it fitted nicely and was secure just wished it work."
129,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ever since purchasing my first iPhone, I hav been super annoyed about not having a headphone jack. This is my third pair of wireless headphones now. My first set was a pair of cheapies that had a ringing sound the entire time they were on. So, my husband bought me an expensive set that is nice but bulky and pulls strands of my hair out when sitting on my neck. I decided to try these and am so pleasantly surprised! They are so lightweight that I barely realize they are there yet stay in place perfectly so are great for even gym use. They came with 3 size ear cushions which is important for me because I have tiny ears. The biggest surprise was that the sound quality far surpassed my expectations for the price, and there is no hissing or ringing sound from the Bluetooth connection. I’m so glad I bought these!"
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is great bluetooth ear phone. I have been using it everyday while I am working out. The quality of sound is nice which covers most of noise and isolates you from yelling of others. The design is also creative. You can wear it on the neck and also hang it on your ears.
131,5.0 out of 5 stars,The earphones are very light in weight. The sound quality is decent. I like it can rest on your neck. You barely feel it. It’s great when you work out.
132,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It worked well for 4 months and just stopped working all of a sudden. The little pairing and power light turns on but no sound comes out of the speakers. I recommended it to several people when it worked because I was happy with it, but not anymore. I'll be looking for a replacement now."
133,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing quality and versatility. I use these working out, at work, and just around the house when my nightshift husband is sleeping. Being untethered is such a gift !"
134,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great solund quality and a low price!
we go through a lot of earbuds so I bought these for the low price. That said these have really high sound quality so I'll definitely be buying more of these. At this price they make a great stocking stuffer!"
135,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, he was designed to be light. Good sound quality, this cost gave me a good time. Use comfort and try personal preferences. And my cell phone is easy to match"
136,5.0 out of 5 stars,"for the price great product has long battery life, the only two things I would have against this item is that it barly truns down, however this can be fixed by just agustining the volum on the device that you are watching it on, and the second is there are no smaller buds for smaller ears meaning I can't share my media with my girlfriend, however for the price this thing is amazing"
137,1.0 out of 5 stars,Faulty item. Headset fails to go into Pairing mode! It either turns on or off after about 2 minutes of pressing the MF button. Unhappy with the experience.
138,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work very much like BeatsX wireless earbuds but at a fraction of the cost. Work well and stay in my ears when exercising.
139,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones are good to use, it's easy to take with you when you're in fitness, they've been recommended by friends, and they both like it"
140,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones have great sound quality. They fit comfortably in your ear and there's no long cord to get in your way.

146,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good, battery life is good, microphone is bad! I have to switch to speaker so people can hear me. I end up using it, strictly for listening."
147,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. The $100. pair I had slip off my neck and wound up somewhere I don't know. Ordered 2 for a backup.
148,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With this headphones, I can finally get charge for my cellphone and listen to the music at the same time. This is very convenient during work out. It does not fall off your ears, and the sound is very good. If you do think the over-ear headphones are way too large to carry everywhere, I recommend these.I think it has the same quality as my apple’s earphones( the regular one, not the airphones)."
149,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphone is wonderful,I used it almost every day, it is really convenient to use,and easy to adjust the volume,I like it really much."
150,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a new iPhone X user, I have to find Bluetooth headphones, so I won't worry about buying the special earphone converter. I am glad I choose this wireless headphones. It works!"

152,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones to use while im at work. These headphones are a similar to the beats x but the battery life on theseare terrific. The beats x I would get about 2 and half hours of use but for these i got 7 and half hours of use. The sound quality is also excellent.
153,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and lightweight. Stays put even when I’m running. Music and calls both sound great!

155,5.0 out of 5 stars,"just what i ordered, works great"
156,5.0 out of 5 stars,I just used it for one day. Great product! I just lost my iphone 7’s headphone. All other wired headphone doesn’t work for iPhone 7 cause the plug is different. Wireless headphone is perfect cause I don’t need to worry about the plug and can fit any smart phones！it’s easy to pair with my phone and so convienient to wear! and the price is so good！I love it! Will recommend to my friends!
157,5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing has a great touch. Cool design. Easy connection and good music quality. Earbud fit in really well. And a control station on the side. Difinately worth for this price.
158,5.0 out of 5 stars," I like using it when I am in gym. It's good , this product has a high quality."
159,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the idea of Bluetooth headphones, but these are a little bulkier than I was expecting because of the thick plastic controls and the curved, non wire neck piece. Because the neck piece is a little heavier it bounces up and down when I run and is just sort of annoying. I guess not a bad headset for the price though"
160,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound great and hold a charge considerably longer than other similar ones I've had that are more name brand. Would definitely buy again 👍
161,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my BF, it's good for gym and have great quality sound! Very comfortable for ears. Also, it's charge quickly! Definitely recommend!"

166,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received my otium headphones on December 23rd and was enjoying the quality and the set for about a month and a half, before the right side stopped working and receiving connection, which I ignored as the left one was sufficient for me to enjoy whatever I was listening to, but that did not last long and about two three weeks later the left piece stopped working, as well. Very disappointing..."
167,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Stopped working after about a month of using

*Update on 3/1/18: I received an email today from the company offering a new set or a refund, very impressed that they responded to my review and took action to try and fix the problem."

176,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic headphones! Not just for the price but in general. The build quality is great. The sound is amazing. It has great bass, decent mids, and clear highs.

177,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use it everyday. Perfect design! It’s easy to use and the price is really good!
178,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am pleasantly surprised. I expected a cheaply built product with thin sound. Exactly the opposite. A quality product with great sound. I have been using a Bluetooth product that is four times the cost of the X6 ... and the X6 had better sound and is actually more comfortable to wear. And ... and an 18-month full replacement warranty comes with product registration. Amazing! I am sold on Otium.
179,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really loved these, but as some comments have mentioned, the left speaker just went out right after the period ended where I could return them for another pair. The time I had with them both working was awesome and I was impressed at the price and the good quality it came with! Unfortunately, I can't do much with them anymore because of the left earpiece giving no sound. :("

183,1.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't try these. I didn't like that they have a hard texture on the back neck part so I returned them.
184,1.0 out of 5 stars,i don't know it i had a pair that were defected but they keep connecting and disconnecting.
185,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these to replace a pair I used for hands free driving, for work. My wife says the microphone works good, clear sounding. The speakers have good sound with music and with phone calls. The buttons are easy to use. They are spaced apart and big enough to find each button without looking. The ear buds do have a slight hook to them to lock them in your ear. I would buy these again."
186,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the headphones they sound great and the battery lasts a long time!!

191,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow. Blown away by the sound quality. Just what I wanted with no fancy frills. Best bang for the buck.

203,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Otium X6 Bluetooth Headphones have the best quality construction and longest lasting battery of any Bluetooth headset I’ve ever used. I’ve been using one set approximately 6 months. The battery lasts for a minimum of 9 Hrs. and charges in about 2 Hrs. I will buy these again if this set ever breaks.
204,5.0 out of 5 stars,These really blew my mind! The magnets holding them together is a total game changer no joke! Great quality sound that's bassy. I've spent a lot of money on other pairs and this pair beats them all

Cons: feels like heart beating when running.
Overall good headphone for this price. Nothing really to complain"
227,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They worked for the first day. The next day, after they were completely charged, they wouldn’t connect to my phone and they wouldn’t charge all the way. These are terrible headphones. I would not recommend."
228,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and I can say that I am a satisfied customer.
The sound quality is more or less the same as my iphone earphones. Noise canceling works pretty well. What I like about it the most is the neck band. It stays and it doesn’t bother me at all."
229,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They worked well for aprox 90 hours of use total over the past 6 months. Bought because they were sweatproof, used for gym workout."
230,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great. They last a long time and I have yet to run out of battery. Although I've run very low on battery, they charged fully in less than an hour. The sound quality is good; I love bass and one of factors for me when I buy a pair of headphones is if you can hear or feel bass-most definitely can :-) I am confident that these will last a long time. The wire is stiffer which is awesome as they don't slide or pull to one side. The buds themself are comfortable & come with 3 sizes to fit snug along w/2 loops to hold securely. Pairing with multiple devices was idiot proof. These are definitely a great headphone at a very reasonable price"
231,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were great for a few months, I received then on October 1st, 2017, and at the end of February, the left headphone stopped working. It almost seems like there is a short where the headphone wire goes into the neckband. The cord here is very thin, and should probably be reinforced in some way.
Will not be purchasing these again, but would consider a different model by the same brand, because they were great while they lasted."
232,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been hesitant to spend more than a little cash in a set of in-ear headphones because I seems to have smallish ears. Most in-ear buds or headphones are very uncomfortable (Beats, Apple Earpods, etc.). I took a chance and am very happy I did. These fit very snug, but flexible enough for long-term wear. They have a decent range, feel very light on the ears, have good battery life, and magnets design keeps it safe in a good place. Good bass response without sounding ""woofy"" like Beats. At this price, I highly recommend them."
233,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't realize how much I would love wireless headphone until I actually tried them. I admit that I'm late to the game, but as a runner, I finally became fed up with the cord sometimes pulling lose with a random arm swing or turn. I have found that these stay in place throughout my run and actually feel secure. Once they're in, I don't have to ever readjust them. Although I had to have someone younger than me show me how to pair the headphones to my phone, that's now done and I don't have to mess with it again. I simply turn the headphones on with the on button and I'm ready to go. The microphone works well when making calls and I've never had anyone tell me that they couldn't hear me clearly."
234,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to use iPhone's original wire headphones. It was truly annoying to unwire them before use, and it was also frustrating that you have to use earphone and charge the phone at the same time.

Life has been a breeze since I get this product. No wires any more. Doesn't need to plug in any more and I can charge at the same time. I like the design that it rests around my neck. So the earphones are standing by neatly during intermittent usage. The sound quality is good too. Love it!"
235,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely do not recommend. Ended up returning them.

Pro: soft neckband, pretty okay bass, magnetic

Con: a full one-or-two-second fade in from silence every time there is a bluetooth blip or dropped data. It is infuriating and makes listening to audiobooks, podcasts, or voice chats (like in gaming) almost impossible. This was enough to make me want to return them, but the nail in the coffin was that when you receive a phone call, the headphones read out (slowly) the entire phone number before allowing you to answer.

I'm amazed these ""features"" weren't included in other reviews. They made these headphones almost completely unusable."
236,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Even after buying this product I've been reading the reviews. Ill have to update if I have any issues with them. But so far I absolutely love these headphones. They are lightweight, rain proof, sound quality is amazing and battery life is good. I've had them for a week and I use them often, today was the first time I needed to charge them. These are comparable to the $120 BeatsX. $100 cheaper and the sound quality is just as good. I also purchased the 3 year Asurion warranty through Amazon, just in case anything does happen. Overall I would highly recommend, especially for the price."
237,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's a great sport wireless headphones I bought. It's easy to connected my iPhone and so strong to stay inside my ears. And it's also has good tone quality.The most important is cheap!! I bought monster and base, even though the tone quality is perfect. But it is easy to out of my ears when I was running. And it's definitely expensive.
This wireless headphones is good for sports and I will recommend my friends when someone need."
238,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ive had these a few weeks. This is the 5th pair of Bluetooth earbuds I've tried, and my favorite so far. Very secure for jogging, comfortable, good sound, block outside wind/noise. Battery life seems good, but I don't push it past 4 hours before recharging because I hate batteries dying mid-jog. Also, the connection to my device is strong. Other headphones I've owned cut in and out when you're moving too much, or if your device is on the side of your body furthest from controls on headphones. These do not. And the neckband/weighted sides keep them secure so the cord isn't pulling toward the one side, as others have done. They're designed very smart. Solved all my other earbud issues. I recommend these!"
239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast shipping. Charged upon arrival. Charged fast. I don’t like the wings so I removed them. I absolutely ❤️ the sound and the feel around my neck. I’ll be purchasing another pair for my daughter. These headphones paired perfectly with my iPhone 8 Plus.

Update:
Still the best wireless headphones! My brother brought me a pair of BeatsX and I HATE them ok!!!!"
240,4.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight and the part that goes around your neck keeps the ear buds from falling out. It also allows for less of a pulling feel in the ear buds. Like they aren't being yanked out of your ears from gravity.

260,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Could not pair with anything. Instruction manual said to ""Keep pressing the MF button until blue and red lights blink alternatively"". This is extremely vague and yielded no results."

263,1.0 out of 5 stars,Really disappointing they paired easy enough but audio in right ear piece was in and out or scratchy I would not recommend these and the other review are very deceiving the quality is very cheap and buttons are chunky and charging took a long time just for them not to work as claimed
264,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones/ear buds! It tends to block outside noise as you are listening to your favorite music or show. Stays put while you move around. I haven't used them yet to exercise, but sure they would be good at staying in place."
265,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bluetooth headsets are great, and now it's convenient to go to the gym every time you go to the gym. The packing is very good. We'll come back next time"
266,5.0 out of 5 stars,great to have while working out needless to say.
267,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The music quality is lacking. The piece that is supposed to stay around your neck stands up off your chest, so it’s pointed strait in front of you. Very disappointed in this purchase."
268,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Fall out of your ear super easily, and when I talk on the phone people can hear everything going on around me crystal clear, making it difficult to hear me. kind of deafeats the purpose of the hadphones for me with both of those issues."

272,1.0 out of 5 stars,Did not last 2 months! The left earpiece no longer works.
273,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphone . Not the greatest sound sound quality but it have long hours to play music and very strong . Only bad thing is the microphone can be bad sometimes due to the fact it's under your neck sometimes when having phone calls
274,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my hubby, who complains about in the ear headphones. Not these! He says they are comfy and loud. They are LOUD. I even find them comfortable as I tried them with the smaller size ear pieces. Love being hands and wore free!"

276,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's very easy to use. Sound is very clear.
277,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not sweatproof. Started cutting out after a 5 mile run. 2 days later stopped working (cutting out and then disconnecting) 5 miles into a 10 mile run. It’s a shame because I really liked the fit of the headphones.
278,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love these headphones because they’re lightweight, so they’re perfect to use while excersing. They’re also easy to use as well, just a few simple steps and your headphones are all set up and ready to go."

280,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best sound I've gotten from Bluetooth earbuds. The battery life has lasted me almost two days without stop. never buying any other earbuds than these. Definitely recommend it for people that love music, but also love to run and work out. While running they don't bounce around or fall out."
281,1.0 out of 5 stars,Was never able to sync to phone and no online support so I returned
282,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought a first pair and immediately upon receipt one of the earbuds didn't work. The second pair worked and the sound quality was fine, but less than a year after purchase the same thing happened one of the earbuds totally stopped working. Won't be buying again."
283,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones offer so many features. Most importantly they sound great. They charge quickly and hold the charge with at least 6 hours of use. I really like that they earbuds are magnetized. They are also very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
284,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super light and easy to use. I like how the earphone fits well in my ear. Doesn’t fall out like the iPhone earbuds.The clarity is ever so slightly lacking when compared to other better wired earphones but nothing too bad.The battery goes more than 8 hours for me, as advertised."
285,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well and sounds great.
286,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful. One of the buds stopped working completely the battery does not even stay charged for 3 hours. Very disappointed.
287,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things are greaaaaat! I've never tried the Beats X headphones, but I wanted something pretty similar. And these fit the bill. I don't often write product reviews, but I feel that I definitely had to write one for this product. Certainly ""beats"" paying $150 for similar headphones."

296,1.0 out of 5 stars,Right side does not work
297,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality for price. Good battery life. Headphones are magnetic and stick together. The ear wings were not useful, and made the headphones hard to keep in, but you can just remove them."
298,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Earphone’s battery working perfectly long, I wear it to jogging for almost 4 days without charging and it’s still strongstay. The wireless connection is stayable at least I didn’t heard anything noise at all. After all a good product."

324,5.0 out of 5 stars,It wears very comfortable. Worthy the price.
325,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Really liked these headphones, for the 5 months they worked. Then recently the right side just stopped working. So I can’t say they are great quality. Would expect them to have lasted longer."

330,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is great. They look fantastic. However, the wire connecting the neckband to the earbud is too short for me. This results in the neckband being suspended whenever I put in the earbuds, which is a tad uncomfortable."

334,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound quality for the price.
335,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've paid 3 times as much money for headphones similar to this. These I find are better. I was quite surprised.
336,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound bar that sits on the neck is very annoying
337,5.0 out of 5 stars,This headphones works great. It is very convenient to use. What I like about it is that they are not easy to fall off my ears when I am jogging.

340,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far it is the best wireless headphones I've ever used in this range of price. At the beginning, I found that's hard to connect with my phone, but it turned out that, when initialling the setup, just press the power button and don't release until you hear ""paring"", and then it takes only seconds to pair. The sound quality is really worth its price, and it is water splash proof. So highly recommended."
341,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really! I've been through all kinds of earplugs all the time. Trying to find a good combination of sound quality and easy connection, my purchase has been disappointing until now. I paired them to my computer because I was going to travel and wanted them to watch a movie on a plane trip. I opened them, and to my surprise, this beautiful little clip had a lot of surprises. They paired up quickly. The height of these earplugs I recommend will not disappoint you."
342,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never used bluetooth headphone before
It is really convenient. I can put my mobile on my bedroom and walk around when I call someone and my mobile is being charged.
And its quality of music is very good. At least better than my previous headphone.
And I don't need to put it in my pocket anymore, because it can be put on my neck :)
And it can connect 2 devices at the same time, but this will affect the quality of sound."
343,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these at work. I have an office and sound travels from the other offices through the ceiling so i have been trying to drown the noise out with regular earbuds. I didn't think that they were noise cancelling at first but then pushed them in further and voila! i couldn't hear anything besides my music. Plus I don't have to jack up the sound really high and the sound quality increased once i had it in my ear properly. It paired with my iphone SE super fast but I had to update the bluetooth driver on my computer at work for it to work on my machine.
344,5.0 out of 5 stars,Came from Beats earbud wired to these - BOOM goes the bass! These sound better and I'm not just saying that - I have been using solid 3 weeks with no hiccups - battery life is better than stated as well - only recharged once and linked with my Apple Watch and phone - have used over the carplay as well due to the noise cancelling characteristics - could not be more happy!
345,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones! They cancel out quite a bit of noise too. The battery life is great so far.. I’ve had them for about 8 months too
The only thing that I don’t like (and this is just nitpicking) is when I try to skip a song, you can’t press twice like you would on apple iPhone headphones otherwise your phone redials! There is another command to skip/go back songs and volume buttons though!"
346,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wear these when riding my motorcycle. I had to switch out the earpieces with some triple flange tips I had laying around, this gave me the noise isolation I needed to not be deafened by wind noise. With these in, I can protect my hearing from wind noise while hearing navigation directions or listening to music. Holds a charge just fine, they're low enough profile to fit inside my helmet."
347,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally found the headphones that designed for sports use. I have bought so many different wireless earphones over the years but this is the one I really like. It stays in my ears when I run. It is very light weight and comfortable, the flexible neckband design is really good. The sound quality is just as good or even better then my other earphones. I am really happy with my purchase."
348,5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW! I always had a hard time with headsets in general! I took a chance knowing how great Amazon is & most sellers are with the hassle free returns. They DON'T BOTHER MY EAR, they are lightweight, you put them on like a necklace so there always available & magnetic!!!! Thanks to these my ears don't hurt anymore!! TOP QUALITY HEADSET!! LOVE THESE!!"
349,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Bluetooth headset is easy to carry and a bit like a headset. I like this style very much, and the line-type headset sometimes makes me feel very troublesome. I accidentally pick up the cable, but the Bluetooth headset can solve my problem. The problem, but it's loud, and it can make my ears feel uncomfortable for a long time"
350,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!!!
351,3.0 out of 5 stars,This my second pair love them don't last long cheaply made. I need another pair.😐

365,5.0 out of 5 stars,Both sound and the phone speaker are good as expected.
366,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall nice. It is a little difficult positioning them in my ear compared to other earphones I have owned.
367,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality. And the best part I like is it will stay firmly around my neck when I work out in the gym.
368,5.0 out of 5 stars,"to be honest, it deserved highet price. very nice sound, the price is so good also."
369,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love how they look like but can't connect my phone. When it's on , my phone can't see this device . Need to check with some other connection but probably will have to return"
370,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's pretty good for bluetooth headphones. I use them a lot and it has a long battery life. Im king to order another pair. The only thing the didn't mention is the curved part is hard. It helpful. I got it onetime. I recommend!
371,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones so far. I've been using these for about a week and they're doing exactly what I need them to do. Inexpensive and Good for the price.

I like it so far."
373,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use and many functions!
374,1.0 out of 5 stars,"un-usable product. The only way they would work is if I kept the phone in my hand. As soon as you put it in your pocket, loses connectivity, almost immediately - 30 ft? try 3. Awful headset."

381,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is awesome for a headset. Made uniquely shaped foryour ears. It was hard to synch The device to my phone however after troubleshooting I was able to resolve prior to returning for a refund.
382,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Should have figured out after buying the first pair that they break easily. Both times one of the ear pieces stops working, it seems as if the wires become disconnected easily, they are garbage."

410,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good for this price. One thing is that they don’t give you heads up before it gets low on battery. A little bit big for small ears.

420,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am very happy excellent product and service!!
421,1.0 out of 5 stars,I got these to use at the gym and typically my phone is in a pocket near my waist while I work out (literally a 2 ft distance) they would not work from that distance.

450,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bluetooth connection works well with phone and PC!
The product is well designed and very easy to pair with my SS mobile phone and Lenovo laptop. It is quickly charged to full using a USB port. The air plug is nicely fit into my ear and sound quality is OK. The only complain is the unit is still a kind of heavy when hanging on my neck."
451,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my friend. It comes with pretty good package, so I do not need to gift wrap it. He has been using it for a week. He told me the sound is smooth, and comfortable to wear. The soft long construction make it easy to carry around and not losing it. So glad that I bought it as gift and make my friend happy."
452,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had these for a week now, and wow! I buy headphones like changing underwear. Theses have won me over. I would say for the price, but that would be a lie. These could cost $169.00 (like somewhere headphones I own) and I would buy these. I work 10 hour days and they last my whole work day. Sound is on par with way more expensive sets. Fit is wonderful. Pairing was a breeze also. If you ask me they are a major buy!"
453,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pro: Great sound quality with fair price. Power last for entire day. Easy to pair with my cell & computer.
Con: Sometimes, I have to repair it after used other Bluetooth devices. Not big issue when I use it.

The sound quality and power is the best part. I have tried so many different brands, and this is one of my favorite. Must buy item."
454,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my brother in law birthday gift,he love this light weighted wireless headphone. The headphone will stay around your neck and will not move around when you are running. The music quality is good and easy to control. Super sensitive and easy to hook up with his phone. My brother in law so happy with this gift."
455,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality! The tips were annoying so I swapped them out for some COMPLY foam tips, the bass and seal is so much better. Definitely a great balance of bass and treble. No lack of bass, no tinny sound. Was really surprised, considering I bought these on a whim."
456,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair of LG HBS 700, then I miss placed them somewhere, lost now, but had years of great use out of them. Before I got these, I got a set of BeatsX, well those got returned after trying them out for a day. They sounded like any old cheapo ear buds, the ear cushions did not block out any outside noise (sound leak), and only last around 6.5hrs, not the up to 8 hrs claimed (continuous play). For there price you can get nothing in returned but over priced and an over rated brand. We'll these for the price is a great buy, been using them for a few days now and they have lived up to the specs. Got a total of 11.5 hrs continuous play, sound quality is excellent, controls are straight forward and work as is. No complaints here but getting a 2nd pair for my office use. Confident i'll have years of great use of of these like my LG one's."
457,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These inexpensive headphones are simply incredible. So far I would give them 6 stars if I could. I use them on my motorcycle. I am literally able to ride down the Interstate at 80 mph and hear every word and every note. I used them to and from work today on my 40 mile commute, including 20 miles of Interstate each way. The noise cancelling is superb. It reduces the wind noise down to a level where the music comes through loud and clear. The wind noise is usually deafening, but with these little gems in I barely hear it. Be sure to use the correct size rubber tip for the best results, (three different sizes are included). I highly recommend them for motorcyclists. Just be careful and pay attention because you also barely hear the traffic around you. But that's what your eyes and your mirrors are for!"
458,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really excellent bluetooth headphones. Paired easily, has great sound quality (some of the best I've experienced), and most of all are very lightweight. Bought these to replace a pair of bluetooth headphones that had the battery attached to the earpiece, which made it bulky and heavy, and stuck out of my ears in a really conspicuous way. These are the opposite. Sometimes I forget I have them on. Very pleased with this product."
459,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved this product in the beginning. However, after only one month of using these headphones, it went downhill. The first time I contacted this company, they were quick to respond. My second correspondence got no response and I just sent my third correspondence and awaiting a response. I purchased two of these headphones, one for me and one for my husband. Mine went downhill and my husband's is still going strong. I feel that I received a defective item and for some reason, their customer service is not responding to my attempts. Not happy with this AT ALL."

540,5.0 out of 5 stars,They were easy to work and sound amazing.
541,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is truly a sports earphone set. All the designs are for sports purposes. The soft rubber supportive structure really helps the ear pods stay within my ears even when I am doing extensive exercise. The buttons for controlling it is as simple and comfortable as it could be. The overall weight of this set of the earphone is just about right, makes it feel comfortable while wearing. It looks very durable too and I hope it stays for a long time use. Besides, I really love the magnetic clip design, the ends of two pods could easily connect to each other when they get close. This helps the earphone to stay on my neck when I am not using them. Great product overall."
542,4.0 out of 5 stars,good for listening music.
543,1.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t get it to connect to Bluetooth
544,5.0 out of 5 stars,
545,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gerçekten çok iyi tavsiye ederim.
546,1.0 out of 5 stars,Only work for 1 week. And gave out
547,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good

549,5.0 out of 5 stars,Charge last my 8 hour work day!!! Great headphones!
550,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good enough for my daily out.
551,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The box looks totally second hand. it's not firmly placed in the case, and shows some wear and tear. it's obvious that someone used it and returned it. as a Bluetooth headphone to listen to music, the quality is pretty clear, but if you are planning to talk to someone, be ready to hear that the other party will be experiencing static noise. I tried 2 times to call my husband, and he's hearing some ""mechanical noise"" and asked me to return."
552,5.0 out of 5 stars,It can t get charge
553,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great
554,2.0 out of 5 stars,is mistake buy them so is bad product
555,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight and comfortable fit, but sound was scratchy, lacked depth, and the left earbud's construction was faulty as the suction caused by adjusting the earpiece would completely cut the sound out for several seconds.

I was looking for acceptable sound quality, stable wireless connection, comfort, and water/sweat resistance since I didn't want to subject my pricier earphones through my heavy sweating during workouts. I wasn't expecting excellent sound from a $20 Bluetooth headset, but the quality of what I received wasn't acceptable. Item was returned."
556,1.0 out of 5 stars,No me sirvieron
557,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them!!!
558,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds nice
559,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best!!!!!!!
560,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones and they won’t pair with devices, your supposed to press what’s called an MF button until it blinks red and blue alternatively. And the head phones don’t do that, they turn off blink blue lights but that is about it, really disappointed."
561,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this light weighted wireless headphone. The headphone will stay around your neck and will not move around when you are jogging. The music quality is good and easy to control. Super sensitive and easy to hook up with my phone. My friends had tried it out and they placed the order for this headphone too.
562,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Huge money saving rather than spend almost 100$, you can get this product with as little as 20$. This Bluetooth headphone is very light and suitable to wear all day long. A full charged headphone can last at least 6 hour+. I have wear it everyday and hang around to my neck as a standby mode."
563,1.0 out of 5 stars,"First, these headphones aren’t sweat proof, I can barely get them to stay in while biking let alone jogging.
Second, they lose connection with your connected device frequently and even at close range (phone was in my pocket and it disconnected more than 5 times in 30 mins of jogging) The battery life is also horrendous, barely goes 2 hours with a full charge.
These headphones are terrible. They’re so annoying when you have to constantly reconnect them. Don’t waste your money, buy the expensive quality headphones if you don’t want the headache."
564,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first set came to me with a short in the left ear, but when I contacted the seller via Amazon the immediately sent me a replacement. I wear the headphones constantly, using them primarily to listen to audiobooks on walks and bike rides. Is but these again. They sound great and work as expected."
565,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using this headphone for about couple weeks and I'm really surprised about the battery life and how cool it looks. I use this daily and I love it! Only blemish is that I couldn't really fun fast wearing this obviously because it was keep bouncing off and hitting my neck back every time.
566,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have always had trouble with every pair of headphones I've gotten. They all had that heavy Mic box and it drove me insane! They were always falling off my head. Then I got these! They have a supportive neckband so they don't fall off. And they have to separate batteries so it lasts for almost 10 hours. They're great!
567,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Took me forever to figure out how to connect it, but when I did it got excited. This is the part that's a five star. They're really light weight and super comfortable on the neck; you can't even tell they're there. They stay centered when hanging down; which is really nice. These are my first earphones with fins that I have personally used and they are surprisingly more comfortable than I thought. Now this is where is gets down to 3 stars. The left earphone has to be messed with in order to sound the way it's supposed to. When it's working the sound is fantastic with pretty good bass. When it's not working the sound is extremely muted and is super noticeable. Keep in mind this is my first day getting them and using them. If the warranty replacement goes through I am more than willing to bring this rating up to five star."
568,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this wireless headphones for my daughter because she likes to listen music while she does exercise, after I received it I asked her back it to me if she doesn’t like it but after she tried the headphone, she likes it very much and alway show me how nice the quality is, she said she will tell her fridends to buy it too."
569,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the design. When I'm not using it, it sits comfortably around my neck, the magnetic earbud clipped together forming a closed loop so I don't have worries losing the earphone. I use the smallest ear piece provided in the package, the sound quality is great and my ears don't hurt. This is a great product."
570,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far great. Looking forward to lots of use.
571,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good
572,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lose connection easily
573,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these wireless headphones. Great sound quality and easy to Bluetooth to your phone! I can listen to all my music on my phone while getting ready, taking a walk, cleaning, etc. crystal clear sound quality! No static or fuzz. Very great quality and durable! Highly recommended! Would definitely purchase again!"
574,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome! They make my workday go by fast. I used to call in all the time. Now i have an audible membership and i rarely call in sick. I know that sounds lame, but it's true. I work in a laboratory and am very social. But much of my work is independent and i would get SO bored. Now i listen to books all day. Perfect. The battery lasts forever and it charges really fast. I also take it home with me on m y weekends to use while I'm cleaning."
575,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In love! This is great! I used it the first time today. It is very easy to connect to my phone, and the sound is awesome. I tried to run to a diff room of the house, and it still works ! Also, the noise cancellation is good. Exactly what I was looking for."
576,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice looking headphones. Took about five minutes to pair with cellphone, but once it paired it was fine. Excellent sound, and looks very ""cool"" on. I've paired it with iPad and an android cellphone and had no issues."
577,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These paired easily, are very light weight, and the sound is great. The back of each ear bud is magnetic and oppositely poled from its counterpart, so they magnetically snap together to secure them around one's neck when not in use. Nice feature."
578,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product! Works straight forward right out of the box. It's very easy to connect to my phone. The earbuds perfectly fit to my ears. It also comes with the hooks to help the earbuds stay in place even you work out or run hard outside. The sound quality is decent for the price. It's a little bit distortion when turn the volume all the way up. Very happy with the purchase!
579,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The effect of sound in this headphone very very comfortable. And also easy hang on my clothes, not easy to lost . And another headphone I used before, my ear is pain . But the new one today my ear is not pain any more!"
580,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were working fine for about a month and half. one day I put them on the charger (the one provided) and when I took them off about an hour later they had shorted out, overheated, and exploded. Potentially very dangerous, glad it didn't happen while I was wearing them"
581,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really excited to have these earphones, because I get annoyed by the cord on my traditional earbuds getting caught on stuff or just otherwise distracting me.These otium headphones are pretty good,they stay in my ear and of course there is no cord to get tangled. For phone use, people I'm talking to report that I sound loud and clear, even when talking while walking on a busy street with traffic. So I highly recommended them! Just buy it man!!"
582,1.0 out of 5 stars,Product was broke before i even used it. The left side ear piece wasn't making sound.
583,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for my daughter's boyfriend and he said sound is good and great for workouts.
584,1.0 out of 5 stars,Left microphone stopped working not even three months of use
585,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A good Bluetooth headphone, it will be stay firmly around the head and won't be moving up and down with vigorous movements. And also has good sound experience, very comfortable, anyone have the pursuit of stable and soft products could try it."
586,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First day of having it and it was a pain to connect to my phone.. Note to self when you get this, first turn it on then immediately after pressing the on button hold it down until the red/blue lights flash. Otherwise if you don't do that after turning it on you will be just turning the headset on and off over and over... So be quick!"
587,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are great. However, I must rate 2 stars because the charging cord does not work. I’m using a different one although the instructions say not to use any other or it might damage the headphones. I hope it doesn’t!
Update: I changed the rating to 4 stars because they are really decent for the price. I have been able to charge them with a different cord for almost three months now and they still work just fine."
588,1.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones don't work with my iPhone 7. I'm so upset.
589,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice headphones.Can't beat the value of them,very comfortable to wear and sound quality is good."
590,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give it less than one star if I could , straight Out of the Box they would not connect to my phone... the most ridiculous thing is Amazon will now keep my money for a product that never worked until they get it shipped back to them what a unbelievable inconvenience"
591,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is very clear. It is very comfortable. The battery life is more than enough. Just what I needed for a Bluetooth headphones.
592,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very cool looking headphones great gift for those who love music. I use them all the time. I am happy with this product.
593,5.0 out of 5 stars,This pair of earbuds were of good quality. It was sturdy and the sound was good. I enjoyed using this product.
594,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound. Lost one of the ear wings, somehow fell off. Asked to purchase more, was told no. Still really like the product."
595,4.0 out of 5 stars,Just received today. No problem so far. Charged and ease with correcting to device. Volume and bass just right. Haven't tried one a call yet. Will update if not satisfied. But will change rating to 5 🌟 once experience call with a positive outcome. Worth what I paid.
596,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality. I use them when I walking to school and have no problem with them falling out. I would recommend this headphone.
597,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sound was “tinny” and would drop out.
598,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work right out of the box.
599,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They connect easily, the battery doesn't last as long as some other wireless ear buds.
I've been through about 8 pairs of these and other wireless ear buds, trying to find the ones that work best for me (lightweight, excellent sound quality, buds don't feel like they are about to be ripped out of my ear, etc..)

They don't skip much, even when moving. Beyond that I don't like the sound quality. Ever since those beat headphones came out every cheap headphone/earbud manufacturer TURNS THE FACTOEY SETTINGS FOR BASS WAY TOO HIGH!!! I listen to actual music, rock with different instruments, orchestra, electronica, and heavily lyrical music. The bass is way too high to enjoy a full music experience with these buds. I haven't touched the equalizer on my phone in about a year, and have to adjust them to turn down the bass on these. Now I'll have to adjust them EVERY TIME, cause the sound is fine with my other Bluetooth devices (car, motorcycle).

Dear ear buds manufacturers, NOT EVERY CUSTOMERS JUST WANTS TO HEAR A WHOLE LOT OF BASS BLASTING IN THEIR EARS.... SOME CUSTOMERS LISTEN TO REAL MUSIC!! NOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF BASS!! I'm so sick and tired of paying $30 here, $40 there trying to find a quality set of ear buds only to have mini bass machines that just make my music sound like crap......"
600,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
601,2.0 out of 5 stars,"no good, cool have been better"
602,5.0 out of 5 stars,It came with a nice box. I can't wait to use it! Perfect for gym
603,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst headphones I've ever tried. The ear buds fall out with the slightest movement They do not stay resting on your neck while lifting or doing abs. Will be returning these.
604,1.0 out of 5 stars,return one of the air piece wasn't working
605,1.0 out of 5 stars,Item devictive. It doesn't work:(
606,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first wireless sports headphones, i found out this one so light and convenient. i like this so much and i think i will use this everyday,"
607,1.0 out of 5 stars,The power button stopped working after only a month and a half of use.
608,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very fragile had it in my back pocket and when I sat down and and stood up right after and the ear pice broke off
609,2.0 out of 5 stars,OK. Not recommend for the gym or being active .
610,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy.stopped working about the time the warranty was over
611,1.0 out of 5 stars,it hurt my ear badly
612,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Did a lot of research. Bought eight pairs of headphones. This one came out on top. Comfortable, good sound quality, and the buds seal out a lot of external noise. The only thing I don't like is the voice FREQUENTLY reminding you to charge it when it's low on battery. I get it, it needs to charge! However the voice is LOUD and cuts over whatever you're trying to listen to."
613,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Bluetooth connection is no good
614,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great the range is better than the other one I have which is 30 feet, I can get about 50 yards away from my iPad before it cuts out. It may be producing more RF radiation than the other one though so I think I will only use it when I need wireless hand free applications."
615,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I did have some initial static that disappeared when I forgot, then repaired to my device. Surprisingly good sound when you push them well into your ears. Battery life is effective through the use of active power management"
616,5.0 out of 5 stars," This Bluetooth headset is very small, put in the neck is not heavy. Sound quality is very clear, do sports when wearing a very suitable."
617,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked these at first. The sound quality was decent, especially for the price. However within a few weeks the sound started to cut out from simple things like the ""shock"" of briskly walking downhill as my foot hit the ground. Within another week just turning my head or another object touching it would make the sound cut out for several seconds. I didn't really continue to use them afterwards to see what further progression the might have been."
618,2.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to work fine and does have a good sound but From the pictures I thought it was just a long cord and it’s not. the neck piece is actually hard plastic and shaped to fit around your neck. Seems like a fine product and a good price but Just not what I was looking for
619,1.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t rebiew because I returned them only because my son wanted different style
620,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my headphone, but there is a problem with them, when in use static is been heard, it's very annoying to listen."
621,2.0 out of 5 stars,These things are hunks of garbage. They don't connect and then sound quality is horrible. I'd rather stick cacti in my ears and listen through the blood. Not even worth the price. I had a pair previously that were great and when I reordered they felt cheap and crappy like a tiajuana woman.
622,1.0 out of 5 stars,The earphones were fine at first and randomly stopped working in the right ear. Should've bought beats instead :(
623,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say this is completely waste of time and money. this crap just stop working in less that a month. thanks that I have prime and send it back and get my money quick. this had big big big problem with the connection, I did a hard reset as they told me to does. and the connection is crap and today they just stop working.
It works some time better than other. When I got this Bluetooth at first I love them. But now that I use them for some time I do not sure if I'll keep them or I'm returning them. The problem is with the conection that some time and now is doing more it had interference and drop the conection. I used another Samsung Bluetooth and I had zero problem with conection. The battery in this Bluetooth is amazing and the Bluetooth are very light. But lattlely I had this big bug with the connection dropping more and more. Some time you are in the middle of a conversation and you do not want at all your conversation."
624,1.0 out of 5 stars,reminds me of a 1960's transistor radio.....like listening through a tin can. Bass is literally nonexistent - the ONLY thing these would be good for is a Podcast. I would absolutely not recommend this product......old Apple phone ear phones sound 100 times better.
625,1.0 out of 5 stars,Low quality headphones. Would not pair with any device.
626,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound pretty good, and they were surprisingly inexpensive for Bluetooth earphones, and they add some nice features, but because those features override standard behavior, switching between these earphones and normal ones can be a little frustrating.

Most audio programs for mobile platforms have a user-definable function for double-clicking the remote button. You can skip ahead a few seconds to fast-forward through podcast advertisements. You can jump back a few seconds in case you missed something in your audiobook. You can skip to the next track. Etc.

These earphones override that functionality and will only re-dial the last-called number on your phone when you double-click the ""MF Button."" However, they include a useful feature to rewind or fast-forward a little but by holding down the volume up or down buttons for a few seconds, giving you more flexibility once you get used to the non-standard operation.

Another minor annoyance is that if you pause the audio on your phone for awhile (for example, to finish writing/editing a review for the earphones), the earphones will automatically disconnect and reconnect to your Bluetooth device (e.g. phone) every so often, which is really jarring, because the ""Disconnected.. pairing.. connected"" voice prompts are quite a bit louder than they should be (that is, they're louder than most audio content you'll be listening to).

The issue with the voice prompt volume being too loud affects all aspects of these earphones - powering on, powering off, pairing, connecting, and disconnecting. They're just too loud and jarring, or when they're not, other content is too quiet."
627,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They work ok except if you're talking on the phone with them. When you're on a call, they will randomly loose connection, say they are re-pairing, But, won't. You have to turn them off only to have them repair, and then drop again. Annoying message telling you battery is low keeps playing every few seconds, until batteries die."
628,2.0 out of 5 stars,This headset is very comfortable in my ear and the sound quality was great. But it stared to over heat within 30 minutes of being turned on. Not even listening to music or talking just on. Really like it but the feeling of your neck getting burned is a no go. My search goes on.
629,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are pretty comfortable and have a decent enough Bluetooth range, and a decent battery life. My biggest complaint is that the volume for low battery, power on/off and pairing notifications is really loud. Much louder than the volume I have my music set it. It's annoying, but not a deal breaker."
630,1.0 out of 5 stars,would pair get a phone call. half way thru conversation it would unpair in middle of conversation !
631,1.0 out of 5 stars,"One star is too generous. Fresh out the box Connection is sketchy st best. They sound fine as long as I don't turn my head to the right, bend over, or do anything but sit perfectly still. Do not buy them, they're a waste of money. I'm going to try a different brand for a few more dollars."
632,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They worked great the first couple of days, then they stopped playing any form of media. I've tried everything but still nothing. Works great for calls, but useless to me without media that's the whole purpose I bought them"
633,2.0 out of 5 stars,I thought these were awesome sounded great and never had connection issues......for 3 weeks then the battery refused to keep a charge
634,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The is the 2nd exact headphones bought. First pair, loved the fit and all, however, too much feedback when using the bluetooth on phone call. Tried another pair from another seller, but hated the fit on those. The fit on these Otiums was too good. So I decided to exchange. No feedback, so far on this pair. Descent sound, very comfortable around neck and in ear."
635,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the comfort and fit of these ear buds, and they work great for watching movies on my devices. The only problem I am having with them is that they frequently disconnect from my phone during phone calls, making it so that I have to then go from hands free to either speaker or using my phone.... Which if you live in the state of Washington it is illegal to even touch your phone while you are driving. So if your plan is to only use them for movies and videos you are set."
636,1.0 out of 5 stars,sound quality is better than expected but it disconnects on every call very disappointed.
637,3.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. It goes in and out every now and then which is annoying. I'm hoping that it stays working well since I got it to use while I'm at work.
638,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for the price. Needed a pair of workout headphones and I got a deal on these when I bought another pair from this brand. They stay in my ears and the volume support works on the iPhone 7 plus. Wish it were a little bigger though because I have large hands (thanks, mom)"

Brand: Otium
Model: X6 Neckband Wireless Headphones

Overall Rating: 4/5 if they work, 1/5 currently.

Introduction:
I love headphones, I absolutely enjoy getting new headphones, trying out new headphones, and talking about headphones. I ordered these headphones along with another pair of Otium headphones and was fortunately able to try out both at the same time. Up until recently, these were my favorite pair of headphones. They currently, however, will not charge and so I cannot use them. It may be the cable I have to charge them, I will update this if trying a different cable helps.

Product Description:
These are Bluetooth headphones that consist of two earbuds wired to a necklace-like device that rests around your neck. The earbuds themselves have no buttons on them but there are three buttons on the right side of the necklace: volume down, a utility button, and volume up.

The length of the earbud cord from the necklace is plenty long enough to be comfortable while not being too long and awkward. The necklace is great if you are just listening in one ear as the other headphone will hang without dragging that ear out. Often Bluetooth headphones consist of two earbuds attached only via a cord, like Beats' popular model. While these are stylish, they are absolutely frustrating when using one headphone at a time as the non-used headphone will literally drag the other one out of your ear. For most people this isn't an issue as they are perfectly content ignoring the rest of the world, so two ears is fine with them. I like hearing people/sounds as I'm listening so unless I'm alone studying/reading I typically only use 1 ear at a time.

One more nice feature is that the volume down button is the first (and therefore easiest) button so that if the music is suddenly too loud you can quickly alleviate that.

The earbuds also have small rubber flaps designed to help them stay in your ear better. These are actually quite useful and, unlike some other headphones I've used, they actually stay on decently well. If the flaps bother you they are easily removable (or re-attachable if you change your mind) as you just slide the rubber ring on/off.

The headphones come with three different sizes of grips, but they are not very high quality grips. They work fine, don't get me wrong, but they're just the standard quality rubber.

Finally, the earbuds can magnetically stick together, which is semi-useful if you're wearing the headphones but not using them. By sticking them together they don't fly around as much.

Product Features
The headphones can easily connect via Bluetooth to my phone and laptop, at the same time if desired, and likely to additional devices. The necklace can adjust the volume by pressing the volume up/down buttons or change tracks by holding the volume up/down buttons. Power is controlled by holding the middle utility button, holding it turns them on/off. Pressing it once without holding pauses/resumes the music. Overall, most standard music controls can be achieved via the necklace without even looking at your phone/device.

In terms of sound quality, these are among the best cheap headphones I've ever used, and I've had about 20 pairs of headphones. In fact, until they stopped working these were my favorite pair to use. I even brought them to Kauai with me. I did, however, say these are among the best ""cheap"" headphones. My favorite pair of headphones was an old pair of Sony headphones called ""Extra Bass headphones"". They cost about $60, sounded beautiful, and the bass vibrated from them so well. These cost about $24 currently ($90 originally), but I would be willing to pay about $30 for them. They sound great but their range is not as wide as the Sony ones, they have great deep bass but not quite those of the Sony headphones or the other Otium ones, and they seal out sound well but again, not quite as well as the Sony ones.

In terms of battery life (before they stopped charging on me), they lasted about 2-3 hours or so. Honestly not the greatest battery for me, but they worked well enough and charge quickly enough that it wasn't a huge issue. The low battery life and poor quality grips were the main reasons I would give them a 4/5.

Pros:
Necklace with many controls easily-accessible.
Phenomenal sound for the price I paid.
Earbuds designed to stay in ear.
Earbuds can clip together to prevent flying around.
Easy Bluetooth connectivity to multiple devices.
Decent sound cancellation.

Cons:
Not as powerful or clear as higher-end headphones.
Grips provided with headphones are average-quality.
They stopped working on me.
Conclusion:
Great-quality headphones for the price until they stopped retaining battery charge.

Update!!!
I contacted the seller, explained the issue about the battery charge, and they sent me a new replacement free of charge. This new pair holds a charge much better than the initial ones, so I bringing my review back up to 4/5."
640,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I found a few different types of Bluetooth headphones, and these ones were fairly average. I wish they weren't so long. The sound quality is not as good as other ones I have had it, but the bass is still prominent. I don't like how the music fades in and out when pressing play and pause. The range is sub par, but as long as I am in the same room they stay connected. This headphone is terrible for runners. The part around the Neck tends to bounce up and down."
641,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok so the build quality is decent, they are decently comfortable, and the battery life is great but let me tell you these things sound like garbage. the sound is very thin there is almost no bass I have to turn bass boost up on my computer just to barely hear the bass line of of a song. The treble is harsh and tinny. I've tried all the tips and ear wings to try and get better sound but this just doesn't make the cut at all. I bought these because many reviewers said they liked the sound quality and the bass was good. This simply is not true

Save up a few more bucks and get something better Not sure if I am going to keep these"
642,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is beyond horrible, and the headset keeps dying after turning it on for more then 10 mins, even when it has fully charged."
643,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these on Aug 2, 2017 and it is only Aug 12, 2017 and the left ear bud has already gone out. I really liked everything about these headphones until I turned them on this last time and for no reason the left headphone won't produce any sound what so ever. The quality was great they are super lightweight and true to the sweat proof, honestly if it wasn't for the headphone going out after 10 days these headphones could easily be rated 5 star"
644,2.0 out of 5 stars,These a good sound good bass but the connectivity is bad they disconnect on their own they don't have a long range At all
645,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked these headphones. They were easy to pair with my iPhone and had good range. If I went out of range they would automatically reconnect when I got near the phone again. Best of all, they would hold a charge for 8 hours (I listen to books while working). This week they developed a short in the left bud, which is annoying, but they won't charge any more, which is fatal. Last week I would have given this product 5 stars. This week, 1 star. I have had them since about the middle of July."
646,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds aren’t great. I think the weight of the magnets that keep them around your neck when they aren’t in your ears are too heavy. They actually won’t stay in my ears because of the weight! I can’t even attempt to wear them for activities, like the gym, walking my dogs or even cooking. Every time I move my head, they pop out of my ears."
647,1.0 out of 5 stars,I would give these no stars but that is not an option. These were a replacement pair for the original item ordered that came with only one side working. These are used intermittently. 2/12 months later they no longer work. Ridiculous.
648,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, they stay on your neck, hardly tell you have them on, great sound too.
** update ** they stop working after 29 days from every other day use (1 hour), I just made it in time to return them."
649,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's so far holding up. Does what I need. Battery life is good. A lot more sturdy than my old ones this replaced for riding while wearing under my helmet. I previously had 2 old one's that damaged due to thin cables and cost more, which were similar to the LG Tones.

Only CONs:
1) I wish it vibrates when a call comes in since I don't leave it in-ear that often when working so it'd be nice if it vibrated to inform me of calls.

2) Also, I wish it'll let me know battery status when ever I power on the device; that way I will know just about when to charge again as it's not easy to gauge when since I last charged.

Will definitely buy again, especially if they upgraded with newer features as discussed."
650,1.0 out of 5 stars,Garbage the left earbud did not work upon arrival don't buy this cheaply made trash!
651,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The connection is lost very close to the main device, and the specifications says that it has a range of 10 meters"
652,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound for a low price.
653,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I made the purchase mainly due to the necklace type design and the advertised battery life. The funcitonality of the design works for me but to be honest I don't know if I've gotten 9hrs of battery out of this thing. A couple hours on the phone usually ends with the craziest static/interruption. Also, the signal range has got the be the worst, where sometimes I can't even put the phone in my pocket."
654,2.0 out of 5 stars,There OK I have all Skip too much
655,1.0 out of 5 stars,"10/17:
When I first started using these, I loved them. I did have to buy smaller earbuds because my ear holes are tiny. It worked great, but after maybe 10 uses, the right speaker blew and now it's useless. For the price it's not bad, but I was hoping it would last longer and wouldn't die so quickly.

***UPDATE 12/9/17****
I purchased another pair of these hoping I would have better luck with the speakers. When I received the item, it wouldn’t even pair with my iPhone 7. I tried doing everything and my iPhone didn’t seem to have any trouble connecting to other Bluetooth devices. Sadly will be returning these."
656,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn't last three weeks , not a good purchase"
657,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just awful. I Tried them for all of 60 seconds before I printed out the return label. They're so oddly stiff, The pictures make you believe the thicker plastic band is just on the back, but it comes around the front of my neck, connecting, like a weird necklace. The smallest size is still too big for me, and to top it off, the quality sounds like you're listening to it underwater. It's a no for me"
658,2.0 out of 5 stars,"******EDIT: They were awesome headphones for 2 days then the speakers started popping and crackling so bad it hurts to listen to them with medium volume.. oh well i guess its time to start looking for another kind... ********

originally purchased apples beats x for use at work and the gym.. did not know that they were not sweat proof so i never did take them to work since my job is outside in the heat and and high humidity. did not want to ruin a 150$ set of earbuds on day one.. i saw these from otium and decided to purchase.. very glad i did.. sound just as good as my beats x they fit just as good.. battery lasts just as long .. AND THEY ARE SWEAT PROOF.. $16 vs $150 ... i wish i had bought these first.. could have save some cash for bought 10 pairs of these for the same price as my beats.. so now the beats are at home earbuds and these are all day everyday work ..workout. sweat and not worry earbuds.. thanks otium for a nice product and amazing price"
659,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good when they work. They do however consistently go quite when you are moving before they come back on.

Additionally, while the battery life seems to be very good, once they get low you get a constant ""low battery, please charge"" comment in your ear every 15-20 seconds at a high volume. It makes it unbearable to listen to when it's low.

There's nothing worse than being in the middle of a workout where you want the music, and despite the headphones having another 20+ minutes of charge left you are stuck hearing ""low battery, please charge"" every 15 seconds. That ""feature"" alone will prevent me from buying these a second time.

I just left the gym and it annoyed me enough to time it. It takes 3 seconds to say that and does it once every 20 seconds. The headphones lasted 16 minutes after that notification and it was a miserable experience"
660,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Been having for two months and already messing up connecting and disconnecting connecting and disconnecting and it keep doing it over and over have to turn them off and then turn it back on for them to work a little better then it'll stay on for about an hour and turn off and turn on, I'm sick of them and I need to find another pair that will last longer than two months....."
661,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used other brands of around the neck headphones for years. I saw this on a lightening deal and decided to give it a shot. After a couple of weeks of use I really like them. I primarily listen to Podcasts, and audio books, not music, so I won't judge the sound quality other than to say the spoken word sounds very good. The earbuds have little ""arms"" that help hold them in your ears. When working under a car or RV these are light enough that they don't tend to fall off as easily as others I have used. Plus they the ear pieces are held together magnetically if not in your ears. Therefore, when they have fallen off my neck while laying on the ground, they have stayed with me. I lost one pair of the other style when they fell off while working on an RV at a camp ground and did not remember that I had them on. I have used these for a number of phone conversations and have had no complaints that the person on the other end could not hear me.
The only negative that I have thus far is they don't tell you the battery level when you power them on. I forgot to charge them for 3 or 4 days and ran out of battery."
662,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well built and good quality with a affordable price.
663,1.0 out of 5 stars,I tried to connect/pair the headphones aith my Iphone but it did not pair at all. Reset it multiple times still nothing..
664,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My hubby suggested I purchase these. I am so glad I did! I had such a hard time finding the perfect wireless earphones for me because they are either too bulky, or off balanced. Even the most subtle off balanced weight I feel on my neck. These earphones distribute the weight evenly. I don't feel the weight of the volume switch one side. Matter of fact I don't feel it at all because its on the neckband.

The sound is great too! I actually like them better then the top name brand earphones. These are definitely noise cancelling. I don't hear anything when i'm wearing them (so be cautious when you do!). I love it because I stay in the zone and my focus is on point. No sound to distract me, I don't hear others talking, I don't hear the weightlifters grunting or dropping weights, etc.

Love these earphones and highly recommend to those who don't like to feel the weight of the volume switch on one side."
665,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are awesome headphones. Sound great! My only complaint would be they don't stay charged as long as they claim. Other than that I would recommend them!
666,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love headphone, I am always buying some for work, home, travel, and for friends. I have one very very expensive pair of Bose, but I like to listen to audiobooks and music when I am in bed, so always having a relative cheap pair at hand is nice. I was looking for another paid of bluetooth headphones to replace another pair that broke, so I decided to give these a try. I had them for a few days now, and so far they are great. Paired easily with my phone, sound quality is nice, and the earbuds fit nicely in my ears. They don't feel heavy and are easy to operate. Only time will tell how long these will last, but I do know I will most likely be using them everyday during my work week for at least 6 hours a day, so I will do a followup review in 30 days. So far I am very happy and I do not have any complaints."
667,2.0 out of 5 stars,Larger than I thought & don't hold charge long.
668,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can’t begin to tell you how many wireless earbuds I have purchased and not been pleased with them. Most would not fit properly into my ears and fall out, or I could not get them to connect, or the sound quality was bad. This set, however, was finally the last purchase. I utilize these at work mostly. They stay in my ears, the quality is great. The distance of range was far greater than I expected. I would highly recommend these earbuds to anyone. The phone connectivity worked when I didn’t even expect to utilize it. My biggest hurdle was being able to keep them in place, and these earbuds far exceeded that expectation! Purchase these, you will be glad you did."
669,4.0 out of 5 stars,"a lil delay in shipping, and had to manually connect were as some Bluetooth picks up by scanning only, other than that so far so good. lost three already maybe the neckband will help that's why I decided to try out."
670,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are very poor quality. It could not stay connected to my phone for more than 10 seconds. Plus, a cheesy sounding robotic women yells into your ear to tell you if it is connected or not. Complete garbage! I don't get how a product like this has such high reviews. I don't write reviews, but I thought it was important to try to steer people away from this awful product. There are wayyyyyy better wireless earphones on the market than this crap. I would stick to big named brands and avoid cheap Chinese junk like these earphones.
Trust me if you get these, you will be severely disappointed."
671,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for sports !
I love these because they are noise canceling and well made !
The packaging are good which allows me to give as a gift
It comes with a USB cable for charger and also extra ear buds in case you dirty them or loose them
They fit my ears perfectly !"
672,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
+long battery life, around 11 hours
+fits comfortably in ears, no soreness after extended use
+earbuds never have came out on me, even on long runs with sweating, or when using bench press
+no issues with connectivity with devices

Cons:
-No real instruction in manual on how exactly to wear these, took a little practice at first"
673,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I picked up the headphones on Amazon,they were on sale for a good price, and at that price point I am very pleased with them. I'm not the pickiest when it comes to the quality of sound in earbuds--and I know those who would turn their nose up at these--but it all sounds good to me, plus they cancel out a fair amount of noise and with the neckband they are hard to lose. They're strong enough to make it through an 8 hour day with me and that's all I need. Recommend!!"
674,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have this headphones for about a week now.It is really comfortable to wear,looks really cool on my neck,it can stay fixedly and would not fall off when you are running.The sound is amazing,the best BT headphones i have ever used.Recommend!!"
675,5.0 out of 5 stars,It fit nicely to the ear where I can wear it for bicycling and jogging. Light weight and the part that goes around your neck keeps the ear buds from falling out. It also allows for less of a pulling feel in the ear buds. Like they aren't being yanked out of your ears from gravity. The sound quality is decent for a head phone used for exercising. Battery life is satisfying which can survive a week for one hour's exercise per day.
676,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This wireless headset is great!!! It takes less than 30s to set it up, but it takes me a while for me to figure it out which side is left and which side is right. They write the R and L on the shoulder place instead of the ear place. The sound is good. The battery is good as well!! It helped me through my whole exercise time which is about an hour. It definitely last longer than that!!"
677,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Bluetooth earphone is really nice. I have wear it while doing exercise. It is steady, never trying to drop from ear. And the sound are basically nice too. The design is well thought out and they have a look and feel of quality. There is also a notice sound telling you that the earphone is turned off or on, so that you know exactly the status to avoid wasting your battery. I like this set of earphones. Highly recommended!!!"
678,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound track came out from this headphone, very good quality. Easy to connect by Bluetooth. My ears feel very comfortable when I'm wearing it. Very stable. Last for a long time, don't need to always keep charging."
679,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the phone literally 3 inches away and the reception sucks. It keeps skipping something awful. And it's a brand new phone which connects to other devices seamlessly, so I know it's not the phone. They do have nice sound though, and paired relatively easily. Trying to decide if I want to keep them, or try something different. They're kind of expensive to not pair very well."
680,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This product was great. Quality sound that is worth more than what is paid. And the neckband helps in that I never felt the earphones slipping out of my ear. With many other Bluetooth headphones, the earphones would slip out of my ear while exercising cause they were the heaviest part of the headphones. The neckband prevented that. The reason for the low rating is longevity. These headphones lasted me less than 5 months before 1 of the earphones stopped working. And I was very careful to take care of them cause I like them so much. I would careful pack them away in a plastic bag before and after each exercise and I would do so in a way that the wires would make a circle. This prevents tangles and preserves the life of the headphones. Despite my efforts, these headphones are not meant to last long in my opinion, which is a shame cause the headphones were perfect in every other way. $15 for 5 months isn’t great. I’ll just buy a more expensive pair with better sound that will last longer."
681,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update 3/21/18 the company contacted me about my problems. They offered me a replacement headset came in a few days. Love these headphones good bass all day comfortable would buy again if have to.

Well after 3 months only using a few times a week the right ear bud cuts in and out.

Love these things you can't even tell its on your neck. I can use these for hours and no problems. Sound is really good. When you put them in its like putting ear plugs in. I really don't see them falling out of your ears."
682,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are now my go too headphones for working out. The sound is amazing, they totally blew my mind when I first listened to them. They block outside noise and can handle bass with ease. I haven't even heard them distort yet. These are a GO. The best thing next to the sound on these is the range. I can leave my phone at the wall of the gym and move around the whole gym without going out of range and getting distortion. The only problem I have with this headphone is the voice prompt is not in English."
683,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these yesterday and was very excited to get them. They charged quickly and easily paired to my iPhone and iPad. The noise cancelling is very good however the sound is average at best. It wouldn't be problem if I didn't have a pair of Bose headphones already. There simply is no comparison. I plan on keeping these for when I travel, but for everyday I am sticking to my Bose."
684,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am really amazed with the sound quality of this headphone. I mainly use it during my workout because it is sweat resistant and also very comfortable. Very loud sound that blocks outside noise.
685,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave these two stars because I absolutely loved then when I first got them. I have a very active, heavy lifting job with moving belts, so no having the extra wire was great, since they couldn't get caught or dragged. They fit will, stayed in my ears, and sounded nice, and lasted about 8-10 hours. However, I recieved these as a late Christmas gift, and by January 18th, they had already stopped working. Very disappointed, considering how much I loved them to begin with."
686,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't like the pairing, you basically have to have the headphones completely powered off, then hold the power button and keep holding it while it turns on and pairs. If you already have the earphones on, then want to pair after, you have to first turn them off. kind of annoying, but range is good. they hang lower than other wireless headphones."
687,3.0 out of 5 stars,Charge doesn't last long enough
688,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great, but the battery life is amongst the worst I've experienced. It only stays alive for about 1.5 hours fully charged if used for phone calls, and 2.5 hours for music playback. I like the design but the battery is a huge downside."
689,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great. Super easy to link up to my Android and I've never had an issue with them. Good sound quality, blocks out pretty much all other noise. I don't use them for calls so I don't know how the quality would be for that but overall, I'm really happy with these."
690,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got these yesterday and I love them! I can dance around while doing chores, the sound quality is absolutely amazing, they're SO comfortable, and the packaging is very minimal. You can't go wrong! You can also get an extended warranty for free, however, if you want multiple, order them separately. I ordered two and it wouldn't let me register mine and his under the same tracking number. :/

UPDATE: My pair broke shortly after getting them.- a snapped wire. I informed customer service and attached a photo- they were very helpful, responded the same day, and I have my replacement less than a week later! I wish I could give them 10 stars."
691,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is soft and nice, easy to connect with my iPhone, just hold the power button for 10 seconds until the blue light turns to red, same to disconnect it. I really like the design of 3 buttons that I can power on and off, adjust volume, play/pause, forward/backtrack. Good deal."
692,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought these would last longer. Maybe I’m expecting too much. I got them at the end of September, by The beginning of November the sound was breaking up. I used them to listen to audio books, so not very loud and usually 5 days a week, 5-6 hours a day. I have another brand that worked for longer, paid about the same for both."
693,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and battery life, they look similar to other higher price ones. After 3 months my left ear bud blewout and started buzzing, email customer service after a few exchanges they sent me a new pair! I like the magnetic buds, I wish they could charge with usb-c. Im pretty hard on headphones and never get more than a year out of them I will buy again."
694,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use: At the Gym, playing music, lifting and cardio

Sound Quality: The sound volume and quality is great.

Battery Life: Sometimes I forget this thing has a rechargeable battery, I work out for weeks (1-2 hour sessions 4-5 times a week), and don't need to recharge this bad boy.

Comfort: Feels great, better than some of the other """"work-out"""" headphones out there. The hook wraps around the outside of your ear, very comfortably and not too tight."
695,4.0 out of 5 stars,They work pretty good. The only thing is that the ear buds don't fit in my ear comfortably. I have even tried the smallest size and they still don't fit just right. They will tend to fall out and I have to constantly keep pushing them back in.
696,5.0 out of 5 stars,Only earphones I have ever tried that have stayed in my ear. These are great! They have a very long distance they can go. I would recommend!! I use these to both run and sit and watch shows on my tablet. They stay in my ears for both
697,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is pretty good for the price. Pretty easy to operate. My one complaint is the volume buttons are also the advance and repeat button for music. You have to hold down the button and the volume is changed before the advance or repeat button is activated. So you are either blowing your eardrums or can barely heart the song. As long as you are willing to use your device to change your song then it is a good product.
698,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, paired with my phone quickly and have good sound for the price"
699,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first pair of bluetooth headphones and I'm quite happy with them. Easy to use and a simple guide. I wish the""connected"" and ""disconnected"" voice wasn't quite so loud, but that's a minor complaint."
700,5.0 out of 5 stars,"so far they are great, no connection issues with iPhone 6s plus , sound as good as beatsx, the battery does leave some time to be desired, but at this price, you can't really be complaining compared to 125 dollars"
701,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best wireless headsets I have ever purchased! Long battery life, great quality, I use it all the one when I go running or going to the gym. The price is unbeatable!! Definitely recommend!"
702,2.0 out of 5 stars,Description says 10 hours playback on a charge. Not. I get less than 4 hours on a charge. My other dislike is the activity LED. It is on the same side as the buttons. The activity LED should be on the underside of the buttons as it is not easy to see the button side without taking off the harness.
703,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to see how long these would last (e.g. if it stands up to the 10 hr claim), but couldn't since these bluetooth headphones could not reliably or consistently stay connected to my smartphone (even after resetting headphones and bluetooth pairing). When these do occasionally work, they sound very muffled (e.g. a very muted/muffled high-end/treble response)."
704,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. I use them to workout all the time and I sweat alot. They have held up well over these past 3-4 months. They recharge quickly and last a long time. Really good sound quality and they stay put. I love that they're so light and I cant even feel that they're there. Basically they're good and cheap headphones for above average quality with good durability. Great everyday headphones. Connects super fast and decent range.
705,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Nice my go to headphones right now. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because the packaging is very cheap and the amount of replacement ear pieces is limited.
706,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have great performance for the price. I've not used them too much, but I've been impressed so far. They are easy to connect, fit well, sound good, and play for a while on a charge."
707,2.0 out of 5 stars,I would like to love this product but unfortunately it is too big for my ears. It hurts and slips out constantly. Also took a while to sync to my device initially.
708,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wear eyeglasses and these don’t pull or interfere with glasses. Also in winter can wear more easily with a wool hat.

And sound great for the price..."
709,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Otium X6 headphones are great for the price!!!! Better than BeatsX. I bought a pair of BeatsX before ordering Otium x6 from the daily deal. Otium has way better base and the mid-range seemed slightly better as well. The mic on the headphone is not great. So, best use may be to use them for listening to music. BeatsX has a better mic if you need the headphones for your cell."
710,1.0 out of 5 stars,"3.4.18. honestly, these headphones are pretty awesome, I had these headphones for about 1 month now and they are still great, only thing is the LED light that shows its charging isn't lighting up anymore but it does continue to charge. I'll write another post in a few months but for now, they are pretty awesome headphones.

3.7.18 okay so they won't charge anymore. I'm really Upset about this"
711,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is one of the best pair of wireless headphones that I’ve ever bought. The complaints are I wished they had a visual display of the battery life and you cant hear anything when you sweat onto the earbuds.
712,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound. Holds charge pretty well. Light. Does not interfere while working out or just driving. Sometimes I forget that it is even on.
713,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using this for the past 3 months mainly while walking or jogging. I do sweat a lot but it has worked without issues. There were probably one instance where the audio would break. The comfort has been good. Have to wear it with wings if you are running or jogging. Battery life is superb. I am not an audiophile but I like the sound from this. It can get loud. Extra 6 months warranty on registering the product is a bonus.
714,2.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is good on it but it keeps loosing connection with my cell phone after a couple of minutes.
715,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got mine in the mail today, first impressions were really good. UNTIL I paird them. I have a Galaxy S8 and I have not gotten through one song without them cutting in and out multiple times. I was excited but I don't know if these will be a daily set of headphones if they continue to do this. When they work the way they should they sound above average forsure but the loss of connection prevent them from being more than a 3 star for me"
716,1.0 out of 5 stars,don't move while using the headphones because it will not work...
717,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these for my husband and he loves them. He uses them when doing yard work and he has no issues at all.
718,5.0 out of 5 stars,My old headphone was broken by my pet so I purchased this pair. The sound is good and it’s comfortable to wear.
719,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound isn't awesome or what you'd expect from wired high quality headphones, but it is good enough for working out. Battery life is as advertised or better which was a great surprise. I would recommend this product anytime."
720,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use these every time the landscapers are in the neighborhod... DAMN LEAFBLOWER AGGGGHHHH !!!
721,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been really impressed with these. The battery life is amazing, comfortable and stay in my ears."
722,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I tell you as is. Pro: wireless, pretty good battery life, it looks good. Con: it sound is like $10 headphones."
723,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pro: Amazing sound quality for the money. Good sound canceling, actually works and no distortion.
Con: The battery lasted less than a month. They died out of no where while using them, then wouldn’t charge. At all."
724,5.0 out of 5 stars,"this EarPod is very nice and easy to carry. The sound is clear and truly, also it fits my ear very well. Thus it is truly worse buying"
725,4.0 out of 5 stars,"good enough for ""books on tape"" type audio; not so much for the music lover"
726,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are good and they do cancel out the noise but they seem to grow week after a bit, i've had them for less than a month and the battery doesn't seem to last as long."
727,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was a little confusing to set it up to the phone but once i got it connected it was awsome. Battery lasts all day and the sound is great. Thats all i needed for these head phones. I will be ordering a new pair since my cats ate the wiring
728,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic sound for the price! The thicker bar that loops behind the neck keeps it balanced, which is nice when listening with only one earbud on. Only issue so far is the frequent and quick mute then have the volume fade in, and I'm not sure what is causing this. Other than that, great set of Bluetooth earphones."
729,5.0 out of 5 stars,"got this with good price, this is my second headphones, they are easy to use"

732,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m surprised at. How long the battery lasts on these. VERY SATISFIED
733,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my friend for Christmas and I know she's going to like them because I know someone who has a pair and they love them!
734,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had these for a few months and use alot. Work great, no issues."
735,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The neck part is stiff, I wasn't expecting that, but then again I didn't read the reviews. the return process was simple and stress free!"
736,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great buy. Doesnt fall out like other headphones I've tried. The sound quality was actually surprising as to how good it is. And the noise cancelling works well also. I work with loud tools in a shop, and this helps very much to hear music. Very happy with this purchase."
737,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for the price. I use them every day for hours and have no complaints at all. By far my favorite pair of Bluetooth headphones. Would buy these again in a minute.
738,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After the Bluetooth headset power on, the headset can not be searched, replaced several devices, are the same situation, is not damaged? Need to change a new one."
739,4.0 out of 5 stars,"cheap, but satisfied for what I paid just not great quality you know

no complaints"
740,4.0 out of 5 stars,Muffled sound. Pairing was easy. Not 5 stars worthy. Stays in place while consistently moving head.
741,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd give it less if I could. Would not go into pairing mode, difficult to turn on & turn off. Waste of my time & money"
742,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good，my friend like it .

744,4.0 out of 5 stars,not bad
745,5.0 out of 5 stars,At first I didn't know how to pair them until I looked up reviews about it . I love them though they are loud and noise canceling and great for workout and last long. Very satisfied customer!
746,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve used many different bluetooth headphones and these are my favorite. Great price. Great quality. Would definitely purchase again.
747,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great. Recommended.
748,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They fit amazingly well. Jumping, running, walking! Great sound. Easy to pair and adjust volume. I bought a different pair of Otium with a ear piece that wasn't adjustable ... these are a million times better!!"
749,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best set of headphones that I've ever purchased and really enjoy the sound quality that it offers. I totally recommend buying this product!
750,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these wireless earphone for running loved the sound quality. They worked great and lasted well for the gym.
751,3.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good.
752,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones will never connect to phones Bluetooth, or if it does it wont stay connected. I dont recommend this product."
753,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable to wear and great sound quality
754,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, better than usual"
755,1.0 out of 5 stars,2.5 months after purchase won't take a charge anymore. The charge slot is very awkward and sometimes hard to get a good connection. Also the little cover that snaps over the charging slot broke off at about the 3rd or 4th charge
756,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are nice earbuds and very comfortable, however they do not allow you skip/replay music tracks - more specifically - audio books. Great if you mainly use them as a phone headset."
757,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use these at the gym primarily. They’re pretty great I just wish they had a mic for the phone so I could be hands free entirely. Sound quality is pretty good too.
758,3.0 out of 5 stars,The connection is pretty spotty for me. Just having my hand over my phone inside the front pocket of my hoodie is enough to make the sound stutter. For the price though it's not too bad.
759,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought them for my son - he loves them ... now he can't here me at all!
760,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd like to give products 4 stars but mine have a bad connection issues while on body, ok sound, respectable bass feels like beats x on body at a fraction of the price but if you have connection issues everything is worthless"
761,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work great for the price. Sound is as expected for price.
762,5.0 out of 5 stars,Connected easily to my phone and iPad. Great sound quality. Would totally recommend!
763,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing set of head phones. Set up is extremely easy. Sound quality has been great and even on a windy day I can answer the phone and talk with no problems.
764,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad ear buds for the price. I thought they would be louder. I could still hear some noises around me when working out.
765,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Received the item today..Very disappointed as the volume down button is not working..Except this,the product is really good in all the aspects we checked..going to place a return"
766,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great packaging, easy to understand instructions. Good sound quality for purchase price. Excellent value."
767,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved these! There is perfect
Sound quality and greatly made."
768,1.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones won’t even go into pairing mode. I literally can’t even use them. All the instructions say is to keep pressing the mf button until the lights flash.
769,4.0 out of 5 stars,very good
770,4.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life is great. Lasted me a day & a half at work (roughly 11 hours) on a single full charge.
771,1.0 out of 5 stars,Love them and such a great price!.. EDITING 3months later.. because that’s how long they lasted!! Super disappointed.. I loved them while they worked. 😩😡
772,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After roughly 30 uses the headphones no longer will take a charge. They'll turn on and off if connected to a power supply, but immediately shut off when disconnected."
773,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If I could give it zero stars, It would be appropriate. The people who got their headphones to pair need to consider themselves lucky. The instruction's were completely wrong. It tells you to ""continuously press the MK button until it turns on"" when in reality you hold the MK( Middle Button). As a customer myself, I told myself that the bed reviews were wrong. I asked myself why there were so many good reviews if the product was so bad. As a naïve customer, I wasted $18 on a product that cannot be used. I am in the process of returning this faulty product to receive the money they is rightfully mine. I realized for the first time in my life, A product is only as good as it's worst review. Trust me, It's a terrible product."
774,1.0 out of 5 stars,Two months after buying them a wire poked through the cord. The lowest setting of volume is still too loud.
775,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy! Worked for three weeks then stopped. Sent them back and got a refund. If you’re looking for wireless headphones just invest in some quality ones.
776,5.0 out of 5 stars,good!
777,1.0 out of 5 stars,No matter what we do none of our phones will connect. It does not show up on the Bluetooth options.
778,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good just got them
779,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones don’t work at all. Either the headphones I received are defective, or this product is incompatible with Samsung and IPhone devices."
780,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a big change from wired ear buds! I can move around without dragging my phone around. My hair is long enough to cover one end and I tuck the other end in my blouse. No one knows that I'm listening to music or watching my favorite show! The sound is clear and buds are comfortable in my ear. I will never go back to wired again.
781,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a very good deal. the shipping is fast. the product is designed for sporting use.

I enjoy wearing it for my work out.

battery works well and last long. sound quality is good."
782,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product so far, been using several days with Moto G5 plus. Perhaps not as much bass as some of my other bluetooth but still excellent overall, clean sound for my ears and very good mike as I use this when I drive or walk to talk on phone. This is better than my other light headsets for overall use to listen and talk. Can't comment yet on total battery life but working great for my use. Very light to wear, I like the magnets to keep earbuds together. No it doesn't fold up or retract but that's inherent in design, knew when I bought it so it's not a downgrade, just part of the design. I'm very satisfied
12/5/17 not working on phone calls, had since August, should be still under warranty, will see how vendor responds."
783,5.0 out of 5 stars,Had a single ear blue tooth headphone before but itis so easily get lost in my pocket and it hurts if you wear for too long time. With this one I can wear it all day. No worry to find it anymore.
784,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Received these yesterday and happy with the sound quality. The built-in mic works well enough for calls; the other party says they can hear me well. However, there is no feedback of my own voice through the ear plugs as I am talking. This is really annoying and distracting as my own voice sounds distant and muffled to me during a conversation even though the other party hears me fine. As such, I wouldn’t recommend them if you intend to use them often for conversations. They do sound pretty good if all you want to use them for is listening to music, books, videos, etc., with the convenience of answering an infrequent phone call.
Hope this helps the next buyer."
785,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing battery life, connects perfectly, good noise-blocking and sound. I actually like these more than the much more expensive Airpods because of the better battery life and not having to worry about losing them. I use them for white noise to sleep and it does the trick (and I don’t have to worry about choking in my sleep due to wires)."
786,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Paired up to my iPhone 6 instantly and gives me the freedom of moving around without the cord of traditional buds. They fit snugly in my ears and stay that way through my treadmill runs. They do not shake loose or slip out from sweat. And, the biggest bonus is the clear and precise sound quality, great sound from a super affordable set of buds. Highly recommend."
787,5.0 out of 5 stars,So I decided it was time to take the plunge and go with digital music instead of my CD's. I know its about time! So I wanted wireless headphones I can use with my phone and iPad. I made the right choice! These are comfortable and easy to recharge. They are simple to use and I like how the magnets turn them into a necklace when I am not using them. No lost headphones or dangling cords. Perfect for me.
788,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for my mom and she really likes them! Worth spending another $10 more than the cheaper bluetooth headphones, quality is a lot better and more durable, and the magnets are nice as well."
789,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Battery life was great, 8+ hours of continuous play. Noise blocking was excellent. Hold in ears well. I use for white noise as I sleep because there is always house noises present. Controls and setup are easy. Back neck band is more rigid than parts to ears. While using it I found the neck strap to be kind of annoying, since not I having it I kind of miss it. All Bluetooth headphones that I have used for sleeping in do not last that long, lots of pulling on the cords as I toss and turn. These held up better than most."
790,3.0 out of 5 stars,okay. not great not bad.
791,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones lose connection when you get outside of 10ft from your device. After a few weeks, they will not connect to my phone."
792,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones worked great for the first month and then after that the headphones doesn't turn on.
793,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after 12 days
794,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad headphones at all. Sound quality isn’t great, decent bass. But they hold up well and they’re very comfortable."
795,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound! Very light and comfortable
796,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible, absolutely horrible. I bought these so I could do my Yoga and Workout easily without disturbing my partner. Every movement sends the sound into a flurry of distorted noises that sound like an old arcade game. I thought it was my bluetooth device in my computer, so I paired it with my phone. Worked FINE!.....until I went for a walk, again just having the phone in my pocket while listening to music sends it into distorted and jarring noises. I can't even use them, they were a horrible purchase and I am CONVINCED most of these positive reviews are either bots, or planted there because honestly I have no idea how they could run around, clean the house, dance even with the headset on and it NOT devolve into chaos. I'm very unhappy,"
797,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good, use it for gym and it stays on while running, not allot of bass but perfect for me."
798,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Omg! They sound Great!! I Love Em, and the Bass, Good laaawd, Yaaassssssss Otium X6! 🎸🎹🎼🎶🎵📱📻"
799,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best seller,good quality,best sound. Thank you for discount. May be I will buy another one on other discount time. :)"
800,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality for these headphones are really good.
801,4.0 out of 5 stars,"blocks out sound, magnetic function is good. It's hard to store, as it's an awkward shape with no case."
802,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed. After all the good reviews I read I decided on these. Boy was that the wrong decision. They do not stay in even though they come with 3 earpiece sizes non work perfectly. I bought just to wear around the house and the fall out doing day to day chores, I couldn't imagine using them to work out with. My next big issue is the reception. They cut in and out dropping reception even after moving my phone to my front shirt pocket, only a few inches away. The sound quality is good when you can keep reception and keep the buds in. Sadly my hopes have been crushed, and my set is now in the junk drawer."
803,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my nephew as a birthday gift. He likes it so much when he got that.
804,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound and long battery life.
805,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice sound.
806,1.0 out of 5 stars,The product is damage from package. The left headphone stopped working almost immediately. I would like it replaced.
807,1.0 out of 5 stars,Can not connect with my phone after two months
808,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best sound but we'll worth what I paid for them.

816,1.0 out of 5 stars,the product earpiece was broke when i used them
817,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these headphones in September. First, they are not sweat-proof, connection is intermittent after 10 minutes of jogging. Also, they definitely do not hold their charge for anything close to 9 hours. I think they are made in China and do not respond to e mails. But, Amazon refunded my purchase. 5 stars for Amazon and none for Optum 6."
818,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My left earbud sounds great, unfortunately the right side does not work... I guess you get what you pay for"
819,1.0 out of 5 stars,"1 Star because while it worked for 3.5 workout sessions it sounded decent. Today during my 4th workout with it, it stopped working. Won’t turn on, and won’t even charge anymore. Back to using wired headphones until I find a decent pair of bt headphones."
820,1.0 out of 5 stars,Right earphone didn't work. Wouldn't recommend this product.
821,4.0 out of 5 stars,You can be a good distance away from your phone and it still sounds and plays great
822,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked well until it stopped charging after a month. 2nd pair I've been through. Frustrating.
823,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far I like it a lot very good for active use
824,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad a little break up with the music sometimes
825,1.0 out of 5 stars,Mine were delivered on the 29th of September and worked fine until today the 23rd of oct and now don’t even turn on. Would not recommend

828,1.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn't pair with iPhone or android. Crap product
829,1.0 out of 5 stars,I thought this would be a nice Bluetooth since my lg was crap. But this was no upgrade. I went across the hall while listening to music and it was losing connection. I made a call and was told it sounded like static in the background. Will be returning.

832,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the idea of Hans free and positing of machine to watch in bet.

Not happy cause our headboard is thicker then how much the opening to attach to head board. Also very hard to bend pole. I would not buy this again"
833,1.0 out of 5 stars,horrible
834,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have great quality sound and are very comfortable in my ears. There is no complicated buttons for operation. They have some bass which I like, and charge quickly. Definitely recommend!"
835,5.0 out of 5 stars,The lightest set of headphones I've had. Sometimes I forgot that anything was around my neck. The controls are easy to find and the buds magnetically claspe to each other when not in use. No delay when watching movies either.
836,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how comfortable these earbuds are in my ear, I hardly know they are there! (See picture) The sound is great, and affordable price, makes these earphones the ones to buy!! The hardest part is pairing the Bluetooth with my phone... not an issue with my earbuds, but user struggle! Lol"
837,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite ear buds yet. Bluetooth pairs easily and consistently. Sound is decent for buds. I especially like the around the neck loop to keep the phones with you and not lost somewhere. To top it off, the actual earbuds have magnets that clip them together making it nearly impossible to lose the phones no matter what you are doing."
838,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these recently. The sound quality is good, but they fade in and out when I connect them to my computer, even if it is sitting on my lap. Additionally, sound quality when walking and talking to someone using these headphones is really poor. My friend said it sounded like there was a constant buzzing in her ear. Note that it wasn't even that windy that day."
839,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was an awesome headset. The sound and features on these headphones are fantastic. GREAT SOUND and it was comfortable to wear the neckband and very lightweight.
840,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is really the best headset for the runners. Sound quality is very good, how to run will not fall and very comfortable. Battery volume can be used for a long time, charging very fast."
841,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great. I tried 6 different ones from best buy but this headset has been the best by far. A female voice says ""Power on. Pairing. Connected. & Power off"". I use them daily for 9 hours and if I don't turn them off on my breaks, approaching the 9 hrs a female voice says ""Battery Low"". I like to wear them around the house while cleaning. If I’m not using them I just take them out of my ears and they snap together because of magnets on the ear pieces. They are so comfortable I forget that I’m wearing them! They pair easily with my phone, iPhone. They're light and have the volume & power controls on the right side of the neckband."
842,5.0 out of 5 stars,"it's exactly the training companion i'm looking for. It's comfortable to wear and sound quality is good, except the sub-woofer. I'm wearing it everyday on the train and in the gym"
843,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent wireless headset I use on my train commute every day. Great battery life, terrific sound quality, automatically connects to my iPhone or Apple Watch as necessary. Magnetic ear buds keep it around my neck when not in use. Flexible collar rests comfortably about me. These have become my “go to” headphones."
0,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave this product 5 star when i purchased it cause i thought it was awesome tiny little thing.

But gave out too early, not even a MONTH.. The case doesnt charge the headset and only one head can be use but is dead already cause cant be charge.

Too bad. Had to buy different earphones (beats)..."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Paired with a Note 4.
First attempt to pair the phone failed to find them. I blame that on the phone because it's had a history, just like every Samsung phone I've had this century, of doing that so I turned them off then tried again. This time it found them and after what seemed like a year, finally paired BUT would play for a second, cut out for about 5 seconds, play a second, repeat. I unpaired them, turned off the earbuds, tried again. Within a second, success and they worked correctly.
Medium gels and ear clips (not sure what you call the wings) from the box sounded good, felt great, but no bass. I'm used to this with all in-ear buds so I did my usual change the gels to the large ones but kept the medium clips. Bass is incredible but highs are slightly muddy when using no EQ on the Power Amp music player.
Nose isolation is quite a bit, so much so I couldn't even hear the TV, family, grandchild, barking dogs and other usual noises in my world in the least. Once I turned on music the whole outside world was gone of noise. I definitely will not wear them both when driving as it reminded me of my days of mega way stereo days in my truck (I was one of those folks at a stop light that annoyed the crap out of everyone around}. But I digress
The left bud is the main one that controls everything, limited as the controls are. What I found was to decrease time from power on to listening to music or make a call was power up the left side then in the time it takes to switch what I'm paying attention to and power up the right, the left has connected to the phone, right side about a second later has connected to the left one and they're ready to go.
The only control on the units is power on/off by holding or tap left button to answer/end a call or in music tap either side opens up your voice prompt engine. This is easy to remember, as no clue tap this triple hold that to remember. It's also inconvenient when wanting to change tracks and/or volume without the music device within reach.
Battery life was about 2 hours on the first charge but sometimes lithium ion batteries will increase life between charges after about 3-7 charges by a discernible amount. Time will tell on this.
I didn't write much about the sound quality as that's a personal choice but I did find the medium gels to provide no bass (far too bright) to me and the large a slight bit too much bass (aka muddy) but voices were pretty natural on both.
Volume, again subjective, was plenty for me at just under middle on the phone, I actually prefer it just under that as a maximum when lightning for extended time.
Turn off either side and they both power off. I like that a lot. Powering up just the right one did nothing, this why I stated the left side has the main software and the right is slaved to it.
Since call clarity and all that stuff is also highly subjective I called the Plantronics test line (Google it as I'm not sure I'm allowed to post the actual phone number in a review) and recorded myself. My volume was plenty loud, their volume was loud but I could hear my low volume level television a little in the recording and my voice was very muddy, but understandable.
The fit, as I wrote above, is comfortable. Forget you're wearing them comfortable. They are feather light so they didn't move in the slightest as I tested them jumping up and down, shaking my head, etc. It's rare I find both comfort and no movement when moving around in earbuds. Now when I'm cutting grass and sweating profusely no more cord catching my neck and painfully yanking a bud out of my ear. They almost make me look forward to cutting my lawn on a hot humid day. Almost.
I'd thought briefly about similar buds by the same manufacturer as my phone but the price they wanted it was very brief. With the low asking price and only $3 for a Square Trade warranty extension (I deal with these folks at my job ,selling their product ,and they're easy to deal with and no hassle when trying to actually use the product) I took a shot and I'm glad I did."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say righ off the bat that these are awesome for the price. No, these are not reference audiophile earbuds and for $30 no one should expect them to be. I own a pair of jbird x3, for working out, which cost from $99 to $129 depending on where you buy them. I had to send them in for warranty and wanted something to wireless to use in the meantime so I got these. Wow. I was expecting them to sound like total garbage and was planning to return them once I got my X3s back. There is no way I'm returning these. Yes they are missing some features like volume and track control, but again you can't go wrong for $30 wireless stereo earbuds. I can confirm that they are true stereo as I tested them with some tracks that have crazy right and left channel separation.

Beware though. I would knock off one star as the call quality is horrendous compared to the music sound quality. I was listening to music and decided to place a call. The person on the other line answered. The sound switched over to the left earbud only. The sound was kind of muffled and staticky. Once I ended the call, the music stayed in the left one only and I had to turn the Bluetooth on my phone off and then back on. Once they reconnected all was good.

I didn't knock off the star for the call quality but the music sound quality is really good for the price."
3,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll start by saying that I honestly wanted to like these headphones. It's hard to find a solid set of wireless earbuds with decent sound quality and battery life even if you are willing to price up to Apple Airpod levels, so when I found these and I looked over the reviews and specs I was cautiously optimistic. On first glance they're slick looking and fit firmly and comfortably into your ear, and the charger/carrying case is conveniently sized and a great concept. And after charging them, a quick cycle through a variety of different musical genres left me pleasantly surprised by the actually-quite-decent sound quality (the deciding factor in giving them a 2 instead of a 1 star rating).
But the problems became apparent almost immediately. Though advertised as usable with one or both earbuds, only the left earbud actually connects to your device, while the right earbud appears to connect to the left earbud. As such, you can use either both pieces or just the left, but the right is effectively useless by itself (if you, as I do, prefer to have just the right earbud in, or if the left earbud dies). And the battery life is abysmal. I was skeptical when I couldn't find an estimated battery life anywhere in the product description, but shrugged it off when I saw words like ""extended"" and ""surprising"" in the reviews, thinking I would find myself with perhaps a 1 1/2 hour life for each earbud that I could charge with the case while using the other. This is sadly not the case. From full charge to unusable is -maybe- 45 minutes, and as I stated earlier, the right earbud is effectively useless by itself, so when the left one dies, you're out of luck for the two hours it takes to recharge. I make no assumptions about how effective the charging case battery is over time since I only bothered to fully charge the left earbud twice before becoming exasperated, but it was honestly underwhelming when I still had to pull out the regular headset after less than an hour.
I get that there's just not room to pack much battery into headphones this size, but given that this is such an obvious problem making one earbud completely dependant on the other seems like a massive design flaw. I really wanted these to work, but just came out feeling like I had bought a pair of headphones at a gas station."
4,3.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE:!!!

I returned these because the have terrible range and wont stay connected.( I wrote the review before using them extensively)

these headphones sound freaking amazing! and they fit in my ears perfectly. the box and packaging are terrible.. lol.. very cheap but the case and the earbuds themselves are great quality. the carrying case is the best of all the ones ive used. they fit in it so secure that they wont shake loose. this is really a steal for the price. my only issue is that it doesnt go loud enough for me. i am constantly turning it up. that may just be an issue with me because i like my music loud, but ive noticed none of the new earbuds out go very loud. My old QCY earbuds still are my fave cuz they bump!... These do seal out all the noise around it so maybe the extra volume isnt always needed. it will do an add on to this review after a couple days.

its also a really small carrying case. so well made. they are just a bit bigger than the buds itself. perfect for travel and charging."
5,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was super excited when I ordered these at a reasonable price. I followed the directions and they worked great the 1st time (about 2 hours usage). Then 3 days later I tried them and they would not connect to any devices. I charged them for an hour and per instructions the indicator went off signaling they were charged and I still was unable to connect to devices. Super bummed. Returning them. :(
6,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this pair of headphones on Amazon Prime Day when the price was at a low point and unfortunately have had issues with them charging since they arrived. I charged the case and the buds to full on arrival (film removed from buds as well) and the earbuds do not retain a full 2 hour charge as advertised.

I contacted the company and kindly requested a replacement unit and the response I received was ""We are sorry that we are unable to arrange a replacement for you because the price is for mistake at that time and these cause a lot of loss for us.""

They offered a refund for my price point, but I don't want the small refund, I want a pair of ear buds that work. They sound great when they're actually charged and I had no issues with dropping signal to either earbud, but if they only work for 20 minutes they aren't worth much."
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best TWS I have found so far! I have tried many many brands, IOUIOU(tried two different sets!), Parihy, Soundmoov, Losei, QCY, and so on. They all have the same characteristics: right ear cuts in and out, weak connection. They all have good sound quality but very weak signal. Very disturbing to use. This one surprises me as it is not the most expensive one but sounds great and maintains the connection. I wear it while I jogging in my neighborhood and there is not once an interruption. Easy to connect to cell phone. One thing some people may not like about it is the size of the ear buds is the comparable larger than those previous brands. I think this is also why it has strong signals. Battery is a bit short like 2 hours or so depending on how loud you listen to your music. When you buy a set of earbuds, you want to be able to listen to the music without distraction. So far, this is the best."
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I wasn’t sure how well these were going to work with all of the negative reviews. However, I don’t think it’s the excitement of getting a new toy! I have used these to listen to my music on my iPhone 6, and I was blown away! They sound amazing! The only thing I would say is if you have kids or someone else you take care of, make sure somebody else is home with you! These earbuds block ALL outside noise! I only had my volume up halfway and I snapped my fingers next to my ear & couldn’t hear it! I’m buying more of these for Christmas gifts! Absolutely amazing. Oh, they also come with a 1 yr. hassle free warranty & a free 6 month extended warranty! That’s crazy for the price! Love them! Glad I bought them for my early Christmas present! Haha"
9,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't figure these things out.. When I get them to work the, sound is great. However, I will charge them on the charger and then try to turn them on and it'll connect and 5 minutes later it'll warn me low battery. It also says you can use one while the other is on the charger. But the main earphone is the Left ear and if the left ear is dead I can NEVER get the right ear to connect. They do fit perfectly in your ear and I have been able to workout while wearing them without any problems. Just wish I could figure out how the pairing thing as its not easy to pair with your phone every single time."

12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just went for a run with them this morning, and I absolutely love these! They stayed in my ear very securely the entire time and didn't slide out from all of my sweat (and trust me, I sweat a good bit). The quality of the sound was great and I would say even better than the Apple earbud quality.
Pairing wasn't an issue at all and was actually way easier than I expected it to be.
The only VERY minor complaint I have is that they do protrude out from your ear some, and although this doesn't bother me a lot, I would like the outside to be just a little bit smaller just for the aesthetic. They still function great and look pretty good in my ears!
Very glad I bought these and amazing what you can get for the price!"

14,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The concept of these headphones is great- true wireless, charging case, etc. However, they fall short when actually used- I have 7 sets of bluetooth headphones I use for the gym, so I have a wide experience on fit, sound quality and ease of use. These fit very well and don't fall out, but the problem is that the sound output is very low, even with my phone AND the headphones turned up to max. The left bud is even worse than the right one, as it is maybe 20% quieter. I don't have this issue with any of my other heapldphones, so I can isolate the issue to the Otium ones. I love the fact they they come with a charging case, but it is very hit or miss when it decides to charge. I ended up with no music 2 of the last 3 times I took these to the gym after sitting in the case overnight, only to learn that they didn't charge.
Two stars- marginal for the price."

Where they are terrible is for taking phone calls. Every time i use them I get complaints from the other people on the conference call that I sound garbled so I have to go back to my handset. I had much better luck with other products from Ant and Plantronics."
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I really like these earbuds as they are truly wireless. Opening the case they came in is fairly easy and getting the earbuds out is also simple. Pairing the earbuds was much easier than expected and is a matter of pushing a button on each one. After placing them in your ear you will notice how well they block out surrounding sounds and they are comfortable to wear although it might take some getting used to. They fit nicely inside the ear and don't fall out or move too much.
The sound quality it's self is very good although for me the volume wasn't loud enough. I had to turn my ipod high while working out and all the way up when mowing the lawn. Charging these is super easy by simply plugging the cord into the back while the earbuds sit inside. Overall, I am super happy with these and recommend them to anyone listening to music."
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super easy to pair up with my phone and the sound is very good. Please note only one earbud per order... this earbud is very small but with a powerful sound. There are a couple unique features with this earphone such as being able to pair up with a second mobile phone, you can connect with both phones at the same time and answer calls from one another. You can answer calls, reject incoming calls and end calls including last number redial or hang up current call while receiving another call... You can play music and there's a pause button
This is a super compact little earbud, I can see it coming in handy when you really don't want someone to know you're using headphones... I know for me it might be handy for work purposes.
It came in a very cool little compact black and orange case and included a usb charger, 3 sizes of silicone ear tips and the earbud. The earbud is made to be worn on either the right or the left ear. So super cool little item and I can't wait to try it out more"
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best bluetooth headphones i have ever had. They are smaller than they look in the picture and stay in place while I workout. From weight lifting, treadmill, elliptical or biking they do not fall out. Battery life has lasted me a 3 hour bike ride. I love that the case is also a power bank capable of charging them about 3 more times before needing to be plugged in."
19,4.0 out of 5 stars,"1 - Literally garbage
2 - You can find better
3 - Solid, maybe during a sale
4 - Good purchase
5 - There is literally no better version of this

These headphones are good; great, even. I buy a lot of headphones of all varieties and these genuinely surprised me with their quality. If I could go fractional, I'd go higher than a 4, but there are a few things that keep them from being a 5 in my opinion.

Good:

*Great price
*The case they come in charges the headphones.
*The fit is excellent; both the inner-ear plug and the concha bowl flare are separately interchangeable, so these will fit any ear.
*Sound quality is very nice, even before any ""burn-in"". I wasn't expecting much from the low ranges, but they genuinely surprised me. I think the benefits of Bluetooth V4.2 shine through here.

Bad:

*The only functional button is in a bad place: right on the center. I didn't find it comfortable to push the headphones into my ear with the force it took to depress the button, so it practically removed the convenience of one-finger operation. I'd rather have seen the button on the top or bottom of the earpiece so that you could press it with a pinching action instead of a pressing. On the same subject, not much is done with the function button. I'd either like to have seen more buttons for more function, or more creative things done. I've had single-button headphones that have separate uses for a short press, a long press, a double short press, a triple short press, etc. These are just start/stop.
*With the largest earpieces attached, there are issues fitting the headphones into the case. Mine are such a tight fit, it inverts the plug every time I try to remove them, no matter how gently. The concerns this brings to mind are faster wear on the soft plug and getting it stuck in the case if I try to remove it too fast and the plug gets ripped off the headphone.

---

TL;DR: These are really nice, especially for the price. Minor issues you could easily overlook keep it from being five stars."
20,4.0 out of 5 stars,Came as a Christmas gift and worked perfectly.
21,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These wireless ear buds are actually quite amazing. I was worried they would stay put but they are made just the right size and fit my ears perfectly. I wasn't too sure what the correct placement was so I just kept adjusting them until they felt comfortable for me.

I'm thankful that the instructions were so clear because I would have never thought to turn on each ear without them. I love that you can listen with one ear at a time or both.

That makes things easy for me when I want to listen to music or take calls but also need to be able to hear what's going on around me or with the kids.

The volume was great for these earbuds. I think the best part of all is that you simply place them back in t he ir case and plug the case to the charger. That makes it a lot easier than trying to plug each bud in. The case also keeps it safe and protected if you are on the go or simply don't want to lose them. These are highly recommended."
22,1.0 out of 5 stars,Gonna return. Doesn't charge
23,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty loud. It really doesn't last a long time. Probably about 30 minutes the most

26,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These things are awesome for the price!!! Good sound, but not great. No regrets.."
27,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not waste your money. Short battery life, losses connection, does not prompt phone calls. It does stay in your ear comfortably."
28,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Sound but the answering the phone on the headset doesn't work. I don't know if its a defective headset or if they are made that way.
29,2.0 out of 5 stars,almost a month ago i bought this and one of the ear piece isnt working anymore

32,3.0 out of 5 stars,Stereo sound great. Phone volume poor even when phone turned all the way up.

Great buy."
35,1.0 out of 5 stars,"they sounded terrible. Had to return because the highs would rattle and crinkle, which caused physical discomfort."
36,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been extremely disappointed with this item. Does not hold a charge very long. I never know when it’s charged or not. I have used them less than I planned. No consistency.
I like their compact design."

40,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Man bought these on the eighteenth of September now only last not even an hr maybe 45 minutes at best, was actually pretty cool while it lasted; surprised how good the sound was. Random occurrence or daily event?"
41,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these head phones. Stay put even during a run. Wish battery would last longer. Battery ran out about an hour & a half into a run.
42,1.0 out of 5 stars,What a ripoff. They work once or twice and then the case just doesn't charge them. Do not buy.
43,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you plan on using them for like longer than an hour to an hour and a half, I’d look elsewhere. Mine haven’t made it past the 90 minute mark without running out of battery. I’m sending them back this week."
44,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound not loud enough for factory
45,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fits great in the ear. Extremely comfortable. Not very loud but the sound is good. Very bad battery.
46,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buds!!
47,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not that impressed with the sound
48,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Too bad the battery life of these headphones Don't last long at all, they are confortable but i have to keep charging after 2 hours of listening, had them for just 6 days and already sending them back"
49,1.0 out of 5 stars,I am now on my second pair of these headphones and they cannot hold a charge and last for a very short time (1 hour). They also don't connect to the bluetooth on my phone very well. Not a good product.
50,4.0 out of 5 stars,My prayer have been answered. I wanted a pair of true wireless headphone and I found them in these. They fit perfectly in my ear and the sound is very good. Perfect for working out!
51,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good earbuds. Very comfortable to wear. Only gripe is the battery life. Which last about an hour and a half. So you need to have it charging while not in use.
52,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound it’s not good, the battery life doesn’t go more than 1.5 hours if not less, people can’t hear you when you are on a call.
I do not recommend this headphone.
DO NOT BUY THEM!!!!!"
53,1.0 out of 5 stars,Both earbuds stopped working after the third use.
54,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these with the preconceived notion that I was not going to like them. My ears are pretty weirdly shaped, or at least that's the excuse I use. Earbuds never stay in my ears or they stay in and hurt. I expected nothing less from these. However, who can pass up on the chance of going for a run and not having wires bobbing around or big clunky sweaty headphones. Who knew that wireless headphones were what I have been missing my whole life? To start, I thought I was an IT tech and could pair them without using the manual. Nope, not I. Once I actually read the instructions I was paired and ready to go in no time. Sound quality was very good. I'm sure $200+ headphones would sound .01% better, but who needs to spend that money? They fit in my ears and never slipped out, not even during my run. It comes with multiple interchangeable ear pieces to find the perfect fit. On another positive note, the headphones muffled all of the environmental sounds around me. They come in a case that when docked they are charged through it with a micro usb plug in the back. So, now my goal is to make sure they are always kept in the case and not loose them! If that is the only flaw, I'll take it."
55,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sending back. Fully charged last for hr with volume low.
56,1.0 out of 5 stars,The left earbud stop working after the second use
57,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. Fit well in ear and don’t fall out. Worked great for a few weeks. The battery life is terrible. Only last for about 1 hr use. Now they don’t hold a charge at all.
58,2.0 out of 5 stars,lobat faster
59,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible.........does not stay charged
60,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These constantly die on me, the left one is always going out of sync, and whenever i set them to charge, they charge , stop, continue after 30 mins and then stops cold turkey"
61,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones quit the very first time I tried to use them, within about 5 minutes. I sent them back and got a refund."
62,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Besides the bad manufacturing and no bass, it makes it difficult to connect to your phone. Your better off saving a few more dollars for a better experience."
63,4.0 out of 5 stars,Need to have longer charge time
64,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this and a different set at the same time. These work as expected, no issues unlike the other company I bought."
65,2.0 out of 5 stars,The sound was good for the price the problem was you only have one time to charge it then the charging station doesn't work anymore
66,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's very good headphone. Better quality and price.
67,1.0 out of 5 stars,"garbage, battery dies after like hour and a half or quicker, music quality is garbage too, no bass and sounds like the 90s earplugs."
68,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really solid product. If you're on the fence about buying these, just do it, Great price and worked as advertised!!!!"
69,3.0 out of 5 stars,small hard to hear
70,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not buy these, connection constantly comes in and out and the battery life is horrendous."
71,1.0 out of 5 stars,"never worked properly. only one bud at a time would work, now one of the buds stopped working altogether."
72,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headset are very nice sound but Mic sucks, people can hardly hear you. I like the sound and great value."
73,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent and loving it. I mainly use it for working out.
74,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very low. Only one ear work when talking. Battery has very little talk time. This item is terrible
75,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Product came without charger, but in the manual it says supposed to have charger included."

83,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound great!! Synced to my i pod touch very easy!!
84,1.0 out of 5 stars,Audio out of sync on videos.
85,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They work great, I haven't had an issue, great choice"
86,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best sounding in ear headphone I ever had. Reduces noise, and it's absolutely silent in the background when listening to an audio book. Music play back is literally HD. However, I took off a star because it sounds atrocious for phone conversations and the other party barely can hear me, or not at all. The charging case is perfect to carry around the ear phones safely. They sit amazingly well in my ear, don't move, and create a barrier to external noise. Highly recommend for music and audio book use, but not for phone calls."
87,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, short battery life (2 hours)"
88,2.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working in 1 ear.
89,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's suck
90,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work great
91,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great and good sound
92,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say I'm really like it when I saw it at the first time. It's my first time using wireless earbuds, it turns out my decision is right. The charging case leaves a deep impression for me, and I really enjoy the great sound quality of the earbuds. What surprises me most is that I can share the earphones with my cousin. We go outside a lot and spend a lot of time taking subway. We won't be bored during that time. I'm really fortunate that I choose it."
93,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this headphones for one week, and it's great! Usually, I used it when I was driving or running, and it's so comfortable to wear. also, the charging carrying case is very portable. I like it!"
94,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the headphones, however the left holds a charge for 2 hours while the right only lasts about 20 minutes on a full charge. May not be worth the hassle of a return."
95,1.0 out of 5 stars,If you're hearing is even remotely good upon the first listen there is awful feedback. I have bought earbuds at the dollar store that were better then these.
96,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super good workmanship, sound quality is also very good, than my phone comes with headphones much better effect. Life is also very satisfied. very good."
97,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product won't hold a charge for more than three minuets only used twice
98,2.0 out of 5 stars,I received my package 10/10/17. Used BOTH earbuds till it was time to charge them. And MY CHARGER DIDN'T WORK. According to the manual. The red light supposed to come on and when it's changed. It shuts off. Well the red light comes on for ONLY 1 minute. No charge. I really hate wasting my money. And I highly recommend that NOBODY purchase this product.
99,3.0 out of 5 stars,It has an okay sound. BT pairing can be a pain at first.
100,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I saw these, liked the reviews and the sale price. I thought my wife would like. She used a few times. When I used them they sounded good, and I liked that there were no wires. Liked that I could use one and hear conversations with the open ear. I should have bought for myself. They would have been used more."
101,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's cheaper than iPhone 's bluetooth headphone ' very small and the voice so clearly! Love it
102,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These bluetooth wireless headphones are pretty convenient to use, since they don't need wire to work. I often wear them when I do exercise in the gym. These headphones are in high quality and easy to use. One set of headphone can automatically match up with the other one and it can also be used alone. Besides, they are good-looking! Recommend!"
103,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great. Love them
104,2.0 out of 5 stars,They only stay charged for 4 hours it is frustrating when it does not last the day.
105,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones work well and fit great. For being wireless headphones, these met my expectations. My only criticism is these buds needs more volume. I have to go full volume every time I listen."
106,1.0 out of 5 stars,No rating - did not keep
107,1.0 out of 5 stars,I give this 0 stars. Product doesn’t connect with iPhone 8. Waste of money!
108,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I enjoy it very much, this is my first wireless headset, the operation is very simple, and easy to carry and it sounds good, sounds great, and is used when doing sports, like it very much"
109,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great fit. Perfect addition too the running gear. No cords bouncing off your neck.
110,1.0 out of 5 stars,One earbud works and one earbud do not work. The sound is low. People say they can’t here me a lot.
111,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality is fine, battery life leaves a lot to be desired. You're getting 90 minutes tops on a full charge."
112,3.0 out of 5 stars,"2 hours of battery life at best so if you are looking for more battery life, chose something else."
113,5.0 out of 5 stars,These can not be beat for the price!!!!
114,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it
115,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exelent🤗👌👍
116,2.0 out of 5 stars,These are definitely bass heavy and lack any high range. Take one earpiece out and its almost as if the highs are random static tones. Midranges are tight. The major redeeming factor for these are the many earpieces and hooks. They fit great. I haven't had them long enough to review the battery lifespan but will update once I have a better idea.
117,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very tiny and music sounds ok for the price, but while on a call it's terrible, volume is very low and you can only hear through the left earbud, I bought this for use at work and to be able to make my daily phone calls and it's not going to work."
118,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great, but they don't last a really long time. No ""all-day"" use from them, but great for exercise."
119,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works fine, but ear piece is a little to big for my ears. If a little smaller they would be perfect"
120,5.0 out of 5 stars,I give my props to these head phones I love how there are no cords but j love how tough they are! I accidentally dropped one getting out of my car and I didn't realize I had until I couldn't find it well let me tell you this sucker lasted in the parking lot got wet from rain and being in the sun and it still worked!!! I found it today and it works like normal the only downside is they could last longer but then again I'm using them for hours straight not so the battery life is pretty good
121,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am glad that I made the finally decision to purchase theses pair of wireless earphones
It is very easy to pair to my samsung phone ,fit my ears very well,long battery ,I have been used it for 2 days now without charging it, the good thing about these earphones is it comes 2 ear buds and can be connect to 2 different device,I can connect one to my cell phone and the other to my I pod to listen music . it a great features.
Highly recommended."
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are so comfortable and have amazing sound! They even have a little charging/storage box that I can toss in my purse instead of them being dropped and lost in the bottom of my purse. You can wear one or both. Charge quickly. Have attachments to change out to make it more comfortable for your ear shape. I wore one in my left ear when I went walking with my son so I could still hear him and out surroundings. Definitely worth the money!
123,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality and connection and amazing. I had doubts reading the negativity and drawbacks, but I’ve never experienced a problem like that. The connect range was fantastic and it still works after 5 months. 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽"
124,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I probably should have returned these headphones. I found them awkward to use because they are so large, and it always felt as if they were about to fall out of my ears. Just to list the pros and cons:
Pros: bluetooth technology
cost
Cons: Too large for my ears (I'm female so maybe that impacts fit. 2 guys found the size ok)
Held a charge for less than 2 hours"
125,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to return first set because one earbud wouldn't hold a charge, so I was skeptical. Received the second set and they work perfectly. I wear them when I run. I have been caught in a couple really hard rains & they have given me perfect service. I have never used them for over around 90 minutes, but they have never lost charge while I have been using them. Sound quality is excellent and the design will not allow them to fall out of your ear."
126,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Edited: I received an email saying they will send me a replacement. I will update after it’s received.

I was really excited to get these because I listen to music every day at work. They never worked from the minute I took them out of the package. I tried to contact the seller and they didn’t respond to my inquiry after I replied to their first question. I’m returning them."
127,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This headset is very cool and nice bass to boot, also this one qualifies as Otmos Dolby compatible, just knowing that will already make you jump on this headset. The only reason it’s 4 stars is because the battery after charging don’t hold out for long max or 2 hours , enough for gym and one movie. But still a great buy!"
128,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing! Case is a charger. Battery lasts for a while. You can pair right left or both. Happy with my purchase.

Update: Used one of these headphones all day at work today. It only lasted about 2 hours. So, I switched it out for the other one and put the first one back in the charger. I need to have one ear open at work at all times. Switching off allowed me to use these all day. Good stuff!!"
129,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Summer - for me, this time of constant travel, flights. Therefore, it was important for me to choose the comfort and convenience for my ears headphones. These headphones are very comfortable and compact, and after charging they work long enough. They hold even very long flights or trips, always fit in any pocket and even easy to clean. I recommend this little pleasant find to everyone."
130,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second pair I've ordered in 1 week. The 1rst pair I sent back because the earphone's battery died and it will not take a charge. It lights up, shows its charging but then is still dead. The 2nd pair I ordered are going back today for the exact same reason. If they worked they would be nice because they fit the ear very well. An hour of listening time upon arrival and then they are dead and never work again just isn't going to cut it for $29..........a few days later, I'm in to edit my review........I've kept these earphones a few more days in hopes that I can figure out how to make them keep a charge longer than 15 minutes. Nope! They are truly just a set of earphones that can only be used for short minutes at a time between hours of charging. It's stunning that a product like this is even legal to advertise and sell in the USA. Garbage! Complete garbage!"
131,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad for the price.... looking signal when walking. Oh well!
132,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
- Super affordable.
- Come in their own case. I charged the case to charge these.
- Comes with quite a few silicone earbuds.
- Lightweight
- Cannot hear anyone around me when fully inserted. Almost sound proof.
- Can charge the case and that can charge the earphones. Works like a battery pack for these.

Cons:
- Slight distortion in the sound, gets more audible when volume is high.
- Feels a bit uncomfortable in the ear because of the design.
- No volume buttons.
- Charging lasts for 2 hours. I use one at a time, so thats 4 hours."
133,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are decent looking, and fit nicely for the gym, but the sound quality is poor. The bass is nice and the volume is loud without too much distortion, but there is an underlying static/scratch sound behind every song. I purchased two pairs and tried both to make sure it wasn't a defective set. Both operated the same way, underlying static. If you aren't picky about sound quality, these would be fine. I have an older set of BT headphones I was hoping to replace, but they still work and sound better than these."
134,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought this could be a good product to try but it has too many issues. The charging case is very sensitive. Sometimes it charges both, sometimes it only one piece. Seems like the left side is broke. Not very happy with this."
135,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor quality. Poor connectivity, they are very diificult to connect both at one time. Also they never would accept a charge; I left them plugged in for hours and hours; they never charged. I want my money back."

139,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice set of earbuds. This is my first set of true wireless earbuds and I'm very happy with the purchase. I only wish they would get a little louder but it's ok as is.
140,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones and from day one, they would not hold a charge more than five minutes without turning off. Very frustrating"
141,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I've now read some reviews on here and see some people have had these last for a full two hours. Well I guess they're the lucky ones bc fully charged these lasted much less than 2 hrs for me. Is there any real point having a pair of ear buds that last just over an hour? The answer is no.

update: after the 2nd use one earbud no longer holds any charge and does not function. I'm returning them, anyone else should stay away from them"

145,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to like the earbuds. Quality wise, the buds are solid, not flimsy plastic cheap feeling. But sound quality has much to be desired. The problems I have with the product is the loss of sync between the left and right earbuds when in my pant pocket not more than 4 ft away, and a slight drop in volume every 30 seconds in one earbud. I made sure it wasn't my phone's message alerts. I emailed support a few days ago about the issues and have not received a reply. These are going back."
146,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Look I know why you're here. You probably think apple AirPods are too expensive priced at $160 so you're looking for a cheap true wireless alternative. Stop what you're doing, take a big breath, and fork out the extra $$ and get yourself some nice quality AirPods. Anyways here is how I rate these :
Sound - 3/10
Battery - 4/10
Connectivity - 3/10
Comfort - 5/10

These suck. I've honestly tried cheap airplane earphones that sound better than these. Not to mention I can't get them to pair half the time.
Bottom line: skip these, by yourself the real deal. You'll thank me."
147,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very disappointed. First of all, the product is falsely advertised. It has no noise canceling technology, apart from the fact that the earpieces are so big that they block some of the noise. Aesthetically, the product does not look good, it is too big and stands out of the ear. Most importantly, the headphones are hard to pair, mostly due to the fact that the battery last very little, in my case less than 2 hours with full charge. This was a very bad deal. If you looking to buy noise canceling headphones to study you are better off buying some earbuds..."
148,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Fully charged, the earbud only lasts for two hours of continuous use. While I'm at work I only use one earbud (so that I can hear my coworkers), so I thought I'd switch to the right earbud while the left one was charging. Apparently only the left earbud does the Bluetooth pairing, so I have to wait and only use the left earbud at work.

Fits great in my small ears though!"
149,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Came Very Fast,
If you switch out the eartips for FOAM ear tips it won't fit the case, you have to force it in there.
Volume are Excellent quality, but it Maximum isn't too loud.
Have to power them both separately each time, and it could be better if it snugs your ear."
150,1.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones came pre charged. The battery life lasted 20 minutes. Followed charging instructions and turns out that it won’t charge. Had it charging for 24 plus hrs and the light just stayed red. Faulty product I suppose. Certainly should do more research next time. I got what I paid for!!
151,2.0 out of 5 stars,sound is sizzle. music sound doesn't hd sound. i don't like this sound.
152,1.0 out of 5 stars,I loved these headphones until the batteries ran down. They will not charge.
153,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh My God these are fantastic. not only do they fit better then any other ear piece I have, I actually forgot they were in my ear ,which is saying alot because I dont like things in my ears.They charge right in the box together so no need to buy something extra they are made fantastic they look sharp and expensive. the sound is clear and loud enough to hear. They hook to bluetooth very easy and are just a pleasure to own I recommend theses to all my friends and family you will too.FIVE STARS for the true wireless earbuds they are the best.you will be so incredibly happy with these you will want to do what I'm going to do and give them as gifts to everyone for every occasion. The sound quility is something you will not believe, you feel like you are at a concert with the b and right in front of you .I just can't say eno ugh about these earbuds .If you wear both they block all outside sound so all you hear is the music or book or phone call you listening to, Like I said these are the very best earbuds you will ever own with the sound quality better then bose, trust me you will love them as much as I do. I'M GIVING THEM FIVE STARS ONLY BECAUSE I CAN'T GIVE THEM MORE ,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU PURCHASE THEM YOU WON'T BE SORRY"
154,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are looking for something that is reliable and will last....I would definitely pass on these. I purchased a set and it worked great for a week then stopped charging. I reached out to the company and they promptly sent me a replacement in the mail. That set was decent for quite some time but just recently it took a dump on me. The earbuds do not hold charge. I've charged them for hours and only get about 20-30 minutes before they start beeping then shut off. The companies page claims they have a 1 year warranty on their products and that they get back to you in 24 hours but I have reached out twice now without a response. I held myself from making this review hoping they would reach out and make it right but they haven't and it doesn't seem like they will. I guess you get what you paid for with these. I am not sure how they got such good reviews (well I am sure considering most Amazon reviews are fake) If you want quality, spend some money. If you want throw aways, i'm sure there are other sets out there for the same price that last longer."
155,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am quite happy with these earphones !
Pros:
These earphones have no cords or anything which I like. I don't like the cord hanging off anywhere on me when I workout and these earphones enable me to do that
-super easy to install and connect to my phone
-they fit it my ears perfectly, not a lot of noise canceling earbuds fit my ears
- the volume can go up pretty high
- keeps the noise out
Cons:
Since there are no cords, i might lose these easily if I don't bring the box with me."
156,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been searching far and wide for a cost effective solution to running headphones. I will see that this mission began years ago when wireless headphones hadn't been invented yet. I used to hate running with ear buds. They would pop out and the cost would pull. I tried over the ear and behind the head and nothing fit the bill. Then I started looking at wireless headphones.

Now I should give a little background on how much I run and how often. I started out a year and a half ago wanting to run a 10k in 7:30 miles or faster. In July I began training and could only run maybe 1 mile at around 10:00 or so minutes. By thanksgiving I ran my 10k at 7:30 miles and now I am running much more. My hope this year is to run the 10k in less then 7:00 miles, but in addition I have added a lot of distance. I generally run around 20-25 miles a week and this year I will have run over 1,000 miles. I go on long runs that can be over two hours and as long as 15 miles. I only say that to give you some reference regarding my usage.

I would like to say that I don't care about the audio quality of the headphones within reason. I care about durability, fit, and functionality. The audio quality is just a bonus.

Little did I know that this would become a long and painful process. I will give you all my experience step by step in hopes of eliminating some of the pain and suffering that I endured flushing out all of my different options.

The very first set I tried were these Mpow headphones Mpow Swift Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Sport Headphones Sweatproof Running Gym Exercise Headsets-Nature Green. It turned out that they were a little bit bulky and heavy right around the ear. This weight isn't much of an issue under normal usage, but between the weight and the wire and thousands of running strides they would shake lose and fall out. FAIL!

Having had some stability issues I decided to try something just a little different Anear Bluetooth Headphones Stereo Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds for Sport Running Gym Exercise Sweatproof CVC 6.0 Noise-Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earphones Microphone Compatible with iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 5 5c 5s 4 and Android--Black & Green. This set was similar, but it had an extra piece that I had hoped would provide me some more stability in my ear. Unfortunately the little extra piece that is attached to the bud did absolutely nothing to increase the stability and they would also fall out while I was running. FAIL!

So then I looked around and found the next logical step forward TaoTronics Bluetooth Headphones Wireless In Ear Earbuds Sports Sweatproof Earphones with Built in Mic (Cordless 4.1, Secure Ear Hooks Design, 7 Hours Play Time). These would definitely stay in place and in fact they did. These gave me a false sense of success. I really liked these headphones, but over time I found the wire running behing my neck was a bit of an annoyance. That wasn't enough to drive me away from the headphones, but when they stopped charging I had no choice. I wanted to find the perfect headphone and not one that was just good enough. The constant bouncing of the wire, even though it came with a little clip, drove me to look for something better. FAIL!

I must admit that this set of headphones was just a bad idea on my partBluetooth Headphones RIVERSONG Sweatproof Wireless Stereo Earphones Noise Cancelling Headphone Headset with Mic for iPhone, Samsung Galaxy and Android Phones (Black). In retrospect the lessons I learned earlier should have told me these wouldn't work, but I guess something made me think the smaller earbuds would be lighter and might not shift around as much. Unfortunately these were a very fast FAIL! The wire with the charging port in a little pod along the length is never a good idea for running. The momentum your running stride provides this piece will yank the bud out faster then you could stop and catch it as it falls to the ground. FAIL!

Finally I decided that the wire was an issue and had to go. With that in mind I entered the world of truly wireless headphones SoundPEATS Wireless Earbuds, True Wireless Stereo Bluetooth 4.2 Headphones Cordless Earphones Sweatproof In-Ear Headset with Mic, Secure Fit for Sports. Down the rabbit hole I went into chinese manufacturers rebranding and fake reviews. I really liked these headphones until the right now stopped charging after about 2 months. I got a replacement set and the left one did the same. I think the sweat was just too much for them to handle. I will also say that I wasn't terribly pleased with the customer service from these folks. FAIL!

Now that I did have a wire between the headphones to worry about I felt like maybe smaller would be better Mpow True Wireless Earbuds, V4.1+EDR Bluetooth Headphones with Magnetic Charging Box, Mini Stereo Bluetooth Earpiece Hands Free Headset Sport Earbuds w/ Mic. I tried these, but they just didn't say in my ears very well. Additionally I struggles with some connection issues. If I turned my head from left to right I would intermittently lose connection between the two headphones. Being that I run on the street/sidewalk I needed to be able to turn my head so I decided I needed something with better connectivity. FAIL!

Now these are a little gem Cobble Pro True Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth V4.1 In-Ear Earphones, Mini Twins Headphone Headset with Mic & Charging Carrying Case, Noise Cancelling & Sweatproof for Apple iPhone X/8/7/8 Plus, White. I really like these heardphones. Now after about 3 months the right one became really quiet, but the customer service was great and they sent me a new set. They didn't even make me return the old ones. The next set worked well for a while and then I must have jossled the magnet inside the left ear piece because it wouldn't sit on the charger correctly anymore. In general though they worked really well. The biggest issue I had was the right earpiece not staying in place. In fact it become common for me to simply pull it out and put it in my pocket during a run. NOT Fail! ALMOST THERE!

The mission now become to find a headphone with the same capabilities as the Cobble Pro's, but with more stability. That's what led me to regress back to the behind the ear design True Wireless Earbuds, DAVIKERY Bluetooth V4.2 Headphones HD Stereo Sound IPX5 Sweat & Water Proof Earphones with Mic for Gym Running Workout 8 Hour Battery Noise Cancelling Headsets - Black. I will keep this simple. They were nice for about 2 weeks and then they straight up stopped working. I think the design of the battery in the ear hook simply provided too much opportunity for moisture to get into the earpiece and killed them. EPIC FAIL! One of the worst sets for sure.

Now I just needed to find a new set without the batteries in the earhook Bluetooth Headphones SMARTOMI Gee True Wireless Earbuds Sport Earphones In Ear with Mic Bluetooth 4.2 Sweatproof Noise Cancelling Cordless Headset Running Sport Gym Soft Earhooks (Upgraded Version). These fit the bill, but unfortunately had MASSIVE connection issues. I didn't even get out of the house before these ones went back in the box. The ear pieces couldn't consistently stay connected to each other with me walking around the house. I wasn't going to even try going for a run. EPIC FAIL!

Maybe I needed something a little more Sporty Wireless Earbuds, NEXGADGET True Wireless Bluetooth V4.2 Headphones Sweatproof Cordless Sport Earphones Twins Stereo Headset with Mic for iPhone iPad and Most Android Phones. Flat out I just couldn't get these to fit right. I don't know if it is the flexible/moldable ear hook, or what it was, but they would not stay in my ear. FAIL for me!

FINALLY, that led me to the promised land. Now I write this review with a heart full of hopes and dreams that I am finally at the end of my journey, but I will admit that I am cautiously optimistic. I have gone on a slow recovery run and also a fast 6:45 min/mile 4.7 mile run. Usually my faster runs include more jostling and are worse for stability and the longer runs are worse for moisture. I haven't gotten in a really good long run yet, but the design provide me hope that water will stay out of this better. The small hook piece that goes inside your ear does a tremendous job providing the additional stability needed. They are really secure in my ears, use standard sized ear pieces (unlike the Cobble Pros) and sound pretty good. I gave these 5 stars and I hope that they stay that way. I will update this review as I learn more."

158,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately, this product is not the best. Only one side will work even when trying to use for dual listening. Additionally, the noise reduction isn't working. I got constant complaints about the background noise or inability to hear me. Wished I could have returned!!!"
159,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just opened the box and within an hour one ear piece fell apart.

I charged them, changed the size of the airwings to fit my ear and listened to music for about 15 minutes. When I changed one of the air wings, the piece that goes into the ear fell off. I put it back on. I checked the other bud, and the ear insert was attached well. Then I put them back into their case for storage. I could not get the case to close. I took out one ear bud to look closer to see if I was putting it in the right way and see why the lid wouldn't close, and the entire insides came out. And I was gentle with them.

With only the one ear bud that was fine, I still cannot get the case to close or the receptors to line up for charging.

I'm so very disappointed. They seem to be great for everyone else. :("
160,2.0 out of 5 stars,"For the first couple off weeks I've loved using this headphones. I used them for running and when I was working out. However as of the third week after arrival, the headphones make a scratch sound every 30 seconds, like the speakers are blown out."
161,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nice product. I hated the fact only device worked on a call. yes -- it is kinda cool that you could stream the call to one device and music to another device but that isn't what I wanted. If you look at the manufacturers website -- they clear state that fact right off-- so kudos to their website. Amazon choose to bury that information into the specifications. That is why I returned it. If you are looking for that feature to only use one device -- it is a great product. But if you are like me, want both earpieces working on a call -- look for an another device.

I give the manufacturer and device an 5 star but I give Amazon a 1 start for burying that information."
162,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had these earbuds for two days but my initial impressions are very good. I ordered wireless earbuds from the startup Kanoa almost two years ago and they still haven't been produced and shipped to me so I wanted to get some inexpensive wireless earbuds specifically for the gym. For $30 these have been great. I'm not an audiophile but I am happy with the bass, the overall sound, and the ease of use.
I've read that most people get about two hours of play time with these which is more than enough for me since I go to the gym on my lunch hour and won't need more than 45 minutes at a time. Some of the other reviews seemed repetitive and not very well written so I wasn't sure if they were genuine but now that I have these earbuds I can honestly say I am happy with this product so far.
UPDATE: I've had a few more days to use these earbuds and I had to reduce my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because I experienced some connection issues when using this product while playing a solo round of golf. I was listening to music from a smartwatch which I wear on my right wrist (I'm left-handed). I was using a pull-cart while golfing and when I used my right hand to pull the cart my hand would trail behind me and the connection would fail. I ended up just pulling the cart with my left hand for the rest of the round and the connection issue was solved. I'm guessing the left earbud handles the pairing with my smartwatch, so it probably just disconnected when the watch and earbud got too far away from each other. Not a deal breaker, but notable."
163,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok...may be too early to tell, BUT....I have a pair of QCYs and right out of the box, these OTIUMS are easily TWICE the sound quality. Maybe my QCYs were knockoffs because I have had quirky issues with them. I am enjoying tunes right this moment on the OTIUM set and quality is really better. The price is also much better. Although they are bigger and they do have the little silicone ear hook on them, they are definitely a great product. I know these won't fall out of my ears like the QCYs. Don't get me wrong, I do like the QCYs, especially since they were the intro to my true wireless experience....but I think the OTIUMS just beat them out. Now, this is my first day and this review may be updated...hopefully only for the good!"
164,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like these headphones I use them when I go for my morning jog. they actually stay in my ear when im running and i don't have to be afraid of them falling out. I also like the charging station/case it comes with and don't have to worry about plugging a annoying wire into the headphone just pop them in the case and they start charging. Love these would recommend.
165,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for almost a week and I have found they they have good sound and I like the case that you charge them in. The cons are: I don't like that when you remove them from case the one on the right goes in the left ear and vice versa, very counter intuitive. I had to change out the earbud covers for the small ones, which was fine. And I had to take off the ear hooks, they seem to serve no purpose for my ears. Also, they do not keep a charge for an entire work day either, barely half a day. I start using them around mid-morning, turn them off for lunch and by 2:30 or 3:00, they are beeping because they need another charge. I guess I will have recharge during my lunch hour. I did not have to do that with my other bluetooth earbuds."
166,1.0 out of 5 stars,Really liked thiese while they lasted. Have had for about 6 weeks and they were easy to use and pretty good sound. Unfortunately the charging box doesn't work and I can no longer charge them. Super disappointed that they lasted for such a short period of time. Do not recommend unless you have back up headphone.
167,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was admittedly skeptical when I ordered these as I have traditionally been a name brand nerd. That being said these may have helped me turn a corner overall in that regard as I have absolutely nothing but praise for these earbuds. No issues connecting to myriad devices, great sound quality, outstanding durability (a full cycle through the washing machine and dryer), and most of all extremely comfortable! I have deleted bookmarks for buds from Sony, Samsung, and Beats at upwards of $200 because sans a back massage and a home cooked meal there is no way any of those warrant the premium price tag and would be hard pressed to win a Pepsi challenge straight up against these gems!"
168,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off I like the earbuds design and fit and they sound great, only problem is mine seem to only last 20min on a full charge. Update- company contacted me and sent me replacement they work perfectly"
169,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sound and fit from these earbuds. I bought these as a trial to see if I would like true wireless earbuds. These have convinced me that I do. Good ""noise canceling"". Not fond of the charging system. Earbuds won't charge when charger is plugged in so, you have to charge the charger first then place the earbuds in to charge them. If your earbuds are dead, and the charger is dead, it takes quite awhile to get the earbuds charged. The charger does not turn off after the earbuds are charged. This means that, if you place your dead earbuds in the fully charged charger to charge them, and you leave them in for an extended period, the charger goes dead. So, you can't store them in the charger beyond the charging time and expect to get more than 1 charge. Overall a good product just need to work on a couple things. I would not buy again but, if you are on the fence about getting true wireless earbuds, I feel these are a good initial buy because the price is right and you get very good sound."
170,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just go to the gym, first use the Bluetooth headset, began to think that wearing instability, no such situation was very stable, and the sound quality is also very good! Put it in a small box, charge it, and don't lose it!"
171,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are mostly pretty awesome. They fit in your ear perfectly and you can go 2-3 days before having to charge the case. It's nice that the buds light up so you for sure know they are charging.
But man the directions are super confusing. It took me a LONG time to figure it out. And I am still lost on some parts which is pretty frustrating. But otherwise very nice and a good deal!"
172,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great ear buds for bass lovers, good connection comfortable to wear didn't ever fall out of my ears the only con I would say would be Battery Life around 2 hours Of battery life. So if your willing to sacrifice good sound quality with good strong bass I would say these are the ones to get but if you need something that goes all day without having to sit and wait for it to charge up these aren't for you"
173,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these with plans to use them for a long overseas flight. I was excited on the first use because after years of disappoint from earbuds that wouldn't stay in my ears, they fit perfectly. The sound was OK but for the price, I didn't complain. The pairing process with my Android phone was a bit kludgy, but eventually I got that sorted out too. I found that I was able to get about 2 hours of use they needed a recharge. Then, after about 10 hours of total use, the right bud stopped working. The indicator light flashes, but it will no longer pair with my phone, ipad or Macbook."
174,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these. I use mine to listen to music while i walk. I use them when I am cleaning or cooking so I can jam out to my favorite music anytime and the best part is that they are truely wireless so no more finding mommy tied up with her earphones. lol plus they also qiet down when I get a notification sound or a call so I do not miss anything.

I am much happier with them now!"
179,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Difficult to tell if they are charged - tend to only use one at a time, so need to charge both when other is at full charge. Doesn't always reconnect as expected. Still hopeful that they'll be useful but not as user friendly as anticipated."

185,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing about these headphones blew me away. The headphones aren't that loud, the life of the headphones are horrible, and from my experience they very difficult to pair with my devices. These are my fourth pair of bluetooth headphones, but the main selling point of these are that they are truly wireless. The truly wireless part is the most convenient part of this product, but I don't find that giving up sound quality and battery life are a good trade off from a convenience factor. Overall, they aren't horrible but they are not that good either."
186,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent customer service!!!! Headphones have great sound and great connectivity! I had an issue with my charging case not charging the ear buds correctly and Otium sent out a replacement and were very helpful and courteous!!!

189,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow... I had very low expectations of affordable wireless earbuds. They can't do justice to my 80's super-bass music but for music I normally listen to they have great range and volume. I listen to music while biking and working out so falling out is a big worry of mine, but they came with ear pieces that are comfortable and I cannot shake my head hard enough to dislodge them. Haven't had a chance to test the battery life yet, but I already ordered another pair because I am already very impressed! The noise cancellation seems to work great too!"
190,1.0 out of 5 stars,Got two hours of the initial charge. Had to return them. I liked them for their fit and the sound was pretty good. Clearly a sub par design.

196,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a fan of this product. It was incredibly hard to pair both ear peices at the same time (usually only one would work and the other useless). Also, they do not hold a charge. I’m not sure if its a product defect or this is just how they are but i wish I could return."
197,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound Quality is Fantastic, i tested lot of below $50 and this one has best sound and super fit. I do high intensity exercise and they never fall.
only downside is it's very poor in calling. while on the call, only left ear piece will be active and you will need to scream for other person to hear you.
Sound quality for Calling is very bad. Hope they will release new version with fix.

200,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I like how it fits in the ear and the nice portable charging case but over all quality is pretty poor! The sound itself does not get very loud even on full blast, the earbuds charge rather quickly but donot hold a charge longer than 3/4 hour to an 1 hour on full blast. I can hear others while on talking but enryone states that i sound like im on the other side of the room and very muffled at times."

I got in touch with customer service but they said it wasn't their problem since i don't have an invoice number. I guess they don't know the concept of a gift. Another product for the dump. One star for one good ear piece. Like they told me sorry for the inconvenience.

206,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Music range is okay, sometimes seems flat or underpowered. But for the money, this is a very comfortable, light, easy to use (no issues pairing and simple on/off button) solution to the cord! You'll forget you have them in which is saying something! Callers have no complaints of being hard to hear on the other end of the phone. I'd buy them again and have recommended these to several others."
207,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I cant connect both earbuds at the same time, and the battrry doesnt last long, wouldn't buy again."
208,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality main issue is the battery life but I like to use one at a time so it works for me. I originally had pairing issues with the right headphone but I figured out that one shirt press pairs it with the other headphone but if you hold it longer it will pair Individually
209,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this at sale price hoping it would be at least decent. At $19.99 I expected average at best, but headphones were a total disappointment. On full charge they only lasted 40-45 minutes, only about halfway through my workout. Sound quality wasn’t good, not loud enough either. I sent them back after using twice."
210,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pro: cheap (inexpensive)
Fit in the ears are great and they do not fall out.

Cons: cheap (materials and quality)
No volume and music play controls (must be done on phone)
Sound is lacking bass and volume doesn't go very high.
Person on the other end of a call can barely hear me (mic does not pick up well)"
211,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Although they seemed great at first, they eventually would not hold a charge for more than a half-hour to an hour. Previously, they held a charge for 6-7 hours. Even if the base is charged, the ear plugs still don’t hold a charge. I would like to exchange them for another pair as the functionality and sound are great!"
212,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these to use with my new iPhone...and they are fantastic! Wonderful sound, and I have no problem having conversations with them. I also use them at the gym, no issues with them falling out of my ears, no matter what I do! Great buy!"
213,4.0 out of 5 stars,very nice and comfortable
214,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are amazing. So nice not getting headphone wire wrapped around machines when working out!
215,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wish they were better. Headphones sounds quality is OK but they barely stay charged long enough for a work out.
216,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like these a lot. They do the job well. The charging case is a touch bulky.
217,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was only able to charge it once when it arrived. After that, it won't charge anymore. Cheap product, would not recommend."
218,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just got them out of the box and they are amazing! The headphones are easy to pair and they are comfy while staying secure in my ear. Even tried out pairing just one and it works like a charm. I am very happy with my purchase!
219,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound. Be sure to remove plastic off back of each bud to charge fully initially.
220,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones! Sound is excellent and they last a long time on a single charge
221,1.0 out of 5 stars,product was defective. Right side would not charge.
222,2.0 out of 5 stars,Music sounded good and came through both ear pieces. Phone audio was entirely too low and only came through one ear piece even though both were used. Never could get them to automatically pair with my phone.
223,3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t like them very much !!!
224,5.0 out of 5 stars,My brother in law loved them
225,1.0 out of 5 stars,Garbage! Would give negative stars. They don't work separately. Don't charge correctly. Never had a full battery. People hear static when talking on phone. Will never purchase another otium product.
226,5.0 out of 5 stars,"""Good sound"" when playing music. Relatively loud stereo sound when playing music and movies .Very comfortable in ear with a good range of fittings .Really convenient charging/carrying case . The only thing I can say is alittle disappointing is the fact that u can only make calls from the left earpiece and when making calls it's not extremely loud based on my individual hearing opinion, which might effect some users who work around heavy machinery or loud noise. But other than that it's a great item for the price I'm definitely going to recommend these to friends and family who are looking for an affordable pair of quality wireless earbuds also they'd make an awesome affordable gift Thanks!!!!"
227,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Garbage. They don't charge after using the for two days. Sound is subpar, as well"
228,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seemed to be well made. Nephew was happy with them.
229,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always want a pair of true wireless earbuds with a charging case but can't afford the well known brands.
I find these on Amazon and liked what they looked. I read the reviews and decided to order these true wireless headphones..
These are exactly what I am looking for!! They are lightweight, comfortable and easy to travel with!!
The charging case charges quickly and easily fits in my bag.
These earbuds have a real low profile and actually look really amazing. Recommend!"
230,5.0 out of 5 stars,All I can say is it’s bad ass. I love to see a company put the customer before profit and put out a great product to compete with high end companies at a much better price. I can’t see anyone not living theses they are fantastic go ahead push the buy button you will be glad you did.
231,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these, I use them at night when I am going to bed and I want to listen to some relaxing music or do some meditation. these actually rally stay in my ears well even though there is no cord connecting them. I like that both ear buds charge at the same time. these ear buds really are a good product I am very happy with them."
232,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought 2 sets of the ear buds as gifts purchased early before I needed them because I had the money available. Now they've been wrapped and given and one set it is so hard to hear or be heard. Too much background noise comes through so other party can't hear you. Can't return and have to purchase another gift. Highly disappointed
233,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Otium T2 wireless sport stereo earphones is one of the best I have ever purchase and used. I have many sets of headphones but this set is my first wireless earphones and it come with a case that charges them when not in use. The sound quality for this earphones is totally amazing you even can hear the background noise. They are super easy to pair and one of most unique about this earphones is it can pair two devices at the same time ""each side earphone can be used separately"" . I would definitely recommend to anyone for the price where is at is a totally worth item to buy.
Anyone who see my review. Please give me opinion "" click helpful "" If not please leave a comment thank you"
234,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones don't have that much battery life as promised, they only last about an hour on a full charge and at medium volume, audio quality isn't that exciting either, I tried the three optional sizes and audio doesn't improve, I do like that they won't fall off my ears even on a long run but the short battery life is a disappointment, considering returning."
235,5.0 out of 5 stars,"these are the nice bluetooth headphones earbuds and I would definitely recommend them. I love it ，they charge in their carrying case. The sound quality on these is excellent and they do not distort, even at higher volumes. I love them!"
236,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pro: Great sound quality, and not obvious when I wear it. It also easy to pairing to my cell and computer.
Con: Power for each side is about 1.5 hours.

Generally, I still love this product due to great sound quality and invisibility. It super worth my money."
237,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight and compact, fits easily in pocket even inside of charging case. Case charging headphones is amazing and helps keep them charged a lot more than if they had to be plugged in. They fit comfortably for hours and come with multiple pieces you can use to fit different ear types. They have excellent noise cancelling quality. Ordered a second pair for my wife after receiving mine!"
238,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things are super-nice. They sync easily, they are very comfortable, and the build quality seems pretty good. For running, I like of course to have both in. I also like the ability to use either right or left alone listening to podcasts around house. Bluetooth 4.2 seems more stable than 4.1, and I haven't experienced the kind of cut-outs that I am used to with other wireless headphones. I've tried a number of bluetooth earbuds, and these are my favorites so far."
239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that I can take these earbuds on the road without having to worry they will run out of battery. The case is also a charging station, and can recharge it up to 3 times! And no wires! Perfect for my IPhone 7. High quality for a low price. Amazing"
240,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Sound, fits ok, battery life sucks 1 hr and a half probably, I have to connect manually on my phone every time that I use them."
241,2.0 out of 5 stars,I like these but the battery life doesn't last very long. And as you walk the audio doesnt sound very good.
242,4.0 out of 5 stars,Make sure the ear buds are in the correct ear lol. Decent sound quality.
243,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are awesome. It's easy to pair with my phone. Each earbud was small and come with different size earpieces and were black. As for the fit, these headphones do a well job, they don't seem tottering at all and they stay in place.They are really light and feel very comfortable to wear. Each piece can be paired alone as well !"
244,3.0 out of 5 stars,They have trouble connecting to each other
245,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones don’t have a long battery life 😐
246,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They were great the very first hour, they immediately discharged and left earphone stopped charging"
247,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product! Just what I needed
248,3.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work with just one as ad stayed
249,2.0 out of 5 stars,Good feel and sound but now I can't use them because the charger doesn't work
250,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to pair, the sound is decent. Battery life is short, and they don't work the best for phone calls."
251,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Item is cheaply made, does not hold charge to long."
252,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice and good sound. Battery doesn't last long
253,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Strong Bass, signal, and clear sound, very much worth the buy!"
254,5.0 out of 5 stars,It worths every penny of it. I like the single mode，which allows u to share music with friend. The battery lasts over 2 hrs. Stylish design and easy to carry and store.
255,1.0 out of 5 stars,not good. had to return these
256,4.0 out of 5 stars,great buy
257,1.0 out of 5 stars,don't work
258,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good price good sound
259,1.0 out of 5 stars,"One side won't connect (right ear piece), hard for callers to hear you."
260,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When these things are used correctly, they sound great! The charging case is awesome, and does give me 2-3 full charges before I need to recharge the case itself. That's plenty of time for a couple flights + time to the hotel, which is exactly what I wanted. They fit well, and it's nice that they include several different sized ear fitments. The sound quality is awesome, they fit snugly and safely, and I didn't notice any fatigue from wearing them for several hours.

On the down side, these things are finicky as heck when you're trying to juggle one or both of them. Despite instructions (which are mediocre at best) and comments here, you almost have to re-pair these to use one or the other, depending on the situation. Like you start with both paired and the music playing and then one starts to die (battery), so you drop that one back into the charger and just use one. But now it doesn't want to work by itself, so you have to pair it again. And then when the first one is charged again, you need to re-pair BOTH to get them to work in concert. It's frustrating and annoying, but somehow, it's still worth it. I hate having cords laying around, stuff hanging on my neck, etc., so the hassle of pairing and re-pairing is tolerable for now. Someday it won't be, and I'll jettison these, but for now, it's okay. My second gripe is battery life. I don't think I've managed to get three hours on either ear piece. Maybe two hours, or 2.5 hours max. I really wish they lasted longer. If they DID last longer, then the whole issue with pairing becomes somewhat moot, as I won't have to do it as often. If someone comes out with a pair of these with a six hour battery life, then I'm all in, and these are toast.

Oh, the case is a bear to open when the ear pieces are charging. Which I guess is good, because you don't want to lose them, but just note it takes a fingernail to pry that sucker open. Finally, when you consider the COST for these things, well, they just can't be beat!"
261,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, but the mic on the device is not that great."
262,3.0 out of 5 stars,"they came in a very great case, it just the sound wasn't loud enough for me"
263,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The microphone quality is so poor that it is not realistic to use as a headset for conversation. Sounds like the user is in a tin box down the hall.
Sound/speaker quality was OK though."
264,5.0 out of 5 stars,"1. I haven't ever been able to get earbuds to fit right. These fit perfectly out of the box. Comfortable, light, and seals out enough noise to make it feel like noise canceling.

2. These are hands down the BEST sounding, clearest, ACTUAL stereo, and deep bass headphones I've ever had, even Monster headphones aren't this good.

I love everything about these, and I haven't actually ever loved a headphone before. And they're actually wireless, no connector between the two of them. If you aren't sure, buy these. More expensive ones aren't needed."
265,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The price is more than reasonable. The case is super cool, it has a little battery and charges the headphones when its not plugged in. they are comfortable and stay in your ear. However, these do have some issues staying sync'd, especially in areas with a lot of interference causing electronics and crowded areas, these have zero low end, terrible battery life (about 2 hours). I wouldn't purchase these again, however I don't regret purchasing them the first time."
266,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I had bought a pair of these a long time ago. They are so worth the purchase. Hands free driving covered. Listening while cooking no problem. Listening to music while house cleaning cleaning was done faster.
267,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very surprised these worked as good as they do way cheap for the amount of sound and battery life. I go on 2hr runs with these they are very comfortable, no ache in my ears like some ear canal headphones. Very light very responsive."
268,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered this set of wireless headphones for my husband. He is very satisfied with this headphones so far. The sound quality is good. And it is very convenient to have wireless compared to wire headphone.
269,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones I use them when I commute in the morning and afternoon on the walk to and from the train. They will actually stay in my ear and i am not worried of them falling out. I also like the charging station/case it comes with and don't have to worry about plugging Directly into the headphone just put them in the case and they start charging. Wish on next generation they work on battery life. I have recommended these to family, friends and coworkers."
270,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was impressed with the concept and the charger, until I tried to open the charger cover to remove the units. I had to pry it open with a tool and it still will not open easy. The units do not seem to hold a pairing, as I have had to pair them several times. I use them for TV late at night, often they get out of sink and I get a delay between the two units. Will give them a try at the gym with my phone. I wish my hearing aids charged like these......"
271,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They are JUNK! I have used them 4 times and they stay ""working"" for 10 -15 min then says pairing lost. After pairing them once again they will work for 10-15 min. then they are done and back for a recharge.
Please don't waste your money like I did spend 10-20$ more and get a good pair!"
272,4.0 out of 5 stars,"2 things I don't like about it
1. When talking to someone via these earbuds, you kind of have to talk loud for the person to hear. Also that only 1 side works for calling, not both sides of the earbuds.
2. The sound is great, but it is not very loud. If you wanted to blast in your ear, it doesn't do that.

Otherwise, the earbuds are pretty good. They stay in my ear perfectly. They drown out all the sounds around me. Connecting to my phone is very easy."
273,5.0 out of 5 stars,This earphone is comfortable to wear smaller and have Bluetooth and the box can be charged and the sound quality very nice is perfect earphone thank u my man
274,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good headphones. You can use both left and right or just one of the earbuds. Very convenient case. Easy fit to my ears, didn't feel them at all, very lightweight. Good instructions and a lot of possibilities — read it carefully to use all the possibilities designed by a manufacturer.

Great value for that price."
275,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible product! I bought it in August and I only got to used it 2xs. This morning, as I was listening to music, the right piece just went out! I thought it went out of battery but nope! It went out forever!!! Waste of money. Horrible!"
276,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After charging fully I paired them up but they did not sustain the connection if I walked away more than 10 ft or moved my hand close to the earphones. They were not a good fit either. The right one would lose synch with the left one. Lastly, all the praise about its sound quality is unjustified"
277,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Returning this. People can't hear me very well, I tested several times and with different people. Also too big for my ears. I thought the other kind I bought before this was bad ... this is worse."
278,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice headphones, but batery life not so good, one hour, two hours maximum. Nice for calls and movies, bad for music. Wish could be stereo sound and a longer battery."
279,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The reason I bought it is due to the absence of wires and the price. Searched for same brand and the with wires are similar price. There is a lot of chemical smell, but I kept it aerated and it is better. Sound quality is good for the price."
280,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Firstly, I bought an Airpod for my wife. I have to admit that it is very cute and the sound quality is so amazing. But I think it isn’t worth the price. So I bought this cheap one online for myself. The earbuds work fantastic! The sound quality just the similar as the Airpod. They are super easy to connect to my phone and comfortable to wear. I gave them 5 stars."
281,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These wireless earbuds took a bit extra time to figure out for setting up and have only about one hour's worth of use time. They fit well in the ear and sound fine for audiobooks, though only okay for phone calls."
282,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it!Great product! High quality, easy to connect to my phone. I am very glad that I purchased it!"
283,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pair. Bass is great sound is good. 4 stars because the pairing with something is very slow and complicated, the button on the Bluetooth can only play or pause, should have added multitaps to skip and repeat, and battery is OK but considering the size it's to be expected."
284,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for several months. I wore them at work in my office for a week to try them out. The sound quality is great, but the battery only last about an hour in a half to 2 hours and takes longer to charge than you have listening time. I constantly had trouble pairing the ear buds to my S8. I haven't used this product in weeks, I feel like it was a waste of money."
285,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gift of husband, husband very like. The sound is clear and easy to carry."
286,5.0 out of 5 stars,"While these headphones lack the multiple buttons that others have, they excel at comfort, weight and noise cancellation. I wear these while mowing the grass and can barely hear the engine."
287,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was thinking about buying some Bluetooth headphones that were in the 200-300 dollar range. But I figured why not try out a cheaper pair first. These are awesome for the price; they fit well and sound great. I'm sure the battery lasts longer on the more expensive pairs but these are perfect for my hour workout sessions.
288,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is for my dad. He says he likes it very well, and the sound quality is good."
289,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm truly amazed at how great the sound quality is. I had purchased a 60 dollar one previously that ended in great disappointment. Also, I'm extremely picky with the sound frequency. I purchased this with no expectation since it was quite cheap, but wow. This product simply left me speechless. I will buy this again if it breaks."
290,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible.
It rarely lasts up to 2 hours. May be a dud or bad battery. It then began leaking an oilly substance that turned white after it dries."
291,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Connected with my cellphone steadly. Very compact design and can be easily charged in the box. Firmly attached to ear. Suitable for working out, driving, etc. Highly recommended!"
292,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING sound and very comfortable. I wear them at my desk and at the gym and love them in each place!
293,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had it for the past two months and have used it about 10 times. Now, here are the issues I have run into.
-The left earbud doesn't charge anymore.
-The charging base is supposed to hold 3 full charges, doesn't hold any charge.
One of the worst products that I have bought."
294,5.0 out of 5 stars,Working flawlessly. Now I can do my morning jog without wires dangling over my face.
295,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the idea of these headphones and they are comfortable. They work great when using them together. The biggest complaint I have is the charge does not last as long as I thought it would. I might get 2-3 hours from a full charge. When using them individually, I have a hard time getting the right one to connect."
296,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality out of these small head phones are magnificent. Fits great in the ears. Best headphones so far. I like them better then my beats my dre
297,5.0 out of 5 stars,they work good
298,1.0 out of 5 stars,The product information is miss leading. It states that the earbuds can be synced with 2 devices at the same time. That is only possible by syncing 1 bud to a device and the other to a different device. I have two different BT earbuds that are connected that I can sync with a S7 and iPod touch at the same time listening to the iPod and switching to the S7 for calls. That is not possible with the Otium.
299,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Garbage. Stopped charging after a few weeks with minimal usage. They were, however, very comfortable. It just sucks that they stopped charging."
300,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very pleased and super happy with wireless headphones. 1st the feeling and built are solid with premium quality...even the ear hook and ear cushion. 2nd the sound and bass are wow ...i tested with instrumental music, RB, and some eletric Tiesto. Overall, great price, quality, premium, and excellent sound. Recommended!"
301,1.0 out of 5 stars,"fit was great, sound was great while they worked and connected, was great for about a week. now all they do is cut in and out."
302,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast shipping. Easy setup, sounds good, and great price. Would give 5 stars if play time was lo nger, and had a button to control volume and skip songs. Still a good buy for the price"
303,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Bluetooth headset is very convenient,very cute.and listening to music to quality is also good. Great products!!"
304,3.0 out of 5 stars,The right side would not pair after about 3 or 4 uses. Unfortunately I had them just past the 30 day deadline for returns through amazon. I tried to contact the company to see if I could get a replacement and they have not contacted me back. The left side works fine and I really liked them. They were easy to use and the sound quality was really good.
305,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great, sound is excellent, they fit great. would recommend this"
306,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excelent relation between cost and quality. The design is good, it is not annoying, it actually doesn't bother you to have something in your ear. The only opportunity I see is the sound quality. It is good but hey they are not beats."
307,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Earplug sound quality is easy to use, connect bluetooth quickly, very like"
308,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy to set up. They stayed connected for my hour walk and they sound great. No problem with staying in my ears and are very comfortable.
309,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love it. It works fine. I wish it was smaller or less attractive in the ears
310,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work well. Not the most comfortable headphones.
311,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love them no wires pairs easy great sound. I like them so good I bought one for a gift for my friend.
312,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. Stay in ears when exercising. Very comfortable. Will but these again if they ever stop working
313,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound of these ear buds were great and they felt really comfortable in my ears (why I am giving these 2 stars and not one). But the left ear bud stopped putting out sound after 5 days of using them. The LED indicated it was connected, but there was no sound coming out. Really disappointed."
314,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great except the battery dies very quickly.
315,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about these except the battery life. I am getting 1 hour and 40 minutes per charge and it takes almost that long to charge them. They sound, fit and otherwise work well. If another generation comes out with MUCH better battery life I might purchase them again."
316,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like the product. It's a great buy.
317,2.0 out of 5 stars,Trouble with both staying synced and only 5 months and the charging base is no longer charging because of a defect on the plug
318,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sound and compatibility only downfall battery only last like an hour then need to recharge back again
319,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product didn't work as well as said to. They don't charge well. And when they finally do charge they only hold a charge for less then an hour.
320,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love them. They fit so nicely. At first I would wonder which one is left and right. Thanks to the little tiny mark L & R on the earbuds for indication. You wouldn't believe how comfortable it felt and easy to fit on. I could have them on the whole day. I have another brand that made my ears hurt and I could not wear them more than an hour. The sound quality is good and big for its size. The battery last longer than described and I like that it has options to use it one at a time or together. The carrying case looks good and it hold the wireless earbuds neatly. The charging is easy. Just plug the cable to the caring case for charging.
321,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had to return this. Awful.
322,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing! Returned 2 other products and this one is the BEST. It holds very well which is sometimes challenging for me and my ears. Sound quality is great/
323,4.0 out of 5 stars,Wasn't what i was looking for. Fit was a little odd for my ears.d

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these for workouts and yardwork, and can honestly say it gets the job done. They stay in my ear with no problems, and have great sound quality. I was actually amazed at how good everything sounded, they sound as good as my Klipsch S6i - which at the time of writing cost around $60. Pairing to my phone is a breeze, and I find that the battery lasts a very long time before needing to be recharged. The wire connecting the headphones is flat, which from my experience means that it is alot less prone to being tangled that ordinary headphones. All in all, I am happy with the purchase, and would not hesitate to buy another pair."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first pair of Bluetooth headphones. I really like that they speak when you turn them on and off. They were very easy to pair , and the connection seems solid.I did leave my phone on a table and walked around 20-30 fet away and still had music. The bass on these is not too deep but, my music did not have deep bass to it. I was able to use the earpiece that came installed and they were quite comfortable. I have worn them during some semi vigorous activity and they stayed in place with no problems."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Massachusetts is planning on going Handsfree for cell phones. So, I think these might be an alternative. When I saw them I thought what a great way for not losing the ear bud it's attached for both ears. Gonna have to read the laws on driving with head phones. Most states it's frowned upon. But, to use the tread mill or to go outside or the track for a walk it would really be a great idea. I can leave my phone in my car An set the blue tooth for the ear buds."
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable with three sets of replaceable ear plugs. Works great with my iPhone and Mac pro.
Like the control for volume and track. Hard cover case provides good protection and easy to carry."
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I mostly use these headphones for working out. Sound is excellent, Bluetooth is flawless - including call clarity the few times I've used it - and they seem to hold a charge for the stated 8-9 hours of continuous play. Save some $$$ and get these!

Update: These started acting odd - disconnecting from Bluetooth and then shutting down - after about a month of use. Seemed to happen most when working out, possibly a moisture issue as normal function returned after a day or two. Now, two months into use, they refuse to connect to my phone or other Bluetooth devices at all. I've contacted Otium about a replacement. Will update when I hear back."
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really nice headphone. It can active a music so well. I also like the appearance of this device！
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a compact Bluetooth in-ear headphone with cyber look design. It totally surprised me with its audio quality for small body at this such price. Comparing to my Bose QC 35, It definitely is not at the same sound quality level, but considering a fifteenth price, it will win."
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones, the signal is strong so that i can listen to music with no issues with my phone being across the room and had no issues with dropped signals. They have great balanced sound with nice but not overpowering bass and feel quite comfortable while wearing them. The design is nice and won't fall when moving so these are decent headphones for jogging. this is a great deal for 24$ as these have outperformed 60/70$ headphones in terms of quality. Good buy"
8,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for these headphones. After looking through many other headphones and their reviews, I chose to purchase this pair. It seemed like a great deal price to performance wise. The headphones had quality sound and were comfortable.

Now, fast forward to 3 months later. The headphones worked fine until one day at the gym. The right side of the headphones stopped working. The sound went in and out for a while until it immediately ceased to work. I put the headphones in a bowl of rice to see if it was due to sweat seeping in, but isn’t that why they’re IPX7? After a night in the grains, nothing changed. I thought these headphones were the one, but now I’m stuck with listening to only leftsided audio. I’m very disappointed.

Thank you for your time."
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had another cheap pair of wireless headphones but those blow those out of the water! I love the sound and how you can control your music from the ear piece. I don't have a problem with these slipping off or anything as they fit secure around my ears. I've been using these at the gym for about 2 months now & I really love them. Definitely recommend!
10,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are quite nice. The tips are very soft in the ear and fit comfortably. The hooks are a bit large for my ears, but they stay snugly on my head when I'm moving around. It was very easy to pair and the controls are pretty straightforward. Volume levels were good; they can get surprisingly loud if you want them to. The case is quite nice and feels very sturdy. Definitely a good thing to have when traveling. Plus it comes with a 1 year warranty which is really nice.

As for the sound, they have a strong bass emphasis similar to Beats headphones. I prefer a flatter EQ personally, but I was able to tweak the EQ in spotify and other apps to get a flatter response. If you like Beats then you'll definitely like these. Kick drums and bass are very forward in the mix and if you're listening to podcasts then the voices will be a bit more boomy than you may be used to. Again, adjust the EQ if you have that option and want a flatter sound."
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great set of headphones! I am really happy that I got them. They are very comfortable, and fit over my ears great. It also included extra buds, but these were great. They connected to my android phone really easy, and they came pretty well charged. They seem well made, and I foresee them lasting a long time!"
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,This si awesome. Sound quality is really good. I love bass and one of the factors for me when I buy a pair of headphone is if you can hear the bass or feel it. You can definitely hear and feel the bass a little. I literally got these therefore I'll do an updated review later when I test battery life etc. I work midnights and with the movements etc. of what I do when I work. I am confident that these will last a long time. So far a definently buy if your looking for headphones. I'll update this review tomorrow. If anything crazy happens with the headphones you'll know.
13,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for 6 weeks and they just stopped working. Of course, they broke 20 days after they couldn't be returned. They are an absolute rip off. Do not waste your money. Now I have to find a new set."
14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is so easy to use. Just turn on the earbud and the Bluetooth on your phone and connect. Sound quality is great, does not slip off the ears. The box also comes with three replicable earbuds, a charger, and a manual. Thumbs up!"
15,5.0 out of 5 stars," First of all, I have to commend the seller for extremely fast delivery. I am pleased with this aspect. The package came in perfect condition, and the set up for these earphones are so simple. I would say it took me no less than 3 mins to actually connect the bluetooth to my phone and use it immediately. They come in the cutest little carrying case, with a keychain hook that you can connect to your belt or keys or hydroflask for when you're at the gym. I listened to the quality and they are crisp and clear, and the bass filled my ears perfectly. There's also a mic on the earphones, so this is a way better deal than spending $200 on iPhone wireless earpods. It fits my ears well, and if my boyfriend wants to use it, he can switch out the ear padding to fit his ear size and vice versa. It's comfortable, so that's a huge reason I got these. Definitely recommend to those college students trying to save money on wireless earphones!"
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sleek and modern headphones fit snugly around my ears, and I can mold the plastic slightly in order to make them fit my ear better - which is nice. I really like the red color and feel that they stand out while I'm taking a walk or run.

The sound quality of these earbuds are nice, and I love that I can hook it up to my phone and use it around the house, or while I'm out. The cord is a really good material and feels soft and sleek to the touch. Charging these earbuds is pretty painless as well, and doesn't take a lot of time! They also come in a cool zipper container that protects them in my bag!I highly recommend these!"
17,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a late adopter when it comes to the wireless/blue tooth game. This is due mainly to the reports on battery life, and loss of signal while listening to music/podcasts etc., from personal sources and forums. The sound of this product is sufficient for most genres of music. This product seems to have an issue with really intricate metal, however it still sounds better than most in ear headphones. Your more mainstream genres such as Classical, Jazz, POP, Electro, Rock, Country, R&B, Hip Hop, et cetera sound great. I purchased these during a flash sale for 16.00 USD. Definitely worth your money. I will update when the battery life starts to dissipate so that future consumers will be made aware of the average product life."
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this as an ""Employee of the Month"" gift for my company. When I got it, I had to test it out, and I gotta say, it works very well. Charges fast, easy to install onto your device (I used my iPhone) and the sound quality is pretty good. It's no Bose or Sennheiser level of quality, but it'll hold it's own against a pair of Skullcandy earbuds. You're also not paying Bose level prices either - hence the gift idea. I figure 25 bucks a month is worth it if my productivity increases.

But now I'm considering keeping them and getting something else for a gift. We'll see."
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good Bluetooth headphones with one exception that almost made me return them. The bass, arghhh the base is way out of proportion. Please stop with the over emphasis on this one component of music, what is it with everyone jumping on the over use of bass in their music. Bass is one of many components that make music beautiful and it plays an important part yes but it is not the holy grail. At first I could barely make out the vocals and other instruments due to the extreme bass incorporated into this product. I was about to return them hoping to find a more balanced set of headphones. BUT then I remembered oh ya they make equalizers just for this very purpose. To fine tune the listening experience to your satisfaction. Since these will only ever be used (in my case) with a smartphone or iPAD this was a simple fix. Now my music is almost just how I want it. I’ll be tweaking the sound for a little longer until I get it just right. Don’t be afraid of equalizers if you have never used one. Don’t panic take a screenshot of the initial settings for reference and then just dive in and play with all the sliders, you will know when you have come close to your preferred setting, problem solved.

OK NOW THE GOOD! These feel really good on my earlobes and in my ears, just really comfortable. Even without music on these block what I think is a good amount of distracting noise. There are many Bluetooth headphones that are very similar to these but these had a slight style advantage over most that I came across. The price was reasonable and the construction feels very solid. The buttons are all in the right place and easy to identify. I like the silicone cord tightening piece, I don’t like things dangling near around my head very distracting and I inevitably get the cord caught on something and yank my headphones right out of my ears...aggravating. These are also very loud when set to the upper settings, I don’t advise it, seriously a bad idea and the music gets very distorted at the uppermost range. But I have to admit I do like the freedom to destroy my ears if I want too. Too much product nannying going on these days, I cry FREEDOM! Ok that’s a bit extreme but the point is made.

For the price I think these are hard to beat, I did a lot of researching because I am insane enough to drive myself loony comparing devices, options available, reviews and style within a price range that doesn’t send me into and obsessive compulsive spiral to keep them perfect.... believe me you don’t ever wanna know what that’s like.

To sum it up these are a very good choice in my opinion, only time will tell. You should certainly pay the $20 admission fee to try them out. Download a high rated free equalizer app that doesn’t demand permissions the app has absolutely no reasonable explanation for needing. Happy Listening 👂!"
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do need a headphone while working out. This one is.small and easy to carry. Quality of the sounds is good. Love wireless, it make our life easier."
21,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had no trouble pairing these to my iPhone and they work great! Sound is amazing, totally able to drown out my annoying coworkers and their terrible gossip. I even recommended them to my mother -in-law for her books on audio, and she too loves them."
22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are EXCELLENT. I have them and use them for my laptops, phone, etc. Not only are they for listening, but they are also to use on the cell phone as well to talk to , etc, which I did not know. A big bonus. They charge fast and the charge last a long time as well. EXCELLENT price for the product!"
23,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these amazing headphones! The package is very nice and comes with a super convenient zipper case to keep the headphones when you travel. The headphones are very light and fit perfectly on my ears. The sound quality is very good as bluetooth headphones. And it is very easy to pair up with my cell phone.
24,5.0 out of 5 stars,Greatest headphones for the price. Way better than expected and sounds great for price and better than some more expensive ones i’ved Own.
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This earphone is easy to operate, and in any noisy place, the sound quality is good, easy to carry, running or walking, any time, is worth having"
26,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome so far. The sound quality is very nice and the Bluetooth capability has been great. Only had them a couple weeks now but no issues so far. I walked about 15 feet away from my iPod at the gym and had no issue keeping connected. And the flexibility of the rubber ear grips make them easy to fit around my ears. My old, stiff headphones used to fall out of my ear but these don't move at all."
27,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality has distortion and subtle disruptions when playing music. I still don't understand why people have reviewed this product as 4/5 stars? I believe they are fake reviews. I do not encourage anyone to buy it!!!
28,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A very convenient and easy to use Bluetooth headset, the sound quality is very clear, and it will not be uncomfortable to wear."
29,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace my old Bose sport earbud because the cable was broken, so I decided to tried the wireless one this times. I tried it last nite when I went to the gym, no problem falling down when I was running and the noise cancelling to good too."
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones actually performed beyond my expectations. After a 4 hour workout they were still charged. I continued to use them at least 2 additional hours after l got home from my workout and they were still going strong. The battery lasts along time ,very comfortable. these are a great set of wireless headphones with very good sound quality."
31,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable to wear and the sound is great too! It fit my ear so well, and even when I’m running, it doesn’t bother me at all."
32,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to pair with my Note8. Sound quality was not good. I returned them. Also, the part that goes over the ears was too big and not adjustable."
33,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I only have them a week, and so far so good. Crisp sound and loud enough when walking , but when it's very windy, I can hear the wind too much. I will update the review at a later date.

34,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it.
35,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible!!

I have so many headsets... Well, here it is. the BEST EVER
Bass BIG
Allover sound Awesome.

HIGHLY Recomend"
36,5.0 out of 5 stars,it’s very good price for this kind of good quality sound product. easily connects to my phone without the wire. hands free. I don’t need to pick up my phone to answer the incoming call anymore.
37,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. Got these after the original ones were defective so I upgraded to these from the $4 cheaper ones. Use them everyday for my workout. Good sound. Hopefully they continue working well.
38,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work well. I can use it during jogging. Good
39,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I brought this for my husband. He use it when he goes to the gym. He likes it so much. It's light weight with good sounds quality. He said it also isolates the outside noice completely, so he can enjoy the music without turning on a high volume. Strongly recommend!"
40,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the bluetooth headphones. It's very comfortable and very convenient. Before I have it, I am always bothered by the ear plug dropped down from my ears. Now I don't need to worry about that at all. In addition, the sound qualify is very good, too. I enjoy to listen to music with my bluetooth headphones."
41,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I looked at a lot of different sets of bluetooth ear buds and landed on these. I can't speak to the longevity of this set since I've only used them a couple of times however I would be surprised if the more expensive models like Beats sounded better enough to warrant the near $150 extra. Phone calls could be a bit clearer but they perform as advertised. Easy to use controls, music is clear, links easy and stays linked."
42,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice quailty！ like it so much! Wireless is so convenient! And it works well with my Bluetooth! I like the color! Red and black! So cool!
43,4.0 out of 5 stars,super loud headphones i love that. the bass is crazy on these but the trade off seems to be that the highs are muffled but still totally worth it
44,2.0 out of 5 stars,I would save my money and purchase a little better brand. I thought this would serve my purpose but they do not last longer than an hour. I use them once and then turn them off. Next time expecting at least two uses before needing to be charged and they are dead....and at the gym...that really sucks when you aren't expecting it. The sound is decent though so that's why two stars.
45,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product has exceeded my expectations by far. They are light, but well-built, and audio quality is good. Bought 2 pairs thinking they would break easily die to wear, but have withstood the constant usage and rough handling. Excellent product."
46,4.0 out of 5 stars,Like the quality of head phone. The instruction is clear so I set up easily to enjoy my music. Another thing is the case is great for storage!
47,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a gift which I bought for my daughter. My daughter likes to have sports in the gym, and she also likes listening to music. With this headsets, she can enjoy the movement while listening to music at the same time. The headphones are simple to operate. The sound quality is very good. And this transport time of goods is soon, it only takes two days for me to get it."
48,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to wear while running, but they kept falling out of my ears. The ear wraps are worthless and serve no purpose. They look like they will grip around the ear, but they do nothing because the loops are way too large. I am returning these for something that wraps over the ear and snug around the back of the head."
49,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality. Stay in place and they're comfortable. Quick to connect. The loop part is a little big. I wish it was adjustable.
50,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quick to charge and holds charge for several hours. Sound is awesome and they are extremely comfortable. Comes with convenient carrying case and extra ear bud covers. Great price for quality product! Will certainly purchase again.
51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome, battery lasts a very long time, and the sound quality is as good or even better than Apple's earphones."
52,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, it’s been over a two weeks and they still work. Nothing is broken and the sound is clear."
53,2.0 out of 5 stars,"cheap, but they feel that way too. I can hear a noise when running like something rattling inside"
54,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably the best, cheap Bluetooth headphones out there. Wife likes them. Battery lasts for a while."
55,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an avid reader who enjoys listening to audiobooks to distract me from the daily drudgery of housework. Toting around devices with corded headphones/earbuds is a pain. Plus, not everyone wants to hear what I am listening to, so wireless is the way to go"
56,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my uncle,and he is a Uber driver, so he can use this pick up phone call or listen to the GPS which is keep quite inside the car. He loves it"
57,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a little bit of an audiophile and a gym junkie in the works. I do a lot of different workouts that include running/springs/HIIT/etc. These do an amazing job of staying in place and I have had zero issues with sound skipping. I actually was running lines today at the gym so I took my phone out of my pocket and put it on the ground and my signal never cut out, I was running between 5 - 35 feet away from my phone and it was crystal clear the whole time! The sound quality is also up there with some mid-level headphones I have owned. Not quite the quality of a Shure IEM, but much better than anything you can get at this price range and better than some I've had in the $30-$50 range. I've had them for around a month now and will update if anything changes, but these have been nothing short of awesome since day one. I also got four solid 1 - 1.5 hour workouts without needing to charge and actually never got a low battery signal even prior to charging."
58,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are better quality than I was expecting with them being pretty inexpensive. Mine came with a zippy case that wasn't mentioned in the description which is nice for storing them when not using.
59,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good, comfortable earhook will not let you lose it in strenuous exercise,"
60,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this bluetooth because I do need to listen to podcasts and need answering calls hand free throughout the day. (Not for workout) I have to agree that it is indeed a good headset, the quality is great. But it is not perfect. While your not listening to music or talking on the phone, it keeps playing a message saying your bluetooth is connected. Also, while I'm in a phone call it does disconnect at LEAST once and I have to turn it on again. The range is pretty great while listening to music. Unfortunately as I had read previously in other reviews it is a bit of a weird fit in your ears. I dont know why, I guess its common to have different ear sizes and etc, it just doesn't fit right and feels weird.. wish it had a better fit but still, it works great for the price. Would I purchase it again? Probably not, I would try a different one, maybe even stay with this brand but a different model would probably fit better."
61,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Wireless headphones has a powefull earplugs. It was very loud and clear and easy to use,also can be a gift for others."
62,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphone， very easy to use and very good for sporting. I will buy again!
63,1.0 out of 5 stars,Tried different songs and different genres of music just to make sure I’m getting this right but These do not sound good at all. The bass sounds like you’re listening to a blown out speaker will return
64,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones fit really well and have really good sound quality. I feel like I'm listening to the performer live. I highly recommend them.
65,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the 3rd pair I've bought because I love these, for me, for my man, everyone. They are great and you can't beat the price"
66,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The range is awesome. They're just the headphones I was looking for. great battery and they sound good. Till now I've bought 3 headphone, this one is the best."

72,5.0 out of 5 stars,It does not make uncomfortable to ears like normal earphones. I like it.

81,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, stay charged forever."
82,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these so I wasn't having to carry my cell phone around the gym while I worked out. I was wanting something that would allow me the freedom of not having a cord dangling and getting wrapped up around the equipment.
83,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. Convenient and status nicely on my ears while working
84,5.0 out of 5 stars,"love this set of bluetooth headphones. I have had a few Bluetooth headphone before, but this is the greatest quality one with lower price. The connection is excellent and the sound quality is perfect for me. recommend this to family and friends for sure."

98,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good headset. The battery last very long and the volume and bass on this is amazing for the price of the item.
99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a person who likes music and likes to relax and exercise. It was always inconvenient to listen to music in the past. Now that I have this great, Bluetooth headset is very convenient."

Great price..."
101,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A nice wireless headphone. Easy to use, I used it when I was running and it's deep-set in my ears. Always use it to listen to music and watch a movie. Nice sound comes out from this headphone. Best Bluetooth headphone to use."
102,4.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my bf in replace of his beats he had broken. He uses them everyday and enjoys them a lot. Although it is not the best in sound quality they are really good for the price and you can’t beat that.
103,4.0 out of 5 stars,good quality. Battery doesn't last very long
104,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn’t expecting much for the price. Sound quality is marginal, which is fine for running and working out. But the real problem is they kept falling out during just a warm up run pace."
105,5.0 out of 5 stars,I listened to them and he was right; the sound quality is amazing! When his first pair stopped working after a month the company gave me a brand-new pair and had excellent customer service. Thank you for solving the solution for us and providing excellent headphones!
106,5.0 out of 5 stars,I just got it and I can’t love it more. Sound is great and the best for running..
107,5.0 out of 5 stars,It has a nice package. It can connect to my iphone by Bluetooth fast. It is really good and it is cheap. I will buy one more for my girl friend，
108,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was my first pair of Bluetooth headphones. I use it nearly everyday now when i am running and driving. They are comfortable and real great value and quality.
109,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very good Bluetooth headphones. It can make me hear good music when I exercise. It's really great.
110,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great 👍 to workout in
111,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them. Haven't tested the battery life but fits is comfortable and sounds great. Great value considering I use them mainly outdoors on the go and don't have to panic if I misplace them as I might if I bought Beats headphones.
112,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In a small bag, looks cute!"
113,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great set of headphones! Awesome sound and so light. highly recommend these!
114,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is very good, the bass is better than good as long as the earbuds are properly inserted into the ear. They stay on my head all day in a busy office and during my home renovations. l have tried a few other brands and these are the winner so far."
115,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow!the Bluetooth ‘s price is soooo cheap!and surprise me,I just charge the battery several housr and last few days!and the design looks like smart"
116,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great bargain
117,5.0 out of 5 stars,worked great and easy to use.
118,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair of beats that died within a year of purchase, these are 1/4 the price and perform even better!"
119,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is pretty good, eight hours of play... Good buy"
120,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great so far. Got these to replace another set we got that was not working too good. These are great!

Edited: These are actually not good for having calls outdoors for example on the train, bus or just walking on the streets because it picks up all the noise and the person could hardly hear you but they hear all the background noises clearly. I also sent voice notes to my friend and she could not hear me, only the background noise then when I replayed them I couldn't hear me either.

This sucks because this is the second set of bluetooth headphones I got that are no good."
121,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Used this for about two months.

It's ok sound quality is what you expect for the price.

The problem is...today the buttons to increase volume and skip songs...the button is stuck, so now my earbuds are playing full blast and I can't skip songs.

Avoid the product."
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't found any earbuds that stay in my ears. These stay in my ears. The loop is painless and doesn't feel uncomfortable, and allows me total freedom while I listen to anything on my phone."
123,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just finished using these headphones on a four hour road trip. Amazing sound! Crisp and clear with just the right amount of bass. Still going strong at the end of my trip. Very comfortable to wear. Was easy to pair with my phone in just seconds. Come in a very handy carrying case with a nice carabiner you can clip to your pack. Also come with two other pairs of different sized ear buds, although the ones originally on the heaphones fit me perfectly. Compared to other Bluetooth headphones I looked at, these are a great value!"
124,5.0 out of 5 stars,This wireless head phone is very light. The ear plug is soft and doesn't not hurt the eardrum area even after long use time. I really like the base sound of it. The Bluetooth connection range just s great too. It doesn't disconnect even I am 10 feet away from my phone. Plus the battery last for a good eight hours. Totally worth it first every penny!
125,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having wireless plugs is so very nice. It's freeing from all the issues you have with cording up to a phone, or other electronic. They are comfortable for ear buds. They stay put when working out, which is a real plus. The over the ear hoops are soft enough not to annoy, or irritate the skin around your ear. They're well made, and come with a handy carrier you can throw in your gym bag or purse. They hold a charge, charge up pretty quickly, which I appreciate a lot. Would buy them again, if I needed to."
126,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Intermittent issues with the volume key(s) not working since unpacking them. I contacted the seller immediately, who asked for more information. I gave them more information and they said they would be in touch. It's been over a month now and no reply. It's not bad enough to return through amazon (though I imagine i'm past that deadline now anyways), but it's pretty annoying. If that issue were not present I'd probably give these a 4, they do work pretty well in the shower, and the sound quality is good though I'm no audiophile."
127,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't usually write reviews but I wanted to post a quick tip to those that don't want any brands or colors. I was able to black out these headphones by using a plain sharpie. Just go over the headphone brand and color. The sharpie will leave a glossy residue then just use your finger over the glossy residue and the resulting finish matches the flat black rubbery coating of these headphones. The blacked out finish seems to last since I've had the headphones. I also used some black ear buds I had from another headphone.

Overall, I would rate these headphones great. The sound is a bit bass heavy but the sound isolation is amazing as well as how light these are. The only negative I would say about these headphones is the button function. I wish the + and - button function were reversed as it's not intuitive. Another peeve is the voice that states the headphones are on or off. Otherwise, well worth the purchase."
128,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A few positives of this product include its easy Bluetooth setup with a cellular device, the sound is extremely clear and precise, and the noise cancellation works well. There is a volume adjustment feature on the headphones which contain one up volume button and one down volume button. The headphones are comfortable on my ears. I feel as if this set of headphones was well worth its price."
129,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, excellent bluetooth connectivity. I could put my phone on the kitchen counter while listening to music and I never had a problem! They are comfortable with a bunch of different size buds to try in your ear. It is also very easy to locate the volume buttons while wearing. Good battery life. All in all a smart buy for the money!"
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy setup. The price is super good given the quality of this earphone. I also like the case coming with it. I can hang it on my daily bag so the earphone won't get lost.
131,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great price, fantastic performance. These actually have some nice bass to them! Great sound, whether on a plane, cutting the grass, at the gym, etc. I will definitely get a second pair!"
132,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fit well but the headphones went in and out with my phone in my pocket. Same thing or completely out when more than 4 feet from my phone (ie phone on ground next to me). Tried with another phone too...Same problem.

137,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice light weight
138,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These do not fit people with smaller ears. The loop for the top of the ear is too big, and does not stay on the ear as a result. Someone make headphones for folks with smaller ears!!"

152,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great valued wireless sports ear buds! I bought these over the Black Friday Daily Deal sale. I did not expect much. Yet, am pleasantly surprised once I charged it and put them on. The default ear buds fit perfectly for me. They aren't noise cancelling, but because of the perfect fit, I feel enclosed and away from the grunting meatheads in the gym. It stays charged, for what seems forever (I charge it once a week. I use it 5 days a week for the gym). The range isnt all that great, but just keep your phone in your pocket, and you will be all good.

If you aren't brand specific on ear buds, but these. Excellent stuff."

229,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's worth the price, good bluetooth connection with other devices."
230,1.0 out of 5 stars,5 weeks and now will not hold charge. Bad.
231,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had quite a few different earbuds that I use for running and working out. These are the best ones I've ever had. They stay in place, have great sound quality, and I can move around without the bluetooth skipping or losing contact. I can even listen to my music while casting exercise videos to the TV. Holds a charge well over two hours of use. Very highly recommend to anyone that has an active lifestyle!"
232,2.0 out of 5 stars,"these work great on my phone - and thats it. They will not connect to my laptop, tablet, or PC (all Bluetooth compatible) Had for a few months and only tried pairing with my phone (until today), My PC will find the headphones but not pair with them (said it is a driver error) and my laptop cannot even find them when in discovery mode. After these two failures I unpaired it with my phone, repaired it and it works fine. This is a very limited product and I would not purchase again, very unhappy, no more Otium products for me"
233,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this set best! It connects to my phone spontaneously! ! Unlike my other Bluetooth devices, they would take a few seconds to find and connect. I finally can be hands free while cleaning the house or walking the dogs. I had the wired headphones from Samsung when I purchased my phone. The wire got caught and my phone got dragged out of my pocket and dropped on the ground so many times. Especially my kids, they complained that my phone was being too loud while they try to watch TV. Now, they can mind their own business and I have my own freedom listening to music however I want."
234,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price point you just can’t beat these. The sound is decent if not spectacular and the battery is long lasting. Several hours. If you want heavy bass etc these are not for you but if you want cheap pair that sounds solid then go for it
235,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for a Christmas gift and after about a month they stopped working, won’t charge. Disappointed as I bought a slightly more basic pair of this brand in June for myself and it’s still working after lots of use."
236,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After going through a couple bluetooth headphones ive finally found the one that ticks all the boxes at a fantastic price. These headphones do everything well. Great quality sound.(bass,treble, clarity) .solid build.....Comfortable on the ear. Awesome audio quality during phone calls. Good battery life. Dont look further and just buy these now. You wont regret it."
237,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This wireless earphone is good for people having an iphone7 or up, like me. You cannot use the regular earphone unless you have a convertor for iphone7 or up. With this wireless earphone, you don't need to care what connection iphone has. Also I usually listen to news at night while I charged my iphone, and I cannot do that with wired earphone. So this earphone is very handy for me. This sound quality is okay considering the price, and especially for people like me only use it for news. By the way, you can connect your iphone to the wireless headphone and apple watch in case you don't know."
238,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i have been using it for a while. it can be used for couple hours after fully charged. Not premium sound, obviously couldn't compare to JBL, Bose or Beats but hey, considering the price, I would still give it 5 stars. Very easy to pair with my phone. it works well so far. I would recommend you to buy this if you're looking for a fair price, Bluetooth headphones."
239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I need a better Bluetooth headphone, then that's it. I spend a lot of time on taking bus to go to college through Monday to Friday. After I got this Bluetooth headphone, I can spend time to listen to music and no longer feel bored."

271,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great.
272,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This sound quality is good, I like it very much"
273,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound but not as comfortable as I thought they would be.
274,1.0 out of 5 stars,Product sounds great as long as you keep the paired device within 6 inches. Any farther than that and the audio gets choppy and intermittently disconnects.
275,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love them
276,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality, phone feature works easily"
277,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth buying!

283,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product
284,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I expected
285,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for your bucks.
286,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them.
287,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect
288,5.0 out of 5 stars,Went to workout in these and they felt secure around my ears. The large power button is easy to find even in my bag and while running. Impressed by the sound quality too. Wasn't muffled and gave me a good amount of bass while not overpowering the music. The carrying case is a nice touch too.
289,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is worked properly for the first week but after that its not connecting properly and giving too much noise while talking and hearing the music. battery also draining too fast. probably I might got a defective piece but my experience is bad with this.
290,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked ok for 2 months and now they won’t connect to anything. I’ve tried 3 different devices and get the same result.
291,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very good for the price and I am incredibly happy with the product. They come in a small case that has a clip at the top that can fasten it to say a bike or even on a belt loop. They fit very nicely in my ear and haven't fallen off once, even during a workout. The sound quality is fantastic, especially the bass. These babies kick! Another fantastic aspect is the battery life, they last all day for me and more on a single charge! The only reason I have given it a four star review could possibly be own fault, but i can't seem to figure out how to pause/play using the headphones themselves. Other than that i LOVE these things and will probably buy another pair."
292,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now that I have this, I don't know if I can come back to wired headphones!!! They are so convenient to use - especially if you like riding bikes, going to the gym, or doing any other physical activities. They don't get in the way, are easy to charge. and are on sale most of the time."
293,1.0 out of 5 stars,The product worked well for the first month but now it doesn't turn on or sync up. I fell bad because I gave it a good review during that month to friends looking for a nice portable Bluetooth headset but I may have been hasty . Now I will have to buy a new headset but I won't be looking at otium audio.
294,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These bluetooth headphones are amazing, looks nice, well made, very comfortable. After charging, can work for a long time. Plus there are three different sizes of earbuds to fit different sizes of ears, very thoughtful."
295,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't work.waste of money.will cost too much to send them back.
296,5.0 out of 5 stars,Build quality and audio quality is great compare to my old over-priced Beats. Very easy to pair and comfortable to wear. Price is right. Come with cabon fiber carry case looks awesome. Highly recommended.

298,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Gave these as a Christmas gift... they lasted until the last week of January. They were great and then they just stopped working one morning. I guess I missed the fine print about them being disposable, hm?"
299,5.0 out of 5 stars,It has a better sound quality in comparing with the one my son has. I like that they provide a cute round bag for storage. Good for a gift for the kids.

305,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is fine but microphone position is very poor (just outside the right ear bud) - does not pick up my voice clearly while using the phone. I had to take it off my right ear and put it in front of my mouth for the mic to pick up. Every time I use the earpiece, they complain that they can't hear me."
306,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality. BUT... I’m not really a fan of the earbuds with the ear hooks. They never hook around ear properly and always slip out and feel uncomfortable, which greatly distracts from the quality of sound. I wasn’t completely satisfied."
307,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never used wireless headphone before, but I have to admit that I love it immediately when I tried it. The sound is quite clear. It worth the price."

312,5.0 out of 5 stars,This blue tooth set is easy to set up and use. It took me less than 3 minutes to set up and start using it. The battery lasts me almost a day with usage of music I play on my phone.
313,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphone works well and the Bluetooth is so easy to use. The mic and control on the earphone made it easy to use. love the ear hook it has, never falls."

318,4.0 out of 5 stars,Needs better adjustment for smaller eyes. Fits too loose on smaller ear which means its doesn't work for workouts.
319,5.0 out of 5 stars,This headphones is good for sport！when you run is hold you ear very well，you don't worry about water anything.
320,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's easy to connect with my phone by the bluetooth. The acoustic quality is pretty good. Reasonable price!
321,1.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived broken
322,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Delivered on time in great condition. First day with them, but so far they seem to be a great value with really good sound"
323,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, So Good. Last for the time being. Fit over my ear sound is fine. I use them for running and they are fine."
324,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a very good blustooth!
325,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe when you use this headphone, you will find the electricity down slow. Don’t care and charge everyday."
326,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound I like it
327,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It sounds very good, for the price is worth it."
328,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work like they say they would . Great sound and charge last all week!
329,5.0 out of 5 stars,The quality is very good！I like it very much.
330,4.0 out of 5 stars,Battery only 2-3 hours on a charge
331,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones for training. Not sure if they are supposed to be noise suppressing but I can’t hear anyone trying to talk to get my attention when I’m working out. Battery life lasts longer than my older pair which was only 3hrs. I sweat like crazy and I’ve had a few sets of headphones for because of moisture getting inside, have had these 3+ months and no issues. However, my phone shows the battery life of the otium beats and sometimes will die when read at half-battery. Only reason for 4 stars."
332,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Do NOT buy these for running. When I wear these running or if there is wind when I'm walking outside it's like listening to your car stereo with the windows down. When running you have to turn the volume way up to hear anything over the wooshing and whistling these make as air moves past them. If you don't plan to run or wear these outside, they are great, comfy, loud, sound good, last a long time, easy to use controls, the cord is stays out of the way even when working out etc, they look pretty good. Being picky but the over the ear peices are a bit big and tall, I don't think you can use these to give Siri commands while your iPhone is in your pocket, that is a feature my old Bluetooth headphones had. For the price these are amazing headphones as long as you don't run or experience any wind. These really seam to amplify any moving air."
333,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the worst headphones I’ve ever used. Out of the box the sound quality was TERRIBLE. At an average volume a regular song sounded like they were totally blown out when there was any sort of bass. Besides that, they didn’t fit great, the part that hooks over the ear was too big and couldn’t retract so it didn’t serve its purpose of keeping them on my ear. The main round button that controls just about every function is in the worst possible place because if you try to adjust them while you’re working out (you will have to because they fit so terribly) you inevitably hit the button every. single. time. Overall they were terrible and I returned them after the first use."
334,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very dissapointed as they don’t fit my kids ears and I need to return 2 pairs but the return date expired! I ordered them for Christmas and now can’t return them? Hopefully we can make it right somehow!
335,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know if I got a bad one or not. But every time I put my phone in The inside of my wool coat pocket. The Bluetooth keeps disconnecting! We're talking about a foot difference of distance. Then I have a problem , when I have for example my navigation program on or software I should say, it only gives me part of the beginning words every time it speaks. I'd like the idea that it's Bluetooth and fits well around my ears. It had so many good reviews I thought these were it. The options for music playing,stopping, answer phone calls is great. I think, I received a bad one or batch--is my only rational explanation aside from it being junk. Anyways, this is my experience. H"
336,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Connecting it via bluetooth was relatively easy. But I think the speakers are of low-quality. Bass is heavily muddled and sound as if speakers are cracked, even at low volume. I am using this with iPhone 7 and my Apple earphones sound far better than these. I tried to reset the connection as it looks like that was suggested to another buyer but still same problem. Bass sound similar to low-quality airplane headsets. A personal preference issue with this unit is that you have to hold down the up/down volume for 3 seconds to skip or reverse a track. This is fairly cumbersome when using the unit during runs.

Overall very disappointing but I guess you get what you pay for."
337,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice for the price, great range; however, don't try riding a bicycle with them on...they do not block noise at all...real bummer too."
338,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Seem to be well built and crafted. However, I just cannot sacrifice sound quality to this extent. My numerous pairs of wired earbuds produce much better fidelity. These bring a very muddied listening experience. Vocals such as podcasts are difficult to discern to the point of frustration even with bass reduction settings. Could be an acceptable, even good product for some, but for me the distortion was just too much. In the drawer they go for use in a pinch only. A disappointment."
339,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is really bad, waaaay too much bass, so much that even if you listen at a low volume it hurts your ears, and I love rock and rap.
BT connection gets jumpy if you put the phone in your pocket! I had to skate with the phone in my hand to listen to music without interruption.
I bought it and came to my country, so I won't be able to return it, I'm completely disappointed with this product."
340,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There is a lot that I like about these headphones and just a few that I don't.
They produce a nice loud quality sound, easy to connect, listen to music, answer calls but for my small head, the headphone earpiece does not fit as well as I'd hope for. They are fairly comfortable, I wore them for a few hours while doing housework and then went out into the yard and watered my plants. I did have to use the supplied headphone ""clip"" to shorten the length of the cable. I ended up putting my hair in a bun so that it didn't tug on the cord. I lose reception a few times but you can move about freely for quite a distance. If I had tried them on at the store, I probably wouldn't buy them because of the ear length piece but for someone with a larger head, perhaps they would be great for a man."
341,5.0 out of 5 stars,I only used for a week while I waited for my beats 3 to be fixed from Apple. These are great.. cheap and the sound is loud. Not as clear but the volume makes up for it. I'm happy to have these!
342,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So my headphones came in earlier today. I've used them for a couple of hours so far and they are pretty awesome for the price. Way better than the wired headphones that came with my s8. They paired with my phone easy, the sound quality is great, and they do kins of block out outside noise. They are lightweight and fit my ears good and Don't make them sore. Walked through my house farther than 30 ft. And even closed a door and they still pick up. Don't know of they are water resistant yet, I haven't sweated or took a shower with them on like the product clams you can do. It comes with a 1 year warranty, and I registered online and got an 6 month extended warranty. So far I'm very pleased with them."
343,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had decent quality for a week, but the charging port broke which means I can’t charge them anymore. Low quality, would not buy again"
344,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it,the sound is amazing you wouldn't even know is a $23 product.Had to other another pair for my husband.He is in love with it too.You don't have to pay crazy amount to get a Bluetooth headphones.this is good you would love it .They even give you a year warranty if you register you product online.Good job guys.Am smiling.😘😘😘😘😘
...."
345,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great. I use it to listen to music when I’m running. Look very similar to my husband beats and I personally think they work about the same. So much cheaper. Like that it’s wireless
346,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use bought this headphone for workouts . They stay in my ear with no problems, and have great sound quality. I was actually amazed at how good everything sounded, they sound as good as my beats headphone. I find that the battery lasts a very long time before needing to be recharged. The wire connecting the headphones is flat."
347,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. I use these during my runs and while working out. I don’t use the talking feature because people say that I sound far away. But that’s not why I purchased them. Great set that stays in place and feels light weight on my ears so 5 starts from me. I even ordered my husband a pair and he loves them too.
348,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 15 year old son loves these. He broke his first pair somehow and wanted the exact same pair again. He paid for the second pair himself for not taking care of the first ones.
349,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice look, but the Bluetooth connection is not good at all. Cannot hear music or calls very well because of the bad connection."
350,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing headphones! They are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn! They sit perfectly on my ear and feel like they can be worn for hours without discomfort! The sound quality is unparalleled! These sounds just as good as my friend's ""beats"" that we're over $150! They come with a perfect size carrying case as well. They are light weight on your ears and have the perfect length cord. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for a sweat proof high quality superior sound wireless headphones!"
351,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these bluetooth earbud-type headphones! I love music, but am not super picky about sound in headphones, but these sound great! They stay on my ears and it is so nice to not have a cord in the way, this is my first pair of bluetooth headphones. I bought 5 pair of these as gifts, as well as my pair. So far, everyone is happy with the gift. They connect very easily to our phones, all iPhones. I've also paired them to my MacBook and iMac. I would highly recommend these for sound quality and ease of use!"
352,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These WILL NOT stay in ears, no matter which ear buds are used. Completely useless for running, since they require me to hold them in my ears the entire time. Wish I had chosen to spend more money for a higher quality product."
353,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are not ""noise cancelling"" as listed in the description; they are sound-isolating in that they behave like ear plugs with speakers, rather than actively removing background noise as the description implies. If you are looking to buy these as a ""noise cancelling headset"" (like a Bose headset) you will want to look elsewhere.

That said, as a basic bluetooth headset, these aren't bad. The ear clips are a little flimsy and don't provide a positive feel for being held in, rather they are just to keep the earpiece from falling to the ground when (not if) the friction fit of the earbud gives way. A stiffer material would go a long way in this area.
Sound quality is good, bass is more pronounced than typical of a small speaker like this. Mids and highs are a little muted/muddy, but can typically be compensated for with the music app of your choice (or a sound equalizer app).

All in all - I wouldn't purchase these again at full price, but as a lightning deal they are a decent set of bluetooth earbuds. There are much better available in the price range."
354,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are OK ONLY because the ear wraps are way too flimsy. If the ear wrap were more sturdy then Id have given this a 5 star. The ear wraps are designed to keep the pods in your ear, but these are so loose that the pods often wiggle out causing you to continue to press the pods back in your ears. If the ear wraps were sturdy enough to actually press the pods into your ears slightly this product would definitely be a five, but as it stands it's only ok, especially for someone with larger ears."
355,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just picked these up on a cyber monday lightning deal. Very happy - only took a star off because it's not perfect.

Pros:
Great price for the sound quality
They are LOUD - very freaking loud. I'm actually going hard in the paint right now with these on.
Good design, stays on my ears
Comfortable for long wear
Easy to pair
1 year warranty from the company
Little carry case that I may or may not use

Cons:
Wire is a little long for my liking - however it doesn't bounce around and fly everywhere. Overall, I would definitely recommend these headphones. Especially at the price.

Summary: The sound is actually phenomenal - it exceeded my expectations. High quality across the board - good bass as well. The headphones are comfy but the only complaint I have is that it's just too much extra wire hanging from the back. Wish the wire was a few inches shorter because there is no reason for the extra slack in the back - nobody has a head that big."
356,5.0 out of 5 stars,When I first bought the this wireless (Bluetooth) headphones I was skeptical because of two reasons. Losing connection/the music cutting out and the quality of the sound. But after using the headphones I was pleasantly surprised. Not once did the music cut out or I have to reconnect and the quality is top of the line. On top of this the buds did not fall out of my ear once and not having to worry about the cords getting in the way is awesome. I highly recommend the product.
357,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Used it for 2 days, but only charged once. Nice battery life. I love the design of 3 buttons control everything. Power button easy to press to answer the calls. And the button is well hidden as the icon. I didn't find it first time hands on it. Volume buttons are able to control the volume and next songs for android phone apps.

Love this headphone while sporting and in the car."
358,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Used for 3 weeks now. Very much as described. Last more than a full day of work with music (over 8 hours) and charge in the 1.5 hours as described. Took a few days for me to find a comfortable fit angle, but once found they are very comfortable and secure, though probably not wedged in deep enough for full noise cancelling. Fully inserted they were just not comfortable to my ear shape/size, but I wouldn't expect everyone to have a perfect fit.

I've done two mile runs with zero jiggle or fear of falling out. Sound clarity is way above what the cost is. The Bass is maybe not as deep as they describe, but still plenty. Overall they sound great and un-muddled.

One issue I've had is wind noise. I think this has to do with the wire being towards the front of the ear piece. That said, it's not that much and I just crank up the volume a bit more than in a non-wind situation.

The only other issue I've had is that when using two devices, one tends to completely dominate. This may be more to do with setting on my devices though than the headphones and not really a huge deal.

You can't go wrong on this purchase at this price."
359,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are awesome. Great sound quality. Crystal clear. Exactly as described and what I expected. Very comfortable. Doesn't make your ears sore. My kids love them. Easy to set up Bluetooth and connect to your phone. Very good quality and very durable! Highly recommended! Would definitely purchase again!
360,3.0 out of 5 stars," These heads phones work well in the respect that they connect to your phone easily and they sound.....pretty good for the money. However I'm an audiophile, I actually mix tracks for a living so I don't know how I ever thought that these headphones which were on sale for like 16 bucks on sale...normally like 27 were going to live up to my demands. I guess I just couldn't pass up a smokin deal. That and I trusted the majority of the reviews which said great things about these.

At the end of the day I was seriously concerned about using wireless headphones at all considering how much quality gets lost in the air when you lose the cord with headphones, let alone when dealing with cheaper ones. Now...let me just say ...I am knocking these headphones...but considering they were as cheap as they were, I almost feel guilty about it because back in the day when I was a kid....this kind of quality would have been impossible for this price...if at all. So it's cool to think about how far we've come.

But as my video review says..overall they're 7 out of 10. The sound is actually surprisingly good...and they do get loud...so you can push them a bit. But the sound does start to come apart. There's not much low end bass...so whoever made them tries to make up for that with some high bass that sounds kinda cardboardish sounding. Hallow you could say...right about 300 HZ which I tried to EQ out with my phone to get them to sound better. It kinda worked but not altogether and they still left me wanting more. Much more.

Do they work well enough for an hour at the gym for 16 bucks..yes. Am I surprised at the sound....yes....amazed..NO! But am I amazed at how much you can get for 16 bucks all in?...yes. But here is the real question that matters. Will I ALWAYS be thinking to myself about how much I wish I had a better pair while I'm wearing them. HELL YES.

With that being said,...I think this is one of those situations where you actually get more than you pay for...but even saying that...they still aren't up to the standards of what I would expect with a rockin pair of bluetooth headphones. So I wouldn't buy again...unless I just wanted a throw away pair of blue tooth headphones.

Regards!"
361,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for long lasting (battery) headphones for work. I work overnight & I had trouble finding headphones that would actually last 8 hours in one charge. I came across this product & let me tell you, it’s great. The headphones are comfortable & the battery life is more than I expected. In one single charge I got 11 hours on a moderate volume level. Really easy to connect to phone. They come with a nice case that fits the headphones, charger cable & the ear bud replacements. The sound quality cannot be compare to jbl, beat or apple headphones but it’s not awful. Only complain would be that usually around 20% charge you get the notification the battery life is low. Instead of just one simple noticed, the notification keeps repeating itself again & again (voice notification) which can get a little annoying specially if you hear it the first time. They also come with a 6 month free warranty in case anything goes wrong with the product. You need to register on their website (easy process) & can be helpful since you get updates & if you want to purchase or extend your warranty you can do it online. Overall I’m happy with this headphones & I would buy again.

Pros:
-Long lasting battery life
-Comfortable
-Water/sweat resistant
-Good looking product
- Free 6 month warranty

Cons
-Low Battery Notification (so far)"
362,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones feel great on my ears and didnt move around while mowing the lawn. I also used them while riding my motorcycle and they actually stayed in place! They sound great and can get loud enough to hear almost all the time. Love the price and quality. Definitely recommend.
363,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So I been wanting some wireless headphones for forever that 1. Didn't have ""beats"" price tag and 2. Weren't super low. These are great! The only problem I've had with mine so far are sometime when switching from different apps for example from Netflix to Pandora the sounds stops and I have to power down and power back up. The battery life is amazing! For the $16 I paid for them they were well worth the money! They don't fall out my ears and I literally can't hear anything when im wearing these, like I have to take them out my ears when people talk to me at work"
364,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great, They last for hours and the sound is great. They fit in the ear well and there are times when the music stops and I forget I'm wearing them.The reason I giving them 4 stars is because of the controls.They're a little hard to master. I've been using them since Jan 2018 and and it's now the end of March 2018 and I still haven't figured out how to use all the features but I still like them a lot. The quality of the mic when making a call seems to be on the low end but the listening quality is great.

Bottom line-
I would buy them again or recommend them to a friend."
365,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great for the price. I love them. You have to kind of get them at the right angle to fit in your ear but once you get it your set. The sound it very good. When a call comes in you are able to answer it. I paid about $15 for them and would buy another pair in a second. I love that they are wireless. No more dropping my phone on the ground when I hit the corded headphones by accident.
366,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Was afraid to try the apple wireless earbuds, knowing how easy it would be to lose one or both. These fit in the ear good, are wireless from phone but have a cord to keep the two of them from getting lost. Cord works either in front or behind the neck. Has microphone too. A cool case as well with a small caribiner on it."
367,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones work very well. I use them for making and receiving phone calls and they work great. I have bad hearing but have no problem hearing the person on the other end at all and they can hear me as well. No static or distortion. I haven't had anyone who complained or even seemed to notice I was using headphones. They are great so far.
368,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfectly fitting over the ear headphones. Great for working out, they don't fall out compared to some of the other ones I've tried. They also came with a case, extra ear bits, and a charger"
369,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is real the better choice in bluetooth headphones.It has nice stereo sound and bass sound.Its operating distance is so wide that i can use it in my whole house.Hanging on ears is more comfortable than in ears.
370,2.0 out of 5 stars,Unfortunately the Bluetooth cuts out often and also many callers complain that they can’t hear me well. Sound quality is fine for calls or music but I need dual purpose. Gave it a try for $12 so not really any loss. Will go get Beats or something that is a little higher quality.
371,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great headphone and great sound, it doesn't fall off your ears even jumping around, lasts long, charges well, Extremely pleased with these buds."
372,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smart design. I can easily connect it to my phone with the Bluetooth. The sound quality is not the best, but it’s worth it for the price."
373,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted something to take to the gym but didn't want to spend too much. The built and overall quality are ok for the price, they look cost efficient (not to say cheap). What really surprised me was the Bluetooth part, they connect right away, no problems at all at least on my iPhone. The connection is very good, no drops or noise, I tested the range inside my gym leaving my phone on my bag and they worked fine (no walls) for more than 30 feet. I even had my heart rate monitor (Wahoo) connected also all the time while listening music, no problem. I even got phone calls, excellent plus if you don't want to reach for your phone while working out. They fit nice around the ear, I do weight lifting and some cardio (bike or elliptical) so they don't move to much, I don't know if they would be as confortable for a runner, I'm guessing maybe not (be sure to try all tip sizes). I really like them, given the price I would keep the four star rating if they go for more than 1 year of use, which i think the will accomplish easily, but you never know. Then If I like them so much why not give them 5 stars?... Well here is the thing, the sound. They could sound so much better than they do just by setting them to a ""flatter"" response curve, I'll explain my self: It looks like they wanted these to sound heavy on the low end and adjusted them to give more volumen there sacrificing quality (they sound a little distorted). I know they are not audiophile or high quality audio headphones, but if they change the response curve lowering the low end volume they could sound so much better. The high end is there, a little rolled down but that's expected for the price range. The good news is you can use your phone's adjustments or equalizer to tame the low end to your liking which eliminates the distortion. Over all I enjoy my new headphones, the package was cardboard which I like, and they came with 3 different size earplugs. They came with a case, nice addition, but I find it a little too big, I wish it was smaller and the soft kind, nevertheless it is still very convenient."
374,5.0 out of 5 stars,My last pair of these broke as the power button failed but I do love these and I love the fact that they will replace them for free if you have any issues-
375,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound quality, simple to use but they just don’t want to stay in your ear for shit. I tried everything all the different bud sizes it come with I tried rotating it the stay in if you’re stationary or not doing much but if you’re working out these will kill your pump quick. But if you’re on a plane ride these are great. Cancels nearly ALL sound, there was a baby behind me screaming most the plane ride but I didn’t notice till I took my headphones off and asked someone next to me how long has that been going on. So comfortable and good quality for for the active user though."
376,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Random disconnecting. After a disconnect/repair unable to adjust volume and it's to loud to use. Like buying a water bucket with holes, better than nothing but equally useless. Stay away."
377,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands down, best purchase of the year. Lasts really long on one charge, it's responsive to calls and other communication back and forth from my phone. Sounds great, I've compared it to my gf's beats and I could tell very little difference."
378,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sound quality and deep base these headphones provide. They connect quickly between my HP notebook, LG TV, and Galaxy Note 5. The volume buttons second as previous-next buttons when long pressed and is very convenient when working."
379,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They’re not going to blow your socks off but these are a great bargain. The battery life is decent, two weeks of gym sessions and still over 50% battery left. Sound is okay as well but it can be improved for if your player (such as iTunes) has an EQ."
380,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fine heapdhones. Battery lasts about 7 hrs. However, I need something that lasts longer. The fit s great, the headphones don't fall out. Just dont have a long enough battery for my use."
381,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These do not stay in my ears at all. I have smaller ears and the ear hooks do absolutely nothing for me, in fact, they make these way worse to wear."
382,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome! I'm very deaf in my right ear and it was extremely hard to hear everything on my Amazon kindle 7.
No problems now though!"
383,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband got these and I liked them so much I got a pair for myself too. I love them, I can walk all over my house and get reception I love it! The sound is crystal clear too! The fit is very comfortable. Great for the gym."
384,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It seems to be my never ending journey to find a pair of bluetooth ear buds that sound and fit well. It's ok to spend $20-$30 and not be happy, these sound flat and shallow...."
385,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am really glad I got these. Great sound,easy to use packaged well. Nothing bad to say. I use these for work. Great to not be tethered to my phone."
386,3.0 out of 5 stars,For the price they are not bad. Cord could be a little longer. Got them for my son to travel with instead of taking his good ones.
387,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones aren't that great. Don't know why it has such high ratings. This has problems connecting to two devices. Doesn't automatically connect. I need to power it on and off or I need to switch on or off the bluetooth on my pc and phone to connect everytime. Especially when I need to connect to both devices. Also, often there are continuous breaks in the audio when it seems like it's delivering the audio in impulses or bursts of beeps."
388,5.0 out of 5 stars,They have great sound quality and comfortable fit.Very easy to pairing with my Android phone. This was a great buy for the price.I love it!
389,3.0 out of 5 stars,They are ok. No beats by dry but for $17 bucks they get the job done. Easily connects to my iPhone and plays music.
390,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound with long lasting power. Great buy. I have had them over 60 days and working great and last long time with continuous YouTube music
391,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the look, functionality, etc. I think the battery life is 7/10, the main issue is I wish there was more bass boost but for the price you can't beat it."
392,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good. No complaints from callers about background noise. Clear. Holding charge very well at this point. My only complaint is the in ear fit. I just can't seem to manage a fit that feels snug in that area. The ""sweet spot"" as others have called it. Perhaps a different ear canal piece is in order for my ear. Even still, I can hear clearly. They are definitely worth the money."
393,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is not the best, midrange is weak and bass is too strong. Otherwise, its been working reliably so far and connection works flawlessly."
394,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these on sale as a back up set for my youngest. These are wonderful and great gifts for young teens.
395,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hook broke off while walking and lost the headphones. Also they will have a blinking blue light every few seconds which is kind of annoying
396,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good. The price was great. I'm disappointed with the ear hooks, as they are far too large for my ears. They kind of just flop around above my ears. You would think, since they are so flexible, they they would be smaller. The result of this misfit is the earbuds are not secure, but merely resting in my ear... something I was hoping to avoid with ear hooks. Oh well"

452,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent sound quality. I love the way they look and they are comfortable to wear. My issues are: the largest soft earbud size still is not large enough to make a snug fit causing me to push them back in repeatedly. The other issue is the ear hook is too flimsy causing me to readjust them a lot. If they had a larger ear bud size and more rigid firm ear hooks I would give better rating
453,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones have been amazing for me. I bought them after my last headphone battery stopped holding a good charge after a few weeks. These headphones have and hold a charge that gets me through my workout and then some.

456,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Considering the high price of high quality wireless headphones such as Beats and Bose, I was skeptical of cheap Beats knock-offs for such a low price but bought a pair anyway. They are amazing!!! They have rich sound from high to low - from beautiful acoustic to deep bass. When used as a wireless headset for phone calls, I've been told my voice comes through the mic loud and clear. And to top it all off, despite their size and appearance, they barely weigh anything and are comfortable for all day wear."
457,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it for my husband, he uses it for workouts. This is really a great headphone: Easy to use and pair. The signal is strong and the sound quality is really great.

The distance is good you can be quite far and still be able to listen to music or whatever. The headphones are really loud I usually use volume around 7-9 but for this headphones max I went is 5. You don’t expect it to sound great when the prIce is this low. You get what you paid for. I just hope these headphones last more than 3 months cause from my 2 day experience I’m expecting it to last at most month and a half. I’m hoping it last 3 months or more

The earbuds are so light that you hardly will notice that you are wearing them and the buds fit vert nicely in the ear canal. Overall this is a very good set
