0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are what I was looking for. I wear hearing aids, but like to listen to either audio books or music when out walking. I also like to wear a broad brim hat to protect my face from the Texas sun. I've tried other over the ear and bluetooth headsets, but they are heavy and cannot be worn behind the head. These headphones can be worn over my hearing aids and behind the head. They are lightweight and did not shift. They permitted me to still hear outside noises like cars and critters which ear buds do not. Old school, but still work real good!"
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of these headphones to use as my workout headphones. I used them for nearly 6 years before they finally broke. I used them in nearly every workout (6 days a week, for about 90 minutes a day). I sweat constantly, and these headphones really held up through it all. Because I sweat so much, I would clorox spray them occasionally. Honestly, I was so surprised at how long they lasted. I bought another pair because of how long the first pair lasted. They are comfortable, durable, and have decent sound quality. Honestly one of the best purchases I've made. When I ordered them from amazon they came in a timely manner, were packaged nicely, etc. Worth every cent."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are one of the few that are over the ear headphones that don't give me hat hair or hurt my head. They can be comfortably worn around the neck too, which is nice. If you're buying these, you aren't looking for sound quality, so I'm not even considering that. They stay on your head when you excercise, can you say that about any other over the ear headphones?"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. I have had several pair already over the years and I would probably be a bit devastated if they stop selling them. They last a decent amount of time; mine have lasted anywhere between 1-3 years (1-1.5 on average) which is pretty good for the price and I love the sound quality. It may not have as great of sound quality as some of the expensive ones like Beats, but it's still pretty good. The only trouble with it is if you play anything louder it can be heard by others around you.

The only trouble I ever have with these is after so long the wire at the base of the aux connector will break, but it takes a while for it to happen (this is why I need to buy a new pair like this every 1-3 years). I wear mine a lot too, especially when walkin and moving around so it does get a little roughed up, but it holds up well and relaxing them at the price isn't so bad at all; I definitely get my money's worth out of them!

They are comfy too! I wear mine for hours and have little to no discomfort at all and they can be worn with glasses on without issue (usually any discomfort from wearing them is not common, minimal and goes away if they are removed for a few minutes, and the discomfort is mostly when I've worn them with glasses for long periods of times, generally after a few hours).

They're also not as easy to accidentally knock off ones head as they do have a plastic loop that sits over the war to keep them in place, and don't fall off easily either. They stay in place and out of the way.

I would recommend these for anyone who just wants a comfy pair of headphones that will stay in place, but aren't looking to break the bank on an expensive (overpriced) pair."
4,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like behind the ear phones. I hate ear buds. These are good for workouts, sweat doesn't short them out. Good enough bass, comfortable. Cord is long enough for computer use. Much lighter than Bluetooth headphones which make them good for running. Because they don't cover the ears entirely they don't make my ears hot."
5,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, there isn't very much you can complain about in the sound quality department. These get plenty loud and fairly clear with a somewhat flat frequency range that's slightly more pronounced on the high and with a little boost on the lows, but not a bassy set at all. Sound stage is great for the price range. They feel heavier than expected in the hand, but light on the head.

Biggest complaint is that there is a designed under cut that runs along the entire bottom part of the plastic band and has a slightly rough or sharp feel to it so it gets annoying and irritates the top of my ears from the plastic that's around the area that sits on your ears. I don't care how this looks, but I stuck a bit of athletic tape around that area and it's fine."
6,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I prefer earbuds, but I recently got a daith piercing in each ear, and the jewelry I have in my ears at this time won't allow ear buds to fit, so I wanted to find a different style headphone that didn't seem very obtrusive. The ear clip style that are similar seemed to have such mixed reviews as far as the clips breaking, so I chose to go with this style, which seems sturdier in construction. I love that the ear portions tilt and move so that they grip tighter to your ears, making it easier to hear the sound clearly and also helping to avoid others around you being able to hear what you're listening to. The only possible down side I've found so far is that I had to have my phone volume at almost halfway before I could really hear what I was listening to, when, with other varieties of headphones, I can't get the volume turned down low enough to not bother my ears, so they definitely don't provide a very loud output, but I've found them to be sufficient. I have not yet tried these in a place with a lot of ambient noise to know if they're decent at blocking that out or not."
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"good workout headphones. back in 2014, i had purchased a set of amazon basics wireless bluetooth headphones. these worked great for a very long time, however, one day before my workout they refused to turn on. charged them up, still no dice.

was hoping i could come on and simply by another pair of the amazon basics pair, but i was wrong. apparently amazon quit making the ones i had.

sony has been around for years, and ive owned several sony products over the years. i bought these and they are very reasonably priced. i didn't wanna pay 50, 60, 70 or 80 bucks for a set of bluetooth headphones.
these are the old school corded headphones. they arrived quickly and are very comfortable. had them over a month now, and i Love them.
pick up a pair today!"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Holey-smokes these are good. WAY better than expected. Considering the price, they are a outstanding value.

They sound great! I mean, literally (I guess auditory-ally). Not just great for their size and weight, just great. They're quite light-weight, very comfortable and feels very secure on my head. These sound much better than the on-the-ear lightweight headsets I've tried."
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My family goes through a lot of headphones and earphones.
We've tried many types: wireless / wired, over ear / on ear / earbud, ...

My frustration is that I end up buying replacement headphones or earphones at least once a month (for the five of us) ... because they just last very long.

I really like these because they sound fine and are very simple and rugged. This is my second pair ... the first pair lasted a very long time, I think for a couple of years."
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great, exactly what I have been hoping to find.

My MP3 Player is loaded with audio books, and some music, that I listen to at the gym. I generally prefer being read to when working out than listening to music.

Earbuds are uncomfortable for me and don't stick in my ears. I have fine over-the-head headphones with good sound and volume, but they are heavy and make my head hot. What i have been searching for are lightweight, behind-the-neck, wired headphones like the ones I have for my smart phone.

Sound quality is very good and so is the volume. The volume control is on the MP3 Player, of course, but it is amazing how much variation there can be between different headphones.

Lightweight, behind the neck, cmfortable, good sound and volume. I'm searching no more, I've found what I've been looking for."
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always wear a baseball hat outdoors in spring thru summer which is where, when, I tend to wear headphones. They're inexpensive and fit very comfortably below my hat. There also relatively inexpensive which outdoor use requires. In-ear plugs which I admit are more functional, but I hate them so they aren't an option for me. And the sound is ok given I play usually compressed music on the phone player."
13,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Disclaimer: I haven't received the item yet, but this is my second pair. Reviewing the first pair, that finally gave up after all the abuse I've subjected it to (not it's fault at all)

This is the best pair of headphones for running, period.

Sony sound quality is more than acceptable for this use, and the shape of the headphones precludes them falling off of you as you run, a common problem with little earbuds or separate headphones. The behind-the-neck design is the best in terms of how firmly it's attached to your head, without causing extra sweat or inconvenience.

Oh, and do get some.replacemebt foam tops for those, they get funky quick, and they tear"
14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW! Especially considering the price...just WOW! I have everything from Apple Ear Buds to $400 professional studio monitors! There aren't a lot of manufacturers the make this style. These have a great range for plugging into a source for busy work music! They're very comfortable! For the price, you can't beat them...especially if you don't want to mess up your hair, or your ears are in agony after only a few hours of having them in. I highly recommend these!"
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They fit well over the microphone of my hearing-aids, that are the over-the-ear type. Also very light for wearing for long periods."
16,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because I was having trouble finding earbuds that would stay in and be comfortable while jogging. These headphones stay on as long as I don't look up at all. If I do, my neck bumps the back piece, which joggles the earphones. Today, while using them, my right ear started to really, really hurt. I'm disappointed."
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for the gym! I can't vouch for the sound quality of these headphones because I don't use them for anything other than listening to TV programs through my gym's cardio equipment. That's the use for which I bought them and they work perfectly. What more can I say?
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"3 days having this headphone and I got to say I like it it came in good condition no broken or anything like that and everything work fine I give 9/10 on ranting that are good means

1- sounds good guality
2- fit perfect on my head right sizes
3- there is no bass or anything like that but it sound super loud and good
4- this headphone won’t bother you while you lay down
5- pretty much this headphone is meant to use while working out or running
6- is great headphone and is cheap too you won’t regret it buying it

I highly recommend getting this headphone if you planning on buying it is cheap and great :)"
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A replacement for the pair I wore out (listening to tunes on my bicycle, about 8 hours/wk). These do not interfere with my glasses or helmet. They're terrific."
20,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm probably a little spoiled because I always use my bf's headphones which are studio headphones. I needed something I could wear to do light cardio in, but I can't wear earbuds. These work fine. They stay on my head and the sound is okay. They feel weird to me, like they're going to fall off my head.. but that's probably because I'm used to heavier headphones. Many would consider the barely-there feeling a pro, I imagine. :)"
22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an MP3 player my son gave me some years ago. I put it on a timer and play my favorites each and every night to help me sleep. From the beginning I had tried different earphones and finally found this one. It gets tugged, pulled, stretched, and still lasts a long time before it needs replacing. This last time I bought two of them so I would have a replacement immediately when the one I use every night no longer works. I am glad to keep buying this earphone because the price is right and the fit is comfortable when try to get to sleep. It meets my needs exactly and I just hope they never stop making them."
23,5.0 out of 5 stars,"for the price they are great. I use them on my computer and the sound is perfectly fine. I'm a gamer so if it wasn't good sound I would be crying about it. If this is your price range, this is an easy buy"
24,4.0 out of 5 stars,they are little quiet for my taste but they are comfortable and they work
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome for the price. Sound is clear and balanced the way speakers should be, even in the low to high ranges. It's really comfortable and is great if you wear glasses. Received this on Monday and I just ordered another because the first one ended up on my husband's iPad."
26,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great! Its very light and compact, A long time ago I had one panasonic with this kind of design, over the ear, and is one of my favorites.
This Sony is above my expectations."
27,4.0 out of 5 stars,it fits for my smaller head. The sound is excellent compared to other earphones I've tried. I can hear all of the instruments and get a complete engrossing sound experience.
28,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Light in weight, fits well, good sound all around SONY quality. Great not to have annoying wires when listing to my Audio Books and MP3 downloads."
29,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for running, they stay in place like a boss. Don't let your kids near them, they will rip off the foam pads that cover the ears. Sound quality is probably 6/10 for a headphone this style (on ear). But I'm not listing for sounds quality while I""m running."
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones for my husband. He likes them and finds them very comfortable. They don't slip off and the sound is clear. They cup over the ears to eliminate background noise. They are a basic and reasonably priced. He's pleased with the purchase.
31,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Audiophiles may find something wrong with this headset, but for me the sound quality is fine. Rock music of various styles all sound crisp and clear.

However, the cheap plastic of the band does tend to pinch on the ears if worn for prolonged periods. If you just use them for a 15 minute jog, you should be fine. However, working overnight listening to music for hours the discomfort becomes apparent rather soon. Wrapping a strip of duct tape around the band by the ears will save you some pain, if you don't mind how cheap it will make them look.

If you want a long-wearing solution I'd suggest elsewhere. Short-term they'll do the job though."
33,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these to wear when I'm streaming without messing up my hair (what a girl). They're perfect for that but are painful to wear for longer than a couple of hours
34,4.0 out of 5 stars,Had these before and needed wired headphones. Very comfortable but not as much bass as my Bluetooth headphones.
35,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my favorite among others, like those in-ear buds whose bass output is superb, but...I said but due to the tendencies to hurt your ear canal after a while. Most of my older headphones are made by Sony and Sennheiser. This Sony MDR-G45LP is light and comfortable to my ears and ear cannals, but Sony has something to do about it because the slit below that part of the plastic headband which hold the tiny electrical cord to the other speaker is ""biting"" the top skin of my ears due to its weight after long hours of wearing it. If you're planning to buy this style of headphones, and you use this for exercising or jogging/running, you are better off to buy that other style that has the slit positioned at the side (not at the bottom) of the head-band. I don't want to return my headphones to Amazon that's why I wrap that portion of headband with soft fabric, and planned to replace it with a short transparent plastic tubing later. You cannot buy a pre-split tubing, therefore a sharp kitchen knife or an Exacto-knife will be handy for this; just watch out, and avoid slitting your fingers ;-)"
36,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As others have stated, it doesn't have much bass at all. But it's still good headphones. I work as a custodian at a grade school at night and I don't like ear buds (they keep falling out because I am cursed with freakish ears from the pits of hellish fire).... Anyways, good for work and for exercise. :) I likes. :)"
37,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I think this is my 4th pair! They're great - they sound good, they're easy to take off and put on, they're light and comfortable enough to wear while I'm working out. And I don't need to stress that someone's going to steal them because they're crazy expensive!"
38,5.0 out of 5 stars,"While they don't offer triple-deluxe-ultra-mega-whatever-sound like those $300 headphones the music junkies brag about, these headphones will let you listen to music. Ta-da! That is what they are supposed to do.

Plus, they hold onto your ears really well so running and other athletic activities.

I bought my last pair two, maybe three, years ago and they last that long despite all my time in the weight room."
39,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sent this back, sounded great first day or so but had a rattle to one ear. Speaker was not secure in its cup, wires disconnected from base, lost sound. Manufacturer defect."
40,5.0 out of 5 stars,"From advice from a friend I bought 3 pairs of these, one to leave at home , one at work and a spare for anything else that comes along. I was really amazed at how good they sound. I like the behind the neck simply because it makes wearing a hat some much easier when I walk. I use these with a shuffle MP3 player most of the time and for me there is more than enough cord and the plug angle is no problem at all. Also as a Prime member it was free shipping and fast delivery. Amazon is great!"
41,1.0 out of 5 stars,"First, yes I know it was my own stupidity. But, when I search for Bluetooth headphones and the picture comes up showing headphone WITH NO WIRES attached, I assume they are Bluetooth headphones. They aren't. My bad, but I still feel ripped off."
42,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tiny ear canals and can't comfortably wear earbuds, but when I ordered these headphones, I had a job hanging price tags at a grocery store, meaning I needed headphones that would stay in place. They do, and there's no cord to tangle when I store them. They're lightweight and have survived in my purse for months. LOVE them."
44,3.0 out of 5 stars,"these are great for the price. I needed something that if thrashed, wouldn't bother me (due to purchase price). These work and take a daily beating, so far they are surviving."
45,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite headphones ever. I've had a few of these throughout the years, and I'm very happy they're still available for purchase. They last longer than any other headphone I've ever used."
46,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was looking for headphones that didn't feel so heavy on my ears and these were perfect. They don't sit on top of you head they go behind which I like and are very lightweight.
47,5.0 out of 5 stars,this is my third pair. love them...all still working.
48,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, good sound quality, comfortable. Replaced these for the same pair I bought almost 10 years ago."
49,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best behind the ear headphones you can get at this price! I already had a pair that was wearing out. They are perfect for wearing in the winter because they keep my ears warm, especially for taking long walks! And, they do not hurt my sensitive ears. There is no deep bass on some songs, but deep enough for me. When it comes to earbuds, which are annoying most of the time, you have to push them deep into the ear to get that deep bass. I gave 4 stars for the cheap plastic and foam ear covering."
50,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fits well; great sound quality. This my third purchase of these headphones. I ruined my first pair by accidentally clipping the cord with garden shears. This is why I always keep two pair on hand.
51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know how the behind-the-ear headphones aren't bigger. Ear buds are the worst successful invention ever. Full headphones have great sound, but get too bulky. These are perfect for using at work or at the gym. Good sound and a great fit. After I lost my last pair and couldn't find another replacement in stores(Target, Walmart, Shopko, etc.), I found them on Amazon. I bought a pair for me and the girlfriend. She loves them too."
52,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best behind the neck headphones

The sound quality is crisp and clear
Good bass
Snug fit for avid runners

I tried others and always come back to these for the last 7 years"
53,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can't beat these for the price. They are truly audiophile-grade as opposed to the usual bass-heavy crap out there. They are perfect for the spoken word (podcasts) too. Pretty darned comfy too.
55,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't recall where I purchased my first pair of these headphones, but I just got my second pair in the mail. These are simplistic, sexy, and functional. There's no doubt about it. They fit perfectly, they have great sound quality, and they last more than people suggest. Yeah, they feel flimsy at times, but nothing that bad, and they're more durable than you might think. Always pleased with these. :)

For the record, the reason for having bought a second pair is because the right side of the headphones on my first pair was no longer working. Which is to be expected considering how long I'd been using them. Nothing to complain about, especially at the price. :)"
56,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't use ear buds. They simply fall out at the slightest movement.

So for working out and doing chores, I use these. They stay put and sound pretty good for the money. This is probably my 4th pair, and as long as they keep making them I will keep buying them.

My only complaint is that they only last 6 months or so before one of the ears go out. I do use them a lot however, about 20-40 hours per week."
57,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my third pair and each has lasted about 2 years with heavy usage-
58,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the headphones I use for working out when I go lifting, and running. They hang onto my head/ears just great"
59,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't like using ear buds, they never stay put. Maybe I have small ear holes? Either way, these are great because fit right over the top of my ears, so I don't have to worry about them slipping off. I've had them for two or three years now and the fabric on the inside of the headphones is starting to wear thing and come off. Then again I wear them all the time, especially when I workout, so I feel like 3 years worth of use for such a cheap price is totally worth it. The only complaint I have is that sometimes my ears get sore from the plastic on the top, but that's only after wearing them for a long time and it's still better than the earbuds constantly falling out or the giant padded ones that make me feel claustrophobic. Overall, good simple headphones for a great price."
60,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far
So good"
61,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best. They sound good, are inexpensive, and the best part is that they don't mess up your hair. I don't like the feel of earbuds and as a female, I hate big ear phones over my ears - they sound great but flatten my hair. For these, the ear part covers just your ears and the headband part goes behind your head, under your hair so no muss. I'll never go back!"
62,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the past four years my wife has been looking for the perfect headphones to use while she exercises at the gym, and I mean three/four days every week. She bought these on the recommendation of a fellow gym member and the search is over! They are lightweight, have a single cord, and sound great. Because they go behind the neck rather than over the head they are more comfortable and reduce sweating. She loves them!"
63,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Sony Street style headphones they rock! :D I love the behind the head style. And I love the sound quality for the price.
64,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the only headphones I will buy, I love the way they fit around the back of my neck and not on top of my head. I hate earbuds,these are perfect for me. They have awesome sound, not completely noise cancelled, but I like being aware of things going on around me...the sound is great, and they don't mess up my hair. My son tried mine, so had to get him a pair too...very light-weight, and the bass is great. Mine have lasted me a long time."
66,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These inexpensive wonders of technology provide the sharpest sound and the highest treble available. If you appreciate crystal clear music that remains ""whole"" while hitting the highest notes, these are the ones to get."
67,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great - great - great. Hard to believe these behind-the-neck earphones are hard to find on the street but they are. Even box stores don't have them. Lucky we have Amazon for stuff like this.
68,3.0 out of 5 stars,"lightweight, bass sounds okay but not great, pressure is not too much on ears, cord should be longer"
69,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a bunch of pairs of these, they are the best.

I use them for skiing, biking, and anything active. I especially like the loop-around the head style because it is easy to take one in and out without having to look or use two hands, no guess work.

I am a male with long hair and I also like that it conveniently goes right under-neath my hair bun.

The sound is decent and they can take a lot of sweat, but can show signs of stress if put under too much pressure or banged around a little. Most of the time I just notice a slight noise when I am handling them, but there is no affect on the sound quality."
70,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been buying this model for a few years locally. Decided to see what's online and happy to find them a little cheaper. These are my all around headphones and love them. Double check recordings with them and the studio headphones to see where I'm at in doing the mixing. These are also my ipod headphones. I almost live in headphones and I'm hard on them. These hold up pretty good with good sound quality.
71,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these, the sound is good , and i like the way they fit your head."
72,3.0 out of 5 stars,I guess Sony doesn't make stuff like they use to. Theses were a replacement for a pair I bought 8 years ago that had awesome sound. The sound in these is very tinny sounding and I have to crank up my iPod. The one good thing I can say about them is I didn't have to use the jaws of life to open the packaging.
73,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this style of headphones for working out in. Earbuds are painful and other styles don't stay on. These worked well, good sound, stayed in place during my 3 mile run. Had an older pair that failed to keep a connection but they worked for years before that. Nothing lasts forever. I would buy again."
74,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is ok, but they won't stay on. I have to almost hook them on the top of you ear (not comfortable) and even then they want to slide off."
75,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones. They are light to run and music sounds very good. Once I bought similar on Phillips and Maxell but have nothing to do with these. Worth paying the price.
77,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, light, good sound. Only negative is no volume control, but otherwise a great buy."
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very satisfied
79,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazingly comfortable and the sound quality is good.
80,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, priced right."
81,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best value for the money and they are comfortable when lying in bed. I've used these for years and gave a set to my wife who loves them too.
82,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These pair of headphones are very, very loose. I have used Sony's behind the neck headphones for the past 6 years and every single pair has had at least twice the clamping pressure...which isnt a bad thing if you want them to stay put. They should stay put, not move or bounce around with any movement. And I have a bigger head too, it would be even looser on a smaller head.

The sound quality is what you would expect from $14 headphones, decent sound. Build is lighter and feels cheaper than my previous sony headphones.

Conclusion is I can't recommend these headphones because they are way too loose, if you aren't moving at all then they might work for you."
83,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, good sound. Not very rugged. I'd like it if they made the place where the cord goes into the plug more robust. Eventually they develop a loose connection there if your running motion stresses that connection. But, when that happens, I still buy another pair because nothing else I've found works as well. (I use a wired headphone so my FM radio will work)"
84,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony has let me down once again.

I only bought these because I had newly pierced traguses and needed something of good quality to go over my ears. There was a better version of these headphone but as usually, they discontinued it, and we are left with these crappy ones. These are so bad that I decided to just remove my piercings early, suffer the bleeding and swollen ears to put in flat backed piercings so that I could wear NON-Sony earbuds again.

I have a bad history with Sony. I have had to buy $400 in headphones from them (before I realized it) because their phones and earbuds have a tendency to fail after a few weeks, no matter how well cared for, the left ear ALWAYS goes out. When I call and ask them to improve the product they never do. When I get a replacement pair (not a refund) when my earbuds quit working after a week, the replacement pair also breaks or I am charged for it. Between my poor history, my Sony Playstation Network account being hacked and my MP3 Walkman being on the fritz since I first bought it, I'm done with Sony for the most part.

DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!! Take it from an expert at wasting money on Sony. If you choose to take the risk, prepare to be completely disregarded by the company!"
85,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for family member who prefers the street-style headphones. Good value for the price. I would give 5 stars if it had mega-bass feature.
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why spend a bunch of money on sweat resistant headphones? These work just fine so far. I went through 2-3 different sets of sweat-proof headphones because when running 4 miles then doing P90X or P90X2 after I sweat ALOT! I know if headphones can keep up with my drainage from my pores within a couple days. These hold up I run with Oakley's mainly and the conveniently hold them down so my glasses aren't bouncing around the headphones stay in place and are comfortable and provide great sound. I also have Dr. Dre Tours, Motorola Bluetooth (Didn't hold up to claims of being sweat proof) and Skullcandy Hesi so yes the sound is good for working out. The sweat also conveniently is soaked up and drains off rather than completely in your ear unlike the Tour in ear headphones."
88,3.0 out of 5 stars,"as advertised, can not stand those ear bud types."
89,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, these simply cannot be beaten. Sounds excellent, and great for working out, that's what I use them for!"
90,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for jogging but ended up not using them for that because my music wasn't loud enough or clear enough for me. And I wasn't expecting them to sound perfect or anything... If you like your music pretty decently loud and clear, these might not be for you. I ended up getting the adidas sport in-ear neckband ones instead, which were also pretty reasonably priced but gave more clear and a little louder sound, again not perfect sound, but a lot better than these. Now my son uses these when he's playing video games I don't want to hear, so at least we found a use for them!"
91,5.0 out of 5 stars,same as the one I've been taping together for 3 years. Finally a new one. Hard to find a behind the head at this price.
92,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is really a good headset, however, the only problem is that they cannot be adjusted. They are slightly too big for me any I cannot adjust."
93,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are not kidding, these bad boys are LIGHT!"
94,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, comfort, the convenience of neckband headphones. I bought a pair for myself and one for a gift. My friend and I are both very well-pleased. They have also held up well under heavy use."
95,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these specifically to wear them while I had my motorcycle helmet on, and once you get the headphones settled into the ear pockets of the helmet, they work great. The neck band comes out under the bottom of my HJC and G-Force helmets, doesnt interfere with the fit."
96,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality is surprisingly decent. But MUCH too quiet. Works for getting by, but if you like to listen to reasonably loud music (not ear bustingly loud, but certainly loud), this device is NOT the one for you"
97,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yet another replacement for a son who loses or breaks things--great stocking stuffer. He requested this item and I know he likes it!
99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived dead on time no issues with customs, mainly use them for work, I work long nights in a stock storage so this makes it easy for me to get in with my job and not worry about the headphones being ripped off my head or causing me to get caught in any machinery, they are reasonable loud but not too much I can't hear my boss when she's got orders for us. Great product when your on the go and just need something to take you out of the tedium"
100,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my favorite style headphone, but don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed."
101,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. I'm glad they're still available on-line (Best Buy no longer carries them, evidently due to consumer-related complaints re skin contact with the plastic, resulting in irritation). These headphones are inexpensive, comfortable, and very durable. Music sounds great whether using them on an i-Phone or a Sony ""Walkman"". The plastic is strong yet flexible, and very difficult to warp or break. The Foam Pad Ear Covers will begin disintegrating after six months of daily use, so plan on purchasing replacement pads for future use."
102,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these. They're cheap and they don't leave a band mark on the top of my head.
103,5.0 out of 5 stars,these headphone work awesome love them
104,5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect for treadmill use.
105,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I chose these because I have a smaller head. They turn out to be a good choice for that. I am very pleased with the price versus sound quality. In fact, I recently bought a second pair for home use (the original pair are in the office). I might wear them, with breaks, for a few hours at a time. There might be a better pair out there in terms of how they fit my head, but these are good enough for the price and all that they do for me."
106,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have you reached the point of frustration with cheap ear-buds that work for awhile but won't stay in your ears or get pulled and loose sound on one side? I had reached that point so many times that I was looking for exactly this product, fits comfortably over the ears, sold frame, corded on only one side so less likely to get snagged and pulled - and the sound is phenomenal for headphones in this price range!"
107,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simple, very inexpensive and do the trick. I listen to these everyday on the way to work on transit and back. These aren't Bose or Beats but heck, either is the price. The wrap around design is super convenient for those like myself that don't want to mess up my hair! Great value, good volume, decent sound, no brainer."
108,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these for exercise. They take a beating and stay in place even when soaked in sweat.
110,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have used these headphones as an on-air personality and I love them. They are light weight and the sound is great! Great service.
111,5.0 out of 5 stars,So light and really works well even with my glasses on. I see no problems. I do use them upside down since the equipment is on my right. Works just fine.
112,5.0 out of 5 stars,great for what I needed
113,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use them all the time.
114,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this style of headphones. They are good for people who wear hats because they fit behind the head.
115,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had this style of headphones years ago, and they finally gave up the ghost, and was glad to find them still in production. The only difference from the older pair is the missing volume control on the cable. However, it was this that caused the problems on the old pair, so maybe that's why it was omitted.

I like them because they don't get in my way, don't fall off my head and I can still hear people and phones - don't block out external noise, but good enough to listen to most things!"
116,5.0 out of 5 stars,the sponge material that is on my old headphones deteriorated so I bought these. I didn't have any expectations for these just wanted a new pair really and they're good. I prefer these headphones style headphones to the ear plug ones because those tend to hurt my ear if I'm wearing them for too long especially if I have to pull them out and put back in.
117,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I despise earbuds - they're uncomfortable, worse for your hearing, and I think my ears require two different sizes. But the nicer headphones I use for pure listening just don't cut it when you're running, etc. I searched a lot for something suitable, and finally found these. They've been great. The build quality is nothing special but it's fine for what I paid."
118,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok. I like the angled plugin.
119,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought three of these for my girls for their MP3 players and their 3DSs. I wanted them to have something like this to maybe help preserve their hearing rather than the ear-bud type that focuses all the sound directly into their ears. Good price and they do the job handily. My kids are totally happy with them and they couldn't care less about sound quality so I can't vouch for that.
121,4.0 out of 5 stars,They have worked well so far. They sound good and are comfortable.
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,I thought this headphone was gone forever! Perfect for me.
123,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good sound quality. The only problem I am running into is that the crook around the earphone part pinch my ears after prolonged use. Otherwise, these are good quality headphones for the price."
124,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds great. Use then for our Praise band at church. Would love to get more if some one would donate about 5 to my church. Great Acres Baptist Church, smyrna ga"
125,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for listening to youtube videos, not for music. Save up for a better pair of head phones for music."
126,5.0 out of 5 stars,I try buying different headphone but always come back to these. The quality and the fit for the price is unbeatable.
127,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Acceptable sound, but it does not fit all heads."
128,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These things cut the volume down so much that I couldn't hardly hear anything through them. Nothing wrong with my mp3 player, or my ears, just a defective unit I guess. I would have returned them except they were so cheap it wasn't worth the trouble, so I just tossed them."
129,4.0 out of 5 stars,It‘s good
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i do not face any problem with it at all. it fits me fine and sound is great. i do not know why people write bad reviews about it.
yea, there's no privacy with it i.e. others can hear you little bit. but that's the point of having this headphone so you do not destroy your ears rather let the sound spread out. i like it. perfect for me. alhamdulillah."
132,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Replaced my old 20+ year old model which took a dunk in a cup of coffee. I was happy these are still made. Great comfortable lightweight little headphones for the money. Unlike most headphones, which are rigid, this neck wrap is a bit flexible, so it will automatically adjust to fit, and there is no uncomfortable pressure on the ears. I forget I'm wearing them. They work will with my glasses and hearing aids. The earpiece is foam covered, and I understand they are replaceable, but , the same foam pieces lasted on my old one until it bit the dust. I use these with my laptop to watch movies or youtube."
133,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these for many many years I have owned many sets. These are my go to gym headset. They are very loud that I like and stay out of my head and over my years. I can't fit headbuds into my ears as they do not fit well. I like to have music and I do mma or boxing these do no move unless I'm getting hit. The foam is pretty junk and soak up the sweet very fast; but you can drop these and will side will go out. They are cheap enough to keep on just re buying new ones. I can get anywhere from 1 year to 2 years out of each headset
I think I'm on my 7th headset I don't mind buying more as they are priced so cheap and work just fine"
134,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE these headsets. I always use headsets when on my laptop, and these were my go-to because of their cost and comfort. The behind-the-neck style makes it easy to sit back in my chair without them falling off my noggin. Their sound is decent, especially considering the cost. They put out surprising volume levels at a fair enough quality for most every-day use.

The big downside of these is they don't last long. Every single pair I've owned (This is my 5th pair) has had the connection come loose inside the ear-piece. When I open it up to fix it, I can't even see where the connection issue is coming from. Lastly, the sound quality tends to degrade quickly. They have good bass out of the box, but after a few weeks they become ""average"".

For the price I use these as my every-day throw-away headset. I use them until they stop working, then I order a new pair. They serve their purpose very well."
135,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using this same model sony headphone for many years. I bought my first pair probably 6 or 7 years ago for running and rollerblading. I like them because they go behind your neck and stay on very well. The behind neck headphones were very popular for awhile but now it seems everyone wants the ear buds or the over the ear sitting on your head headphones. I still prefer these neck headphones because when I am running I do not want anything directly on my head and the ear buds fall out. These work great and I recommend. The sound is great too.
136,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones. Comfortable, remain stable on your head while exercising and the sound is great."
137,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This style of headphones, the on-ear, behind-the-neck type, are my favorite kind of headphones. I've owned several pairs over the years, and these are the worst ones I've ever had. The speakers sit too high up on the ear, rather than being nicely centered; and the earpieces are poorly shaped, making them uncomfortable or even downright painful to wear for long periods of time. The sound quality isn't great either; it's only slightly better than what you'd get from a cheapity-cheap pair of supermarket headphones. Regretted buying them on only the second day I owned them, when I had to wear them when my ears were already sore from wearing them the day before. I would not recommend these to anyone who wants good headphones in this style."
138,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to have an older version of these a long time ago. I really like the ""Behind the neck"" headphones because I ride bicycles and they stay on well.

Good:
1-Priced to sell, after shipping and tax they were under 15$ which is nice.
2-Sound quality for what you pay is amazing. I can hear the bass well and all that.
3-They don't fall off your head while bicycling.
4-I have a huge head and was afraid they would be uncomfortable but they are not.

Cons:
1-The audio quality is not up to par with that of the 300$ headphones but they were under 15$ so who cares?"
139,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second purchase of the Sony neckband headphones. I still have my first neckband headphones, but I like them so much that I purchased a second pair for my laptop. The headphones have an awesome sound, are very light, and don't feel heavy and bulky like the others I have purchased in the past. The Sony neckband headphones rest comfortably on the back of your neck, which has a comfortable feeling. This was an excellent buy and I would purchase another pair as well as recommend others to purchase the Sony neckband headphones."
140,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect little headphones for my work cubicle. The behind-head style lets the rail sit right behind my ears so they don't slide around or muss my 'do. They're not noise-cancelling or anything, but that's fine; I need to be able to hear when my phone rings anyway."
141,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great fit, sound and price! Love them."
143,4.0 out of 5 stars,"volume level: 7/10, comfort: 8/10"
144,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality feels a bit cheap, but sounds ok."
145,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for running, and for use with bike helmet, I got these after the Phillips brand ones had jack issues after a year, I think these are a little better"
146,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite headphones that always fit my head and never fall off. Sound is not seinhesser level but for 14 bucks its still pretty great cheap pair of on the god phones.
147,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They fit pretty good, but there's not enough volume."
148,5.0 out of 5 stars,Too expensive for what you're getting but I prefer these at the gym over the earbuds.
149,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a repeat purchaser. I buy more because I have worn out or destroyed my current pair. Tried others, but can't beat these for bang for the buck. Thery're not Cadillac or even noise-cancelling, but for the money, they can't be beat.
I especially like that they fit so comfortably that I can wear them while lying on a pillow...in any position. Many times I'll wake up, realize music has ended, drop them on the floor next to the bed, and then go back to sleep. (Although there have been mornings where I'll wake up and realize I had them on all night.)
If anybody ever perfects a 'sleep learning' system, these will be the headphones you'll wear."
150,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably the best set of headphones I have ever purchased.

I have had the same pair for over three years now and have never had an issue with them not working.

The pair I had previously - the same pair, lasted almost five years and only had to be replaced because of an error of my own (the cord was cut in half) otherwise I think I would still have that same pair.

Five stars because I have yet to find a better headset at this price for the amazing quality that comes with it"
151,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like it because of the behind the neck style. I wish more brands made these types of headphones.
152,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sounding headphones for the dough and it you wear a hat or helmet they're awesome
154,5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is my best headphone in the last 10 years
it's very durable with perfect sound quality, I used 3 or 4 items of MDR-G57G and MDR-G45LP in the past decade
I hope that I can find it in the next years"
155,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a good replacement for the old Sony MDR-G45LP that eventually died on my after years of use. I have a fairly large head, so these felt tight on me at first, but I think they're slowly stretching out over time. At this point, I really don't notice any tightness. I like this style of headphone because they're more comfortable than having buds in my ears, and they give me a bit more ability to hear when someone approaches than the large over ear headphones would. I think they're ideal for casual use with my PC while sitting in my office at home."
156,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned a pair of these before and wore out the padding and the cable. I try using ear buds, but my ear canal is too small and it makes wearing them painful, so I have gone back to the magic of these headphones. I will probably have to buy another pair soon, just to make sure I have a back up in case Sony stops making them."
157,4.0 out of 5 stars,I won't pretend that these are the best sounding headphones that I have ever owned. I think I've had about 10 pairs of these or similar models in my life. They're great for biking and working out because they stay on well and don't completely block your hearing. Definitely a great add on to a headphone collection.
158,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As I bring my iPod everywhere with me, these are a great asset. I have a small head, so they are quite comfortable and the behind the head band is wonderful for letting them sit around my neck when I'm not listening to anything. I'm rather hard on my headphones, sometimes using them as portable room speakers with friends, and these last me years that way. They don't have professional quality sound,(which isn't needed for everyday use) but they actually have a fairly decent mix, something I find that is very much lacking in earbuds, hence my choice to stay with these. Though they are more bulky and harder to just wind up and put in a pocket, I find that the pros outweigh the cons by a long shot. They also make good ear warmers in the winter :)"
159,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product is easy to use and ultra comfortable. I am able to jog and still feel secure that I will notlose my headset. Sound quality was very good. Company contacted me as a follow up to see how I liked their product.
160,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use them while on the motorcycle. I'm giving 4 stars because I feel that the volume should go a little higher.
161,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awsome
162,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it. I used to run with headphones like these all the time. Earbuds always fall out of my ears - these work wonderfully. Thanks Amazon! You're the best.
163,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for a month and they worked great... Until last week. The sound has started to cut out on both sides which probably means it's a cord problem. I haven't used these often, usually two to three times a week while walking my dog. They are basically what you pay for and I guess they aren't meant for endurance. Time to start looking for a new set of headphones again."
165,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Of this kind of ear phones, these are my favorites. Good fit and sound."
166,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wear these when I go to sleep. They're cheap and comfortable, and have quite good sound."
167,5.0 out of 5 stars,love the fit
168,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for people who are active or always on the go, and for those who don't like earbuds. Decent sound for the price, relatively comfortable. Be aware, the sound leakage is bad. Save your Insane Clown Posse, Nikelback, and Creed tunes for home!"
169,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to replace an old set of MDR-G42 phones where the foam wore completely off and the pieces behind the ears that help stabilize them the broke off, they are now like the MDR-G45LP. I'd rather use something else but the ear buds REALLY irritate my ears and the over the head phones move around and just look dorky. They are, were the best I found and I think that Sony has stopped manufacturing them."
170,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not great sound but they keep your ears warm and are excellent for biking or jogging. The sound is actually better than some earbuds costing three times as much
171,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for the gym, as the behind the ear style keeps cords out of the way. These headphones are very minimalist without being the small earbuds that I don't like for the gym. I've gone through a few of these over the years, and always come back to purchase the same brand and same style."
172,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound for the dollar.
173,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these about 4-10 hours almost every day. I love the way they fit, and the angled plug that helps keep the wire from fraying. Although they do not stand up well to this much use, I think that for the price, I have gotten plenty of usage from each of the 12 or so sets I've bought. They last me about 10 months each."
174,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the fit of the headphones, but I have now had two different ones break on me. The piece that plugs into the phone, it is very weak. Be very gentle with these - if they improve that part, my review would be 5 stars."
176,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones and has good stereo sound quality. Great for the low price and better sound then some more expensive headsets. Item is flexiable and comfortable. Others reviewers stated uncomfortable. Sony quality is there. Recommend for purchase.
177,4.0 out of 5 stars,very nice headphones work well
178,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well. Comfortable.
179,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for a friend. They work great. Very happy.
180,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Product is defective, there is rattling noise in the left ear. I am in the process of returning."
181,1.0 out of 5 stars,The cushions wore and tore almost immediately.
182,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The design of the part that goes behind of the ear was not right for me.
I couldnt wear them after a few days I got a they cut me behind of my ear"
183,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones - great sound and lightweight! Love the behind the head style.
184,2.0 out of 5 stars,Kind of cheaply made and the cord is way too short.
185,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these same type of headphones for years. Can't beat the style for walking, running and jogging."
187,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th pair as they are great for working out, since they rest behind your head, they stay in place and provide good sound."
188,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite headphones! I bought a pair years ago and the connection started going bad, so I was glad to see they still made them and ordered another pair. Bigger, bulkier headphones hear my ears and get to heavy on my head. I despise earbuds and don't use them unless on the go. These are light, functional and have great sound quality. I recommend them to anyone wanting a simple style of neckband headphones."
189,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The cord is about 6 inches too short, I like to place my I touch in my left front pocket but because of the length of the cord, it pulls on the headset. My old sony neckband that I owned for at lest 8 years had a longer cord and I had no issues. As far as comfort and sound, it is fine."
190,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really love these. They are very comfortable to wear.
191,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent replacement for my worn-out old headphones. Good sound quality, and comfortable enough to run with daily"
192,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice
193,4.0 out of 5 stars,We use these for the gym because they dont bother my ears. I find the small in ear headphones bother my ears when I am at the gym. This is an inexpensive neckband type headphone. My wife tends to leave hers at the gym so I purchased two of these to be replacements.
194,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best headphones ive ever had. stay attached through whatever work out, comfy, great sound. just PERFECT. GET THEM. these without a cord i could hook to my mp3 would be amazing but they're cheap so just buy a couple. I have hit the cord and ripped them off my ears or mp3 but still work!"
195,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and good sound but needs more bass quality
196,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. I hate anything in my ears so these are a great alternative. I bought several for backup and my daughter slid one in her bag.
198,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using these headphones for many many many years and they are by far my favorite so they don't seem as loud as they were the last time I bought them
199,5.0 out of 5 stars,My retired husband uses these and loves them. they are comfortable and he can hear well with them.
200,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well packed, fits well, good sound. Great px."
201,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These stay in the car and the kids use them almost daily with their phones and tablets. They are durable beyond belief and works well. My kids think that they're not stylish so don't wear them out, but they work great and do exactly what they are designed for.. that should be enough, right?"
202,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great - ear buds bother my ears, which are sensitive. These are comfortable to wear, don't bother my ears and have great sound."
203,3.0 out of 5 stars,"headphones work fine but the product package was open when they arrived,very unprofessional ...no more Continental Supply for me..."
204,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the basic, lightweight design. They stay on when I work out which I've had difficulty with ear buds in the past doing so. Good price too."
205,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this pair of headphones, the quality is amazing and after a while of listening to music you forget you're wearing it with how light weight it is. The cord is on the shorter side so keep that in mind before purchasing. Packaging came in perfectly and on time also."
206,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OVERALL
A very good headset for the price. Caveat, the price varies considerably, even on Amazon.com, often from hour-to-hour. I purchased a new set for $9 from Amazon.

COMFORTABILITY
""Behind-the-neck"" headphones are generally the most comfortable type you can purchase. However, you can buy a half-dozen different headsets which look identical except for the brandname. Some will be comfortable, some won't. Apparently different folks have different shaped heads and ears, which is important to the fit of behind-the-neck headphones. So, when you find a set which is comfortable for you---buy an extra set or two and stash them. Personally, I find the Sony MDR-G45LP headphones to be very comfortable---but your experience could be different.

ADJUSTABILTIY
Like all other ""behind-the-neck"" headphones Sony MDR-G45LPs are non-adjustable because no adjustment is necessary. In fact, that is one of the advantages of ""behind-the-neck"" headsets as compared to ""top-of-the-head"" headsets.

CORD LENGTH
Despite the silly complaints of a few other reviewers that the cord is short, it is in fact the Sony MDR-G45LP cord is the standard length---long enough for you to carry your MP3 in your pants pocket. Short is better than too long---you can always add a cheap extension, for example Cables To Go 40405 3.5 mm Male/Female Stereo Audio Extension Cable, Black (1.5 Feet/0.45 Meters). If the cord is too long, it will catch on things, straining the cord at the plug----which is what will ultimately kill the headset.

SOUND QUALITY
The sound quality of the Sony MDR-G45LPs is VERY crisp and clear, (unlike many headsets which are optimized to ""pump up the bass"" which makes voice and treble muddy). I use the headphones to listen to audiobooks for which it is perfect.

CONSTRUCTION QUALITY
Appears to be good, but unfortunately, the Sony MDR-G45LP has a right-angle plug. Virtually all headsets ""die"" by strain on the wires at the plugs---so straight plugs are far better than angled plugs (because straight plugs pull out easily, rather than straining the wire).

COMPARISON WITH OTHER TYPES OF HEADPHONES

""Behind-the-neck"" headphones are generally the most comfortable type you can purchase. They also the best at staying in place when exercising.

For an ""outside the house/office"" headset, I prefer my J-buds JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (White) with my Budkeeper Carrying Case - Fire Engine Red (BKFD20-G47) case, which I clip to a belt loop. I can also stash a couple of extra AAA batteries with my J-Buds in the Budkeeper. The J-Buds in the Budkeeper are a much smaller package, and J-Buds are better at noise reduction, for example in a doctor's waiting room with a TV on. However earbuds can become uncomfortable after several hours. I suspect that the build-up of heat and moisture in your ear canals might lead to infections if earbuds are worn several hours daily. Indeed, enough heat builds up to melt your earwax, which then solidifies in and on the earbuds. Premium earbuds even have replaceable ""wax filters"". If you wear non-premium earbuds, clean the earwax out regularly, or it will get to the speakers and kill them.

""Top of the head"" headphones slip easily, require adjustment, interfere with wearing hats and interfere with women wearing hair ""up"". The only purpose for which a ""top-of-the-head"" headset is better, is for listening to music while taking a nap.

Apple/airline type earplugs are just plain uncomfortable, fall out of your ears easily, and do not provide the noise isolation of earbuds.

207,5.0 out of 5 stars,A+++
209,5.0 out of 5 stars,my favorite headphones... these are my 2nd pair.
210,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stays out of the way
211,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice
212,4.0 out of 5 stars,This a nice product to wear especially if you either don't like to have the loop over the top of your head or your wearing a hat. Fidelity is very good.
213,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value overall
214,5.0 out of 5 stars,good for the price.
215,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Wish they were a little larger to accommodate my big head. Also, the cushiony bits keep falling off. Functional, but not ideal."
216,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound and very comfortable. Note: I have a small head and am not sure these work on larger heads.
217,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my FAVORITE design for headphones. Ear buds are dangerous and I am knowledgeable of how delicate (and precious) eardrums are so I recommend that people find headphones like this one.
218,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound.. comfortable earpads, good quality, for the price ... not like your bose headsets, but these work well.. I like them because I wear a hat, and these fit around the back of your head... am happy with them for sure!"
220,5.0 out of 5 stars,these fit over the ear perfectly and do a 1/2 way decent job of blocking outside noise...great value for the price!
221,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my Sony small headphones. The quality of the music has always been good with Sony. I bought two sets because I purchased a similar set about seven years ago and I want to make sure I have a second set if needed.
222,2.0 out of 5 stars,Uncomfortable and made with hard plastic that wears on my skin.
223,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are great,they have really good sound and are very comfortable to wear,quite happy with them,they also came very fast in the mail,all of my Amazon orders have been right on time or earlier,very much appreciated,thank you so much!!"
224,5.0 out of 5 stars,My main source for music.
225,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I cant not print a return label all i get is an OOP!! so what do i so ,I would love these if they were bluetooth if you have anything like that please let me know."
226,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you need a cheap, lightweight set of headphones that nobody will steal for work or something, these fit the bill."
227,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these exclusively for working out, from intense runs to stationary machines these headphones encounter a lot of sweat and continue to sound good. My previous set lasted 3 years before our puppy decided to chew on them... I've had the current set for a little over a year now and show no signs of letting up! I will continue to purchase this model based on its durability and price point."
228,4.0 out of 5 stars,Tight fit which makes long term wear a little hard. Good value and sound.
229,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had a few pairs of this style headphones. They usually last a few years before the wire starts shorting out in one ear. Great bass sound for low end headphones. Not the most popular style anymore but definitely one of the best value pairs of headphones I have ever had.
231,5.0 out of 5 stars,Greta headphones and a great price.
232,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it. I had one- my wife took it from me- Bought another one. Cheap and good quality. Really lightweight and comfortable.
233,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great experience.
234,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant little pair of neck headphones. Great fit and were super comfy to wear on our long holiday flight. The sound quality is fantastic for such a low price and I am sending off for another pair to keep on standby for the future.
235,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Really comfortable but super quiet. I have to turn up the volume on my phone so loud for these to register as ""normal""."
236,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always come back to find these on the internet. I have used them for jogging for 10 years. I have bought at least 10 sets. In fact, I'm wearing a set now as I type this. Behind the neck headphones are a bit rare these days, and its my favorite style."
237,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this as a replacement for my dad's hearing device. It worked well and was a great fit for his head. if anyone hasa hearing device that is over the ears..these are a great replacement and less costly instead of going back to the hearing aid center :)
238,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT SOUNDS AND BASS. I RECOMMEND.
239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great inexpensive over the ear headphones. Plug 'em in and listen in the kitchen, on the treadmill, in the yard. Excellent bass response for the money."
240,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the gym
242,2.0 out of 5 stars,right side of headphone has become loose and has to be pushed back together a lot
243,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 5th or 6th paires. I bought several for my family members. Easy to use. I use it everyday and especially for my running. Wish in the future they can Make the same style with wireless.
Highly recommend!"
244,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Stays on while I run, unlike the earbuds that pop out. Sound quality is good."
245,1.0 out of 5 stars,The cushions on the headphones kept comming off
246,5.0 out of 5 stars,Still great headphones after all these years
247,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay for the price
248,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. Sound isn't the greatest quality, but they are great for walking and I can wear them on the bus and the back part doesn't bother my next against the head rest at all."
249,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sure you can't crumple these up in your pocket but for people with small ears such as myself, running with ear buds is a hassle. These stay in place and have decent sound. Quality ear buds will always provide a better sound than outer ear headphones because sitting in the ear allows them to form a deafening sound seal around your ear drum. After years of battling buds. I'm kicking it old school."
250,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wife loves it. Uses it daily (and nightly)!
251,5.0 out of 5 stars,a great sound for the price and comfortable
253,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my go to headphones for 10+ years. I wear them in bed listening to music as I drift off to slumber-land. I add an extra foam pad on the earpieces so I can lie on my side wth them on comfortably. I have another pair in the kitchen that I wear walking the dogs on winter evenings. The sound is goid and my ears stay warm. Only reason I have to buy new ones is because I sonetimes lose them when I take them on trips. Overall, for the price and sound quality, these are just dandy, if you ask me."
254,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just right for the gym.
255,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The band is not flexible and chafes one ear because i'm not symmetrical enough so I can't wear them for too long. (I don't think they'd be that good for gym use, but others might have matching ears). The sound is good (I'm not an audiophile, just a regular user of music on my iPhone). When I talk on my iPhone: not so good because it doesn't have a mike on the line and seems to amplify ambient noise or make it muffled, depending on where I am. My favorite under-$100 headphones used to be Seinnheisers, but they stopped making them well a few years ago. Considering these are less than $20, they are well worth it, but I will probably replace them when i find something more comfortable/good for phone use."
256,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great clear sound from my tablet, phone and metal detector. Comfortable. Only shortcoming is a lack of good strain relief on the cord. Of course, at this price, if it goes bad you can afford another set!!!"
257,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these for years, and even buy generic replacement ear covers whenever the original ones get ratty. I'm not an audiophile, but these do sound better than any other low-cost headphones I've ever had. A bonus is that the L-shaped plug is very slim, so there's no problem using it if your smartphone has a thicker case.

I cannot use earbuds, so I'm stuck using over-the-ear headphones, and I don't want to tote around a bulkier set. So for me these are perfect."
258,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite headphones. Very good sound, comfortable for extended wear. The back of the neck style means they don't slip out of place. They are a little sweatier if you use them during brisk exercise. I don't know how many times I've jerked the cables by mistake on my previous pairs and they still last for several years.
Recommended."
259,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones for working out (I've been using them about 7 years now and have never had to replace them) so I bought some for my husband as well, since he was having trouble with other headphones shorting out on him when he got sweaty on runs. He was not a believer that these would work, but they have had no issues whatsoever, and he is a sweaty-headed runner! Highly recommend to anyone using them for sports. I have trouble keeping in-ear headphones in my ears, which is why I bought these."
260,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the only headphones I use! I can't stand ear buds being inside my ears, and this is the perfect design for me. Lightweight and with good sound. Not the most powerful headphones (they are not noise cancelling) but perfect for everyday use or working out."
261,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am no audiophile, but these are pretty bad. I had a pair of MDR-G42's that were discontinued, but similar in price at the time. They weren't the best, but were good for music and whatnot. These looked pretty much the same, so I thought I'd try them. The sound from the G45 is terrible. Error 404 for bass. Seems like there is absolutely none. They are also very uncomfortable to wear. I know they're cheap, but had I known how bad they were I would not have gotten them. I would not recommend these for music, movies or TV. Maybe listening to the news or something similar."
262,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good durable product and the second one I've purchased. I use it strictly for working out and yard work and sound coming out of is perfect for me. I wear my ipod on my shoulder and the cord does get in the way when performing yard work so I take it and flip it behind me and it works fine while raking, mowing, and shoveling snow. I have had no issues while running and even used ran with while it was drizzling. Great headphones for the price. It does can get a little bit of a nasty feel to it when it's soaked with sweat, but after it dries out, it will be good-to-go for the next round of workouts."
264,4.0 out of 5 stars,"What I expected. Reasonably comfortable, and i was pleasantly surprised with the bass range."
265,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful. They will not stay on my head unless I hold them there.
266,5.0 out of 5 stars,It really has a good quality.
267,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable fit, great sound quality and a longer cord than a previous set, very nice."
268,5.0 out of 5 stars,We've bought 3 of these. All still work. Foam has come off because our son is very rough with these. But all still work and take abuse. Fits all shapes and sizes.
269,4.0 out of 5 stars,good light weight headphone
270,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these head phones. anybody want the other three sets I have that were more expensive made by other manufactures? wish Sony would bring back the behind head head phones.
271,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent sound quality for the money. Comfortable fit
272,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are super comfortable. It seems they've fallen out of style, but I had the exact same pair before and they wore out from constant use (not unreasonably), so I was happy to purchase another pair."
273,5.0 out of 5 stars,Still like the old fashioned neckbands vs earbuds.
275,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and good sound; Only issue is cord is very short.
276,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was recently given an expensive pair of Monster headphones. Since the only thing I have to compare them to are the earbuds that came with my iPod, I didn't know if they were worth the high price tag. Now I know. You do get what you pay for!

While I love that pair of Monster headphones, I couldn't use them and wear a hat. I use them while doing my walking outside and, with it being Spring and soon Summer, I want some of the protection a hat would provide. I looked at some options here on Amazon and decided on these neckband headphones.

They do allow me to wear a hat and still not have to resort to the earbuds, which I find are uncomfortable. Even to my untrained ear, the sound from these is tinny, at best. They block no outside noise. As a result, I have to turn the volume way up with these where I turn it way down with the others. I will probably use these when I use a hat, but I will definitely use the others if I am not."
277,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I live on an Air Force base, and I use these headphones for running around the runway. They don't completely drown out the jet noise, but they do a good job of holding their own against F-16 engines. They're durable and comfortable, and I would recommend them to anyone who needs a good, solid pair of headphones for running."
278,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this pair of headphones to use in the office. They stopped functioning within 2 months of use. I cannot imagine if this product was put under any type of duress, it would probably break immediately. Also, it's not a particularly comfortable behind the ear type of headphone. Look elsewhere."
279,5.0 out of 5 stars,Only kind I wear!
280,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fits nicely around neck. I like how it fits around neck (no messy hair) and it is close to ears without covering my hearing of events around me.
281,4.0 out of 5 stars,For my husband who is hard of hearing so uses these to watch TV. It is the second set do to the wires that connect to head phones come undone.
282,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have purchased this headset before. I do medical transcription so I want something that isn't going to cover my entire ear and something that won't mess up my hair! Would get these over and over again!
283,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent ear phones, great sound."
284,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these with some trepidation as Sony ""likes"" their items and prices them too high. Due to that, and these at a price below $15.00, I should have known they would NOT be worth half the price paid! The sound quality is like something you could get at a discount store for a couple of dollars, BUT it does have the ""regarded"" name SONY on them so we as consumers should just pay the money and like the result. Well SONY, once again I must say you have over priced a product and I hope it is quickly removed from shelves or you will only further damage your reputation. Did I mention these are TERRIBLE? Well, I guess I have now, and they are that bad! Further more they will break at the slightest amount of pressure it feels like. Crap, just crap! I am ashamed of SONY for selling something like this with their name on it! Don't spend a penny on this item folks, and you will not be disappointed. These are being returned immediately!"
286,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Literally the only headphones I wear for exercise. I have sweated all over these, worn them for forever, and they work consistently and stay on my ears when I run long distances, lift weights, etc. Not to mention the sound quality is excellent, I'm no extreme audiophile but I know good quality sound and these have them. Best work out headphones on the market."
287,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Would you know that this is NOT a wireless item if you looked at the picture?
Sucks since I didn't know that and their policy is not allowing returns."
288,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well.
289,5.0 out of 5 stars,wife loves them.
290,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are especially good in the gym where ""ear buds"" are uncomfortable and activity can dislodge ""over the head"" style headphones"
291,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived as promised and in excellent condition
292,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dont' like them. They are not adjustable.
293,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my g/f as a replacement for a similar pair of headphones. She seems to really enjoy them.
294,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones for running. They do have a wire but I dont care. I run everyday and these things last me 3-4 years. Love them!
295,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are the best in the world!
297,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for my 7yr old. He likes listening to his Ipod and using it for his DSI/XL. He has gone through so many headphones and dislikes the earbuds, so these headphones have been a pleasure for him to use. They are durable and he says they are very comfortable. Pleased with the product and the cost was well worth it."
298,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As pictured, good sound quality, arrived quickly and without damage, would recommend."
299,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Liked it - was looking for a Bluetooth headset and bought this by mistake - but, it works just fine."
300,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for working out.
301,4.0 out of 5 stars,Granddaughter love them
302,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for the price. Comfortable, stay on firmly, and the sound quality is great for a $15 headphone. I use them with a DAC (Fiio E6) which really brings them to life."
303,5.0 out of 5 stars,They're a great fit!
304,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Man can I get a nother set, yes, and soonMan do I love these at work they don't slip off my head while working. That is always a bonus."
305,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really like mine so ordered some for my wife. She likes them too.
306,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headset. Comfortable.
308,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. They are light weight, not tight on the ears, and the one chord from the ear pieces to the plug is just long enough to reach my phone without tripping me up. You can hear the sound even when you're not wearing it, so a quiet bus ride might get you some looks but great for the gym!"
309,3.0 out of 5 stars,Old school style
310,4.0 out of 5 stars,little rough on the ears after a long run. but cant beat it for the price
311,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are exactly what I was looking for. They sound great and no one can hear what I'm listening to. They don't hurt my ears and they don't mess up my hair. :)
312,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Hurt my ears a little after wearing them all day, but great sound for what they are."
313,3.0 out of 5 stars,They don't fit well.
314,3.0 out of 5 stars,falls apart really easily - they work and they are cheap - but they do fall apart- the felt on the ear pieces continually fall off
315,3.0 out of 5 stars,They worked for a bit
316,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They fit great and they are nice for working out as they don't bounce around. There is just one cable (instead of 2, 1 coming from each side) which makes it less bulky and more comfortable. I can't talk about durability yet, I've only had them one week."
317,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've bought 3 pairs of these headphones over the past several years. They last a long time given the price. They're great for exercising or everday use.
319,5.0 out of 5 stars,Would order again!
320,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound. Not as good quality as they used to be a few years ago but worth the cost. Cord could be a little longer.
321,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The work great and they are cheap...
What else can you ask for?"
322,5.0 out of 5 stars,love are very easy to wear
323,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kinda cheap for a Sony product...but they get the job done.
324,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and good sound. I use hearing aids so I can't use ear buds.
325,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite headphones for running. I've tried a lot and these fit the best and provide good enough sound for exercising.
326,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty disappointing sound from these headphones. I know they are not spendy but I expected more sound. They are to quiet and if there is any ambient noise going on around you, you'll barely be able to hear anything out of these."
327,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can wear it to bed, in the car and out to eat."
328,5.0 out of 5 stars,works great
330,5.0 out of 5 stars,a+
331,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yea.
332,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm happy with the quality of these headphones and I can't find this style in stores anymore in my hometown!! Thanks again! !!
333,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fair stuff
334,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and effective. Great for cycling and working out.
335,5.0 out of 5 stars,my 13 year old loves them and this generation is picky about thier headphones
336,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really enjoy this product while exercising.
Thanks"
337,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality and fast delivery. No complaints.
338,3.0 out of 5 stars,Takes some time to break in. and look out it shorts out easy.
339,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just the thing to make note booking peaceful.
341,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my Mother who listens to her Sony Walkman late into the night. She complained about the regular earphones being uncomfortable but she loves these. I will probably order more.
342,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the same pair for running for a couple of years. They get covered in sweat without skipping a beat. I bought a second pair for the gym bag that also get wet and take the additional abuse of residing in the bag. Both pairs still work great. They are plenty loud enough to isolate me from the gym music and the sound quality is plenty adequate. While I don't love them for watching netflix on the iPad, for the other described uses I could not be happier - especially for the price."
343,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones because almost all earbuds that I try on tend to fall out. These were too wide for my head so only the front part of the pads were touching. The plastic ear rest is uncomfortable and the top of my ears will start to hurt if I use them for an extended period of time. The audio is also pretty low even when I fully press the pads to my ear.
344,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exactly what I wanted. Not the world greatest headphones, but they fit comfortably and aren't constantly falling out at the gym like earbuds."
345,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased. Comfortable and good sound.
346,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife wanted these for jogging, and she loves them. No complaints!"
347,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable, very good sound quality. I had a set from Sony prior to this and used them daily for about a year before I had any issues. That's pretty good durability as far as I'm concerned compared to other headphones in this price range."
348,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very unstylish and a little bulky but they are reliable and stay on my head when I work out, I've ordered these many times because of how reliable they are, don't care if I get glares in the gym for looking like I'm living in the 90s."
349,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent fit behind the head with ball cap or ski cap.
350,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for running!
352,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband absolutely loves these headphones. He's tried several kinds and this is his favorite. They last him about a year or so because he sleeps with them on. It wears out the pads and they break off where the speaker meets the band. But other than that, he loves the quality of sound. I hope he won't wear them to bed anymore since they may not be making these much longer. Can't find them in the stores anywhere."
353,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works as expected
354,5.0 out of 5 stars,they are easy to wear i like them thank you
355,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was looking for headphones to wear while walking/jogging. Earbuds tend to fall out of my ears so I've given up on them for active pursuits. These wore perfectly. They rest comfortably on my ears and the sound quality is good for the price.
356,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these headphones. Work perfectly for me. Will buy again.
357,4.0 out of 5 stars,can take a beating good for workouts good sound
358,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this style headphones, and this model is inexpensive, durable, and black. Regarding audio quality, I can't really say. It seems OK, but my ears ain't what they used to be."
359,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT FOR WORK OUTS
360,5.0 out of 5 stars,great bass
361,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great earphone set, and it rests perfectly around the back of the neck. The sound is really good stereo, and music sounds wonderful! Great!! And thanks!"
363,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality.
Hat finder"
364,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sounds very well (not a tremendous amount of gain, but more than enough depending on the source you are using), look great, they're comfortable, and cheap. What else do you want?"
365,3.0 out of 5 stars,I got these to wear while at the gym. The don't get in the way and don't seem to get too sweaty while running. The sound is good and loud enough to drown out the gym noise.
366,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product fine as expected.
367,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is good and the headphones are comfortable after getting used to wearing them for longer periods of time.
368,4.0 out of 5 stars,"would have liked the cord to have been a bit longer, but other wise just fine"
369,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like it. Thank you.
370,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great. Sound is good and they are very durable. I do not pay a lot for headphones because they usually break easily and quickly. I run for an hour 5-6 days a week and I have little to no discomfort. This is my second pair. First pair is still working fine. HAd for about 6 months. If your looking for a low price headphone, these are worth it."
371,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value. Work really well.
372,4.0 out of 5 stars,Still working after about a year and a half so it's worth it.
374,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very good product for the price. It is light and comfortable. I wear it for about an hour before needing a break. Music is clear, detailed and crisp - I say this after trying three other low-priced headphones. The only fault is that the music is a bit bright and there could be a little more bass. But you are not going to get Grado or other top-quality sound for $20 or less. My wife has the similar Phillips product, which is pretty good, but the Sony sounds better. I tried some DJ style phones that were heavy and uncomfortable. If you're going to splurge, the expensive Bose are light, comfortable and have very accurate sound. But the Sony is good for the price."
375,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nice headphone that replaces an older worn out similar pair. I think the sound is even better in this new one. I know it does not compare to very expensive ones, but these are perfect for me...good treble, mid range and bass. They fit neatly on my head which is rather small. I think they may be tight, at least at first, for a large person. I have not had them long enough to tell if they stretch in size with use. They are great for using on a tread mill or for running etc."
376,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this style for learning music on my walks. These are comfortable and the sound quality is good.
377,2.0 out of 5 stars,There is a seam on the neckband for the wire and it has sharp edges. After a while it feels very rough on the top of your ears. They should have put it on the top of the band so the smooth side would rest on your ears instead.
378,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The design of these headphones is the main reason why I have them, but the sound quality is a definite plus. I use these all the time when I do live radio broadcasts on location. The slim design allows them to be packed in the equipment cases easily, and the sound quality allows me to hear everything that I need to when in use."
379,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is good. Looks fine. Uncomfortable on the ears. The plastic is rough/cheap and doesn't feel good on the back of your ears. Would not recommend.
380,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these kinds of headphones and I HATE that they can only be found in online stores these days. I'm always worried that the next set I buy will be the last available. I wish they would make wireless versions exactly like these (Sony USED to). Anyway, I'm wearing a pair right now; and, while they COULD be more comfortable while sitting writing online reviews (they're kind of tight), there is NO headphone set I've ever had that I like better for running or working out--I just wish they were wireless."
381,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones and have bought many pairs over the years. The behind the neck style is perfect for my body when it comes to comfort and staying in place. I'm also pretty hard on them and they'll still usually last a couple years.
382,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones fit well and will not slip off. There are two things I do not like about them. The first is the cord is too short, it needs to be about a foot longer. The second problem is the jack comes to a 90 degree angle which means it twists alot when you move around with it. This movement results in the sound cutting out on one or both of the headphone speakers."
383,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My only issue is that other people can hear my music when i have it on. I think i don't listen to my music that highly too. But if you don't mind it, this is a great headphone. I always loved neckband headphones."
385,3.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones work way better than the earbuds but my ears must weird because after about on hour my ears hurt. My husband will only use this brand and he loves them.
386,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work well and sound good.
387,5.0 out of 5 stars,My old neckband headphones -- also Sony -- lasted more than 5 years. These appear at least as durable and sound just fine.
388,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them
389,5.0 out of 5 stars,I received them and they have worked perfectly. The cord is longer than the generic brand I had previously. Worth every penny.
390,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the style of these headphones and they have lasted a long time for me.
391,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works and fits as expected a product I used 15 years ago and it feels like a retro purchase!
392,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had a few pairs of these headphones over the last four or so years, and each one has been extremely durable with good sound... That is, until the most recent pair I purchased to replace the previous pair I had misplaced. I didn't even use them once, because as I attempted to put them on, they snapped in half. Very disappointing."
393,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My FAVORITE headphones!
Great sound, comfortable, durable and a great selection for those who like a little more than what earbuds have to offer!"
394,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband loves working out with this style of headphones. They stay in place and don't pop out like ear buds often do. They're inexpensive and have become harder to find in stores. Like always I turned to Amazon and they're a great price.
396,5.0 out of 5 stars,I don't like the new style of headphones that either are inserted into the ear or cover the whole entire head. These are the old style of headphones that aren't overly large nor insert into the ear canal. Good sound too :)
397,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works fine, worth the price."
398,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 2nd headset. The first one lasted For 3years. Using them everyday to listen to the TV from 7 PM to 1 AM.
399,4.0 out of 5 stars,i love these. Use them on stage as headphone monitors. pick up monitor mix very well without too much noise isolation. I want to be able to hear like normal but still have a headphone monitor and these are perfect.
400,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love them. Can't stand in ear anything. Wish they had other colors."
401,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not very comfortable. Ear pieces fall apart easily. Sound is decent. You get what you pay for, inexpensive, and not great quality for approx. $15"
402,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones! They take a beating at the gym and I bought 2 pair so I have a back up.
403,4.0 out of 5 stars,More expensive than I would like but it doesn't hurt my ears like some cheaper models have and the sound is surprisingly good. Better than I expected.
404,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dogs eat the covers but I still use them. They could be a little tighter!!!!
405,5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife loves them
407,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughter. In her opinion they are superior to earbuds, so she is very pleased with the sound and fit of them."
408,3.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, but not as smooth and natural as the Sony GDR-G54LP which, sadly, is no longer available."
409,5.0 out of 5 stars,my favorite headphones because they stay on my head during all situations
410,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the headphones!
411,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work well if u don't like the buds in your ear
412,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the favorite style of headphones in our house. They are comfortable and last as long as any other headphones we've purchased.
No complaints about sound quality - mostly used for listening to audiobooks."
413,3.0 out of 5 stars,Itchy covers that go on the ear.
414,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought a pair of these years ago for running. I can't use anything else. My old pair died on me, but I am happy I found these. They work great!"
415,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi Purple Pear. I ordered this headphone on the six of October and I've only been using this for 10 days, the left side of the headphone is not making any noise anymore. I need to know what can be done at your end in this situation??"
416,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones sound great for the price. The behind the head design is terrific because I frequently wear a hat when working outside. I use them frequently.
418,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones! Are waterproof and durable! I highly recommend them!
419,5.0 out of 5 stars,A-OK
420,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice song quality for low price,
Just the cable is short little bite"
421,5.0 out of 5 stars,the ear buds have never really fit in my ears properly so this style has always been my first choice in regards to headphones. These have good sound quality and are very durable!
422,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked perfectly with my elderly mother's old-school portable Sony radio.
423,3.0 out of 5 stars,They are not adjustable. They pinch into my upper ear.
424,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best headphones I've ever had. Not the most attractive, but great for the gym because they never fall off or get in the way."
425,5.0 out of 5 stars,"lets face it, sony still makes great electronics. I use these with my samsung gear vr and they dont get in the way at all, and i love em."
426,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fine sound and comfort for an outside walk. Captures audio range for classical music.
427,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Fits the purpose, the sound quality is okey, however it becomes uncomfortable when worn for long periods."
429,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I realized after purchasing these headphones that they are not the ones I was looking for. My Sony MDR-G75LW headphones broke, but the sound quality is incredible and the retractable cord is awesome, so I wanted a new pair. These aren't available anywhere anymore. I can't wear earphones because my ears are too small, so I still have to purchase neckband headphones. The MDR-G45LP's have terrible sound quality and I'm very disappointed."
430,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These fit around my head perfectly and stay in place no matter what activity I am engaged in. It's not the highest quality
sound reproduction but I am very happy with the quality regardless."
431,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This product never worked, the right ear phone had a disconnected wire. Will not order from Amazon again."
432,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are excellent value for money, comparing quiet well to the most expensive brands. No real criticisms."
433,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stays in place while I'm moving good sound.
434,5.0 out of 5 stars,"about fifteen years ago, i bought a pair of these, and used them CONSTANTLY, sitting on them and stepping on them and throwing them around - taking them to other countries, sleeping with them on at night. the sound was perfect, and just what i wanted in a headphone... and the pair i ordered here is just the same. i am very pleased, and thankful to have my trusty headphones back. <3"
435,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The work well enough, but the fit is a little strange."
436,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ""snapped"" it before and hopefully, I will not do it again!"
437,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love these - they remind me of the old Sony S2 Sports headphones. They stay on great during weight lifting and jogging.
438,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this brand and model for a long time now and they work really well. After years my old pair finally broke, so I was happy that this kind was still available."
440,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphone value (which is certainly not a 300$ Sennheiser value, but...) for this money and great for sports."
441,4.0 out of 5 stars,I am hard of hearing and have several stationed around the house as needed. They are comfortable and sound great.
442,5.0 out of 5 stars,These feel good on my head and are almost hidden since they wrap around the back of your head and they sound good. They work well for someone who is uncomfortable with ear buds.
443,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because they got good reviews, but they sound terrible to me. There is absolutely no bass. I'm not looking for overpowering bass like the rap fanatics like, I prefer accurate reproduction, these headphones are not close to accurate."
444,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad headphones. Get a little uncomfortable after wearing for long workouts, but well worth the money..."
445,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old headphones stopped working on the right side. And they were behind the neck style which I really enjoy now! I really enjoy these, the only problem is the cord isn't long enough, but I'm happy either way! :)"
446,5.0 out of 5 stars,i like these. i can't use earbuds and these are a great alternative
447,5.0 out of 5 stars,Always buy over and over.Mine keep being borrowed!
448,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones - they sound fine and sit just right. Earbuds annoy me to no end, so for me - these are the best out there for a simple 'all-around' set of headphones."
449,5.0 out of 5 stars,When working out doors it does not fall off.
451,4.0 out of 5 stars,Don't like earbud headphones. These are great. I like how they fit against your ears vs inside.
452,5.0 out of 5 stars,simple but great sounding headphones excellent for listening to for any type of music. I definitely recommend to anyone. Thansks
453,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. Really comfortable. Great for walking. I can still hear outside noises like cars when walking, running etc.."
454,3.0 out of 5 stars,OK
455,4.0 out of 5 stars,Item as stated
456,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great.
457,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these. Not too big, sound quality is great."
458,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome - and you didn't waste $$$ on one of those worthless 'rapper' style headsets
459,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived quickly, sound pretty decent,. Now, to put down other buyers- it's $15, to judge so harshly on quality is rediculous. If you're expecting down feather comfort, then they might be a bit scratchy on the ears. Or if your last pair were Beats by Dre, sound quality isn't up top notch. But for being an inexpensive pair that are meant (personally) for taking workout abuse, they're perfect."
460,5.0 out of 5 stars,great
462,5.0 out of 5 stars,great for the gym
463,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Weak headphones, the drivers have poor sensitivity. Comfortable enough for behind the ear."
464,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I jog and walk alot, the ear buds never worked in my ears, but this headphone set stays off my sweaty head, gives me good sound and is lightweight. Use it all the time, running, walking, working in the yard...GREAT BUY!"
465,4.0 out of 5 stars,Received timely and as advertised
466,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound was poor, but I expected it for the price. They were not as good as the old Sony neckband headphones they replaced."
467,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's very comfortable.Sound quality is good.I have also Philips SHS 5200.Sony is better than comfort from philips
468,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable
469,5.0 out of 5 stars,Only HP's I use. Thanks for having them. There Sony so great sound. Awesome!!
470,5.0 out of 5 stars,purchased as a Christmas gift for my mother in law- very lightweight- but doesnt look cheap! She is enjoying it
471,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast service; great product
473,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Behind the neck headphones are the best, most comfortable style of headphone to wear. With these, you're also getting premium sound quality. Sony is still the best when it comes to headphones."
474,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have worn these MDR-g45LP head phones for several years and they are the only ones that were durable and provide good transmission of sound.
475,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love everything about these except that they start to hurt behind my ears after I wear them for awhile (over an hour).
476,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best headphones at the right price.
477,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable and fits my ears with little sensation. The electronics pick up the
signals easily without having to turn up the volume so much."
478,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for this old cat
479,1.0 out of 5 stars,They broke a week after I bought them. Very disappointed.
480,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great! Inexpensive, pretty good consumer headphones."
481,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works just as I wanted it to! Great item!
482,4.0 out of 5 stars,"soundd is good. they are so light you won't even notice when wearing them. Good quality product, I use these when running and sweat in them a lot... never had any issues with it."
484,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these! I owned the same headphones previously but after 2 years of wear and tear I needed new ones. I just hope they keep selling them! I do a lot of running and can't stand the new ear bud trend, as they don't stay in your ears. These have good sound quality and stay put on your ears....please keep selling these!!"
485,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice bass response, clear highs. Sits on the ear surprisingly well! Very impressed with these inexpensive headphones."
486,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I always buy these Sony brand neckband headphones..
BUT- after only a couple months the wiring on the L-shaped jack came apart!!
(..same thing happened to the pair I bought for my roomate.)

ALSO- the bass is awful!! You'll need to boost the EQ for whatever device you're using.

Just from the look and feel- you'll instantly notice a decrease in quality if you've purchased similar Sony headphones in the past.

PS:
The foam ear pieces wont stay attached for long either....."
487,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple lightweight design with good sound that doesn't tire my neck.
488,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair, love them. Great sound quality and very comfortable. I wore out the first one, but it lasted a long time. Great price too."
489,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these at the gym 6 days a week and they are still going strong. They take a beating and still work like new. Very good sound quality. They don't isolate the sound like ""beats"" do, but I am fine with that. For the money these are a no brainer."
490,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm probably one of the few that enjoys this type of headphones anymore. I love how they are secure to my head when I'm wearing them. The sound quality is great.
491,5.0 out of 5 stars,Inexpensive. Lightweight. Very nice.
492,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound quality and very comfortable fit.
493,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simple and light weight. Just what I wanted. I'm wearing these over the mic of my BTE (behind the ear) hearing aid, so works well together."
495,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For years, the Sony MDR-G45LP Street Style Neckband Headphones were my go-to headphones. They were cheap, durable, and best of all, they sounded great. They would normally last me about 6 months before the headphone jack would rip off, and about a month later the sound in one side would eventually go out. For me, 6 months is a long time for headphones. These headphones were, however, extremely painful on my ears. I had to remove them after a while because they would hurt really badly and I had to rub my ears. These are no longer my headphones of choice, I have moved onto to the most popular pair of headphones by Panasonic."
496,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Sony headphones were exactly what I was looking for as a replacement pair for my boyfriend. I was worried these would be too small for him but they sit perfectly on him and are not too small. The sound is great and they are well-made. I recommend.
497,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought these headphones three times in the last 9 years or so. I usually get 2-3 years of use out of them before they begin to short out. I hate ear buds, and clunky headphones. I can wear these with my hoodie or baseball cap. Very useful for urban exploration. Good balance of sound and volume too! A little stiff out of the box, but you get used to them and they loosen up a bit. I hope they never stop making this model because at ~$20 / pair they are a good bargain and investment. Much more durable them some of the higher end ones out there."
498,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones, they're the only ones I can use. So comfortable. Cann't use earbuds because they hurt my ears. Please don't stop making them!!!"
499,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I do like these Sony MDR-G45LP headphones a lot. They are super comfortable, light weight, offer good sound, and most important, stay in place when I'm walking. For me, the fit is just right. However, when compared to the Philips Rich Bass Neckband Headphones SHS5200/28 (also sold on Amazon), the Sony's sound isn't quite as robust. The downfall with the Philips are they are a little bulky, and don't stay on my ears as well as the Sonys. So, for sitting at my desk, I prefer the Philips. For walking, the Sony wins. Both are great buys for the money."
500,3.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are uncomfortable behind one ear. I've bought this type before and liked them. These not so much.
501,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The plastic headband is cheap and poor quality plastic, broke after 5 uses, 6 weeks after I brought it. I bought the same model 5 years ago and it still works but the new model is apparently much worse quality material."
502,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy them. At $14 they are a steal. Easily worth double the cost. I use them for running and they stay on my ears and have great sound. I plan to buy backups in case sony decides to discontinue them. They are the only over the ear head phone that works for me. I've tried the FX-Sport for $160 and had it slip off my ears. Just buy it.
503,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These have held up being thrown in my gym bag and back pack, but they aren't especially comfortable. They do stay on, but since they aren't adjustable, they often get in the way of my ponytail or hood. Good for the price, but not my favorite."
504,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I give these a 3 because the sound quality is not great, however, I do love them. I had an original pair in the 90's and love these just as much as my originals. I got them so I could sleep comfortably with them on and I do. Great for night time listening."
506,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I go through a lot of headphones with all my cardio workouts. Ether the sweating or the occasional yanking on the cord as I swing my arms eventually doom them. These inexpensive headphones are hardly the most comfortable or produce the best sound quality, but they fit my need -- cheap enough that I can treat them as disposable. Also, since I'm using them for workouts, I don't need to worry about the best sound quality.

So in short, very inexpensive headphones that I don't need to worry about getting damaged."
507,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great for canceling out annoying girls at the gym however they will not cancel out tmi loud grunts. I love them because you don't have to keep adjusting like earbuds
508,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is good, but, uncomfortable for me.,"
509,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have at least 4 pairs of these. They work on my ipod, my laptop, even my ham radio. The sound is reasonably good, and the workmanship is first-rate. I wear these to watch full-length movies and they never get uncomfortable.

For the price I haven't found anything tht comes close. Get an extra pair of earpads and if you find the phones are too tight, try heating the neck band with a hair dryer while bending it outward."
510,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second pair I bought for my son. He still has the first one and since he liked them so much, I got a second pair for him to use with his other computer. He said they are better than the very expensive headphones he has. For the price, they are great!!"
511,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is acceptable for my use (on air in a news studio). My real reason is to not have headphones wrapped over the top of my head. These are perfect for that purpose. They are lightweight and just what I need for radio.
512,3.0 out of 5 stars,I wear them all day every day. They are comfy. Just too much treble not much bass and not as loud as the last brand I paid more for but they're durable.
513,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them always. Will never switch from these headphones, unless Sony stops making them and forces me to."
514,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Can't be harsh seeing as they are less than $20, but you get what you pay for. Seems like the volume isn't near as high with these compared to any of my past headsets of varying type. Not crazy about how they fit on my ears either."
515,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, especially for sleeping onboard a ship."
517,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent sound for the price, BUT! this headphone are painful to wear for more that 15 minutes,
I Don't recommend."
518,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these! No problems as of yet. I use them in the gym a few times a week.
519,5.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't think I would ever find another good pair of headphones that would stay on while working out. I sweat a LOT!!! and I was tired of the headphones in the past sliding off of my ears...These work perfectly. Even while laying down on the bench.
520,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this style of headphones. Good for working out.
521,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Replacement for previous behind the neck headphones and these are great. Perfect fit, good sound."
522,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound! I run in these and they seem to be sweat proof too.
523,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are extremely comfortable, and the behind the head part doesn't stick out like another model I had. I hear the music well, yet I can still hear surrounding environmental sounds so I'm not oblivious to what's going on around me."
524,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these for my 20 year old granddaughter. She picked them out, and she was very pleased with them, so I was, too."
525,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones!!
526,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite headphones. I dislike most earbuds, they fall out and it just feels weird to jam something up your ear every time, Great solution for those who feel the same."
528,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best. The way it fits is perfect, your hair looks decent and it is not like those ear plugs that hurt the ear and falls off all the time. Since I use it while working/walking it is stable and the sound is good."
529,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
530,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Product! Arrived exactly as expected, high quality."
531,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These really stay put and have great sound quality for long runs. After a while they hurt the outer edges of my ears, but if I just adjust them, they are fine."
532,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Durable headphones. Good deal. When I wear the headphones that you have to wear around your head it always breaks. I like that it is very flexible, I lay down with it on all the time and fall asleep with it on and it is still working fine. Great product."
533,5.0 out of 5 stars,I do not like having my headphones over the top of my hair. I do not like sticking things in my ears either. This is perfect for me.
534,3.0 out of 5 stars,These sound pretty good and are fairly cheap but will only last about 1-2 years and then the side without a cord will start to not have sound.
535,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are excellent for anyone who needs some higher frequency boost to their music. They produce a very nice higher-end balance which is welcomed by those with a typical hearing loss. I can now enjoy music without compromise.
536,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product ,very comfortable fits behind your neck and very affordable."
537,5.0 out of 5 stars,worth every penny.
539,5.0 out of 5 stars,walk every day with my ipod ... love the comfort of this and the quality is sweet sound ...
540,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality can be better.
541,5.0 out of 5 stars,boom.
542,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The angle of the ear pads just doesn't feel right, but besides that, they sound great and what I wanted for my desk listening at work."
543,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my favorite running headphones because they get loud, sound pretty good and are comfortable without ever falling off. For anyone who finds earbuds annoying to run with (due to sweat, the bouncing of the cord or just discomfort), this is a great pair of headphones."
544,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice and tight. I'm really glad this type of style of headphones is still around, since it is a superb style to work with. Would buy again!"
545,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 4th pair. Love the way they sound.
546,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ORDERED THIS HEADSET BECAUSE I CAN'T STAND ANYTHING ON TOP OF MY HEAD. THEY WORK REALLY WELL EVEN WITH MY GLASSES AND SUNGLASSES ON.
547,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have owned several of these and i am never disappointed. They have a reasonable lifetime with general use and i rarely replace the because they stop working. more often they are stolen by family members or friends. Neither case is a big loss because of the awesome price you can get them for
548,5.0 out of 5 stars,i dont know what all the other people writing bad reviews about these headphones are bitchin about they have amazing sound quality and are so comfortable compared to the old pair i had before that was the same style and the ear pads had worn and i had to take them off it was from a different brand but these these are great i dont know if i can say enough good things about them just a good product sony.
550,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As others have written, these are a really tight fit and make one year very sore after half an hour of use."
551,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great. Arrived in original packaging
552,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the behind the neck headphones, they stay on. But most are just not comfortable and put too much pressure on the ears. Since my favorites are no longer available, these are the most comfortable of this style that I have found. So 5 stars for comfort. However, the sound quality (tone in particular) is only OK. A bit ""thin"". So 1 star off for that."
553,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Being hearing impaired it is very difficult to find a comfortable headphone that I can use during workout activities. I have ""behind the ear"" hearing aids with a tube placed in the ear canals. This headphone causes no pressure on the tubes nor does the neckband interfere with the hearing aids. I highly recommend this headphone."
554,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product for the price. I bought an extension chord in case the included one was too short, so that wasn't an issue."
555,4.0 out of 5 stars,I liked the reproduction of the music. Its the ideal companion for long journey. Your imagination will be fulfilled listening to its soothing sound.
556,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stays firmly on your head. Love the quality.
557,4.0 out of 5 stars,great
558,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are cheap and so don't expect much. For me, they don't sit on my ear very tightly so the sound isn't very good - when I press them to my ear it is great. OK for talks shows etc."
559,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product thanks
561,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 2nd pair, the first pair I bought lasted several years. I was pleased to see that they were still available. They're nothing fancy but I find them comfortable and they do the job!"
562,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price great product
563,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This style is one of the few that fit me when running. Earbuds tend to slip out. Sound is pretty good/clear. Quality of build is not great, but at this price not surprising."
564,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphone is too tight around my head, gives me a headache when I use it. It would be best if the was a way adjust the headphones to the different head sizes/neck lengths."
565,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 2nd pair. 1st pair lasted about 5 years. Great for running. Unlike earbuds these stay put while running.
566,5.0 out of 5 stars,This Sony behind-the-ear headphones work very nicely. This is my second pair. The first lasted a long time and only quit when I damaged them myself.
567,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphone jack doesn't last that long, and the headphone pads wear kind of quickly, but these are the best around-the-ear headphones I can get for this price, so I would definitely recommend them."
568,1.0 out of 5 stars,breaks real easy
569,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these. So happy to not have buds in my ear. So happy Sony still makes these.
570,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the money, I haven't found anything close. The next group of headphones that sound as good as these are priced over $50."
572,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Hard to find these in stores anymore, just like the pair I had 10 years ago"
573,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot handle headphones that have a lot of base, as far as I am concerned, these are the most balance with the most true to sound.
Also, I am a custom jeweler,who likes to watch tv while I work, I wear head magnifiers and behind the neck headphones don't get in the way."
574,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great .
575,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A few months months and still functioning. Comparing other similar products, this does the job atleast"
576,4.0 out of 5 stars,great for the gym. wish they had the volume/music controls on the cord though. otherwise great. comfortable and decent sound for the price.
577,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these to use with a CB radio on a motorcycle. I intended to remove the neck band to fit the ear cups in a helmet. I was unable to do that because the wiring is embedded in the neck band. The only way to use them is with the neck band which is solid and has no adjustment. The headphones hang over the ears rather loosely as the neck band has weak tension. This is a good sounding head set for sitting around or gentle walking. My solution was to wear them with a half helmet in order to keep them in place. I would recommend these for the good sound quality they produce, and the low cost."
578,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice headphones for that money
579,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony behind the neck headphones, awesome little product for anyone looking to listen to music or podcasts on their phone. Good quality construction and performance. Recommended. Pretty inexpensive too."
580,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good enough as my running headphones. Expect to replace it much sooner than other sets. Audio is not great, but not much expecting much. Also, allows me to to still hear ambient noise on my runs. Fit is a little loose. All in all, it's what I expected for this price point and my intended use."
581,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband loves these. They work out great when he goes to the gym because they are not in the way of his exercising.
583,5.0 out of 5 stars,"good sound to it. been looking for replacements for a while, but can't find them in stores anymore."
584,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these things! I can still hear cars and things I need to hear, unlike the ones that go directly in the ear."
585,2.0 out of 5 stars,Cheaply made & will hurt your ears after long usage. Very disappointed.
586,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I still use my Walkman while, well, walking, and these headphones are the best. Much better than over-the-head phones, and stick-this-in-your-ears devices. One of my best finds and buys."
587,5.0 out of 5 stars,"works great for those people who want headphones but not their hair messed up, like myself. Sounds decent for the price..."
588,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay sound quality, but really perfect for working out"
589,5.0 out of 5 stars,A wonderful headphone and it arrived a lot earlier.The headphone is not 100% accurate but it has a decent sound quality.But that doesn't matter because of the low price.Comparing with the price it is a very good deal.
590,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these head phones and the design. Buying a second pair as well, they are that good."
591,5.0 out of 5 stars,I run a lot and listen to audio books. I do not like the headphones that go right in the ear. These are over the ear headphones and I want to order five extra pair just to be ready for the day they don't work. I've had one set that's been working for over two years. Only ordered another pair when I was in NYC for a month and forgot to pack them
592,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the fit of these !
594,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can not beat the quality for the price. I much prefer the over the ear vs in the ear.
595,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound. Fits a little snug on my head, but worth the price."
596,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought 2 of these for my daughter for Christmas. She loves them! Great sound. Comfortable to wear. Very satisfied with this purchase.
597,2.0 out of 5 stars,They broke after a month.
598,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Work well with good sound and are lightweight, but if you have the old Sony's that were similar style don't expect them to fit the same. These are a little bigger and stick out a bit more behind the neck."
599,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice audio quality for the price.
I use these headphones while working out"
600,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, great deal for the piece"
601,4.0 out of 5 stars,Simple headphones that sound great.
602,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound and very comfortable.
603,5.0 out of 5 stars,GOOD
605,1.0 out of 5 stars,Digs into my ear that it hurts after wearing for a short time.
606,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones, i have had 3 pair in the past 6 years. I put them through hell in the gym. If I should break them, I'm only out of what $19. Great deal for the head phones!!! They very are comfortable to the ears unlike earbuds"
607,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great and beauty product!!!
608,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Holding up well a year later, would recommend"
609,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are just ""OK"". I really don't recommend them. Although the sound is good, the earpieces are uncomfortable. I probably should have read some of the reviews prior to ordering."
610,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them! Great sound
611,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great delivery time! Overall fit uis great and convenient. However, the sound quality could use a good bit of upgrading. NO BASS!!!"
612,5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect
613,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use them everyday to listen to music at work.
614,4.0 out of 5 stars,good
616,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible sound. Even taking into account price, etc., they fall way below the quality of the similarly-priced Phillips ear-clips (which have their own issues, but still have a fuller, better sound)."
617,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say, Sony has done it again. High quality product at a great price. I personally prefer Sony for everything when it comes to electronics. I work as an IT professional and deal with electronics on a day to day basis so I have experience with everything you can think of and I still can't find anything that beats Sony when it comes to quality.

These headphones were purchased for an employee who listens to training videos and calls all day long. She complain her old headset was not comfortable and was looking to change. After purchasing these, she has no issues wearing them for long periods of time and the sound quality is wonderful.

What you are getting is a high quality headphones at an amazing price. We have not had the item long enough to comment on durability but if they are anything like other Sony products I own, they will last for many years. Thank you Amazon and Sony!"
618,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Original pair finally broke after what feels like 10 years of use and bought a replacement. Great, light, headphones. Sound quality is pretty decent for the price and weight! Rather clean output!"
619,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They were considered high-quality headphones before the irrationally priced Dr Dre Beats. I haven't worn any of the $100+ pairs of late, and don't have a need to with these.

I used these at the gym and working around the house. My first pair lasted for years of sweating (cat killed them). I now prefer wireless, but my wife uses these at the gym.

Comfortable wearing up to 3-4 hrs, then irritation behind the ears. Good for bench pressing but not lying on a pillow.

Bonus star for value."
620,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. They are so much more streamline than an older pair I had. These stay where they should and the sound is great. We ditched cable and watch videos on our laptops which these headphone are perfect for. They are not advertised as noise blocking, but I did not want that. I can hear the videos well without completely blocking the family out. I have had for a few months and they have not been always gently handled. They have done very well. I would buy them again."
621,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product. I use it every day. it works great and I am still able to listen to people talk when they are in use. Thanks.
622,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After several years of daily use, my son's other pair just like this broke. We tried an over the head style, but they squeezed his ears and weren't as comfortable, possibly because he wears glasses. So, back to the Sony headphones we go. We had to replace the foam ear covers on the last ones, but these are a great price & if this pair lasts even close to as long as the last pair did, I'll be more than satisfied."
623,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to replace a pair of smaller ""behind the neck"" in the ear Steinhauser headphones that got a frayed wire after three years of use by two different users as ""Gym headphones"" for an MP3 player. These are more comfortable than the ""in the ear"" style, and we like the 90 degree connector for the MP3 player because it is less likely to catch on things during a workout on the machine floor at the Fitness Center."
624,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfy Cozy while I play games or watch movies. Much better than ear buds and less likely to get an ear infection.
625,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this to replace the similar version I bought in the 80's (!), which I alas left at they gym. It does what it should, but it's quite cheaply made compared to the older versions. I'd still probably buy it again, but I would wish for better quality."
627,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is a good buy for the price. It isn't as good a Bose set but for the money I spent they have good sound quality and good base. They are very comfortable behind my ears.
628,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great!!
629,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Obviously, you can find better headphones, but these are GREAT for the money."
630,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite headphones!
631,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because I needed a lightweight and comfortable pair of headphones for working out. The sound quality is 3 out of 5, but that's what I expected for a $17 pair of headphones. If you need comfort and performance for activity, go for these. If you want to lounge and enjoy music, click ""Back"" and find a different pair."
632,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought these more than once and in multiple quantities for both me and my son. It is the most comfortable set of headphones I've ever used, and my only regret is that the two of us have really worn them out and have to keep buying replacements. But the highly reasonable price also makes this possible."
633,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are cool. They play loud enough for me.The only thing I wish I could change on these are the low bass.
634,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, nice low price. I can't wear ear bud and these are so comfortable. Highly recommend"
635,3.0 out of 5 stars,They're ok. Short cord and the padding is almost non existent.
636,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They stay on when running, and they sound good. I've had these headphones for 5 years now, and I just bought my second pair. You just have to replace the foam covers once in a while, but it still works great."
638,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They're fine, nothing special. I don't like the earbuds at the gym, but these do a great job, get regular use, and sound fine over the hum of machines and Gym-music."
639,5.0 out of 5 stars,thanks
640,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for someone who hates headphones in his ears, he adored these and said they sound good and are comfortable. Would buy again as a gift."
641,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product. I like this style of head phones.
642,5.0 out of 5 stars,bought these for hubby and he likes these very much. He says they have nice sound and they fit well.
643,4.0 out of 5 stars,This my second pair. My first pair lasted for years.
644,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With my hair style going from clean cut to full on fro, behind the neck style headphones have always worked best for me. They travel well even if I just throw them into my work bag. Great sound quality for the price."
645,5.0 out of 5 stars,To everybody these Sony over the ear headphones are the best in the world. Theses my favorite headphones because it is perfect for when u ride your bike. Great riding bike headphones
646,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I wanted. They sound great and are comfortable to wear.
647,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job.
649,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product
650,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this style of headphone for practicing my electric guitar quietly. The neck style band and single sided cord stays out of the way better than most headphones. Unlike some headphones in this price range, these don't seem to color the sound."
651,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad for the price. Lead is plenty long, Sound not great but ok for the price."
652,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good value. Prefer these while exercising vs. the ear buds.
653,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It produces poor quality sound, mine was making buzzing sound when listening to music, and the plastic part that goes around my ears hurts my ears
I'm returning this product"
654,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is great.
655,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really can't recommend these. I purchased them to replace my Sony MDR-G42s, which were broken. But the sound quality of these is FAR INFERIOR. I was taken in by the price - but even at $14, they're a bust"
656,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good value for the money, my second purchase. Perfect for biking, fits below helmet."
657,5.0 out of 5 stars,"cheap, good sound for what they are and price"
658,4.0 out of 5 stars,good
660,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Behind the neck headphones are the only type of headphones that don't hurt my ears! The audio isn't perfect but it's not bad at all, so I'd still recommend it!"
661,5.0 out of 5 stars,this is the best headphones for a busy workout.fits right over a ponytail
662,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a large head according to my hat size. I have tried multiple behind the neck bands and have found most of them uncomfortable where the band presses behind my ears. I have returned several due to them being unwearable. I found one type that I loved - a Phillips/Nike brand that was extremely light and flexible with silicone ear pads. But the wire eventually broke at the back of the band due to the constant bending. By that time it was discontinued. Sigh. I have invested more money in the Sennheiser PMX95 with floating ear pieces, which are very comfortable. Plus the wire is made of a flex cord so it is unlikely to break. So if you have found this to be a problem, maybe that will be a solution for you."
663,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately, these headphones only last so long. They lasted longer than the more expensive Philips headphones that I bought at the same time, but I fear that they have a ""planned obsolescence."""
664,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've noticed behind-the-head headphones are difficult to find. These are comfortable, sound great, and are reasonably priced. The cord is a good length."
665,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my husband for because the ear buds can end up hurting your ears after a while and we both use our headphones almost every day and he loves these. Now he has a small head so he wears a hat so that they dont move but that is not the headphones that is his head! I would for sure buy these again!
666,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good price and comfortable to wear.... sounds pretty good too.
667,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since I don't sleep much, these are the only headphones I can use at night. Love them for walking, too... I can still wear a hat."
668,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is very good. It was worth the money.
669,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this forever and always
671,5.0 out of 5 stars,quality for price is amazing.
672,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had to return them. Defective. Could only hear out of one side. Amazon was super nice in dealing with it since the vendor was not.
673,5.0 out of 5 stars,great neck headphones!
674,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another great product at a great price.
675,4.0 out of 5 stars,As described and shipped on time.
676,5.0 out of 5 stars,My hubby loves these.
677,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not as good I think as a different set I hand that finally broke down and got discontinued. I will say it's probably the best pair I've found from my looking around and trying a couple as it seems this style seems to have gone out of style.

My only complaint which I will admit could be just me, the foam covers feel thinker and a bit lower quality than my previous, which has me worried might mean that wearing out quicker than I would like.

When the pair dies I will be looking to get this again dispite my concerns, though with this style seeming to be fazing out as long as it lasts a couple years like I would expect may mean even this isn't an option any more."
678,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased 4 or 5 brands online. Some with good sound, but break quick
Some that just deliver poor sound
this sony product is both a good sound and lasts a long time"
679,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice sound, comfortable. I hate ear buds as I find them all very uncomfortable. Have tried many different headsets to find good sound and comfort. Very pleased. Great headset."
680,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite headphones for any activity, even sleeping! Comfortable, and I forget that I have them on."
682,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Sony headphones sound great! I was very pleased with this purchase and I'm glad that I selected this brand.
683,2.0 out of 5 stars,to small
684,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The are comfortable, I can wear a cap while walking and the fidelity is pretty good. I would recommend them to anyone looking for similar headphones."
685,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent fit for the gym. Cant adjust anything on them but they do the trick.
686,1.0 out of 5 stars,This headset is basically junk. It does not make a good connection and I am constantly having to twist it in order for it to work.
687,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones for working out or at the gym, especially if you hate earbuds like I do. It's a very basic cheap plastic with simple foam insulation, but it does the job, and hasn't cracked from being stuffed into my gym bag."
688,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best ear phones in the world, yes, I said it in the world!"
689,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great set, use them for my kids' tablets"
690,3.0 out of 5 stars,These have wires.....beware
691,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very happy with these headphones, they were exactly what I'm looking for. The cable is long enough to plug into my phone and keep it in my pocket."
693,3.0 out of 5 stars,they are ok
694,4.0 out of 5 stars,good
695,5.0 out of 5 stars,Have had a pair and left them on an airplane and looked at all the high end ones out there now and came back to my favorite brand and style. Love them.
696,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING THIS TYPE OF HEADPHONE, AND AM SO VERY WELL PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH."
697,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones work better than expected.
698,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality for the price
699,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these during my workouts at the gym. They are light weight and stay on with no problem. Excellent fidelity.
700,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To me, these are perfect for exercise or traveling. I hate ear buds"
701,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work well so far and got here quickly
702,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad, could use a little bit more padding around the ear but not bad overall."
704,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No frills, functions well after months of usage and sweat."
705,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for the Price.
706,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wear these everyday working outside and they work great.
707,4.0 out of 5 stars,I take audio seriously and the brand and style make it ideal to use while running in all conditions. The price to quality is ideal for those who want the sound but not the pain of earbuds.
708,4.0 out of 5 stars,"good inexpensive earphones. the rigid plastic sometimes is a pain, but ok"
709,5.0 out of 5 stars,My kiddo loves these!
710,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent for working out--running, lifting, etc--especially for those who can't keep earbuds in their ears."
711,5.0 out of 5 stars,great
712,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these same type of headphones about 3-4 years ago. After all the time I used them, they finally gave way and I bought these. If you like this type I highly recommend them."
713,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product
715,3.0 out of 5 stars,These are rather cheap although I trusted the Sony name. You get what you pay for. Sound quality isn't the best but they do sit well on my head.
716,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight - good for mixing when you want to hear how a client would hear it through their headphones. Not exceptional quality, but they are good cheap headphones."
717,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have several pairs......good quality inexpensive headphones for listening to voice recordings in the office
718,4.0 out of 5 stars,"love this style, and these work great"
719,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product
720,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good volume, nice sound with decent bass, comfortable and I like the behind the neck design. They stay in place better while exercising."
721,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent thanks for still carrying them a wonderful alternative to blocking out the whole world. now if I can just find them.
722,3.0 out of 5 stars,These are okay for the money but lack in bass and sound distorted. I previously had a pair of Philips Neckband headphones and they were better.
723,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for the gym they sound good for the money and are tough enough for many workouts? Good price too.
724,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are replacing my old ones from Radio Shack. The sound on the replacement is great; the fit is perfect, and love the ease of use. The only problem is they doe cause a slight irritation on one ear. Because I were glasses earphones are a bit rough but only on one ear. But a little tape and the irritation is now gone. I would recommend these for both the quality and the price."
726,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy I found these. Ear buds always come out my ear working out but these stay right in place.
727,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. Had the same ones and they lasted many years.
728,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only thing that would make this better is if they you could fold them and they had a retractable cord. But for the price, very comfortable and a very good sound quality."
729,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound for the price!
730,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good
731,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second set to replace 2 year old set I sat on and broke. They are lightweight and comfort behind the neck and on the ears.Would recommend these to anyone that can't use ear buds
732,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As I do not like plugs in my ears, I love these. Also, they don't mess up the hairdo!"
733,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent choice ! Already have a set, but the coverings are shot,so I will order a set of those and have two, ;) I love them ."
734,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone who's ear buds keep falling out, I was so happy to find these. Snug enough to stay in place when running, allows me to put my hair in a pony tail, and long enough cord for shuffle. Simple and effective"
735,2.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy if you have a big neck. Wish the neck band was adjustable. If I put these on and look up it feels as if it's going to rip my ear off. I may give these to my niece.
737,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality. I use these on my TV to sleep with. Really rough them up through the night. They really take the punishment and last. Highly highly recommend good quality sound as well
738,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pair of headphones. Sony quality. We've had these for quite some time and have had absolutely no problems with them. They paired easily with our PS3, and with other components as well. We usually use them for gaming with the Playstation. Comfortable, lightweight, great sound, compact."
739,3.0 out of 5 stars,I like these but they dont last. I had to buy this product 3x. The ear cushion tears up and breaks off easily and the the wiring always pulls out. These are good for a few months.
740,2.0 out of 5 stars,Whose bright idea was it to put the seam in the plastic right where it rubs up against the top of your ears? These just aren't very comfortable. The sound is good the shape is great but it feels like it's going to Cut my ears off whenever I put them on. I should've returned them already but I waited too long too late to return them now…
741,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones with wonderful sound and nice fit to my head. I would recommend them to anyone wanting a good on the ear headphone with an around the back of your head band.
742,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I literally own 4-5 pairs of these. they are cheap, sound amazing, can withstand a sweat from a hard work out or bike ride, stay out of the way of bike helmets and messing up your hair. I love them. For the size the sound is really good.

I hate the earbuds, i think its gross sticking stuff in your ear and they always feel like they are about to fall out. If you want high quality sound, you obviously can get some greats studio monitors for 35-75 bucks (or more if you like). But for everyday listening to music on the train, or while working out, these work great.

Tip: The headphones will outlast the ear covers. You can buy replacement ear covers (the little foam things) on amazon for really cheap, and they fit."
743,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are not easy to find anymore. Now it's all just earbuds or over-sized studio phones. I don't care for earbuds, as they become uncomfortable after a while. Plus I don't want to hear my own breathing in between songs."
744,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Repeat buyer. Each pair lasts about 4 years. An internal wire breaks in one side.
Good product though."
745,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had two pair of these before that lasted for years. I like the around the neck style because of comfort.However a friend of mine liked them so much I gave her one. The other eventually died. I am glad I found these and they are of the same top quality.
Marie"
746,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these as my running headphones. After owning some $40 Sennheiser headphones for years now, I've learned what good, low-cost headphones sound like. These are not good low-cost headphones. There's an area between subwoofer and mid-range where things are too quiet - the headphones can't really put sound out well in this range. The sound in general is a little tinny and scratchy. The combination ends up adding up to a disappointing sound when listening to any recorded voice, because it typically has been put through that kind of mic processing to have that deep male radio voice, right in the range these headphones are worst.

All of that said, the sound isn't terrible, it's just subpar. You'd think Sony could produce headphones in the same quality range as Sennheiser for a similar price, and based on what I know about headphones - it's a difference of a few cents for the manufacturer to get that right, so they're making crappy headphones to avoid competing with their more expensive products. Very lame.

There's also an issue when running with these. I wear glasses - pretty light ones, which are nice for running. The way these clip around my ear can sometimes cause them to slowly wedge themselves beneath the stems on my glasses, causing them to bounce around while running - a very dizzying experience. However, on a few runs I've been able to gradually adjust them to prevent that - basically if I set them back a little farther on my ear than where they'd naturally sit, they seem to stay in place just far enough above the stems that they don't cause issues. So far."
748,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good earphones.
749,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ideal for private listening. Works great
750,4.0 out of 5 stars,My boyfriend has not broke these head phones yet although he had gone through 5 sets of headphones before these. If you are looking for this style then these are great.
751,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They fit comfortably on your ears, and don't slip off, even at night if you're a toss-and-turner like me. Sometimes they feel a little flimsy, but that's just a small complaint."
752,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen! Sony used to be the premier source for quality electronics but not any longer. In the 70's a Sony Trintron color TV was THE color TV that beat all others. This is the third, and final, Sony product I have purchased in the last few years and believe me, it'll be the last Out of the box this pair of headphones worked on only one channel intermittently. Only by playing with the plug at the MP3 player would it work. Think it might be the MP3 player? Not so, as two other pairs of headphones worked perfectly. Perhaps the 3.5 mm plug was undersize?"
753,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product. Very comfortable and light weight. Sound is very good, too.
Thank you for the fast delivery!"
754,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this neckband headphone for my iPOD. It is very soft to the ears and the sound is great.
755,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my wife. She is not real big on using headphones. But she really likes these and uses them all the time.
756,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. They are amazing for people if earbuds dont fit in your ears and the others are too big or small for you. they last a long time if you don't abuse them.
757,5.0 out of 5 stars,Delivery time was right on time. Earphones are great!
759,5.0 out of 5 stars,ordered it got right away love this place first time here
760,4.0 out of 5 stars,I expected worse sound quality than what I received. I like the shape and style of them both for sake of comfort and looks. sound quality was really good considering the low price.
761,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fits well. I wish the cord was a bit longer.
762,5.0 out of 5 stars,good sound
763,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works just fine.
764,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I already had a pair of these, I gave that pair to my husband to use, and needed another pair. Since I already owned them and bought another set, I obviously like these headphones."
765,5.0 out of 5 stars,HEADPHONES FIT GREAT AND HAVE A VERY GOOD SOUND..CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE ALSO..
766,4.0 out of 5 stars,What can I say? Sony headphones that are comfortably applied 'round your head while on the move! Or says the person I gave it to for his birthday.
767,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I wanted very good. I use them to walk/run and they don't fall off. When I need another pair I will reorder
768,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent headphones that worked great at the gym. I had joined a gym that had tv's on the treadmills. I had no headphones so I bought a these. I am pleasantly surprised at how durable they are and really good sound!
770,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ok
771,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best basic headphones I have found. And the price is great too.
772,4.0 out of 5 stars,"works fine , good for this price , best for small head people ."
773,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work as expected.
774,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had some Bluetooth Headphones for the gym, but the battery life was unreliable after a few years. These guys should theoretically last forever."
775,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's okay. Perhaps a little *too* light for my preference.
776,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Lot's of crisp high end but the bass response was so poor I stopped using these. Previous version I had of these Sony neckband headphones were better, but the plastic near the ears broke off. I would not recommend these."
777,5.0 out of 5 stars,as advertised
778,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my mom. She listens to books on tape and these fit her perfectly. The regular headphones were all too big for her head.
779,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for the gym. It doesn't fall off your ear and convenient. Sounds clean but I wish there's a little more bass. Nevertheless it beats the Philips SHS5200 for the price & reliability. The Philips jack broke in less than a month.
781,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I wanted
782,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not much to say. They're pretty good headphones that wrap around the back of your neck. The fit is secure but they do tend to dig into your ears after extended wear. Sound quality is pretty good and I haven't had them long enough to really test their durability, however they seem fairly solid but aren't a long term pair of headphones IMO."
783,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is weak, and it fit tight.. it fit my 10 year olf son fine, but even he didnt like the sound."
784,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly as advertised.
785,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sturdy and high-quality, they work as expected."
786,5.0 out of 5 stars,love it sounds very good
787,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones to replace a pair of Sony headphones that were an older model (MDRG42 I believe) of these headphones that had broken. These new headphones look exactly the same but are much lower quality than the old pair. They sound good but noticeably worse than the old headphones. There is much less bass. They do sound better than cheap earbuds though. They are also a made from a much lower quality plastic.
788,3.0 out of 5 stars,These work fine but they are not that comfortable around your ear. I do however wear them for 4 hours at a time.
789,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the price and the quality seems to be alright, but these hurt my ears.
I wanted an inexpensive pair of headphones to wear at work but after having these on for about 25 minutes I feel like my ears are screaming in pain. My head is a little large, those ""one size fit most"" hats are usually too small for me and these are just not great at adjusting to my size.
I have had other pairs of neckband headphones so I don't think that is the problem, it is just a size issue I guess.
Looks like I will need to buy a blue-tooth adapter for my computer so I can use my Motorolla S305's because I can wear those for hours with no issue."
790,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is good, lightweight and easy to wear. I only wish they were easier to find. Great price!"
792,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Broke way too soon for how often I used them. The headphones were comfortable and the cord was long enough, but again, broke way too soon."
793,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have typically purchased Phillips neckband and headphones, but found these at a better price and took a chance. They have more than met my expectations. Great sound, no problems, and I use them fairly regularly."
794,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these headphones for the gym. They are comfortable and the sound is good. I can't wear the ""in-the-ear"" style as they always fall out, and these fill the bill."
795,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was awesome!
796,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for the price.
797,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfy, I use them to sleep with, (I work nights), and drowns out house noises. Sound quality is great!"
798,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for the price. Second time I buy them, first ones lasted for 5 years."
799,2.0 out of 5 stars,Product not as good as I expected. I should have read specifications better. I didn't realize item was not adjustable. Cheaply made
800,5.0 out of 5 stars,Years in and happy.
801,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall good headphones. Sound, etc. is just fine considering the price.

However the build quality is a little iffy. The jack itself fits very snugly into most devices which means you have to tug a little to unplug the headphones. After a few months of this, the rubber bit came off the L shaped jack. This exposed the wires and as a result, I can now only hear in the left ear (wire failure). It may also be due to me dropping my iPod Touch a few times (tugging on the wire where it hits the jack), but I'm not sure.

Either way I'm going to buy another pair as I'm otherwise happy with them, but this time I'll be pulling off the rubber sleeve and sticking a little glue in there to be safe."
803,5.0 out of 5 stars,Inexpensive and great quality. Needed a good pair for my wife and I to use while running. Best value around.
804,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ok for the price
805,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's great! I use it all the time!
806,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!
807,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sleek and comfortable, these do the job."
808,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Th behind the head fit is very comfortable, and the sound quality is great. I watch PBS on my iPad without disturbing hubby's football game."
809,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these and they are hard to find, so I bought two."
810,4.0 out of 5 stars,Use daily.
811,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it for working out and it's simply great! Good quality of sound, pretty decent bass (and I'm a bass player so I probably should know). Doesn't go very loud, but super satisfying"
812,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them
814,1.0 out of 5 stars,The left ear speaker blew out literally 2 days after the warranty ended. Talk about cheap. Don't waste your money.
815,4.0 out of 5 stars,"get what you pay for, its fine. a little snug around the ears."
816,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great job from start to finish
817,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been looking for behind the head headphones for a while, and these were perfect. Sound quality was great and they were quite comfy. Unfortunately my boyfriends dog got to them and now they're in a million pieces, so he'll be ordering me another pair."
818,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A gift for my husband, who loves to play and listen to music. Great for use while walking or running."
819,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good
820,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was glad to see Amazon have these. I had a similar pair previously, tried earbuds, but would fall out of my ears while running. These are the best."
821,5.0 out of 5 stars,It arrived on time and works well with my old mp3 player.
822,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound was simply low, the band that circles the head, does not move, so you cannot make it fit as you desire.. maybe not enough info so you expect better performance."
823,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound and comfort .
825,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones for my husband and he loves them. He goes to the gym and the headphones stay in place while he works out. Great find.
826,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought two of these to use with the Sony portable DVD player.
Like the idea that they wrap around your neck, so they are less noticeable."
827,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these for work to listen to either tv shows or music. They work great, feel comfortable, and people can hardly tell i even have them on. Would buy again."
828,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast shipment and excellent product..
829,2.0 out of 5 stars,"these are way to big for my head so the sound isnt right unless I hold them to my ear...defeats the point.
They dont adjust and they are very uncomfortable"
830,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product even for the money is really bad. Might good for listening to a childrens book.
831,1.0 out of 5 stars,"A fine product, but you should offer one that is compatible with airplanes, as only one side worked"
832,5.0 out of 5 stars,love these and they don't mess up the hair.
833,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quick shipment, no hassle, no trouble, works great."
834,1.0 out of 5 stars,crap!
836,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones I would recommend them to everyone I know. They are light weight and stay in place.
837,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too BIG for my head! I have a common head size. Can I return?
838,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect
839,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For those who do not like, or cannot use, ear buds, these neckband headphones are terrific. And you can't beat the price! I wish the neckband were adjustable, but for what I paid, they do the job."
840,5.0 out of 5 stars,haven't failed me yet
841,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sound and fit
842,5.0 out of 5 stars,What everyone said was true. Very comfortable! I hate ear buds because they never stay in place.
843,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for working out, my third pair. For folks who don't like ear pieces and train hard, these are great! I wouldn't trade them!!!!"
844,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy and comfortable!
845,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it. Will use it alot
847,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for general use PLUS comfortable enough to sleep on a pillow while wearing headphones.
848,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Price! perfect replacement for my Sony MDR-G45 headphones. Arrived early and in good condition. would recommend to all who need around the-neck headphones.
849,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd been blowing through earbuds which would die after like 3 months, started using these. First pair lasted over a year, and I was using them hard."
850,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love those headphones!
851,5.0 out of 5 stars,Important to me is the wire does not get a break as easy as the other headphones. I use a Walkman radio all the time.
852,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a pair of these for about 5 years and the finally wore out. Went for another pair because I find them much more comfortable than earbuds.
853,1.0 out of 5 stars,They hurt your ears and seems like they will break easily lets wait and see!
854,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for outdoor home tasks. Bought it as a gift.
855,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is good
856,5.0 out of 5 stars,without a doubt the best headphones that still exist from sony back in the hay day of behind the ear headphones for sony to be one of the few to still put these on the market are a true blessing for my person and specific ears i've owned this pair for 1.3 years so far no problem i work 3rd shift and a job where you could break a regular pair of headphones in a little more then a day these stand up to my line of work and will be putting this fresh set on my christmas list along with ipod touch 4g (white) BUY THESE TODAY!!!! there godly metal
858,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use these for walking and they are comfortable and stay put. Sound is OK for the price.
859,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work well. Sharp bend above ear rubs my ear and I dot like that.
860,1.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I could return these.Not sure why I can't. Bad fit. Far too tight on the head. Sound quality isn't very good either. Waste of money. Donating to good will.
861,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones by Sony. I feel the older model was a little better. They seemed more heavy duty and could take a lot of beatings. I had a pair of the old model for almost 10 years!!! I hope these last as long; we'll see. There is a little plastic piece that I've noticed aren't on the new model, which supports the headphone on the ear more or something. I know some people thought it was annoying but I thought it made the headphone a little more stable on the head and comfortable for me. Not a big deal though.

I bought a pair similar to these, made by Phillip, and I hated them. They're ok for just sitting around listening to music but if you are looking to go running or something of the sort they are not good at all. They fell right off of my head (maybe I have a small head I don't know). I was very happy when I got my Sony headphones. Hardly moved at all while running.

The sound quality is pretty good; good enough bass for a pair of headphones like these. I felt the old pair had better bass though but egh not THAT much of a difference. Definitely happy with these. Also noticed the cord on these isn't as long as the old model either which I like a lot! The cord for the old model was WICKED long and was annoying I had to rap it around my iPod to keep it from getting in the way while running. Don't have that problem anymore."
862,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My headphones arrived today, and I couldn't wait to try them out. I was looking for a quality behind the neck headphone, at a low price, from a good manufacturer. This one, from SONY, came up in my search. It was under $20.00. I am glad I purchased it. It is lightweight and fits me perfectly. It has a cord for headphone jacks in your phone, Kindle, etc. It is not wireless, I was not looking for that feature. The sound quality, for the price, is excellent. I listened to some music on my Kindle Fire HD8, and the sound quality from that device was excellent. The headphones are well constructed, which is typical for SONY products. I recommend this product with no hesitation. I found no faults with it."
863,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These worked EXACTLY as I had hoped they would. They're not bulky. They fit comfortably around my head. And the sound quality is very good. They're not very loud, but since I use them at work, that's perfect for me."
864,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Headphones/ear buds for working out. I've tried several out recently. I've been a long time Apple guy but have become disenfranchised with Apple lately. I also travel weekly and want something I can pack easily. I downloaded some of my favorite songs for working out onto my Samsung S7 and then began my quest for either Wired or Wireless headphones/buds.

For on the cheap, these are really hard to beat especially at $15.
ROVKING Over Ear In Ear Noise Isolating Sweatproof Sport Headphones Earbuds
Sound quality is good and the design helps keep them put.

Since obviously my phone supports Blu Tooth, I wanted to find a pair of wireless
SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7.
These are around $37 depending on color selection. I was very impressed at the sound quality and
that you don't have to have the buds baried in your ear canal to hear quality sounding music.
I'm on the small size of ear canal so I have trouble with those that need to stick into your ear.
These were good, but I found I was always adjusting depending on my workout.
I was pleasantly surprised when I had an incoming call and was able to answer and talk as well as
listen through these. The music was automatically paused. BONUS for those of us that don't keep normal
work hours!!!

And then I tried Phaiser BHS-750 Bluetooth Headphones Headset Sport Earphones with Mic @ $36
These stay put the best for me. Music and sound quality are nice. I gave the SENSO's to my wife
to try out. She loves them. She also has more of a normal ear canal opening than mine.

865,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first headset I have ever purchased that actually fit my big head... there, I said it. No pinching, rubbing or binding. Excellent! It does rest oover my ears, which I didn't expect, but no rubbing and no pain.

As I cannot leave a seller review for this item, I would just like to say it was a pleasure dealing with Best4Best. I did receive my item promptly, and was very happy with my interaction with Morris. I would be happy to order again. 5 STARS!"
866,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great set of headphones. I like the way the cord rests on the back of your neck. And they are comfortable. I'm not a fan of a headset which sits on top of your head. Therefore, I bought two sets because they are not that easy to find."
867,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it! Bass sounds good. Stays put. No more fumbling around getting in-ear pieces to seat properly. Just put'em on and go! I'm glad I bought them. I would buy extra foam covers though so you can throw them in the wash once in a while.
869,5.0 out of 5 stars,cool
870,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good price and received timely
871,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fit wonderfully. The seal is amazing and they are pretty! I also like the fact that they have a darkened lense.
872,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was exactly as described. Sound's great. Definitely recommend it if looking for this design.
873,2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones have good audio quality but the construction is really bad. Its been just 2 months with very little use ( I wear to the gym probably an hour 3-4 times a week)the headphones have started to come apart. I would not purchase these again.

880,5.0 out of 5 stars,No complain.
881,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These things sound really good actually. And they're very comfortable. I've had 3-4 ""behind the neck"" stile headphones in the past and they've always rubbed the top of my ears wrong after a while. Haven't had that happen with these yet. Also they seem to press more firmly into my ears than the others, which is a bonus. Bottom line I like these headphones which probably means they'll stop making them."
882,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it.

914,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Good: Light, fit nicely
Bad: Every time you move and any part of your hair or shirt is rubbing against the neck band causes a very audible scratching sound (a bit like the TV snow screen).

Annoying enough that these are going into the trash."

970,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones for running and working in!!
971,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves these headphones and uses them while running and working out. They are comfortable and stay put even when he gets sweaty. They arrived on time and exactly as described.
972,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's a SONY!!
973,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound good and they stay in place, and they don't sit on your head. They feel sort of stiff, but not uncomfortable. Can't give 5 stars because I don't love them, but would definitely recommend them. I use these, along with the mic built into my webcam to do Jabber calls. Works great."
974,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You will love these headphones, they are comfortable and the sound is terrific...I love the behind the head feature..
enjoy"
975,5.0 out of 5 stars,works great for what I needed it for
976,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome style.
977,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good
979,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had a pair of these finally break on me after 5 years. I wear these at the office at super low volumes as I'm constantly dealing with people coming in and out. These are the only pair I can wear that won't kill my ears after 8 hours of use.
I'm shocked they lasted this long with the constantly use."
980,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's really hard to find these simple behind-the-head headphones anymore. Everybody is making gigantic headphones. I like these for the gym where big, heavy phone would be awkward. Great sound quality. I may have to buy 5 pair and stash them away."
981,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product and has been staying strong. It has clear sound, good bass, durable, comfortable, and stylish.

**Update**
Bought item 02/10/2009 and still working perfectly as of 5/12/2011 (over 2 years later). It's my favorite, most comfortable and most durable pair I've ever owned. Has been thrown around in book bads, purse, and computer bag and still going strong! :)"
982,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for running
983,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well if you're like me you hate how much ear buds, etc move around while you're working out. These stay put and that's all I really care about. Sony, so you know they're a quality product. With that, they're not very loud even at the highest volume on my phone. Good enough but I shouldn't have to max the volume out just to hear the music over the rest of the gym."
984,2.0 out of 5 stars,My old Sony headphones were better. Now there is a headband to place behind your hair when the older model had a cord. It is hard to carry in your pocket with your Ipod as it doesn't wrap around it anymore. It still plays well and is better than that earbud that you have to place in your ear. The earpiece is also not as comfortable as the older model.
985,5.0 out of 5 stars,I work manual labor and constantly moving. I like these alot as they are easy to remove and put back on. The cord is a prefect length as there isn't a whole lot of extra slack when I have my phone in my pocket. I would like them to be louder but that's only because it's really loud where I work. Definitely would recommend these to people who don't like earbuds
986,4.0 out of 5 stars,I liked these they fit well behind your head instead of over the top! and they are made so the piece goes over the top of your ears which is also a good fit! I felt the sound was good but I went from Bose Ear Buds to these so not a fair comparison but I felt these were not good at blocking out enough of the surounding noise or maybe these could have gone a bit louder then they do!? I have since bought another pair of Ear Buds but with a peice that goes over the ears so they do not fall out like many ear buds do!
987,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great. I have used this particular model for years. I can usually get about 2-3 years out of these. I like using these because they go around the back of the head instead of over top.
988,5.0 out of 5 stars,Item fits snug but not too tight around back of neck. Has very good sound quality with no bleed out from headpiece.
990,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When our kittens played ""Let's Break Mommy's Headphones"" I didn't waste anytime ordering my second pair. They were very comfortable and the sound was really very good. I would buy a third pair."
991,4.0 out of 5 stars,good but not that good >>> low sound
992,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love behind-the-head headphones because I can exercise without them falling off like my earbuds would. However, the cord is not very long so I sometimes feel a tug when I am running and extend my legs (where my iPod is) too far. I usually stick to using these only when I'm walking or sitting down."
993,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these to replace the in ear type. They seem to work fine so far. They don't fit as well while wearing glasses, though."
994,5.0 out of 5 stars,NICE AND LIGHT WT
995,5.0 out of 5 stars,lost my other one and was galdbto find it here. love it!
996,4.0 out of 5 stars,very compfy
997,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Can not have in-ear headphone, Bought it for listening radio while jogging. serving the purpose well, sweat has not ruined yet."
998,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones for running
999,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like them, but they're is a little big for my head. I may have a smaller than average head though."
1001,5.0 out of 5 stars,"the good:
- i wear head phones 5-6 hours a day.i have blue tooth ones, and also ear buds, but after an hour or two my ears will start hurting as those goes inside your ears and are poky.. i like this one because it just sits over your ear

- arrived quickly

- sound is great"
1002,1.0 out of 5 stars,You would expect for a Sony product to last more than 3 months.
1003,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are very light and perform well. I would recommend them to anyone as a good buy for the price.
1004,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Headphones!
1005,5.0 out of 5 stars,I need it for my son he is very confined and form of music he also comfortable headphones lying down. Thank you.
1006,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound absolutely wonderful, and I'm very pleased they have the behind-the-neck-band, rather than the over-the-top-of-head band."
1007,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Being petite, these fit me perfectly."
1008,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I work in radio and got these so I'd stop having the 'indented hair' look at the end of the day. For that, they work great. Don't expect pounding base, or any kind of noise cancelling or isolation whatsoever. I imagine they'd work nicely for running or working out too, but there are probably better options for that. For the price, they're definitely working out for me."
1009,4.0 out of 5 stars,AWESOME!!!
1010,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sony Quality
1012,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They are stiff, smell like cheap plastic, not adjustable, and uncomfortable to wear. Save your money and don't buy these headphones!"
1013,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are worthless. Tossed the pkg or I would be returning. They do not stay on ears.
1014,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Based on the picture and nothing in the description to indicate, these were purchased as wireless headphones. Upon opening, saw that they were wired, and was going to return. However, it costs almost half the cost to send it back. What a waste."
1015,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are durable & high quality headphones which continue to be used in an elementary school computer lab.
I like the single cord which can't be 'zipped open', the lack of an in-line volume control and the neckband style.
They hold up well even when used by many different K-5 kids..."
1016,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought all cheap headphones by name brands were relatively the same. These sound so bad I was sure there was something wrong with the extension cable I had to buy for them (because the cord is ridiculously short). But then I plugged in my old Jensen cheapos, and the sound was far superior even out of the only the one side that works any more. Time to get my soldering iron out and fix the Jensens. These will find the bottom of the trash if I can't return them."
1017,1.0 out of 5 stars,"There's a little deception on the imaging of this product. It could easily be mistaken for a wireless, especially if you started shopping for Bluetooth. How they were able to conceal the cord in the single picture provided is genius."
1018,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Teenage son loves them, uses them for running as well as everything else. Uses them constantly, even to sleep in. This is a replacement pair for ones that got stepped & at the price point I'm not going to get bent out of shape about it"
1019,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are good if you are stationery - at a desk. Price is reasonable and sound quality is good. They can be a little clunky for things such as working out and I recommend Sony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design for that.
1020,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the Sony MDR-G45LP headphones for about 8 months now and I am very happy with how comfortable and durable they are. I use them while working out and running and they stay put and I can lie in bed with them on and forget that I'm wearing them. Even though they are incredibly lightweight, I have sat on them more than a few times with no repercussions. Sony did a great job of making headphones that stay put without making them feel tight.

I used these to replace an older Sony behind-the-neck model and the only thing that has bothered me is that I immediately noticed a reduction in bass from my older headphones, and I am by no means an audiophile. However, for the average day to day use with a portable MP3 player or laptop, these are great. 4/5 stars simply because of the reduced bass."
1021,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones and have several located in key locations to keep them handy. Really nice quality and very comfortable to wear.
1023,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was sorta flimsy, and the earphone pads where rather thin, the sound quality, was ok, and i just bought them so I don't know the lifetime of them. i did not like them at all but would not want to go through the hassle of returning them so I'm warning everybody else who might buy them."
1024,4.0 out of 5 stars,My 6 year old granddaughter broke the wire in two days. Not for kids.
1025,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is very good. First couple of times the device is worn, the ear pieces are a bit stiff but overall comfort is good. I enjoy them very much to work out at the gym or work around my home. Great value for the money."
1026,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones for the money
1027,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed... volume level when driven by IPhone 6 is not adequate when moving the lawn.. primary reason I purchased..
1028,3.0 out of 5 stars,I'm sure the product is fine but it came up under a search on Amazon for Bluetooth headphones and the picture does nothing to clear up that misperception.
1029,1.0 out of 5 stars,"the picture shows no wires, amazon search bring up this on a bluetooth headset search, it is wired, not bluetooth"
1030,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are not by any means headphones for an audiophile, but they are absolutely perfect if you listen to radio in bed and may fall asleep with them on. They don't move and they don't break if you roll over with them on."
1031,5.0 out of 5 stars,my 2nd pair one of the speakers on my first pair went out after i kinda swung it into my ceiling fan
1032,5.0 out of 5 stars,if you want som just to chill wit this is your i put them to crap cord geting pull by accdent there still here
1034,5.0 out of 5 stars,We use these in the classroom and is great for the kids. We keep extra on hand just in case.
1035,3.0 out of 5 stars,not the best sound quality. But I use them for working out and they suit their purpose.
1036,4.0 out of 5 stars,The picture does not show the wire... it was my mistake not to check it deeply.
1037,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good deal for the price.
1038,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bulls***
1039,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sony MDR-G45LP Behind the Neck Headphones purchased for my wife for use on treadmill. My wife hated the ear buds because they did not fit her ear canals properly even though she was using the smallest ear buds available.
1040,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lousy. For 14.95 what did I expect to get?
1041,5.0 out of 5 stars,fast shipping and nice for the price.
1042,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good stuff
1043,5.0 out of 5 stars,Boob
1045,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I did a search for wireless Bluetooth headphones. These came up in the search results. The picture did not show they were corded. The at a glance information was not overt enough to state they were corded.
I’m not necessarily opposed to the cord myself, but since they were for my Mom who specifically wanted a cordless headset these were a disappointment."
1046,2.0 out of 5 stars,"good sound, but the plastic head band and shell over the speakers is cheap and hollow, and every little sound travels up the plastic and comes through into the headphones. just jogging makes the wire shake, and the shaking sound comes through the ear pieces, so i'm probably returning them."
1047,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First, I entered an Amazon search for blue tooth headphones. These headphones are corded. The picture does not reflect this. Nevertheless, I did not do sufficient research to determine that these headphones are not Bluetooth enabled, My bad.

Second, the headphones can not be adjusted so they do not stay securely in place during any activity more vigorous than walking.

Sound quality is OK...no issues there."
1048,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a person who hates earbuds, I'm in love with these headphones. I thought the neck placement of the band would be annoying, but that actually makes it easier to keep the phones around my neck during lectures/when I need to take a music break. Solid for walking.
Note: I have tiny ears, and they sometimes get caught in the crevice. This is not bothersome enough to dock its rating for me."
1049,3.0 out of 5 stars,"You get what you pay for. I'm not afraid to break it, but I'll never forgive myself for actually listening to these."
1050,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had one of these earlier, so wanted a second pair once i wore those out. but the package i received was faulty. they simply would not work. I wanted to return them, but nobody came to pick them up. easily the worst purchase from amazon i have made till date."
1051,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall these are relatively good headphones, but I'm not entirely sure I'd recommend them to someone asking my opinion. The reason for this is that I bought these in hopes of addressing a specific problem -- fit for a small head and ears while also retaining decent sound. The bar for ""decent"" sound is relatively low also since I am deaf in one ear.

Despite the behind the head band, these headphones still slide off altogether too easily for me. I find I regularly have to move the headphones back up on my head again. In addition, the sound quality is so-so, even for myself with limited hearing. I really don't expect much at all in the way of sound quality from headphones due to my hearing loss and, given the inexpensive nature of these headphones, perhaps that is the reason for the less than decent sound quality. Thing is, I have another pair of Sony headphones that cost all of about $15 more and they are terrific in terms of sound quality, so I'm not so sure it's a function of price.

In any case, for the price these headphones are fine. The cord length is good and the headphones themselves are quite lightweight. For the price, not a bad pair of headphones - just not quite the fit I need."
1052,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke in me in 2 months.. great dog dodo item.....
1053,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have very much enjoyed my Sony headset, but I am very frustrated and disappointed in Amazon most likely selling or sharing my e-mail address after my purchase. After never before having a problem with ""scamers""......I now get many daily e-mails from supid people and sights that clog my e-mail wanting me to purchase everything that can be imagined. BEWARE!"
1054,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't read the description, bc I thought the headphones were flexible. No carrying case was provided either. But for $17 what does one expect?"
1056,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these because I can't use earbuds. They work well for the price and have decent sound quality from what I can tell. They work fine with glasses or even dangly earrings, and if positioned right, you can use it with your hair in a ponytail. I usually wear my hair up higher and have this go down below it. I will say after a couple of hours (averaging 3-5) it will hurt a bit behind my ears, and that sometimes increases depending on if I'm wearing glasses or not. It's not a particularly awful pain, but it does decrease the amount of pleasure of listening to music for an extended period of time. Aside from that minor issue, I still use them because they're decently sturdy. They are not collapsible, if anyone was wondering, I usually carry mine around in a small purse if I am not wearing them."
1057,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought these headphones often since they first came out. They fit nicely but takes some time to get used to the configuration wearing this style. If you wear Hats, have long hair, these phones are a great solution instead of Ear Buds ( which I despise) or Conventional over the Head style Phones. Personally, as a Long time user of these headphones ( I use them to Modulate my Radio Broadcasts) I think their Sound Quality has suffered over the years, but these are still adequate for small speakers whose strength is good on the Higher sound spectrums, adequate on the Bass just barely.

If you want a fuller sound experience, buy bigger Cans for a Fuller Listening Experience, but if you want something Light Weight, Ear Feeling Friendly for Hiking, Biking... these are more than Adequate ."
1058,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just about to order my fourth pair of these head phones, which are more comfortable for me than painful ear buds, and don't give me headband hair. The reason I keep ordering new pairs is that after a while, one channel or the other stops working and I end up with mono headphones. Fine for listening to podcasts and other music-free content, but not so great for music. I bought my last pair in March and here it is December and I need a new pair because there is no sound coming in the right ear."
1059,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Street Style MDRG45LP is just what my husband needed for his rather large cranium. The behind the neck design is the only option the feels comfortable. He has tried ear buds and they result in either always falling out or when in for longer than 20-mins result in ear pain. The behind the neck design of the Street Style provides a comfortable solution for those grocery store visits.

The physical design is sturdy and provide enough flexibility to be adjustable without fear of breaking them. The padding on over the speakers are a typical foam that provides a level of comfort. The on-ear design allows for clearly being able to hear both your audio of choice but also the world around you except of higher volumes.

These are wired and come with a long enough cable to allow for use of an audio source in your pocket. The end is equipped with a 1/8“audio jack which is a perfect pair for most mobile devices. The connector has a 90-degree angle at the end. I like this touch as it feels like it will have less of a chance or kinking while in a pocket. I did have some issues getting it to sit just right in my iPhone 6. If I pushed it too far in it would sound very low and distant. If I pull it out just a bit and make proper contact it worked like a charm. We have been through several headphones/ear buds and never had this prior.

Sound quality is decent, considering this price point. (currently $15.62) It has a fair base response and the high were adequate. My source for testing was Amazon music streaming and some pod cast. I know these are not the best sources but also consider that this is what my husband uses this for. That being said, the base is ample however lacks accuracy. The highs are strong and match pretty well to the strength of the base tones. It’s the mid-range that suffers the most. Vocals can be muffled at time depending on the music. Pod casts work very well as any vocal bas tones augment this short fall.

Pros:
• Solid construction
• Fits well for those with a large dome
• Wired so you never have to charge them and can keep them in your car
• Great value

Cons:
• Sound quality is adequate. There are better sounding headphones however for this price point this is the best by far.

Conclusion:

This may sound like a bad review but it is quite the contrary. The Street Style MDRG45LP headphone is comfortable, durable and provides good sound quality for this price point. I gave it 4 stars because of the price for performance. Subtle changes that would have me up it to 5 stars would be to flatten the response to allow the mid-range to open vocals. That being said I have yet to find anything better at this price point."
1060,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased and repurchased these exact headphones for years because they are so comfortable, get great volume, and capture bass really well, and they're cheap. I love the wrap around design and that the speakers stay in place over my ears. I've never had a pair that didn't last at least a couple years, and I'm so happy they are still available.

One minor warning, if you listen to a lot of music with really heavy bass (death metal, techno, etc.) and crank the volume too high for too long, you can blow out the speakers. They'll still work, but you'll definitely hear a bit of a rattle every time the bass gets going, and it impacts the overall sound quality that you'll get. (Simple preventative on that, just don't max out your volume if you're listening to heavy bass, keep it around 80%-ish and you'll be fine)"
1061,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent Headphones, but they are pretty cheaply made. I use mine almost every day and the foam stuff covering the ears is starting to tear. They are actually pretty comfortable, and I have a big head, so that is difficult to find in this style of headphones. I just wish they were a little better made. This is my second pair. Attached is the image of what happened to the 1st pair."
1062,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Looks: They look and feel cheap.
Quality: The sound is bare bones. Basically the same quality you get from any given pair of cheap plastic headphones. The cushions are very thin. Recommend buying some thicker cushions to replace the stock ones.
Price: It's cheap, that's why it gets an extra star.
Users: It DOES stay on your head rather well, so it'd probably be OK for working out (I'd still recommend thicker cushions though), way better than earbuds at any rate. I can't recommend it for folks with glasses though (it starts giving me a headache after a while). It works just fine for an office environment with the HUGE caveat that it blocks no sound whatsoever, so it fails for me, as this is the main reason I bought it. You can kinda block out noise by blaring the music but to block out background noise but these headphones will be audible to a cubicle neighbor. Additionally, at that volume they really show their low-quality from an audiophile perspective."
1063,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap and great quality. I got these because no earbud will ever be able to not fall out of my ear.
1064,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally bought a pair of these from Circuit City before they went bankrupt and they didn't break. I only bought another pair because I bought Sennheisers out of curiosity and was disappointed... they had the same sound quality. Anyway, I couldn't believe these were still available and couldn't resist buying a new pair... and the quality is still there! I'm betting this pair will last another what... probably ten years if it was anything like the last pair."
1065,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I tested these against the Philips SHS5200/28 and the Philips HS520 Neckband Headphone.

Of the 3, these came in 2nd. They have a weak sound, with limited bass response, and although they're cheap and pretty, they just don't compare in quality to the Philips options

The winner was the HS520, with strong bass, low price, and quality construction.

Philips SHS5200 have the best sound, with the HS520 's a close second.

However, the SHS5200 is about 33% more expensive, at $20, while these Sonys and the HS520 are $15.

Also, the SHS5200 has a problem of the plug breaking when the cord gets snagged on pretty much anything. I had 2 of them break in a 6 month period. They're virtually unfixable when they break, as the cord is braided, and not a simple soldering job to repair.

So if you're in the market, go for the Philips HS520"
1067,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love to buy Sony brand but this time I am not happy. I am not big on sound, as long as it is good quality then that is fine with me. So the sound quality is good enough for me for this headphone. The reason I am not happy is that the foam covers started coming off all the time. First the right and then both sides. I bought foam replacements, I hope they are better than the first pair."

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried a ton of headphones lately and these sound by far the best to me. I like generally flat sound. I'm more concerned with clear mids and highs and want present but not overpowering bass and low bass.
Headphones I've tried include the following with my totally subjective sound rating on 10 point scale. YMMV.

Audio Technica ATH-M50X - highs a little subdued for my liking - 7
Beats Studio 2 Wireless - Subdued highs, some mid bass emphasis but not overpowering. 6
Bose QC25 - A little weak on bass and weak on highs, best ANC. 7
Bose QC35 - Can be a little bassy, especially at low volume. Bright highs. Best ANC. 9
JBL - EVEREST 700 - Way too bassy. 5.
JBL - Everest Elite 700 - Much better than non-Elite, 7
OPPO PM-3 - Excellent, expensive. 10
Sennheiser 202 - yuck. Too bassy, no highs, but cheap. 4
Sennheiser 280 - well balanced. 8
Sennheiser Momentum M2 - Close to perfection. 9.5
Sennheiser PXC-550 - wireless noise cancelling. These are excellent. 9
Sony - MDRXB950BT/B - Extra bass says it all. 4
Sony 7506 - Perfection 10

Out of all that I've tried the Sony 7506 are closest to perfection, to live performance. They are not bass heavy at all but can produce comfortable solid bass down to quite low frequencies. Tonal balance leans towards the upper mids and highs. Bright but not harsh. You end up hearing subtle sounds in the music that is missing with other headphones. Those who want more bass or don't want bright highs won't like these. But for my listening taste this matches perfectly.

They are also very comfortable. Many of the headphones listed above are not as comfortable. Either tight band or thin band or ear cups that aren't big or deep enough. These headphones are great. Biggest disadvantage vs. many that I've tried recently is that these are wired... with a long heavy cord easy to get caught on things. I was looking for a wireless headphone. But ultimately I couldn't find one at a reasonable price that sounded anywhere near as good as these. Next closest was the Sennheiser PXC-550, but at $400, wireless wasn't worth an extra $320. I also found that there were times I didn't want noise cancellation. Too bad Sony doesn't make a wireless headphone with anywhere near this sound.
Best of all, these are by far the cheapest of the decent sounding headphones I've listened to. The headphones in this list range in prices from $20 to $450.
Highly recommend the Sony 7506... if you like this sort of sound signature."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my favorite pair of headphones I have tried so far. The overall sound of these are very balanced. This means the Low, Medium, and high tones are for the most part balanced out. You can easily look up a lot of information on these headphones. They are an industry standard which I have enjoyed owning for more than two years now.

The overall design of the headphones is fairly good. They are structurally well designed for the most part.
- Noise isolation is mediocre. You can hear people saying things through these depending on the volume.
- Sound leakage on the original pads is fairly low. People won't have to hear your music when it is at a fairly loud volume.
- Extremely long, coiled cable with 1/4-inch adapter. Possibly gold connections.
- Sturdy cable design. Each cable bend point is reinforced with additional rubber. Soldering to the driver seems sturdy as well, it should be able to withstand most tugs. This is usually not an issue with the gargantuan coiled cable. The coiled cable also prevents a large number of tangles!
- The headband is fairly comfortable. You could easily find a cover for it if it becomes a problem.
- Cup adjustment pieces have numbers on them to ensure a specific setting.

The problems I've had with these over time:
- Headband will lose its tension between your ears over time. These headphones no longer fit as soundly on my head as they used to.
- Faux leather pads will need to be replaced. I have included a picture of both of my ripped pads which I replaced with ""Beyerdynamic EDT250V Headphone Ear Pads Black"" these will create some additional noise leakage.
- The wire that connects the drivers to the headband can get stuck in the housing. (see picture) This may wear the wire a bit.
- Cable is extremely long. This can be an issue when you want to use these headphones outside of their intended purpose. The cable is generally a bit heavy, causing strain to the connections. I very often have to move it around to have it stop bothering me. The cable can be replaced with some soldering. There have been projects modifying the headphones to have a detachable cable. Google ""Sony MDR-7506 Detachable Cable Mod"" that I believe would improve the design of the headphones.
- Like all over the ear headphones, these will be uncomfortable with glasses. They do become very uncomfortable after a few hours.
- While these do come with a transport bag, even the fold up design makes them a bit of a pain to transport. This is to be expected.
- Fold up design doesn't center the cups when the length of each ear cup is at minimum. (See picture) Not sure what this does to the longevity of the headband.
- The blue portion of the ""Professional"" stickers on the sides are decals. One of mine peeled off. It looks similar, but is starting to disappear, and collects dust. (see picture)

Aside from a few gripes, these are still my favorite set of headphones. They simply sound right. I was appalled to go to the store and listen to some Bose headphones and hear how bad the quality was in comparison: for a set of $300 headphones.

These are undoubtedly worth the price. Don't hesitate to buy them if you can overlook the problems i have had."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm rating these five stars, but they do have one pretty big negative. They are excellent, studio quality headphones. If you plan to wear them out and about though (like the NYC commuter I am) they effectively also serve as earmuffs. That's all well and good in winter, but on the June day I wore them out, I was sweating out the top of my head and down my neck. Amazing sound quality, but not great for being out in the heat. In their defense, these headphones never made that claim. They never made any claims at all, as they are an inanimate object without speech capability. They do have the capability to deliver superb sound quality though, which is mostly what you want in a pair of headphones."
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my 7506's. I do alot of video editing, edm production and djing as my main hobbies, and I would not use any other headphone. There is just something about these that reveals any and all audio errors. My rule of thumb is if it sounds good in these headphones it will sound good at the club and vice versa. Now that I have told you how much I love these they do have some major faults.

1. These headphones are very cold sounding even a bit harsh especially with low quality sources like spotify and soundcloud. These are aimed at the professional audience. If you have work to do get these. If you want to sit back and listen to music buy the mdrv6 or audio technica mh50x. As an aside everyone that says these and the mdrv6 are identical must be tone deaf. The v6 sounds warm with way more bass. By comparison the 7506's are harsh and cold with a more technical (tight) sound.

2. The ear pads are terribly uncomfortable do your self a favor and replace them immediately. For some reason I personally love the cloth pads from Turtle beach gaming headsets. I just hate leather and velour on headphones they make my head sweat and ears hot.

3. It's time to make these with a detachable cord. Audio Technica made the mh50's with a detaching cord, it's about time Sony did the same with these and the v6's. I am writing this review because of this. I was djing at a club when an attendee (cough very inebriated human being) fell on the ground and ripped the cord right out of the ear cup. Sony is lucky I won't use any other headphone in a professional setting.

When all is said and done though these are unbelievable headphones at a great price with nice build quality. Sony please just make them with a removable cord (im on my 3rd pair in 9 years and would gladly pay double the price for this one feature. Also, I hate having to get used to a new pair every few years). Finally, to sum up the review, if you are looking for good studio/dj headphones these are fantastic! If your looking for a more casual listening set of cans gets the mdrv6 or at mh50x."
4,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently developed a liking for headphones and wanted to try out the 7506, having the impression they were sort of a long-standing classic pair. I also read an extensive report claiming them to be the best pair of over-ear headphones in the $150 MSRP range.

I haven't owned them long enough to say much about durability, and they may have not had enough time to ""burn-in"" (I'm not confident myself of the importance of burn-in, but it seems to be a widespread-enough idea that I do give my headphones a short burn-in), but so far I agree that they are a great pair of headphones. They have a much more even or flat response than any popular pair of headphones to be sure, but my primary comparison is my go-to pair of Sennheiser 380 Pros. They are both phenomenal sounding. The best way I've found to describe the difference is that the 380s lean just slightly towards the lower frequencies, and the 7506s towards the brighter side. The 380s have a wider soundstage, as well (probably because of the larger ear cups and distance between the speakers and your ears). As a result, there were some songs that felt more rich from the 380s...but some songs that felt more exciting from the 7506s.

The 7506s have a relaxed fit, and the pads are quite soft. They will likely make contact with your ears, and I do feel some fatigue after extended listening. I have a very big head and typical sized ears, which is why I opted for the 380 Pros as my first pair...the ear cups are massive, very large and deep, and make no contact with your ears, but the headphones are heavier and grip tighter, so instead of any ear fatigue you feel a fair amount of warmth. The 7506s have padding on the speakers themselves, as well, inside the ear cup, so the contact with your ears is padded. They are lightweight and don't grip too hard. The headband is comfortable, though I noticed it tends to grab my hair more than I'm used to.

I don't like the coiled cable, though it is more lightweight than the one on my 380s, so it's a bit more manageable. I also don't like that the cable can't be removed, and therefore not easily replaced.

The ear cups don't swivel side to side very far, but can flip all the way around, and are on a hinged arm. You can sort of push them up against the headband (with the two ear pads together) to make the set pretty compact, and there's a basic storage bag that they'll fit in. They're fairly mobile.

I also noticed that the best place to grip the cups as you put them on or take them off is covered with the same thin material that's on the ear pads. It makes me think this will probably wear out fairly fast, but that's sort of a nit-picking detail.

I'm fairly new to the audio scene and don't pretend to be an expert, but hopefully this can give a wide audience an idea of what these headphones are like. I give them 4-stars for a satisfactory, but not exceptional, product. You are getting what you pay for, but in my opinion, not more.

I'll probably update this review once I've used them a bit more extensively.

Additional comments:

I've now owned these for nearly 4 months, and have used them quite a bit.

They aren't so great for using at my DJing jobs. While their mobility helps, they don't produce massive volume, and they don't isolate all that well. This makes it a bit hard to listen to songs in advance before including them in my set, with the music blasting from my system.

They are, however, unquestionably, the best flat-response audio I've ever heard in headphones. No range is neglected or favored. When I mentioned earlier that they make some songs more ""exciting"" than my 380 pros, I was hearing the crispness these songs bring to audio, particularly in the mids and trebles, where other headphones couldn't seem to be bothered. I was listening to some vocal-heavy music (ie Sam Smith) the other night on another pair, and was just feeling unsatisfied...then I switched to the 7506s, and suddenly the vocals came alive. Vibrant, deliciously crisp, presented on a silver platter. Where my 380 pros still make some dance beats and music that shines with the bass cranked up more punchy, the 7506s just can't be beat in showing you the music in its pure, raw form.

Another update:

These continue to shine as magnificent headphones. I continue to be more impressed the more I learn about audio. I'm going to bump my rating to 5 stars. Of the headphones I own, these are the most satisfying as far as sound is concerned. I do feel like the comfort could be better, but it's not drastic enough to deny that last star. They also, as I mentioned, aren't ideal for DJing, but since they aren't advertised/meant for such purposes, I won't hold this against them either."
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned these for just over 6 months now, and while I wanted to write a review the second I first listened to them, I decided to wait. That being said....
WOW. For the price, or even not for the price, these are the single best headphones not only that I've owned but that I've ever listened to. That includes the very high-end cans on sample at Brookstone, Best Buy, etc. Of course, I am not a seasoned audiophile but I know when something sounds good. These sound GREAT. There are pros and cons though:

Pros:
The sound. The glorious, clear, nuanced sound. Just amazing, and if you've always wondered how music is supposed to sound, these are your new headphones. There is a reason these are used in studios by professionals and have been for over 20 years (in which time, the design of the headphones has never changed!). There is no bias in the sound profile, just balance and clarity like nothing you've ever heard before.
The sound.
The sound.
Noise-cancellation. These are not actually designed for it. but given that they are pretty impressive. I usually have them driven pretty hard and turned up to a decent volume. but that's how they're meant to be used and they do not disappoint or let in anything you don't want to bother you.
Comfort. Very nice, don't grab my head too hard, I can wear them for an hour or more before giving my ears a short break.
The cord. I play guitar, and I can stand and move around without any worry because the cord is very long and allows a lot of freedom.
The price. I paid around $80 for these and they far outperform anything I've ever owned, which includes Beats by Dre and others.

Cons:
The cord. These are sit-at-home headphones. I mean, do as you please, but personally I wouldn't be walking around or using these as everyday headphones. At around 10' long and coiled, it isn't as convenient as some.
The bass. If you're a bass junkie, I'm sorry but you will be disappointed. These are meant to deliver a perfect sound profile, the one intended by the original producer. Even then, on dubstep songs and such, the bass falls flat. Not a big deal to me, even though I love bassy songs, because these are so impressive in other regards that I can deal with the lack of power. They do, however, have extremely quick, punchy, satisfying response throughout the audio range and that includes bass....they just lack the power of headphones like Beats and such which are designed for bass.

Overall, just get them. Worth every penny. I use them for studying, playing guitar, watching movies, listening to high-quality audio, etc. and they are always impressive to me. It is actually fun to listen to things with them because everything sounds so good! Everything you've heard on headphone forums and favorable reviews is true, they really are impressive."
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been buying and using headphones for a very long time. All the way back to the Koss Pro 4A in the early 70s. I'll say right up front that I don't typically buy Sony products because, while their products are high quality and fully featured, they tend to be more expensive than competitors. I've been using and loving my Sennheiser HD 280 pro for over eight years, but when the ear pads finally disintegrated and the replacement turned out to be overly pricey I started searching for replacements.

I saw a video about headphones for pros on Lynda.com and it mentioned the 7506s. The speaker liked it for post production work because they flat and true which is what I wanted. To be honest, as good as the Sennheisers were I determined after using other cans that they were not flat at all and it was coloring the sound. Not a good thing for post work and another thing pushing me toward replacement.

Checking reviews for the Sony cans, it turns out that many consider them to be the gold standard for headphones and have for almost two decades. The volume of glowing reviews and the sub-C note price let me pull the trigger, and I am so glad that I did. After four days of constant use at work I will say that these are the best headphones I have ever owned. Yup. Call me a fanboy on this one. (And I'm rarely a fanboy on anything.)

On Thursday, I tuned to a friend at work and told him that I was hearing stuff I never heard before. Kinda blew my mind. That may sound cryptic but all I meant was that I could hear all the tonal ranges evenly. The HD 280 pros tend to punch up the high end a bunch and the low end a bit too. The Sonys are dead flat. Exactly what I wanted.

More good news.They are quite comfortable. They keep out the outside noise maybe a little bit better than the Sennheisers but without the vice-like grip they have on your head. The Sony fit is tight enough without being tedious. I wear them over seven hours each day while wearing eyeglasses and I could easily wear them for another seven. As they as comfortable as on-the-ear cans? No, but on-the-ear cans don't keep out noisy people in the room, of which we have a few at times.

If you're looking for good, accurate, true sounding headphones you cannot go wrong with these. If you want something bright and big bump and thump, these are not for you. Sound pros will know exactly what I'm talking about."
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In 1991 Sony introduced the ""Closed"" MDR7506 headphones to audio professionals. Impeccable neutrality, outstanding comfort, and timeless build quality soon made them an industry standard. Today is January 2, 2016. And yes, 25 years later they remain by far the go to headphones of audio pros everywhere. They were high resolution before there was high resolution, Hi Res. The Sony MDR7506 is a true classic. They are great for all genres of music but they will not fake it. If the source ain't good, then the source will not sound good. But if the source is good, then the sound will be just as good. Lead vocals and lead guitars will take their place at center stage. Everything will be in its place the way the artists and engineers wanted it. And everything will be heard. Great music comes into full bloom. Hallelujah!

If I only had two pairs of headphones for listening to music and watching movies at home one would be a Closed and the other an Open back headphone. Though I prefer the open to the closed ""sound "" in general there is a time and a place for both. And sometimes my ears just get stale and need a change. All open and no closed makes Butch have dull ears... For its vivid clarity, wide soundstage, and outstanding comfort my Open choice would be a pair of Sennheiser HD600 Open Back Professional headphones. Check! Nothing less than $400 is as good. For my closed headphone there is none as good as the Sony MDR 7506 for less than $150. Check! Not even the Audio-Technica ATH M50/50X. Yes, they can be a fun headphone to listen to. But they do not ever offer a full bloom due to their Bass bias. All equalization does is further degrade the source's sound. With neutral cans I decide if and where I want any bumps not someone else... At 10 Oz's the M50's are a full 2 Oz's heavier and over the long haul not as comfortable as the 7506's. Nor are they as durable. Don't get me wrong, I love the ATH M50's from time to time, but they are not the headphone the 7506's are. In addition to home use I would add that the 7506 are also very portable. The coiled cable has been designed so as not to want to get tangled up with itself like so many other coiled cables. These Sony's are fully engineered. Professional indeed. Very minimalist down to their flat black finish. Very Zen."
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very impressed with this item. I bought two of these; I play guitar and my boyfriend plays bass and we both give them two big thumbs up. They arrived earlier than expected. The packaging was great. I got the feeling when I opened mine that I had something really special and it also shows me that Sony takes pride in this item - as well they should. I put them on and was amazed at how comfortable they are as compared to others that I have owned. They look well, and they move well. As far as performance; my expectations are far exceeded. The sound was terrific! I purchased these so that my we could play/practice without worrying about disturbing the neighbors. So glad I did as they have way exceeded my expectations. Love them!"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Sony MDR7506 headphones are so well balanced I'm blown away!! Sony still makes high quality products across the board IMO. I own 4 sets of Sony earbuds and I've tried at least 6 brands and Sony is the clear winner in the earbud department. So it doesn't surprise me that their headphones are the clear winner. I've owned several pair of over the ear headphones over the years including Bose, and the MDR7506 at 79 bucks blows away the competition. I use my MDR7506 to listen to classical music to Hard Rock, and they just ROCK! I'm no expert on headphones but I know what I like and I know what sounds realistic, and the MDR7506 are just awesome. Yes, these are over the ear headphones and all over the ear headphones all get warm, like is somebody talking about me warm? LOL. I'm not going to get all technical in this review, waste of time, but I recommend that you try a set of these Sony MDR7506 because you won't regret it and you'll be hooked.

Update 8/26/2015
I've had these for almost a month now and the drivers are all broken in, yes it takes time for the drivers reach perfection! The MDR7506 are so accurate, for a reason, as they are studio headphones to reproduce music as it was recorded and as the artist had intended. The MDR7506 were designed this way, and not to create ridiculous highs and thundering bass that distracts from the real sound. Once again I highly recommend headphones above the other players in the game. For you audiophiles that still use records on a turntable with a analog amplifiers, the MDR7506 are the headphones for you! Oh yeah! Also well made and durable. Thank you Sony!

FYI - I discovered the hard way that at the pivot and folding joint can pinch ones skin and draw blood. Keep your fingers and web between your thumb and fore finger away from this point while adjusting and just plane putting them on your head! See photo."
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Previously, I'd been using a pair of Sony MDRZX100 ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black), and those were fantastic, especially for their price range, but after 5 years they finally bit the dust. I decided that I would go for something a bit higher end, that would last for a long time, and after doing some research, these emerged as the strongest contender. The big factor in this was finding that these don't really alter how things sound, as other headphones apparently emphasize or de-emphasize certain things which can alter how things sound. I largely wanted something that would just be accurate to how stuff is meant to sound, without really wanting ""enhancements"" that can make it deviate from how it was meant to be. The MDR7506's deliver everything I hoped they would.

The songs I listened to had the same character as they did on the ZX100's, but sounded much cleaner and clearer. I found myself noticing more detail and texture in the instruments, but they still sounded like what I was familiar with. I decided to use these for a couple rounds of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and the benefit even more striking than it was with music. I noticed myself hearing footsteps and gunshots from much farther away, and it seemed like I was able to mentally pinpoint where they were coming from much more accurately than before, which was helpful. The gunshot noises in general had a lot more nuance and detail than I had noticed before. Other games, such as Sonic Racing Transformed didn't feel too different, but still sounded good. One added benefit I really wasn't expecting is that these headphones, while not ""noise cancelling"" do an excellent job at blocking out external sound due to how they cover your ear. My PC has fairly quiet fans as-is, but these block it out almost entirely (and now it feels weirdly loud when I take them off). They also take down the sound of my typing quite a bit.

Overall, I'm completely satisfied with these in every regard. They sound good and feel good. They also come with a 1 year warranty inside the box, which is nice. These are apparently the standard in the audio industry, and I can see why, they're great."
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of these in 1991. Exact same headphones. They finally died and I looked up reviews for something to replace them with. To my amazement they still exist! Same model from 25 years ago. Not only that, but when I started looking at serious reviews (no offense amazon reviewers, you guys are gold too!), these are still on top of the heap until spending much more.

So I got another pair. They sound exactly the same as I remember when mine were fresh and new. I am a recording engineer with a very acute memory for sounds. They are clear and fairly deep. They have some brittleness or sharpness in the treble, but it's not terrible. It gives them a perceived resolution which is greater than I suspect the really should have. Sound blockage is also very good unless you are eating corn chips ;). They are also some of the most comfortable cans I've worn.

These are not being used much for music making, but are great for gaming on a pc and listening to (mostly uncompressed) music on my iphone."
13,5.0 out of 5 stars," Great pair of headphones! I purchased these on May 21st, 2015 and they are still working and I use them all the time. Currently it's 5/15/2017. The headphones are noise isolated (not cancelled) which means they are insulated with foam so it can be a little hard to hear people talking and your ears might get a little warm. The warmth isn't bad for me though. I personally was able to get used to it easily. Case Star ® Black Color Lightweight Heart-shaped Protective Carrying EVA Hard Headphone Case Storage Bag for Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone with Case Star Black Color Drawstring Carrying Pouch I bought this case for storing my headphones and it is a nice snug fit. I use an external DAC with these headphones as well. FiiO E10K USB DAC and Headphone Amplifier (Black) It works nicely with these headphones.

I would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a pair of well made, quality headphones that will last them a long time."
14,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have better sounding headphones by Audeze and Fostex but I listen to these more than either for practical reasons that really do matter. First, this is a pair of cans you can comfortably wear in bed. Second, they are portable, durable and wear well. Toss them in a bag and it won't matter what bangs up against them or how they get bumped- they'll be fine and look fine when all is said and done. All my other headphones would be broken if I'd done to them what I do to these. Third, while the pads will eventually shred after three or four years, they are replaceable. And the velour pads you can get on the secondary market are probably better than the originals. Fourth, yes, they isolate sound really well. I use them at work for video filming and editing; they really do the job in noisy environments. Finally, the sound is quite good. Downside? Yes, unless you really like warm ears."
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Teenage Twin Girls- so 2 headphone sets. The kids wanted Beats Wireless Studio 2. Audiophile Dad selected these MDr-7506 headphones, which I had a pair one day long ago. This is a gift review, unwrapping and seeing these instead of the Beats they were like 'What"" WOW! these look totally cool. As they removed it from the package they saw the coiled cord and loved it as 'Retro"" which they love as they have a new phonograph. All good so far- they already liked it better than the Beats. They put them on- loved how they suppressed a lot of the outside noise and how they fit perfectly over their head and ear and how comfortable they were. Beats Studio 2? Who Dat?
They have Samsung Note 3 (they don't want to upgrade- love them as they are) and plugged in...... eyes lit up, they love the sound- even, balanced, rich bass, clear mids and nice trebles. They just love how it sounds. I explained these are reference style headphones and that if you want more bass- use the phone eq. They don't want to touch it- the songs sound great as they are-. Now I only have to teach them to be 'cool' with their new phones by not yelling when they talk- just the right amount of exterior noise suppression to impress them.

I took a chance- it paid off and I saved some cash because I saw the Amazon feedback confirmed what I remembered about these headphones. To top it off, one got a phonograph and loved the retro look, and other got a beginner Pioneer DJ setup.

Life is good with the Sony headphones."
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I worked in radio stations for most of my career in the working world and am now happily retired. Though my duties at work were in the offices, I had daily business to conduct in the studios, so I got to visit with the DJs and production people quite often. In later years, I noticed that they were all wearing Sony MDR-7506 headphones - and that was the model that our engineering staff would provide for them. In my home systems, I always preferred Sony equipment and had purchased a pair of Sony MDR-V600 headphones. Mistakenly, I thought they were pretty good, but after I sampled first a V6 and then a 7506, I knew that the 600s were to be relegated to the pile of unused equipment.

As I said, I started with the 600s and then discovered the V6s. Reading up on headphone reviews and sales sites, I learned that the V6s were making a comeback after a few years off of the consumer market, and that many recommended them for their ability to provide a true, uncolored sound. That was what I always strove for, so I took the plunge and got a pair of V6s.

Still, I remembered the ""Professional"" sticker on the 7506 headphones of the DJs at work whereas my V6s just said ""Digital"". When I first looked for 7506s, I could only find them on professional musician-type of websites. Then a few years later, they appeared here on Amazon and I finally got to compare them to the V6s that I so loved.

At first, when brand new, I thought the 7506s weren't quite up to what I was used to with the V6s, but after a short break-in period, I couldn't tell the difference between the two, and I now used them interchangeably. Both give me accurate frequency response across the entire spectrum of audible sound, and both continue to impress long after the initial purchase.

Alas, they are not perfect. Their flaw is the material that the earpads are made of, a thin leatherette material that when new, provides an excellent curtain for exterior sound blocking. But with usage, the leatherette dries out and flakes off. This is easily reparable with replacement pads, but at a cost. Genuine pads are fairly expensive, but yo end up with practically brand new headphones again. There are other makes of pads that fit, but they color the sound differently, so I avoid those.

Basically, what I'm saying is that these are so good, that it's easy to forgive the pads that wear out over time. And from my perspective, you are safe purchasing either the V6s or the 7506s, on whichever you can get the better price. They are functionally identical."
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own the mdr-v6 and can’t speak highly enough regarding the sound quality/build for what is really a paltry sum. They punch weigh above their weight. Can be driven solidly and accurately from small usb powered amplifiers, offer surprising fidelity from headphone output of a decent CD player but scale well with better sources and amplification. This headphone is no different in that respect. The build is the same. A red “professional” sticker on the cups versus the mdr-v6’s “Digital”. That’s literally where the difference in build begins and ends. A sticker. Popping the cups open may and probably does reveal more that causes the subtle yet firmly present change in sound signature. As with the v6, the pads being the same; kind of suck but if you’re invested in these, dekoni makes a utterly delightful pad that while expensive is ridiculously comfortable without screwing up the sound signature. I can’t hear any changes meaningful enough to be able to convince myself it’s there for the better or worse that the dekoni pads effect anything at all.
Efficient and accurate, I do feel the 7506 is a little more analytical, not cold or lifeless by any stretch but certainly geared more for the professional requiring accuracy and neutrality but that doesn’t exclude the casual listener or music/headphone enthusiast even the budget oriented audiophile can get a lot of enjoyment from this particular set of headphones. I hear these to be a little more mid range; maybe not forward or emphasized but certainly more mid centric than the mdr-v6 which in and of itself has a very pleasant mid range. The bass; the bass is different. The first evening I had them. I played Aretha Franklins Ain’t no way. I kept hearing these super low tones and thought they were coming from behind me. Kept looking over my shoulder. It was bass I hadn’t heard in the same track before. I played it over and over and it’s the same sub bass, in the same places. Very low. Solidly around 20Hz. Impressive. Not overpowering, flabby or booming but present in justbthe kost convincing way.
I feel there’s a difference in sound stage, maybe it’s just in separation but it does feel a tad narrower but still wider than I expect a closed cup to be. Still; to me anyway a very entertaining headphone.
Enclosed is a “service manual” of sorts and a parts list of the entire exploded headphone and some online research shows this headphone is certainly rebuild-able maybe even scratch built with parts sourced online. That’s handy if your both a headphone enthusiast and tinkerer. More online research nets very little information on Sony’s website regarding either the mdr-v6 or this set of phones. Only posts under “community” so the fate of these headphones, possibly the provenance may be questionable. I am confident both pairs of mine are genuine and both this and the v6 sound wonderful in their own way. Really a solid purchase. I really wish I’d known about these Sony’s and the koss portapro when all I had for music was a portable CD player/headphones and a binder full of discs. I’d have probably never gone over to the dark side with MP3’s."
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am hearing impaired and have loads of headphones and headsets, some of which are much better than others for me. I did a lot of research before I bought these Sony headphones because they were pricey and I wanted the best sound for my hearing loss. I lost all my high pitches so I need both volume and the ability to get crisp clear sound in order to make up for my deficits. After reading review after review of different headphones, I chose these.

These have large ear cups which is great because I can wear them over my hearing aids without pain. Although I usually don't wear my aids with headphones due to feedback, when I do, smaller ear cups really hurt my ears due to the pressure of the aids against the headphones. These are comfortable with or without the aids and can be worn for extended periods of time without any problems. They have a long cord which is great for me. I often workout watching exercise videos on my computer and have to have headphones to hear the music/instruction. The longer cord gives me the ability to do that although I also use Bluetooth headphones to eliminate the wires all together.

But the real winner here is the sound. It's so good. It's rich and full and music sounds so good that I can't believe it. However, for me, spoken words like podcasts and movies don't sound quite as good. That is due to the amount of bass in these headphones. For normal hearing people, the bass is a plus. For me, it sort of muddles speech. Still, I can use these to watch movies and they are only slightly less clear than my other favorite headphones by Turtle Beach.

For music though, wow. Very, very good. My son who is an audiophile and has $300 headphones actually feels these headphones sound as good or even better than his and that's saying something. He says speech is crystal clear for him (He has normal hearing.) and the volume is way more than enough for any application. I also find it to be sufficient.

I love the headphones for music and use them mostly to listen to music. I will also use them for other things but they really are made for music and they do a heck of job making each instrument stand out and creating a really pleasurable listening experience. That is rare for me since my hearing loss makes things sound flat and tinny a lot of the time. I am happy with these headphones for music and I can use them for other applications as well. I have had them for months and they have held up just fine. They're a bit bulkier than some other headphones but so worth it. Great sound."
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. They are so much better than the Beats crap and other trendy brands people go so crazy over.

Whether you are using them plugged into your mixing console for live sound/recording or you just plug them into your phone, the sound is fantastic. The frequency response is flat and accurate, so you get what you are supposed to without any overly exaggerated frequencies, The bass is solid and accurate without being overpowering, The mids are clear and the highs are clean."
20,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The audio range on these headphones are absolutely stellar, but the cord is the biggest annoyance I've ever dealt with. It's heavy, bulky, pulls down on the headphones, and gets in the damn way all the time. I shake my leg a lot when I'm sitting in a chair, and the cord moving around makes the headphones quite noisy - meaning the movement in the cord causes mechanical movement vibration noises in the headphones which annoy the hell out of me; I have to hold the cord to dampen the vibration to remove the noise. These headphones would be 1000x more awesome with a removable cord."
22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality alone gets these a 5-star rating. I like the sound better than my brother's Beats and other more expensive, more ""fashionable"" over-ears. I will say, though, that the coiled cord is a bit inconvenient if you're just planning on listening to music on your phone. It's very long and prone to kinking. These headphones were made more for use in a professional studio where they won't be traveling too far. Also, the jack has difficulty fitting into and staying in an iPhone 6 when there's a cover on it, since it's only BARELY long enough to snap in without the case on. With the case preventing it from going in all the way, it's a bit more prone to slipping out of the phone when you move around, and you'll have to reconnect it every so often."
23,4.0 out of 5 stars,"SOUND: I agree with what others are saying about the sound quality. These headphones are very well balanced throughout the entire range. The mids are crystal and I've heard some of the clearest vocals that I've ever experienced. As you can see in the attached screen shot of the equalizer the sound profile of the MDR-7506 is pushed toward the high end so it does need a little boost in the low range to help bring the bass tones out. But also notice that the mid to high range is nearly flat. These cans sound great right out of the box!

COMFORT: To be honest I've owned better. I am able to wear them for a couple of hours without feeling too much discomfort. But eventually the slight pressure starts to squeeze my ears. It would help if the both the band and ear cups were a tad larger.Also the ear cups have a vinyl covering that traps heat and causes sweat to build up. I ended up purchasing a pair of velour pads which I highly recommend.. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081SO0RM?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00

CONVENIENCE: The band double folds for storage and a carrying bag is provided for travel. Just to be clear though, when I say ""travel"" I mean sticking them in a suitcase, not using them on the go. The coiled cable is not detachable and these are not the sort of headphones you would use on a bus or plane. I would recommend against purchasing these if you want something for both home and your commute.

OVERALL: I am extremely happy with the purchase. The sound quality is fantastic! They are reasonably comfortable. The price is definitely right. As long as you're okay with the permanent cord and smallness of the pads I would highly recommend these headphones for PC gaming, movies, music and production."
24,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things sound wonderful and have great build quality. They are not flashy (kids don't want to ""borrow"" them) and according to all the reviews are not overwhelming on bass / treble, giving you a fairly accurate reproduction of the original music. A quick note about the cord: it's huge, and it's beefy! On the upside the wire is about 6' long before you start stretching the coils, so you can probably get anywhere in your office while wearing these. On the downside, you're not gonna wear these while walking / bicycling, the cord's just too long."
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The review begins with the obvious things any
headphone should have.

1. Lightweight....YES
2. Cord on 1 side and long enough...YES
3. Earcups feel soft and delightful....YES
4. All mechanical features durable....YES
5. Low Frequencies....Neutral...""as the song was recorded."" YES
6. Mid Frequencies.....Neutral...same as above...
7. Bass Frequencies...Neutral...same as above.
8. Capture time....lightning fast....YES
9. Overall fit and sound reproduction...
a. Ability to get very loud but stay undistorted...YES
b. Ability to isolate you from outside sounds....Excellent.
c. Ability for ears to not get sweaty....Not so good....
d. Ability to not pinch ears when laying on side...YES
e. Headband almost feels like its not there...Excellent

Ok so they are the best pair I have ever owned in
their ability to reproduce what was recorded but
I have a few points to make about that perfection.

The average song will need equalization to boost
up the bass a tiny bit, and cut some of the highs.
And add a tiny degree of echo....this is all it will
take to make these headphones sound perfect...

But without equalization they are a little bit flat
in the bass and too bright in the highs and do
not have a ""spatial feel"" They sound precise...
Not warm and not enhanced at all...

This I guess is what it means to be a studio
grade professional headphone....but without
having an equalizer you will hear everything
but it will be flat...just as the recording was
made....so....think about using the Klipsch
Image One premium...the highs will not be
as crisp and clean but the bass will be in
a ""sweeter spot' that provides great sound
in uses where you don't have a high end
equalizer with you...

Of course some laptops allow some basic
sound enhancements but on my laptop its
not possible to match a real EQ's ability to
contour the sound as it needs to be for
making these Sony's shine...Apple laptops
of course all sound better...in all conditions.
MP3's really do not bring you the best sound.
WAV files are far better...

This headphone is Great For Studio Use....
Pretty Nice For Laptop Use...but needs EQ adjustment
and WOWSRS adjustment.

I gave it 5 stars....because it deserves 5 stars.
The Klipsh gets 4 stars...and is better for home use."
26,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Possibly the best phones available when factoring in price. Extremely comfortable to wear for an extended time frame. If buying for general use, some might find the low end lacking punch and fullness. This is to be expected as their response is very flat and accurate. A simple EQ is all that's needed to provide some thump. I use these mostly when recording drums and guitar but also for general listening at times. For overall music, phones such as the Audio Technica ATH 40's and 50's might be a better choice although nowhere near as comfortable as the Sony's."
27,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't necessary love these as shipped, but after a couple of quick modifications, these are tied with my open-ear Sennhsers for the #1 spot.

The headphone ear pads are awful and need to be replaced almost immediately. These Beyerdynamic EDT250V ones are a good addition. I'm not sure what to do with the plastic pieces they came with and the foam speaker covers fit weird, but the ear pads themselves are soft and comfortable. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MF7W2

My only complaint with them, with an easy fix, is that the headphones like to collapse too easily making them hard to wrangle back into shape sometimes. I found an easy fix for this though, a pair of 3/4"" binder clips over the collapse pivot. After opening the clips and clamping them over each side, you take off the binder bin handles, and you can barely see that there is a anything there keeping the speakers from folding into the headband. It also keeps them from squeezing your head too, making them fit much looser, which was a benefit I didn't anticipate."
28,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are not here to embellish or improve your sound; they're here to give you the most accurate representation of the sound possible.

And they do so very beautifully. I now use these as my staple for mastering and mixing my musical work. They fit really well, they're quite adjustable, the wire has an INSANE rea--Okay, hold on a moment; let's seriously talk about the wire length this has for a moment:

Have you ever had to go mess with some electronics at 3:30am while wearing headphones? Have you ever had to do this when the headphones are plugged in on the OTHER SIDE of the ROOM from that piece of electronics? Cause you can totally do that with these! It's one of those features that you think is completely over-the-top until it actually comes in handy.

But yeah, these things conform to the head really nicely, and seem to be designed with wear-and-tear durability in mind.

The only downside, which is why I still carry earbuds with me, is that these aren't exactly portable if you wanna store them in a backpack, and they don't fit well around my neck... But again, this is more of an at-home or studio tool. You should be testing your music through conventional earbuds at some point anyways."
29,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just as great as always! I've had this exact model of phones over the past 20 years and (gladly) they have not changed. Wonderful sound quality and a response curve that compliments the needs of sound engineering... playback through these phones is an honest representation of the mix. I usually will playback/monitor through a few different phones and speakers and even environments. When I get a good sound in these and also my original Yamaha NS10 monitors I feel secure that I've got a good broadcast quality mix.
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones, and the flat response is what I expected. The cable is nice and long, and the headphones are comfortable to wear. The one thing that surprised me, and stood out for me was the volume of the headphones. This is to say that setting the volume to 50% on the source, these headphones will be louder than my Bose noise cancelling headphones, as well as the Bose earbuds. I like that I don't need to turn the volume up so much to get a comfortable volume level. I assume that this will also help to properly adjust the level of any recorded audio.

So far, I'm very happy with these for the price. I would definitely recommend these."
31,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The quality of this headphone was well-known even before buying. A small research thorough the internet will show you these phones present a quality far superior than other products at the same price range, in fact better than headphones costing double or even triple of this one.

Read through the reviews in this page to know these monitor headphones are heavily used by virtually anyone that knows even a bit of music, from music enthusiasts to great names studios. The phones themselves are of simple design, without unnecessary frills, but the focus is sound quality, one thing that Sony dominates. The +20 years the 7506 are in the market prove this quality

The audio itself is clear and well-balanced, the phone works well on any cellphone or portable player and there is no need of an amplifier (They are very loud), the bass end is a little low compared to other headphones available on the market, but with a small tweak on any equalizer or bass boost can fully reproduce a subwoofer without quality loss.

The lightweight but resistant structure makes possible wearing the phones for hours without hurting the ears, the vinyl pads blocks well external noises and sound leaking, but the pads tend to wear after some months of heavy use. Though replacements are cheap and easy to change.

~This is my first review. I've had these phones since June 2014, and I don't doubt they will last for many years."
33,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price I'm very happy with these. They sound great and are pretty comfortable.

I personally find the curly cord to be awful. I use these for guitar recording a lot, and the cord is just not long enough for me with it being all coiled up. I feel like I barely get a few feet out of the length and it's always getting caught on things and tugging on the headphones on my ears while I'm playing guitar.

If I ever need a replacement I won't buy these again with that cord."
34,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently acquired a Korg Triton Extreme keyboard, which I just simply adore, and which I play often and for extended periods of time. I also recently invested in Logic Pro X, which, together with my Apogee Duet, has allowed me to build up songs, track by track. So I decided that I needed a neutral, closed back headphone set for not only playing, but also for tracking and mixing (when I need to not disturb others). I adore my Grado SR-225 headphones, but I have never considered them to be ""neutral"", and they are about as open as you can get. So, I started my research into what are known as ""Studio Monitor"" headphones.

My search revealed three main contenders in my price range: these headphones (the Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone, which are sonically identical to their predecessor, the Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil), the Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones with Coiled Cable, and the Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones.

I learned pretty quickly that the 7506's are considered to be an industry standard, but also that some consider them to be somewhat unmusical, or ""too analytical"" or something along those lines. Fine for cold hard calculating sound engineering stuff, but not great for LISTENING to (and enjoying) music. So, this put me off the 7506's.

As for the HD-280 Pro's, there were a number of reviews where the plastic of the headband cracked after just a few months and eventually broke, which concerned me, and many reviewers found them to be uncomfortable. Of course, there are a LOT of reviews and these were still strong contenders. However, I got a chance to listen to these locally, and didn't really like my first impression of them--although I would definitely require some extended listening (and break-in) before making any judgement of them.

Moreover, it seemed that the Audio Technica ATH-M50's were by far the best reviewed headphones of the three, and were considered to be very musical. In fact, according to HeadRoom, they are one of the top 10 headphones under $500. Very impressive! So, I decided on the M50's and ordered them from Amazon.

Unfortunately, I was definitely NOT impressed! You can read my review for more details, but the short version of it is this: the M50's are not linear, have a hump in the bass at 100 Hz and another below that; have recessed mids; and sound muddy and dark to my ears. I didn't like them at all, not for music appreciation, and certainly not for use as a ""studio monitor"", which they clearly are not.

So, I returned the M50's and decided to try the industry standard, hoping that I wouldn't find them to be too harsh. I was worrying they might be a little like the Yamaha NS10 studio monitors, which are infamous for not sounding great, BUT are really useful because, if you mix using them, and get the mix to sound decent on the NS10's, then the result will sound great on ANYTHING ELSE! Or so the legend goes. I've never heard NS10's. But I was hoping that the 7506's wouldn't be like that. And I was reassured by one review which specifically said that they weren't. So I decided to give them a try.

Boy am I happy that I did! I wish I had gone for these first, and I would STRONGLY urge you to be skeptical of all the claims that these headphones are too analytical or that they are unmusical or any of that. Nothing could be further from the truth. These are wonderfully, brilliantly, clearly, and precisely musical, faithful, and enjoyable. I stayed up late more than once because I kept wanting to hear how something else in my music library would sound through these headphones. I LOVE that they are ""analytical""--i.e. that they are NEUTRAL and even-handed. It's SO NICE to listen to equipment that has an extended, and yet not boomy or exaggerated bass. These headphones are really, really great for the price. And they are very comfortable and have a good amount of isolation. The isolation of the 7506's is not as good as the M50's, in my experience, and about the same as the 280's, although, to be fair, I only have a very limited amount of exposure to the 280's.

In any case, there's a reason that these are an industry standard. And they are not just popular with sound engineers; they are also renowned among musicians. One of my friends even told me that there are albums where the V6 / 7506's are specifically mentioned as what the artist recommends that the record be listened to on. Or something like that. You can't go wrong with these headphones. You really can't. For any purpose. And that reminds me, I should add that while I did do a lot of listening to these using my Duet as both DAC and amp, I found that the 7506's sounded really great straight out of my iPhone 4 (and out of my Korg Triton, too, of course). The fact that these can be driven well by the iPhone definitely sets them apart and it's another huge plus for these headphones. In my experience plenty of other ""easy to drive"" headphones still suffer when used straight out of something like an iPhone or iPod, but not the 7506's.

Now, personally, I prefer open cans to closed (and sometimes I NEED to be able to hear my surroundings), so I do most of my listening to music on my Grado SR-225's or my Sennheiser PX-100's (the original version, not the PX-100 II 's, which are not nearly as good). But I would be pretty happy listening to the 7506's as well. And when I play my Korg, and/or compose/record, I use the 7506's exclusively and they are awesome. Highly recommended."
35,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these things. These are my 3rd pair I have ever owned. The first pair was used for 7-9 years in my mobile studio for live tracking. As well as for use in mixing down. The 2nd pair were dedicated Control Room phone in a studio for around 6-7 years. Then they were donated to the church where I run sound. They still sound great and I have only replaced the ear pads 2 times. This set is for me and my everyday use. I use blue tooth headsets for biking and stuff, but, when i need to really listen to something, these are what I choose."
36,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great. After a while of being indecisive of whether to get the MDR7506 vs. The MDRV6 I finally made the commitment to get these, and I'm very satisfied. They fit great over the ears, and even after hours of wearing them my ears don't get tired or anything. They're very comfortable, and the sound is clear. They cancel outside sounds so they're perfect for keeping you in your zone, or if there's noise around, and you want to cancel it out. These are also made from Sonys professional department, which to my knowledge handles their warranties differently, for example if something were to go wrong with these you get the same pair or get them fixed, but if you had purchased a pair of the MDRV6, and something were to go wrong with them, you would get a replacement pair of a older model headphone, I think the MDR600 or MDRV600 (I forget the name, I think it's. The MDR600 though), since its through Sonys digital department. If you're in the market for a pair of studio headphones I highly reccomend these (Sony MDR7506 Professional). It's worth it."
37,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wore through a pair of these that I had from college (25 years ago, gulp), but didn't replace them because I had no need. Recently, I started playing bass guitar and needed some good phones so as to not disturb my neighbors at night. I made the mistake of trying the Phil Jones Bass Guitar Headphones H850s for $99. I thought they were super weak. So, I picked-up these Sony's for a little comparison, and the Sony's blew the H850s out of the water. I'll never get another kind of headphone."
38,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the classic headphones. They are comfortable and they sound great. I use them attached to my cell phone for work and they don't drain the battery nearly as quickly as I thought they would. They cord can be a little unwieldy but it sure comes in handy when you need it to reach 8 feet or more and stay plugged in. I'm not real easy on the equipment I own and these headphones have held up quite well so far. The ability to purchase spare parts is also a major plus.
39,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love them, they sounds great and very comfortable! I have Sennheiser HD600, Beyer dynamic DT990, AudioTechinica M50X, Philips SHP9500, Hifiman He400s, Shure 1540. But I enjoy wearing these most of the time, great clean sound with emotion and realistic playback. They are not perfect, first the cable is not detachable. so you need to carry the super long ,heavy cable with you everywhere. Secondly the closed back design determine they won't have the sound stage like the other open back design headphone. Overall this is a great headphone for all kind of music because of the neutral sound signature. If you like a bigger sound stage and use headphone at home, get the Philips SHP9500."
40,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Totally floored by these headphones. After seeing them declared ""the literal best headphones in existence"" by every person who had ever stuck them on their head, I was expecting some kind of magical fairy dust type s*** to happen when I plugged them in. Imagine my disappointment when I put them on and couldn't hear any difference from other giant headphones I had tried. But, then I noticed that I was really getting into the song that was playing. I felt chills going down my spine, which almost never happens, and never on the 100th or so time listening to a song.

So, I have no idea what makes these headphones good. They are comfortable enough that I suspect I could wear them 24 hours a day, forever, without any problems (which is apparently what I'm going for, as I am now sleeping with them on more often than not). I put other headphones on and cannot hear a bit of difference, but somehow, in some hipster audiophile way (which I really suspected was just pretentious BS until now), these headphones are better. I'm still not going to drink the HiFi Koolaid and buy a bunch of records that I listen to while wearing a scarf indoors... at least I hope not. This might be a first step down a dark road."
41,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed to replace my AKG K240s that inexplicably died on me, and I wanted to stay in the same price range, these came with a professional pedigree of their own and a ton of great reviews. I am very pleased I bought these. The design is superb in that they collapse when not in use, the carry pouch is cool, the sound is most important to me though, and I can't add anything in that respect that so many haven't already offered, and probably in much better detail than I could anyway. Suffice to say that I wish I had bought these sooner. Out of all the headphones I own, these are easily the best for critical listening and mixing when not using monitors.

***Update***
It is now Jan.2, 2016 and just like my AKGs before them, my Sony's have bit the dust. Sound inexplicably dropped out on the left side. I'm not sure if this is planned obsolescence or just shoddy workmanship, but it's as if we cannot count on any product standing the test of time anymore. It will probably cost more than I paid for them to have them repaired. I really need to learn to repair the connections myself to avoid this in the future."
42,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones approx. two month's now and have used them at least a couple hour's (are more) everyday .They are good headphones . There not great headphones .? i use them only for recording . so that's all I can comment on . some of my tracks even at low volume's make the phone's sound a little muddy . I thought it was my mixing but when my telecaster is played clean, set at 3 volume and my levels are set for no clipping and they still sound gritty ? understand that's why I say there good but not great . I can hear all my tracks separate ( That's Good ).final thought on these headphones if you can get a pair at a fair price ( under 70 bucks ) go for it they would be worth that amount . otherwise don't believe all the hype . They wear well ,there small ,they seem to be made well ,and they good enough for home recording . .I guess its all about what each musician are consumer thinks is good sound ."
44,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yea. They're Great ! Bought another pair for my son. :) My favorite thing about them is the comfort. They're light, don't fit too tight, and seem to have a great amount of travel in the head piece so that they should fit a nice variety of head sizes. My head is fairly big and they are very comfortable to me. They even sound good with low quality, low definition, recordings as long as you don't crank it up too much. Some of the stuff I listen to on You Tube is low def. You can't really turn up low def or it just gets mushy, but that's not the headphones fault at all. The HD recordings sound really really awesome, clear, deep, and LOUD if you want them to be."
45,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good sound - not outstanding, but then for the price one cannot expect top tier performance. Comes with two plugs that can be changed out, one for plugging into your PC or other product that requires the smaller plug and another larger one that is intended for audio equipment requiring the larger jack. Seems well built and the cord is very substantial even though it is lightweight and comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I use this when listening to movies or music on my PC so as not to disturb my wife who is at her PC at her desk behind mine. This headset also helps to isolate outside noises that can be distracting while listening to music or films. For the price, this unit serves my needs quite well."
46,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first pair of not-$15 headphones. I'm no audiophile but the sound quality is great.

I have glasses and typically over- or on-ear headphones are very uncomfortable. These are comfortable to wear for hours.

The extra small wires around the ears are somewhat unsightly. Even when headphones are at maximum extension, there is extra slack in those two wires. They should be shorter.

A small piece of metal (from soldering?) came loose in the left earcup and was rattling around after two weeks of use. It was easy to remove the earcup, unscrew the covering (4 small screws), remove the little metal piece, and screw it back together. Putting the earcup back on was a bit of a challenge (didn't want to tear it)."
47,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, I find these great. I wanted to like them, of course; but I did not expect to prefer them to my Grado sr-225s. Not that they walk all over them, but they are just that bit more 'more' fuller and richer. (without being overly warm) I needed closed cans as the grados leak sound like crazy, not great in hospital waiting rooms or polite buses. What surprises me is that I want to wear these over the Grados even when I could benefit from NON closed back. ( like walking around. These seal out so much it could be dangerous, but it is all about the sound so I wear em anyway) I honestly think they compare favorable to the all metal 500-whatever line/dollar Grado phones. Though I think THOSE Grado are better, and I haven't spent much time with those I still think it's apt. These ARE 300$ plus headphones, but now you can get them for LOTS less.
I'd do it. But one thing: these cans seem to really suppress tape hiss. This is a boon for normal listening, as it does NOT obscure treble detail or MUCH ( but SOME) 'air', but for monitoring?!?!
I wouldn't. Not analog anyway. If lots of studios use this since the nineties, it may well explain the WILDLy differing levels of tape hiss between albums of similar sound quality (and even on the SAME album sometimes - especially with lots of multitracking 'mixed down') as you really aren't going to hear all the hiss that IS there sometimes(analog mostly), so how can you fix what you can't hear? So- if I were releasing commercially sold music I'd find something more ruthlessly revealing (dunno what). They're good though. Very. And if you are semi pro, the price makes up for that by far; and if you AREN'T mixing, well- the hiss suppressions almost a bonus, then!
Excellent - but the five stars would be four if these were compared to Stax phones or top drawer Senns or HI FI man ( I imagine) cans. At 300, I'd recommend them highly. At the less then 1/3 of that current price? I'm going to buy a spare at least; and I call them a SCREAMING bargain. DESTROYS top beats, Bose and skullcandy. DeStRoYs them."
48,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have some nice features. They are very comfortable to wear, and fold to a compact enough size for travel. They seem well-made, like most Sony products. However, I am not all that impressed by the sound quality. I listen mostly to classical music, and thought these headphones are fine in the mid-ranges, the highs are a little too ""bright"", and the reproduction of string bass is odd. It is sort of fuzzy, with a slight echo, or with a small excess vibrato sound. I have used headsets for half the price that had equally good sound, and I have owned sets for twice the price that produced sound quality far superior to these Sony's."
49,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I was very young around 1984 or so I had a pair of Sony MDR40 headphones that were the best I ever used for years. Since then I've bounced around various cheapo phones and earbuds, and wished Sony still made that model. Finally after sniffing around the net and reading reviews I broke down and got a pair of these, and they are all that I hoped for. Finally once again I can listen to music with the clarity I remember. These are no-frills headphones: no Bluetooth, no controls or sliders, just plain old-fashioned headphones with great sound that are very comfortable to wear. They fold up and fit into the included vinyl storage bag, and the cord is long enough to relax on the couch. Wouldn't recommend these for running or working out or anything; too bulky and the cord is too long. These are for studio work and serious listening. The outer shells are very sound resistant; when the music stops I can actually hear my own heartbeat inside the shells and no traffic outside or anything. At first I thought it was my music player but it was actually me. Great headphones at a good price."
50,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing. I used to have a pair of Sony MDRV6’s back in the day. Through the years, and kids using them, they ended up breaking.
So glad I ordered these! The bass response and treble are awesome.
I also like the fact that they plug directly in to the audio source. I’m old school, and am not a true fan of Bluetooth. Also... the cord stretches so I can plug the headphones in to an audio source that is several feet away and not have to worry about them coming unplugged.
Kudos to Sony for these headphones!"
51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best bang-per-buck headset out there, IMO. The standard for a reason. Unless you're a unicorn-dung-sniffing audiophile snob with nothing better to do than nitpick, you'll really enjoy the sound, which is open, transparent, full range, accurate, and generally delightful. If anything, it's so detailed that it'll reveal all the flaws in any recording. That ought to please the snobs, but they're never happy unless the component is crafted of pure pixie spew... For everyone else, these will do nicely and then some. They're about as perfect as something in this price class can be. Money well spent, recommended! Yes, they are rather ugly, and rather plastic. Form follows function, and these work. I don't care if they look like the appliance they are. If these ever fail, I'll buy another set. Due to the volume of production, you get these very cheap for what they do. Best buy, recommended!"
52,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Once I started producing music for my brother's band, I realized my earbuds were not up to the task, and after much research my wife agreed to get me these as a Christmas present.

These made me a believer in quality audio. I've never owned any pair of headphones that cost more than $15 before, and these are like a whole new world. Everything's crystal clear, bass is tight without being boomy, more than enough for me. As some reviews mention, they aren't perfectly flat and there is a frequency spike in the upper-mid treble range, but if that bothers you it's easy to EQ them to nearly-perfect neutral. Personally I like the bright sound signature, and it gives great clarity for mixing and production.

Fair warning, they are very ""analytical."" If you just want to listen casually, perhaps look for something with a little more ""fun"" sound signature. The biggest con is that I can barely stand to listen to any other headphones under $50 now, which my wallet can't afford."

55,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of 7506 headphones and I love them. I started off using them in my studio but find myself bringing them just about everywhere I know I'll want to listen to music. Unlike many (read Beats by Dre) headphones out there, these aren't tuned to boost the bass, which is a good thing for most types of music. Are they expensive, yes. Worth it, absolutely.

Long term notes based on my last pair (which I still have and use);
The rubber like coating on the foam that surrounds your ear will likely start to flake off after a while. Minor issue.
If you're a DJ and flip the ear pieces around a lot the joints will become loose. Minor issue.

Bottom line - these are easily my favorite headphones."
56,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these headphones well. As I'm using them to edit interviews and such I don't know, or really care, what an audiophile would think of them. They aren't high-end quality, I'm sure, but for editing podcasts as an example, they work well.

These headphones are reasonably comfortable. Though I wouldn't describe them as isolating, I'm able to do the work with the ordinary sounds in my environment, such as telephones, conversation and microwave noises. There's a long coiled cord but it's weight is manageable. The earpieces are comfortable and I've found that these headphones can be worn for hours without discomfort.

For the price, they're a good deal."
57,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably the best headphones I've ever owned. They are lightweight and pack into a small space. They have superb sound isolation -- better than some noise-cancelling headphones I've tried -- and brilliant clarity all through the tonal range.

The only downsides are that you can clearly hear the difference between MP3 quality and WAV, and the difference between mobile digital audio and a high-quality sound card. This isn't much of a pain point in my estimation as it may encourage people to choose higher quality sound sources."
58,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The MDR-7506s are an excellent value at $85. They perform as admirably as headphones costing over twice plus they are solid, easy to fold for transport and are pretty efficient at keeping the listener isolated from outside noise. I am using them primarily to use my iMac to access my itune AAC256 audio files and play them on the VLC 2.0.6 media player. I plug the 7506s into an HRT microStreamer, and the DAC is plugged into one of the iMac’s USB2.0 ports via an audioquest Forest USB A to mini cable.

For the past couple of years, I’ve been listening to music with my Dunu Trident DN-12 ear buds directly connected by their 3.5mm jack to the headphone out/optical digital audio port of my iMac. Ever since I’ve added the new headphones and DAC, I’ve been enjoying a noticeable improvement in the sound quality of my audio files.

The Dunus are a pretty good product, so I should mention that the sound improvement is still pretty noticeable even when I use the Dunus. However, the 7506s are a definite step up from the Dunus, as they have a fuller midrange, a deeper bass response, better sequestration from outside noise and are more comfortable. I’d roughly estimate that about 70% of the improved audio quality is due to the HRT DAC while the remaining 30% is contributed by the improved headphones.

Both the MDR-7506s and the HRT microStreamer provide a uniquely affordable solution to improve the audio quality of a basic system. I would recommend using one or both devices to anyone who wants to significantly improve their audio capabilities without breaking the bank.

While this is probably already self-evident, these two items are probably not appropriate for those with more experience and have their eyes on upgrading to more advanced audio technology. This encompasses finding and listening to music in lossless (e.g. ALE, FLAC) or high-res (DSD) formats. Generally, the more serious an audiophile you become, the more money you will spend. You’ll need more advanced (read = usually more expensive) technology such as a DSD capable DAC and higher-end headphones and/or speakers. You’ll also need to determine which high-end audio player (Channel D, Bit Perfect, Ammara, Audirvana…) fits your specific needs the best, pay a subscription fee for access and endure the learning curve until you understand how to use the software and can then start paying, downloading and modifying your music files so you can listen to top quality audio. The options you can choose are basically as infinite as your bank account."
59,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved these headphones. Great noise cancellation, amazing quality sound, good design. Obviously the product reviews speak for themselves.

I owned them for a few years but used them only occasionally as these were a luxury buy. Few times a month for video or sound editing, couple of flights..... I hadn't used them for a long time and one day I plugged them in and the right side was dead.

These were great headphones but damn....don't think it's worth it to buy them a second time around."
60,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an audiophile, but your average music-listener.

I was using beats Solo 2 prior to purchasing these headphones. The reason for my purchase is because the beats are too tight for my head. I would constantly have to adjust them to prevent the uncomfortable, headache-inducing squeeze.

These Sony MDR7506 are definitely more comfortable than the beats. I do notice more of a slight heat from the Sony headphones than the beats, but nothing unbearable.

And because I really didn't know any better, I always thought the beats didn't sound too bad, albeit bass heavy. Once I put the Sony headphones on, wow! Everything sounded so clear and crisp! We had to adjust the EQ settings on my laptop though because the highs were too high for my sensitive ears. Other than that, I can't believe I bought into the beats hype when what I needed cost less than $80. I definitely recommend these headphones!"

The bag will eventually disintegrate, along with the foam ears if you own them for a while (I've replaced the foam ears with no issues). The electronics however have never failed. They do tend to sound brighter than pretty much every other pair of headphones I've used. For my professional work in classical music, they work great."
62,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: Forgot to say that ""Open"" headphones don't do very well when lying down because the if the pillow blocks the outside of the ear cups it will change the sound, this is very noticeable with the HIFIMAN HE series (reason many mod the grills) and my Sennheiser HD-598 and HD-650. I can't comment on Grado headphones yet, still trying to decided on which to get.

Got these back in Apr of this year and have been buying and trying a lot of different headphones since retiring in Feb. These are my ""fall asleep"" headphones that I use when I want to relax and go to sleep because of all the other headphones that I currently have they sound the best at very low volume and are very comfortable when fitted with Beyerdynamic velour ear pads and run of a Fiio X3.
I have also tried my V-Moda XS, Sennheiser Momentum On-ear, Sennheiser HD-598 and ATH-M50x when going to sleep but combination of comfort and sound from the MDR-7506 was the best at low fall asleep volume and lying down. As most have noted the MDR-7506 emphasizes the lows and highs a little too much for most but this is the reason for me that they sound the best a very low volume. My other headphones (HE-560/HE-400i/HE-400, Fidelio X1) are just too large to lie down with. At the current price of approx $80 these are hard to beat."
63,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I refrain from writing reviews for products I've purchased until I've owned them for quite a while, mainly because I don't want to write a review a month after and then four months later have a major issue which changes my opinion. I have owned these headphones for almost three years now, and even though I fell in love with them upon the first listen I finally feel comfortable writing a 5-star review for them. They are the best electronics purchase I have ever made.

I bought them on a recommendation from a friend who owns a pair of the similar MDR-V6's, and I am so glad I did. The headphones feel solid and well-constructed, and have stood up to their fair share of abuse over the past few years. I've dropped them, put them at the bottom of a bag with a 4.5lb laptop in it and then dropped that on the floor, put them in a carry on which fell out of the overhead bin, and so much more, and not only did they not break but the sound quality has not diminished whatsoever. A little bit of tweaking is required as they can be somewhat bass-heavy out of the box but that is true with any headphones. The gold plated plug has outlasted a number of devices and the cord is just as strong as the rest of the headphones are.

I got these for about $75 on sale, and purchased the Beyerdynamic velour replacement earpads for $20. While the pleather pads that come standard are not bad, the velour earpads are much more comfortable for long periods of wearing. Overall, these are exceptional headphones for entry-level and professional persons alike."
64,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to frequent the recording studio. The clear location of each voice or instrument on the ""soundstage"" allows your brain to integrate all signals but maintain their unique space as well. So, the device isn't doing the mixing or creating a particular ""sound."" The signals are going in literally, as they are, and I mix them in my head. The result is that your individual ""equalization ""bias"" determines how you will hear the sonds. Therefore, these phones are exceptional for rendering the voice on Skype or Facetime calls."
66,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are awesome. The audio range sounds accurate and dynamic. Most headphones (and certainly monitors) sound a certain way that the brand intends. These headphones feel pretty darn accurate to the audio in your mix.

The headset is quite comfortable. The ears are the most important comfort zone and this set is just fine on mine. The headband begins to feel a little uncomfortable but this is only after prolonged use while I am mixing down.

I really like the coiled cable. When I need to reach for something across the room, the stretching ability of the cable always surprises me. It's also nice how the set comes with a 1/4"" plugin attachment which you can unscrew to reveal a 1/3"" connection instead. Very cool.

My only gripe is that there is a thin wire that runs from the head band to the ear pad. This cable is actually exposed for about 2.5"" of length and makes me very nervous about accidentally hooking to something and pulling the wire out or breaking it. I would have much rather seen this wire discretely and safely run form headband to ear cup another way.

For $85 I couldn't be happier with a headset. Highly recommended."
67,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound, comfortable and seems to be made well at a good price. While I'll use these primarily for voice narration done on a studio microphone and field voice recording from a wireless mic they're also excellent for music. My only hope is that the ear cushions and inner part of head pad aren't covered in the typical cheaply made bonded leather that will begin to come apart with-in a year. Also it would have been an added touch if the plug would have been a 90 degree instead of straight or would have had that type of plug included as an adapter. I got the adapter in a separate purchase but could not find one that was mini 3.5mm male to female that was gold plated. But so far, I'm happy."
68,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones! I use headphones primarily for gaming (pc), listening to music, streaming movies, and for audio-out via my guitar/bass amps. I was looking to move away from the mic gaming headphones I generally use (i.e. SteelSeries, Logitech, etc.) for something better quality. I am glad I made the move to the MDR 7506 headphones. There is no comparison between any of the gaming headphones I have used in the past and the MDR7506 cans. My SteelSeries headphones sound like a cheap speaker in a cardboard box in comparison. With the MDR7506 cans, every footfall, every shot, and the environmental sounds are super clear, giving fantastic directional feedback for FPS games. They have been great for RTS and TBS games as well.
For music, they are pretty amazing. I adjusted the EQ for my soundcard to get my prefered bass sound for some music styles, and the MDR's have responded beyond my expectations. Through my Fender amps they are great. Initially, there was some ""rattle"" in the right ear piece with my bass amp, but after a short burn-in (2-4 hours of blues/jazz/downtempo) and a session thru my guitar amp, the bass rattle is now gone.
I would describe the sound as clear, crisp, bright and rich. The clarity is what really impresses me about these cans...whatever mix I am listening to, or EQ I am using on my amps, everything is just clear, and unadulterated. For the $ I couldn't imagine buying anything else."

I recently bought the second pair so my studio partner could hear the same thing I'm hearing. I use these all the time to mix down recordings and I get really good results. They are great for easy listening too. And comfortable, I can wear these a long time without the fatigue I get with my other headphones I've tried. Plus they fold up into a small size and are very portable. Not much to complain about with these headphones."
70,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is not enough good to say about these amazing headphones. I have used many different models from many different manufacturers over the years, and the 7506 are the classic, good sounding, accurate, comfortable, well made, inexpensive cans you have been looking for.

They are closed back headphones, which means they eliminate some of the background noise and help you hear more clearly the sound you are listening too. This is a two edged sword, because while you can focus and hear your music/game/movie more clearly, you won't be able to hear other people talking to you in the room. This is a good thing and a bad thing... :)

I have had a few pairs of these headphones over the years, and I have never had a bad experience with them, or had them go bad. The only reason I replaced them, was because they were stolen (I WILL AVENGE YOU HEADPHONES!!!) or destroyed (run over by a semi truck) and everything sounds very good through them.

I received it yesterday and noticed two big issues:
1- Mid-low range pushed too much. Trying a classical piece, I could clearly hear the cellos and bass on the right, but the violins on the left were 'far away'. On Alternative rock pieces, the bass range was not clear at all.
2- After 30 minutes, I had to remove them. Not very comfortable."
72,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm always looking for the best deal in headphones. I have a few that are considered up there- Koss Porta Pros, some Senneheisers, the Grado 125's... and somehow I just found out about these a couple months ago through an article on Wire Cutter, when they named them the best headphone under $150.

That was pretty remarkable considering they were almost half that- about $78 on sale when I got 'em here on Amazon. The closed (i.e., sound doesn't leak) design and coiled cord makes them more practical than the Grados. And both the structural design (especially the soft ear pads) and the sound itself (I found the sound of the Sonys less harsh and sibilant). Though the Grados have more 'punch' to the bass and a little more detail overall, I think this is the more balanced, true-to-the-source headphone. It's easy to see why they're the industry standard in recording studios around the world.

I almost ended up getting the Audio Technicha ATH-M50, but after reading the Wire Cutter article, I got these instead. And at nearly half the price, I'm glad I did. These aren't a pair of headphones that will ""enhance"" the music you're listening to (like the M50's) through beefed-up bass; these cans will just give you a detailed, unbiased picture of the source: nothing more; nothing less. To some folks used to that sound, they might think the Sonys sound ""recessed"" because their frequency balance is so remarkably flat.

In summation: These are cans for music fans who just wanna listen to the music, not the headphones."

I was using a vintage set of Yamaha orthdynamic Bellini edition headphones for when I was making music. They still had good quality but was uncertain if I was getting the right sound or not. So I decided to buy these Sony MDRs just to see. I noticed right away that the sound quality is a lot clearer and I can hear more of the lower in frequencies and the high end as well. I admit I do play my music a little bit too loudly but it seems like these headphones can take it. They are of good quality and can get very loud. I do used a headphone amp that helps as well, so no problem I volume there. I can wear these for hours at a time with no problem. I only use these for home studio use and I never take them outside even though they come with a travel bag. The only downside to them is that the cord is very heavy and often gets in the way a lot for me. I am overall satisfied and hope to get some better ones soon."

The fit is ok, but I wish they were a little more snug. Not too snug like aviation headphones, but snug enough to where you don't feel they may fall off.

The headphones sound great and enough of the ambient noise is eliminated to make them useful for monitoring video camera audio in classroom environments. They are great for watching Netflix or YouTube videos without disturbing anyone nearby. Since they are not that snug, they don't fatigue your ears like some headphone do (i.e., David Clarke head-in-a-vise headphones).

I was having to turn my Bose ear-buds up to uncomfortable levels to be able to concentrate on my work. With these headphones, the noise is cut down to a tolerable level without having to have my music at hearing-loss levels. I don't hear any more slurping or lip smacking but the phone conversations do tend to bleed through a little.

As for quality, these headphones provide great clarity - better than anything I currently own or that I tried in the store (though there could be many issues with the display models, so take that for what it's worth). Like others have mentioned, there was a break-in period for a couple of days where the low end seemed nearly non-existent, but now they sound nice and balanced.

The headphones are also pretty comfortable. I typically wear them a couple hours at a time and my ears don't get hot. Sometimes they do put too much pressure on my glasses but taking breaks cuts that way down. The longer cord is great for mobility within my cube and it's coiled so it doesn't get tangled up in the various junk I have scattered around."
77,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i got this for my grandfather who is deaf as a damn door nail . he can actually hear with it, on top of that it blocks outside noise but does not hurt the ears or make ear suction noise or make you're ears pop when taken off.. extremely comfy and keeps the sound in his ears not my'n blocks internal noise from leaking out as well he cranks it up super high. and i have the hearing of a dog (i test 100 times higher than most ppl) and even near him its quiet enough i can watch tv and not be annoyed.. its not perfect but its a serious good set of headphones."
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am not an audiophile but I love how these headphones sound. They're sitting at my desk at work and I use them everyday. I love how you can hear every detail of the music. Way cheaper than a lot of headphones out there and it sounds really good!!!! I always recommend them to friends looking for a new pair of headphones. I think they have an incredible value for the cost. Also they are really comfortable. I can use them for several hours without any discomfort.
79,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sorta silly, but I got depressed after listening to these the first time (well not clinically), It was a good Dylan song, and I heard it so clearly that it was like hearing it for the first time. I am in the film industry (mainly camera, so I don't use headphones all that much) and I needed a set of headphones that gave me a clear sound that is a ""true"" sound, where they don't mess with the bass or treble to make it sound ""better"" when it's distorted and is no good for a real mix. These are perfect for that. I then wore them onto a film set and a union sound guy looks at me and say ""nice MDR7506's"". That's got to count for something when they are recognizable by a guy that has a boom poll tattooed on his arm (seriously)."
80,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all, I should say that I love my music, and I love bass.

These headphones by themselves don't seem to be pre-set (like Beats) to have massive amounts of bass blasting in your ears, which is what I was wanting in a pair of headphones. HOWEVER, if you use an equalizer on your computer or cell phone or whatever you use to listen to music, these things can PUMP OUT some serious bass, as well as keeping the highs and mids crystal clear. I am VERY impressed so far, and I haven't even had a chance to ""burn in"" these headphones.

They seem to be well-constructed and legit. I just got them today, so I will update this review should anything go wrong in the next little bit. Some of the negative reviews may have simply come from people who ended up getting fake headphones, which wouldn't surprise me. I spent maybe 20 minutes comparing the headphones I received with confirmed legit heaphones online, and these seem to be good!

I would recommend these headphones to anyone. Just make sure you burn these in before you make any judgement on them. The sound right out of the box may be a little less warm. Maybe I got lucky and won't have to burn mine in at all. :)

UPDATE JUNE 2016:

These headphones are absolutely amazing. They sound great STILL after 2 years, and are still working just like new. I'm so glad I decided to buy these over overpriced Beats or Skullcandy headphones. These have been completely worth the money! I highly recommend these! Whenever this pair decides to quit on me, I will definitely be back to buy another. I've gone through so many pairs of $20.00 headphones, that having these $80.00 headphones for two+ years has been one of the best financial decisions Ive made. ;)"
81,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I know there are a zillion reviews on these headphones and people probably won't get to my review, but I love these headphones so much, I had to write a review. My first ever ""professional"" headphones was a pair of what I believe to be an older version of this model. I used them for a good 20 years until they finally fell apart. Since then I have tried a variety of cans including Bose, behringer, and JVC. For the price, The sound on these 'phones is AWESOME. Big bass sound, but tight and clean. Nice clear mids, crisp highs. The cups cover your ears and provide as much sound isolation as you'd want (they're not active noise reducing). You also don't get that weird pressure wave that many active sound isolating headphones have. Here's the pro /con breakdown:

PROS:
*GREAT sound! I'd put these up against headphones three times this price. Big bass sound, clean and tight, not boomy. Clear mids and crisp clean highs.
*pretty darn comfortable (I have a big melon) I've been wearing them for 3 hours straight and have no discomfort, no cauliflower ear, no sweaty ears.
*good sound isolation - since they cover your ears, they block out most outside sounds to my satisfaction. you can still hear sounds, but you can't make out details.
*Reasonably priced - I paid about $90
*comes with a 1/8 plug and 1/4 adaptor for those of you who still have old school a/v equipment that still requires 1/4 jacks (I think that's more for plugging into a console since they ARE designated as ""professional"")
*The fold up reasonably compactly, for as big as they are.
*comes with a handy drawstring ""pleather"" carrying case.

CONS:
*Long dangly curly cord (ok, that's not REALLY a con, but I had to come up with something)
*Because of their size and propensity to block outside sounds, I wouldn't recommend these for any kind of outdoor use. These are great for home or work where you aren't moving a lot. I do see people out and about with larger headphones on,(say on the bus or subway) but I wouldn't try jogging with these."
82,4.0 out of 5 stars,"No complaints for the price paid, only loss of one star [for me] is the ear pads are a little small for an over the ear unit. If the diameter was about 1/2"" greater, perfect fit. But, mission neutral sound. They add nothing and seem to take away nothing, very flat so you're getting a neutral output. 10' cord, some people will complain but I like it, and adapter included. Good by the bed back up head set, or used when working with Final Cut or Audition, etc.. A little cumbersome to travel with given the attached/coiled 10' cord.

Yes, there are much better options, but lot's more $$$ also so that would be a personal choice. These play well in their price range, classic performance."
83,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great. Did a side-by-side comparison with my AKG K240's and these are significantly brighter (more treble) but they don't lose any bass. They're comfy, the telephone style cord is not something I'd normally choose, but it's great and less tripping over than the AKG regular long cord. They completely enclose the ear and sit firmly in place. If you're a consumer looking for ""bass that kicks"" these are not for you. If you're doing pro audio work or have a home studio and want to work for extended periods on comfort, I'd say these are great."
84,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to use when I practice my electric guitar. I'm very impressed . I can hear my playing and my mistakes much better with these than when using an amp. Now I wear these all the time when I practice. Very nice packaging and I like that the cord is long . The sound quality, in my opinion, seems almost as good as my Bose $300 quiet comfort 15 noise reducing headphones. I bought these Sony headphones because I could not use my Bose to practice guitar with because the Bose only work with noise cancelling turned on and they tried to cancel each note that I played on my guitar. So I could not use my Bose headphones although I love their sound. I spent hours reviewing different headphones before I bought these Sony and I am very pleased with my purchase. I wear them two hours at a time during practice and they are quite comfortable."
85,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones have excellent sound quality for what would be considered a budget price. They are very comfortable to use for a prolonged period of time like 2-3 hours. They feel sturdy and appear to be well made. I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for budget priced headphones.
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best studio headphones. The range that you can get out of these things is unreal. I play a lot of guitar and like to record songs as well as learn other songs by ear. I have tried Beats and was impressed by the very full sounding bass and the clear highs. Mids lack on the Beats. So, I wasn't too keen on them. I was previously using some cheaper Panasonic on-ear headphones that had a pretty flat and muddy sound. Mastering songs is impossible with those. Learning songs by ear is difficult with those because you can't hear individual sounds as clear. With the Sony MDR7506, every instrument, voice, sound effect in the song is crystal clear. I would take these over beats any day. They do not have noise cancelling functionality; however, if the volume is up enough, that is all you hear! For $80, these are a steal. I would recommend these to musicians and music listeners alike."
88,3.0 out of 5 stars,When using Studio headphones you want the signal to be as pure as possible. I replaced my Sennheiser headphones with these Sony headphones and these have considerably more Bass. The cand are rather small and don't block out outside sound. Rather disappointed with this purchase but unfortunately the box was already thrown away. Wish I would have stuck with the Sennheisers.
89,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these Sony headphones to complement a pair of Sennheiser HD 280's in my home recording studio. I've been using the Sennheisers for nearly seven years.

The first thing I notice is that the Sonys are much more comfortable; they don't squeeze in on my head like the Sennheisers do. The extent to which someone else would notice this difference likely depends on the shape and size of their head, but I suspect the Sonys would be more comfortable for most people.

The sound of the Sonys isn't a world apart from the Sennheisers. Doing an A/B comparison, one right after the other, I can definitely hear a difference, but after listening for a couple of minutes to one pair or the other, I would have a hard time claiming that one sounds ""better"" or ""worse"".

I do notice that the Sonys seem to somehow flatten and reveal more details of the sound. It's easier to pick out specific instruments / voices / effects from a song mix. The Sennheisers seem to gel everything together better. This might make the Sonys less preferable for general music listening, but more preferable for musical analysis.

Other reviews speak critically of the durability of the ear pads. In my one hour of using the headphones, I haven't experienced this, but I don't doubt it's true. I plan to get a higher quality replacement pad whenever these start to disintegrate. (On that note, the pads on my Sennheiser HD 280's are still quite intact after years of usage.)"
90,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones that make music and other media content sound natural, without overpowering effects.

I was looking for an affordable pair of headphones to wear while editing videos and have heard about these pair of headphones from people in the industry. One of the reasons that these are great for video editing is because it doesn’t add unnecessary bass, but instead is very true sounding.

Included in the box is an adapter to use the headphones with a quarter inch output, which is very useful.

Highly recommended!"
91,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really excellent headphones! They're comfortable, they don't press on my head, and with the Beyerdynamic velour earpads, I've worn them for four hour stretched of coding/research without thinking about them for one second. These headphones are so comfortable compared with others I've owned (monoprice, sennheiser) that I sometimes realize that I'm still wearing them at work, even though the music stopped playing 30 minutes ago.

I would (and do) recommend these headphones to all of my friends.

Pros: Excellent sound quality, plenty loud when plugged into the computer (I listen to them at about 1 or 2 ""dots"" on my macbook pro), comfortable headband, plenty of adjustabiity, coiled cord feels really well made and sturdy, really awesome headphones for $80 ($105 if you count the non-stock earpads).
cons: cord is not user-replaceable, cord is long, stock earpads are only OK, they don't get very loud without turning the audio way up on my phone (mostly notice when commuting on public transit, when I'm in the office or at home I keep them below 50% volume on my phone)"
92,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones produce acceptable sound, but they are not comfortable enough for extended wearing. Prior to my purchase, I read a number of reviews from those who said they use the headphones for hours at a time without any problems. I would not want to wear them more than about thirty minutes at a time. They are advertised as ""over-the-ear"" and they do have an area large enough for that, but the padding was not sufficient enough to keep them off my ears. My head may be larger than average (7 3/4 hat size), but these headphones are nowhere near as comfortable as the Avantree Audition Pro 40 Hour Bluetooth headphones I have also purchased from Amazon for about the same price as these Sony phones."
93,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones came in a silk-lined package - I swear I could hear an angelic choir when I opened them. I was shocked and pleased to discover that they included a card with full disassembly instructions and a list of replacement parts. Audio quality isn't perceptibly different from my (also Sony) ear buds, but then I'm not really an audiophile. My main reason for buying them, however, is for recording, and the key feature is the closed back."
94,5.0 out of 5 stars,"But pictures definitely don't do justice to the way these cans sound. Coming from a pair that promises to make your music sound like the artist intended it to, the differences between a bass-heavy, brand-hyped pair of headphones and one that actually delivers their promise became immediately apparent. Amazon service was awesome, just ordered them on the 6th and received them today.

The 7506 definitely pumps out bass. However, that is not strictly what these cans were designed for. No, they won't win any awards for style, nor will they make you run faster or instantly turn you into an audio professional, but they tell the truth. First, they completely cover the ears, so forget about hearing anything else while you have them on. Bass is punchy, mids and highs are easily distinguished from other components. I found the overall sound quite impressive. Compared to other brands, the sound profile of these are relatively flat, in a good way. I'm not saying that there aren't some out there that won't blow these away, but I am impressed. Also, the treble seemed a little crunchy at first. After a couple of days this seems to have evened out.

They put out plenty of sound with low volume settings. The source does not have to be turned up very high to achieve ear-damaging levels, so keep that in mind. With MP3 players, that can translate into longer battery life and fewer blown headphone jacks.

Feeling these in my hand, I noticed that the headband is made of spring steel and all of the mounts seem sturdy, although I have yet to test their durability. They're comfortable, at least from my observations. Wearing glasses also makes a huge difference in the comfort level of headphones. I have no qualms with wearing these for extended periods of time, outside of the slight warm feeling that the surrounds unleash on your ears.

I must admit that I didn't have very high expectations at first. I did a little research before buying these and found out that these are indeed the industry standard for broadcasters, studios, etc.. Still, nothing beats being able to actually put them on and try them before purchasing. If I'd have had that luxury, I would have purchased these over a year ago. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely be recommending them and Amazon to my friends."
95,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pair is a timeless classic It should be in most people's arsenal of headphones because it truly delivers what other contemporary competitors claim to do--and that is to reproduce sound honestly. Instrument separation, soundstage/headstage, bass or treble response... these are all dependent on the recording, not the headphone! As such these Sonys tend to become brutally honest and end up either pleasing or disappointing their owners who are looking for something that may or might not be there.

Hearing it the way it's meant to be is an ad nauseam term that can only be satisfied by one question: What headphones or monitors did the sound or mastering engineer use to produce the final cut of the track? There is no one common headphone that can answer that question, but this particular model shows up in studios more often than not."
96,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can one say--I mean they're Sony. I've never had a bad run-in with a Sony product in my 36 years of life and these seem like they'll hold true to that statement.

At my office, our sound engineer suggested these to me when I was looking for a set of cans for a home studio/beat making lab. I love these for not adding any bass to the music you're listening to...they are clean and EQ'd flat which is what you want, even if you don't know it, in a set of phones. They fit great and are very comfortable. Come with a nice long cable that doesn't get twisted as long as you take care of them and also came with the 1/4"" input adapter. All of that and a decent bag."
97,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've already reviewed this, because I now own two. Very clear, balanced sound. Some refer to this as ""flat"" sound because it reproduces accurately, But do note that ""flat"" means these headphones will not pimp the bass or treble. You can't can't get deep bass from small drivers without inducing artifacts. I do use these both at my piano, and on the road, but it took a couple of hours to get used to the sound for the latter application. Puccini? Perfect. Beyonce? I little of ""where's the bass?"""
99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use them for gaming paired with a blue yeti microphone. Excellent for gaming, would never buy a gaming headset again, sound quality is superb on these. Not extremely bassy tho if that’s your thing, but your situational awareness definitely increases with these on. They have an amazing sound stage for the price."
100,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Backstory:
I picked up a pair of the same headphones about 13 years ago at a music store local to me for about $120. After 13 years of abuse I still use these headphones almost daily and they still sound fantastic. The earpads have since worn down to the point of having to replace them but it doesn't diminish the quality of the sound at all.

Anyway, I've been working a lot at home lately and decided it was time to get a good pair for late nights when I can't use the speakers for fear of waking the wife + baby. So I thought i'd look into getting the same pair of Sony's I bought 13 years ago. And am I ever glad that I did!

The Audio - 5 Stars
These headhpones, simply put, produce some of the richest audio your ears will ever hear. Crystal clear with an impressively wide range for earmuff headphones. These are not overamplified and over-EQ'd like crappy Beats, Bose or similar brand headphones. They have a relatively flat response and do not 'color' audio like Bose do! Since these are 'studio monitor' headphones they are meant to be used in a mixing room environment to mix and produce master tracks for studio recordings. And studio producers demand accurate reproduction of audio when they work their magic. That's what these headphones were designed to do and that's what they deliver - clear, accurate audio from your source. Even at lower volumes you will still get a remarkably rich sound (unlike Beats, where you literally have to crank to get a full range of audio out of them). I've also literally worn these for hours without experiencing aural fatigue like I do with earbuds / other over-the-ear headphones.

Fit / Comfort - 5 Stars
I have a big noggin'. It's often really difficult for me to find any sort of headware / apparel that fits me properly, let alone headphones (they're usually too narrow). These fit like a glove. You quickly adjust the length by pulling down on the ears and that's it - you're in comfort land. They don't pinch / fatique any part of my dome either.

Price - 5 Stars
You can easily pay twice as much for something twice as bad. If you're looking for audiophile quality headphones without breaking the bank then look no further. Forget Beats, forget Bose, forget all of the other crap - the sony MDR7506 headphones are what you want!"
101,4.0 out of 5 stars,"this is more about the Amazon customer service I received than the product I bought itself. After six weeks of using these at a light use level, the sound stopped coming out of one side of the earpiece. I called their customer service-got to a rep within 5 minutes which i think is pretty good (they use a dial back system) who promptly shipped me a new set right there on the phone. I fully expected to have to have a big hassle because it was past the 30 days-or wrap them up, ship them back, wait for them to verify that they had gone bad, wait for the replacement to get here--but none of that happened. The rep told me they did not want them back because they were defective and would I mind putting them in recycling somewhere in my town ?(no problem there !
) even Costco does NOT give this kind of excellent customer service-nowhere near !. minimizing the hassle for the customer who bought something that had a problem ! wow ! unheard of in this time of being treated like the customer is a major inconvenience!"
102,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really, really good and very durable headphones.

Sony makes another version of these, but I prefer these because they are not so chirpy at the high end.

They are built like iron and wear very well. There is also virtually no sound leakage, so you can be in the middle of a quiet room and no one has to hear your music.

In my opinion, over the ear is more comfortable for long periods of time, so if you are commuting I would recommend these.

While they are bulky, they can fold up, reducing the space they take up."
103,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed better headphones for my portable keyboard and had some inexpensive ones that I was using. When I got this set I could not believe the difference in the quality and tones. Covers the high and low range and is rich sounding. I love the chord because it doesn't get in my way. They are light weight and easy to wear. I looked at several headphones and am very pleased with these. I would buy these again. A few weeks later and I just love these headphones. they've totally ruined my for any others because I enjoy them so much. They are just great!
Update.... I bought these in 2016 and it's two years later and I absolutely enjoy these headphones. I have a keyboard and they make it sound fantastic when I need it quite when I play. I am a musician and I am very impressed with these. I play all the time. Highly recommend these to anyone."
104,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First, I think the Sony MDR7506 are really good sounding headphones. Make sure to purchase a hardcase if you plan to do any run and gun video work, or a mobile DJ. They are accurate, comfortable and fold up nice.

But that is not why I purchased two pair. I've found that buying the standard equipment used by most professionals is the easiest and best way to have your audio sound accurate when it will be listened to in various forms, on various formats, and various crew. That's what these headphones are.

Grab a DVD, go to the special features and view the behind the scenes docs. I dont care if it's a low budget film, or the most expensive blockbuster of the summer, ... 8 out of 10 times the headphones you will see the director and sound people wear are these particular headphones.

So you might as well hear it how everyoone else will hear it, and make adjustments that fall in line with the majority of others out there."
105,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a couple of friends refer these to me. One of them a musician and the other a techy geek like me. I'm glad I gave them a shot. I had a pair of Audio-Technicas that had recently failed on me (they were fantastic but I was just probably just not nice enough to them) and I was back in the market for a pair of headphones. My general use for these include: some videography, editing and general musical enjoyment. These have served me well and are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I did eventually make an upgrade and added the Beyerdynamic EDT250V Headphone Ear Pads. Those are a fantastic addition or a great replacement for the stock ear pads.

The construction and feel of these are nice and the included bag to transport/store them in has definitely been beneficial to keeping them in working order. I have used them on all my flights since purchasing and they do well enough for blocking out a large chunk of noise even though they are not noise cancelling.

The coiled cord is very long. All in all, I have been happy with these since 2012. A worthy purchase in my opinion."
106,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Holy crap, these sound great! They are comfortable, they muffle exterior noise by design and also, THEY SOUND GREAT! No they are not wireless or high-tech, they are just really really really good headphones. However, my phone doesn't seem to recognize them, but they plug into my laptop with no issue. I normally use earbuds at work, but nobody can see them. Now I have to share a space with a guy temporarily and he won't have any trouble seeing that I'm wearing my headphones. :) Oh yeah - they sound freaking fantastic."
107,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Some of the best quality headphones for HALF of the price I have ever used. These are my go-to for my podcast. They mute most sound as the wrap covers snugly, but do not mute all sound so as to make it impossible to hear my own voice. The headphones are comfortable and light, and the cable has a lot of stretch to allow for freedom of movement. The sound quality is rich and full. You will probably want to use these seated at a workstation or studio table more than on the go, the cable is long and the plug is extended for use in professional equipment. (The plug conceals a standard audio jack mm plug for use in most machines or phones however.)

Short version: cheap in cost, not in quality. I've paid 400$ for headphones with exactly the same output range and less comfort than these headphones. A total steal."
108,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice, easy to wear, easy to listen too. I looked around for the right headphones to use during video post-production, and article after article mentioned these, so I gave them a try. You can't beat the value for the price! They provide crisp, clear audio across the frequency spectrum. I can hear audio subtleties as well as the highlights. When doing video post production, I want accurate audio, and that's what these provide. I love the coiled cord, which is much easier to deal with than the straight cord I had on my previous headphones. I've been using these for a few weeks now. The ear cushions don't go all the way around my big ears, but I can put them on so they go around the back of the ear and rest lightly on the front, giving the feeling of going all the way around the ear. They fold up on themselves for storage; popping them out of the folded-up position takes some getting used to. They come with a 1/8 inch plug with a 1/4 inch plug adapter that actually screws on so it won't come undone if you happen to yank on it. I understand this particular model of headphone is a decades-old design, which just proves that you don't have to buy the latest and most expensive to get the best."
110,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have nutty noisy neighbors so I was driving myself crazy trying to figure out what to do to be able to enjoy my movies without having my volume turned too high. So I brought these after wasting hundreds of dollars on other items only to have to return them when they didn't work. These things are a lifesaver. They are not only beautiful, but they also are a ten in the performance category. They are the best headphones I have ever owned and I am glad I decided to pay the xtra money and not go with a cheaper pair

Pros- They have a long enough cord so I don't have to sit right on top of the tv.
I can pair them with my led hd tv and also with my laptop dvd player via led tv for playing movies. I watched two movies last night and I didn't hear anything going on around me. It was like being at the movies. .

Cons- As long as the cord is- for me I wouldn't mind it being a tad bit longer. That way I could go into the kitchen and grab a snack without having to pause the movie. lol..

They are good at blocking out sound around you but if you turn up the volume too much its possible for people sitting closeby or sleeping to be able to hear what you are listening to. So be very careful if your intent is not to disturb others who may be sleeping nearby.

Otherwise for that price you absolutely can't go wrong! I just wish I would have found these sooner as they would have saved me a ton of money and headaches! These would also be a great gift for gamers too!!

Update:****** 02/26/15- I still have these headphones and believe it or not they still work great. They have survived months of torture including me falling asleep with them on in bed while watching a movie, sitting on them by mistake or laying on them, extreme heat, and extreme cold. Despite all of that they haven't fallen apart on me yet. For that alone they are worth the price. Plus they have not lost their sound quality. I plan on getting another pair soon but in the meantime enjoying them as I type this. lol"
111,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i don't usually write reviews but these deserve one. I've owned and lost every pair of $500 headphones, Beats, Bowers, B&O and a few Bose QC. I've been skeptical about these Sony headphones sounding as good as those mentioned because they are priced cheaper, but to be honest, they sound even better. Factor in the price and its a no brainer. If and when i leave these on a plane, they will be replaced by the exact same. don't waste your money on the more expensive ones. The only downside is that have a really long cord for walking down the street, but its a thick cord thats built to last, not like the thin ones on the expensive ones that wear away at the jack over time."
112,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After trying to get along with cheap muddy headphones, I finally sprang for these headphones. It's like cleaning a dirty pair of eyeglasses. These phones have a clean crisp sound, with clear high and mid-range sounds that sound great even to my aging ears. And with smooth and strong bass that's not boomy. Another reviewer remarked that you can clearly hear individual instruments - that's true. I've never used real high-end set of headphones, but I can't imagine that their sound would be much different from these. They're reasonably comfortable, but the headband had minimal padding. The coiled cord is long relatively heavy; I'm hoping it lasts better than the thin cords on the cheap sets. Overall, I'd give these phones more than 5 stars if I could."
113,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as extras for my home studio. I have a pair of nice Audi Technicas costing twice as much (M50x) or about the same (M30x), but I really like these headphones! I think the sound is great (why bother with so many purely subjective adjectives). The way they unfold is a little funky and they always seem to flip inside out for me, but so what. Comfort is good. Not as good as my M50x, but way better than the M30x. If you are in the market for the M30x, then I would strongly recommend the Sony's in a heartbeat. Sorry Audio-Technica."
114,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Came a day faster than it said, nice surprise. People were right, the bass is very meh. These are nice quality headphones. I wouldn't get them if you want them for music alone though. My Logitech G230 gaming headset are honestly are better for music than these, these however are great for VA work. Very lightweight and fits well. I've seen some people complaining that they fall off, I have a pretty average head (20F) and no slip here.
All in all they're a nice quality you can feel and hear. Kinda smaller than I thought they'd be.
9/10 If I could do it again I might buy different ones but no buyers remorse here."
115,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are highly recommended, for the price they make an excellent option. I bought them as a pair for the office. When I need to concentrate I want to block all of the office noises of the people around me. There are lots of good earphones out there and the sony mdr7506 IMHO offers just little more making them a very good selection for this price range. The sound is very well balanced and neutral. They are very convenient to wear even for a full day in the office. They isolate outside noises pretty well. The cable is coiled and thus it can reach far but when you plug it near it doesn’t clutter your desk too much. To conclude I have no complaints what so ever from these earphones and I like them very much. If something will happen to them or if I’ll need another pair there is a very good chance I’ll buy them again."
116,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not have a profession in sound or mixing however I can tell the difference between crap headphones and quality. When I was little my father introduced me to Buffalo Springfield, Crosby Stills & Nash, Allman Brothers, Poco and so on...My fondest memories were plugged into his real to real with some high quality Sony headphones. I would just lay there in front of his stereo for hours with music in my head...These Sony MDR7506 headphones take me back to those days. The sound is smooth like butter. You can hear every element of every song, there is depth in each song, subtle instruments and vocals that aren't heard on crap headphones. There is bass but it's neutral and not overpowering. I do not regret this purchase at all. And I recommend anyone looking for very good headphones under 100 bucks this is it. Goodbye weekend - I'm plugged in."
117,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want a set of high quality cans look no further than the industry standard MDR7506. Great price for a great headset, if you are an audiophile or a content producer, generally a main concern is the accurate reproduction of sound, not consumer gimmicks and ""cool kids wear brand X"" nonsense. If you need to find a picture of a certain performer wearing this headset instead of the massively over-hyped brand bearing his name, a simple Internet image search will provide! Don't fall for marketing fluff or gimmicks, get the audio gear that works - and it comes at a great price to boot."
118,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are alright at best , they work well , sound decent but be wary they are SMALL!! I have ears that are actually on the smaller side AN these do not even cover my entire ear , they are ok for monitoring short takes maybe while your in the booth , but forget trynna mix with these , the sound quality jus isn't there an they are so uncomfortable that you cannot use for even an hour straight without your ears starting to hurt , they aren't horrible jus wish I would spent a little more an got something I would be a lot happier with"
119,5.0 out of 5 stars,"20ish years ago, i worked at a major Electronics chain that sold the consumer version of these headphones (MDRV6). Those headphones were revered by many musicians and DJ's for their sound quality. When it came time for me to upgrade from my older MDRV6's, i decided to see what has changed . I found that there has been a new revival for higher quality headphones and there are old and new names making them. I discovered during my research these which were the professional models of the MDRV6. I tested a few others but liked the neutral sound the Sony's produced. After a few weeks, these I am still enjoying them and these are my observations...

Sound Quality: As mentioned in other reviews, these headphones are very accurate, meaning you hear what the engineer heard when either recording the music or producing the finished product. I have listened to other brands and the difference is these have crisp highs without artificial sizzle and deep punchy bass without the sloppy boom.

Build quality: overall these have a nice feel, not too heavy yet solid. Like most items I expect them to wear over time, but so far they are solid.

Overall, if your listening preference is for overstated bass, these are not for you. These headphones are for the listener who wants to distinguish a Gibson from a Fender or hear the breath of the singer on a good recording. I highly recommend these headphones."
121,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone I am a fan of Sony products which is the reason why I purchased this product. I saw numerous positive reviews for the sound quality and build. I needed some headphones for some light video work and I was something that has a large Diaphragm. When I received the headphones, they worked perfectly. The sound quality that was described online was a lie, BUT the headphone sounded good for the price. So I used them sparingly for the following 2 months and I noticed the copper wire on the side of the became exposed. I used some epoxy to try to glue it back in but the constant motion of flipping the headphones continued to expose the wire. It eventually happens on the other side too. Finally, I just used some electrical tape which has done the trick. The coiled wire is so annoying, it reminds me of a grandmas kitchen phone from the late 80s. I say spend some extra money an get another product."
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using sony mdr-7506 headphones in my work as an audio engineer for nearly 15 years, and I have a personal pair that I've owned for 10+ years without any issues despite going on many trips with them.
I find them to be a great balance between quality and cost, and very comfortable when wearing for long periods.

the ear pads will eventually wear out, but replacements are available for not much, and can be easily replaced without any tools.
the carry pouch is very handy for keeping your headphones and cords from getting tangled while not in use."
123,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This set is definitely a good value in the $100 headphone range with a nice sound as noted by many other reviews. I found the comfort factor good and appreciate the light weight on the head as well as the easy on/off.

I compared the sound to my Grado RS-1 set which I've owned for many years but rarely use due to the relatively poor comfort factor after a short usage time. These Grado's are nice to have, though, especially as a reference sound for checking other headphones.

I compared the Sony vs. the Grado with a number of CD-sourced recordings that I consider of good sound, including tracks from Miles Davis, Ry Cooder, a Mahler symphony and Orff's Camina Burana. In all tracks, the Grado's sound seemed slightly more refined, with more perceived presence, instruments more readily separated and identifiable in the mix, a feeling of slightly greater control in the bass, and a more extended high end. No doubt, if you were engaging in close attentive listening you would rather be listening though with Grado's (if you could handle wearing them for any length of time).

Time will tell on the wear-ability for me of the Sony's - as mentioned my initial impression is good. These should make a good, daily use headphone for music listening when I'm engaged in other tasks.

Although the packaging is intended to impress I count it more as falling into the ""excessive materials"" category. They could probably sell this ""professional"" version to the industry in simpler packaging. The included faux-leather carry bag is inferior to the type of nylon bags that Sony supplied years ago."
124,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace a nearly 16 year old pair that I still have. This model is one of my favorite headphones at any price. That said, I don't feel like the new pair I bought has the same overall quality as those I bought over a decade ago. The audio quality is comparable but I'd swear there's a bit higher noise floor on the new ones (I still have the original ones). The general build quality doesn't seem as high as the ones I bought in 2000.

That said: They sound great. They are wicked comfortable to wear. They are a fantastic value for under $100."
125,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had a couple of studio headphones before, most recently the Shure SRH440. I really loved my Shure's (they lasted for about 6 years before having some mechanical failures) and I think the audio had a slight edge over the Sony MDR7506, but the Sony's are much more comfortable around the ear, very soft and cushiony ear cups and head band. I can wear for long stretches at a time without any discomfort. The audio is still really good on the Sony's, crisp, with a wide range and delicate attention to stereo recordings. Plus, they're cheaper, a really good deal for the quality."
126,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony has dropped the ball on quality control. Good 'studio monitor' sound at a price that has not changed much from when I bought my first pair about twenty years ago. How is this possible? By reducing the quality of materials and workmanship. I very much doubt that anyone relying on these for their livelihood would be happy with them. Too fragile, too much low quality plastic - and the wiring.... The first pair I ordered from Amazon had a loose piece of plastic floating free inside the left speaker which could be heard when turning my head. I promptly returned them for exchange - Amazon sent out another pair - same problem (but less so). I needed them urgently and I had my doubts that a third try would be any better so I kept them. I am proud to announce that after one year and one month the left speaker is mute. Average daily use only. I don't even see any apparent damage to wires, plug or casing. Well done Sony - take a field proven, winning product and screw it up. I wish I still had my originals but they were stolen (and probably still giving the thief joyous listening pleasure). There is no comparison to this POS. If you think I am rough with my gear or listen at inappropriate volumes - think again. Maybe, I just got unlucky - maybe not!"
127,5.0 out of 5 stars,"And did these fit the bill. Songs that I already loved have taken on an immense new life. The sound stage on these bad boys is unlike anything offered by your run-of-the-mill headphones. You can hear EVERYTHING. It's amazing the details and the difference in texture that is present in music that you're familiar with and love. It's almost like hearing your favorite songs for the first time. Or, as a better comparison. Guys, think about your wife. Beautiful, no? Remember what she looked like at your wedding? Yeah... it's kinda like that.

The only thing I could say against them is that you HAVE to have a headphone amplifier. I have tested these on the headphone output of my laptop, a Vox Headphone amp that I use on my bass, and on my M-Audio AV40s with mixed results. But, when they are connected to my Asus Xonar Essence sound card, which has a headphone amp built in to it... wow. That's literally all the more that can be said. Wow. See, with the other devices, they still sounded good, just weak. With a good quality headphone amp though, opens up more than you can believe.

They can sound a little shrill at first, but that's actually normal. See, lower-end headphones are designed to sound good enough. Not great, just good enough. Part of this is giving them drivers with scooped frequency response. These particular headphones do no such thing. What you will hear with these is the music as it was written, and recorded. All the highs, all the lows, and certainly everything in between. You will hear everything, and you will not regret it once you get used to the broader, fuller frequency response.

Oh, and the sound isolation is phenomenal, nearly to the point of noise cancelling. And they're very comfy.

GET THEM. They're worth every penny."
128,5.0 out of 5 stars,"$80 for these headphones is unbelievable. Uniquely great headphones for the price. You know how some companies just make a product that is so perfect everything else can't quite get there and many just stop trying? Sony did that here. Here is a pair of headphones that are so great for the money, everything else in this space falls short. I have other pairs of headphones - I love my Bose headphones for the airplane, but they were $300. I can't really tell the difference in sound quality. I've tried some Sennheisers, I must not have divine hearing because I can't tell the difference. I have a pair of AKGs which are really great but open-backed which was disturbing my co-workers. These Sony's are super light weight, closed-back so no one is disturbed by my music, I listen to it pretty loud, and they fold up nicely to fit in my bag with my laptop when it's quitting time.

EIGHTY BUCKS!!!"
129,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are widely regarded as some of the best headphones you can buy under 100, maybe even 200. I found them to be a little flat and harsh in the mid range for my preference. I also found the cable to be a bit ungainly if you're using this on the go or moving from room to room (like in an offfice). Overall comfort was surprisingly good for my big noggin."
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OOOOOOOOOOoooo these headphones. I just love wearing these. Very comfortable. Snug fitting and fantastic sound quality. I have this running to a guitar amp and enjoy it so much that I have nearly stopped listening to my amp without them. The sound is just so much more immersive and I find myself really getting lost in the notes. Would absolutely buy these again.

However... These do fold in upon themselves and the hinges they are on combined with the overall clamping power of the headsets do get frustrating when you constantly have to unfold them every time u pick them up. It's not so much that they are delicate it's more that they feel delicate to my huge hands."
132,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound but could be more comfortable. Let me first start by saying that when it comes to headphones, the price not always correlates with sound quality. I tested this headphone in a Sony testing room at CES 2018. They were side by side Sony MDR-Z1R, which is ~$1.7K. Honestly, I liked the sound of MDR7506 over MDR-Z1R. The sound is very crisp, natural, well balanced for all frequencies, with good separation. If you like to listen to Jazz or any acoustic music MDR7506 is a great choice for you. After CES, I purchased this headphone and compared them side by side with my other headphones. Here is how I would rank them:
Sound quality:
1. Pioneer SE-MS7BT-T (9.6 out of 10)
2. Sony MDR7506 (9.5 out of 10; both Sony and Pioneer sound great but I think I slightly prefer pioneer)
3. Bowers & Wilkins P7 (8.5 out of 10)
4. Sennheiser HD598C (8 out of 10)
Comfort:
1. Pioneer SE-MS7BT-T (10 out of 10)
2. Sennheiser HD598C (9 out of 10)
3. Bowers & Wilkins P7 (7 out of 10)
4. Sony MDR7506 (5 out of 10)
Design:
1. Bowers & Wilkins P7
2. Pioneer SE-MS7BT-T
3. Sennheiser HD598C
4. Sony MDR7506

So far Pioneer SE-MS7 and Sony MDR7506 are one of the best sounding headphones I tried, even if you compare them to significantly more expensive MDR-Z1R, B&W P7, or Sennheiser HD660."
133,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, these have to most beautiful sound period. The reason I bought these was because I was tired of getting ripped off my cheap gaming headsets with fake 7.1 sound and non existent bass. The initial looks of these kind of felt cheap at first, but once I put them on my head and folded them after, they felt pretty sturdy. I know, I do not work at a studio, but I do love sound and I heard these sounded amazing so I had to buy them. these get a pretty great range of highs and lows. the bass is great and not to intense or fake. These are perfect for people who just love sound and love to listen to music or test their new sound card out. I apologize to the real studio workers because I cannot say that they are the best for making music or sounds, but I can say that they sound great for the everyday average joe or gamer. The comfort is just unexplainable, I don't even know if they are on half the time, because they feel like nothing. lastly the chord is basically tangle free since it looks like an old twisted phone chord, which is perfect also because it is always the right length every time. Just be careful with these because I still don't trust the build quality. I know what I said initially, but in my past experiences with other headphones from Sony, they usually break, fingers crossed and be really careful with these just in case."
134,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These MDR7506's replaced a revered, ancient pair of JVC headphones that finally disintegrated. So far, these Sony's are great 'phones that (1) have replaceable ear cushions that fit the big ears on my oversized head, (2) can be worn (by me) for over 3 hours so far without getting too warm, and (3) give a ""clean, unmuffled sound (want more bass? - turn it up on your source). The coiled extension, unlike a long wire, doesn't tangle as such but is sort of a handful when taking 'phones somewhere - too bad it isn't separate. I hesitate to stretch the coil to its limit, which might put strain on wire-to-'phone connection. I tried these 'phones plugged into an additional 5 meter long Sennheiser HZR62 headphone extension cable with little if any noticeable sound degradation. All in all, I'm very happy with these 'phones that give me much greater listening enjoyment of TV and CD music. I would order them again and can recommend them."
135,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Because my husband was a professional musician/entertainer for nearly 40 years, quality earphones with accurate frequency response while enjoying music and movies is important. Also important is finding quality earphones that fit our budget; a recently purchased pair of $275 dollar earphones at a nearby video/audio store failed the test on both accounts. Enter in these Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm (Studio Monitor) Headphones. They are not only fantastic in every way, but cost just under $80!

What is so great about these earphones? They are super comfortable, even during endless hours of use. The coil cord is great, and helps to keep the 9.8 foot cord untangled and out of the way. You could spend 10X the amount for barely discernible difference in sound quality. The earphones come with a 1/4"" adapter, which makes it compatible for nearly any audio device.

Would we order these earphones again? You betcha! In fact, since getting my husband the first pair in December of 2015 (for use with his home recording studio), we have purchased 2 more pairs. One for me (to replace the afore mentioned $275 earphones that don't even come close!), and the other pair (still in their packaging) to have on hand, should anything happen to one of the pairs in use.

NOTE: for someone wanting a deep/amplified bass experience, these earphones are NOT for them. These earphones are true to sound ... un-enhanced, and crystal clear.

PERSONAL MESSAGE
I paid full price for these headphones; I DID NOT get them for free or at a discounted price. Why did I take the time to write a detailed review? Because like you, I depend upon the comments and experiences of other consumers when making an Amazon purchasing decision.

Please note that when I do provide a review in exchange for a free or discounted product, I don’t feel obliged to write a positive one, just an honest and fair one; when reviewing products upon request I do not always rate a product 5 stars, or even 4 stars. If in doubt as to my credibility as an unbiased reviewer (whether I pay full price for a product or not), visit my public profile page and read the personal message in my bio."
136,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was stunned how these headphones revealed quality and depth in music I thought I had been listening to for years. I felt pretty stupid for cheating myself out of the pleasures of good music all this time. They also feel comfortable to me after a few hours and I'm a tall person with a fairly large noggin. The fancy packaging makes me feel like I bought $500 headphones and gave me that quick passing feeling of being a wealthy person.

I would say in particular my electronic, ambient, classical and choral music benefited the most. That's where I felt the ceiling and floors dropped out to reveal new dimensions. Older stuff like 60s rock certainly sounded better than before but I could also detect more flaws. If your MP3 collection is 128 bit rate prepare to be upset how bad they sound in good headphones.

It goes without saying that if you're going to spend $80 on good headphones for computer use, your computer should have a good sound card. Onboard sound cards typically have noise interference. I'm using an old SoundBlaster Live! 24-Bit External USB and cannot hear any noise or hiss whatsoever when these headphones are plugged in."
137,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These really are nice headphones, especially for the price, both in outside noise reduction and sound quality.

The frequency response is fairly flat, so if you enjoy overly loud thumping bass rap music you might find yourself reaching for the 'Bass' EQ knob on whatever device you're using. I find it really full yet smooth. No thumping.

So far I've used them for my Yamaha MoX8 keyboard, Yamaha digital drum set, and even watching Netflix movies. All sound great through them. I was surprised at all the 'extra' background sounds I was hearing in movies that I don't notice using my home theater sound system; grass crunching as someone is walking outside, crickets, birds, etc all around.

Comes with a gold plated adaptor as pictured, so it fits smartphone/tablet headphone plugs, as well as older home stereo amps, etc."
138,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are absolutely amazing. They deliver a wonderful clear sound. I purchased them mainly for listening to podcasts, streaming music, and watching streaming video. They are 10/10 for non music audio and 9/10 for music audio.

The headphones are beloved by live audio professionals and for good reason. You aren't going to get better sound live audio, talk, and streaming TV/movies unless you are willing to spend hundreds more dollars. If you go into a live studio TV, radio, or internet you will likely find the MDR7506 on a lot of heads.

For music it depends on what you're listening to. If hip hop with a ton of bass is your main interest these probably won't be at the top of your list. Likewise with classical music. The lower end just isn't represented strongly with these headphones. You can boost the low end and it works fine. Plugged directly into a phone or tablet it's fairly weak.

I paired mine with an Fiio E11k portable headphone amp. It can push them to a very high volume cleanly and has a decent bass boost. On a PC or stereo with an equalizer they are lacking nothing.

If you need great headphones these are a great choice. Even if they were double the price they would still hold their own."
139,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a REALLY hard time with headphones because I have a small head and am VERY prone to migraines so they are always either too big or too tight. These are snug enough to block out a good amount of sound but not so tight that it gives me a headache within the first 10 minutes of wearing them like most others do. For the price, I am SO, SO impressed with the sound quality!!! The cushions on the ear pieces are extremely comfortable as well. They are much lighter in weight than I expected and they fold up compactly which is nice considering I travel quite a bit.

I edit podcasts for a living and these are perfect for that."
140,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these Sony MDR-7506 headphones a couple of months ago. More recently, I've also purchased Sony's very similar (but not identical - see below) Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones. My reason for purchasing a second pair (and getting both models) was because the V6's were very inexpensive at the time I ordered ($30 cheaper than the 7506's), and because I was curious to see if I could tell a difference between the two. In reading many of the reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, I knew that the two are constructed very similarly but there were different opinions regarding both the differences (if any) and which has the superior sound.

These are both headphones in the $100 and below price category, which seems like a reasonable price to pay for high quality sound. I do not like to listen to music using earbuds, I prefer this style of ""over-the-ear"" headphone. although it does take some getting used to. I also have very inexpensive Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones for occasions when I don't want to use my more expensive Sony's.

I am very satisfied with the sound quality from these headphones (both models), and with the comfort. They are the first ""quality"" headphones that I have owned, and the level of detail in the sound, lack of distortion, and overall quality is simply superb. I am completely satisfied.

Now, regarding both similarities and differences between the Sony MDR-7506 and Sony MDR-V6, here is what I have found:

- externally, they are almost identical in construction and appearance. The V6 has red stickers on each headphone ""for Digital"", and the 7506 has blue stickers ""Professional"". The phono jack for the V6 is silver metal (all metal), for the 7506 is gold (rubber and gold). Those are the only visible differences I am able to detect.
- when I listen to the two headphones back to back, at the same volume level and with the same music, I can detect a slightly clearer treble and midrange from the 7506, and very slightly clearer sound. This is consistent with several of the other reviewers on Amazon for the 7506, who say they can detect a slightly better sound separation and more open sound for the 7506, with the V6's sounding a bit warmer. One reviewer also says that the internal grounding for the two headphones is different - the 7506 uses a separate internal ground for the left and right channels, where the V6 uses a single ground for both channels. (It seems to me that both grounds are going to the same place anyway, but if this is true - and I am not able to confirm whether or not it is - then maybe this contributes to a slightly different sound).
- some reviewers state that the internal speaker drivers are different for the two headphones. However when I went to Sony's website to check the specifications for the two models, that is not what I found. And here is what the Wikipedia page states for these headphones: ""both models share the same part number for their driver, but the magnet therein is known to vary. The MDR-7506 was introduced with a samarium-cobalt magnet, as is currently used in the MDR-V6. However, at some point, the MDR-7506 switched to the slightly more powerful neodymium magnet. These changes were made without changing the driver part number.""
- The box for the 7506 states ""neodimium magnet"". The operating instructions included with the V6 state ""samarium cobalt magnet"". Possibly either or both of these are out of date (as Wiki states, they may make spec changes over time) - the 7506 box is copyright 1994, and the V6 copyright is 1996.
- The 7506 box includes an exploded view and parts list, which is very nice to have. The V6 box does not.
- Both headphones include a soft case for storing/carrying the headphones, and both include an adaptor plug so that the headphone can be used with either a stereo mini-plug or a normal size plug.

UPDATE 7/22/13 and 7/30/13: The Sony MDR-V6 and MDR-7506 headphones have just recently been reviewed by CNET, with similar comments to my own regarding the small differences in sound quality. Both headphones receive a very high recommendation from CNET. See the MDR-7506 review at [...] and the MDR-V6 review at [...]

According to the specifications on Sony's website (which should be up-to-date), the only difference between the two headphones is frequency response:

- MDR-7506:
- Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 10-20kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity

- MDR-V6:
- Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 5-30kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity

I am not able to explain how Sony is claiming different frequency response for the two headphones if all of the other specs are identical, but this is what they are saying. And I do believe that the two headphones have slightly different sound.

Although there is a slight difference between the 7506 and V6, the sound from both headphones is very neutral. The ""professional"" choice between the two seems to be the 7506, and it is the more expensive model. If you read other reviews you will find that the 7506's are commonly used by studio engineers, because they are designed to reproduce the sound just as it is, without adding emphasis to the bass as some other headphones are designed to do. At this point, for me they are both excellent, and for thirty bucks less I'd go with the V6 if I could have only one of the two.

I've been using these headphones with the Audioengine D1 24-bit digital-to-audio converter, and I am extremely pleased with the quality of the sound.

As a final comment, some owners of these headphones comment that the ear pads wear out over time, and some owners also prefer different ear pads for better comfort. I also purchased a pair of Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions for this reason, and although I have not yet given them a try to compare them with the ear pads that come with the Sony headphones, I do like the fact that it is possible to fit different ear pads if desired in order to provide more comfort, as well as replace them when they have become worn (some owners use these headphones for many years).

I notice that there are a very large number of reviewers for these headphones, many of them long-time owners who feel very strongly that these Sony headphones are the best. I'm just beginning to use them, but I have high hopes that they will be durable over time and that I will continue to be as satisfied with them as I am today."
141,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ended up returning the first pair and now the second because I was getting EMI type buzz when the set was idle plugged into my laptop, Nintendo switch, and the speaker system on my desktop (Soundblaster x-fi); these headphones have a screw on for its 3.5 to 6.3 adapter and I believe this is the core design flaw... this section is a quarter inch of plated metal that is exposed and picks up too much electrical interference.

Additionally I ran both sets of headphones through several tests and there's multiple frequencies where this product just fails... Where it failed:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081SO0RM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7
The pictures are incorrect; the earpads in the link are actually fuzzy and soft, and a lot easier to wear for long periods of time.
Back to the headphones; the only other things are that the cord is a little long, the bass is a little lower than usual, and that colorful tag thing on either side of the headphones actually consists of a colorful sticker covered with another clear sticker, that peels up over time and is a little annoying to have on your $80 headphones. I'm still giving this five stars, though, because it's well built (other than the sticker), and it sounds better than any other set of speakers that I have listened to. In most cases, the sound quality is going to be bottlenecked by the audio source rather than these headphones."
144,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this pair of headphones 2 days ago, they came in a very nice packing from sony, I have to say this first, im a BOSE fan and have in ear and on ear hedphones,, also i have to say that i use headphones to be used with my iphone and laptop only, i tried them with my iphone and was expexting a little more out of them according the reviews i red before, at least a little more of bass, i do not know, may be i have a lemon here, my iphone has to be at max volume in order to hear the bass some decent, like i said they may do better when plugged in from a better sourse.

now the good things for buyers to know, i just plugged in from my laptop and i have to say they sound much better,
things i like:

Long and soft cord, since im a cord destroyer this is just what i needed
treble, man, they sound crystal clear, and can hear any detail on music sorry bose, you cant beat this babies
confortable, last might i slept for about 5 hours woked up took em off, and no pain at all
nice design, very flat and they seem to last for ever, however i put insurance from squaretrade for 3 years 7 dlls w discount
they stay on your head, even when laying down, so runners this is what you need,
they work nice with my keyboard, i thought i was in the concert then realized it was me playing lol,
they come with one year warranty, for those who said 3 months.

I had to come back and give one more star to this headphones, since they work twise better by adding an amplifier to them specially if you are using them with iphone or even computer,, wow its all i can say,,oh, i got fiio E6 for 26 dlls here ar amazon, and what i great devise as well

Bose's (on ear) gime me more bass but they dont sound as clear as this ones, so 4 stars because of the bass, perhaps i come back later and do the 5 stars when i try them from stronger source. i stared falling in love with them,, metallica is on(nothing else matters) wow.

sure i will keep bose in the closet for a litle awhile and test this ones longer, i will be back i can feel it

sorry about my english folks"
145,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pro's: Amazing sound quality, great old-fashioned design ensures it was built to last. I read somewhere that ""they don't make headphones like this anymore,"" and now I believe it. Pretty comfortable as well.

Con's: My ears might be a bit too big, but it bothers me (only slightly) that my ears press up against the inner part of the headphone. Maybe it's supposed to be that way? I'm not sure. I don't believe I've tried to listen to a .flac file with these, but they seem to lack a bit of bass. Also, a non-detachable cable is a huuuuge downside for me; my cord's always go out after a year of use, so it's almost a must for any of my headphone purchases to include a replaceable cord. Only way around that is to be extremely handy with a sauteing iron. It is possible to mod it to have a removable cord, but be very careful not to ruin such a great investment.

Even if it's bass is a bit low, it has quite possibly the best sound in every other regard, highly confortable, and if your careful, can mod it to be one of the best pair of headphones you could own for the money."
146,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best cans I've owned, and certainly the best I've heard in their price range.

I sat on the decision to buy headphones for a few months, did research, looked at reviews and sought store models to try. Open-backed Sennheisers at twice the price were certainly nice to experience, with excellent smoothness and clarity. But the cost of entry plus the need for additional hardware was what I found to be prohibitive. I decided after a while to simplify my search by looking for headphones that wouldn't need a headphone amp to drive them.

Audio Technica M-50s were a bit boomy and muddy compared to these. The MDR-7506s were the most comfortable. They had flatter response with pristine low-end, clear mids and sparkly, smooth highs. Put simply, they made my ears tingle in ways the others couldn't (unless I paid double or more). I whole-heartedly recommend these and will probably buy an extra pair."
147,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an audiophile, but let me just say that after buying these headphones a couple of months ago I have been listening to my music collection as if for the first time. There is a physical quality to the sound that comes through, similar to listening to music through a good set of speakers, rather than just headphones. I get the sense that I am hearing the music, or the audio of a movie, TV show, etc., exactly as the talented sound engineers want me to, and I am grateful for it.

Compared to my Etymotic MC2 in ear headset, that I've owned for 3 years they do a reasonable, but not great, job of blocking ambient noise. In a way this is a bonus as my family can get my attention much easier if they need me. When I try the MDR7506 out on an airplane for the first time, I'll bring the Etymotic MC2 as a backup. But in a household noise environment the MDR7506 blocks enough noise and I am able to enjoy digital entertainment in a way that I never have before."
148,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound: classical, rock, techno,... all sound as it should.
Enough external noise isolation. In fact I was dazed when I used them for chat, since my voice was muted a lot.
Light weight. Although since they are closed, it may become uncomfortable after a two or three hours. Nothing that can't be fixed by swiping the sweat from the ears, and scratch them a bit.
The relation quality/price is exceed by far.
Totally satisfied."
149,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say right away that across all over-the-ear headphones I have ever owned, across Koss, Sennheiser, etc, THESE were the ONLY pair that didn't vice my head and make me want to take them off after 10 minutes. These are also the only headphones I can see using on a daily basis, which is amazing news considering the amazing sound I get from these. These are amazingly well balanced and don't do anything to drown out sections of the output. As someone who produces music, I could already tell some things wrong with my previous mixes that would've been improved after re-listening to them through these. Just for that, this deserves 5 stars, but there's much more to mention that simply make me want to give this more than the maximum 5 stars.
Here's how I would sum it up:
1 - the padding is comfortable around the ears, albeit they get warm like other headphones, they never get to the point of being uncomfortable.
2 - wonderfully balanced sound (the best out of all headphones I've ever tried)
3 - does it's best to firmly place itself on your head without making it feel like it's viced
4 - surprisingly good at suppressing outside noise and containing your sound
5 - just an overall great pair of headphones"
150,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for about a week now and these are just the best headphones I've ever used, hands down.

Have I used a lot? No.

I've used a couple of different pairs of Sony's (MDR-V150 for probably the past... 8 years?) another pair I can't remember the model number of, the ubiquitous iOS ""white"" earbuds, and some Sony behind the head headphones. I've used all of them for the same tasks... maybe with the exception of the V150s... and that is editing/listening to music/working out/and listening to audio interviews.

Clearly, the earbuds were the most uncomfortable, a 3 on a 1-10 scale with 10 as the best. The behind the head, headphones are OK, but after awhile, they hurt too. The sound isn't incredibly accurate out of those either, but they have a nice shorter cord and fit in my gear bag excellently probably a 7 out of ten for overall use, comfort and dependability. The V150s are somewhat comfortable, like a 6? or 7? out of 10, but they've got a super long straight cord that makes working out in them totally dangerous and I never used them for that. For other uses they're... OK.

THESE, the 7506s answer the need for great 'cans' for editing, great for field monitoring and even just for kicking back and relaxing listening to music!

I'm considering getting another pair or two to keep stashed away in case they ever break. These have replaced my behind the head, headphones for field monitoring (and another sony pair that I borrowed from someone similar in style to this but nowhere near as nice. Not sure on model nomenclature.)

They've replaced anything else for editing other than speakers when I'm at home in my office.

Buy these 'cans'! Do it! Do it now!"
151,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have no issues with the sound quality on these headphones; it handles both high and mid range sounds quite well. Bass is rich and the the cables don't get in the way (DJ's will probably appreciate this the most).

That aside, based on the build quality, it's not something that i think will last more than about a year of occasional use and about half that time if it's for daily use.

The material on the ear pads peels off very easily leaving residue on your ears and; the ear pads come off the speakers pretty frequently.
EDIT 1/5/2016
Forget when I originally purchased these headphones but I have had to replace the foam pads twice now. Other than that, it has taken some serious beatings but it still works well. At $10 to $20 per replacement ear pads, might not really be a worthy investment.

A workaround would be to buy custom ear cups to go with it but for the extra bucks, you might as well invest in a slightly more expensive product.

152,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been into audio for a while and was looking for something new.
I purchased the AKG Y50's because they had great reviews and were new.
They are terrible and the next headphones I found were these.
Everyone was right with the MDR7506's. They are absolutely incredible.

Pros:
Very accurate
No ear fatigue (I can listen to these for 8 hours and still be fine)
(Also the pressure of the fit is very good. Not too tight)
Long cord

Cons:
Many times, I wish the cord was shorter, but I still like the length
(Not portable)
They are kind of ugly (Top of the headband says ""STUDIO MONITOR"")
(I think thats cool but most people dont know what that means)"
154,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a video editor, and we've been using Sony's MDRs in the office for decades. I bought my own pair and decided to go cheap with these. While they're comfortable enough for an 8hr shift, my ears sweat enough to make it annoying and I have to pause to wipe it away. This is only a problem when the office temp is 73*F +. Usually the office is at 70*F, but can get hotter when people constantly come and go through the hallway door. When it's that cool, my ears don't sweat and these headphones are A+++.
I still <3 the headphones, but wish I hadn't cut costs. Maybe I'll buy a more ventilated pair and use these for customers who pop in to check out their videos (and won't have them on long enough to sweat)."
155,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, extremely sturdy, and excellent sound. I am not a studio professional, I'm a graphic artist. I use these all the time while doing work, it pretty much cuts off the outside world, and I love that. the sound gets loud, stays clear, and has worked great on pretty much every genre of music in my eclectic playlists. the bass especially delivers for headphones. This is the first pair of headphones I've bought that I can't have at max volume all the time because they're that powerful.

My only complaint: the chord. it's meant for you to be wheeling around a booth, or between camera and whatever, without getting unplugged, so the cable is super long. but it's also coiled, so it doesn't bundle neatly, it's heavy, and highly prone to twisting and tangling and catching on things. if they made a standard consumer version of this, that's all I'd change, a shorter straight cable (even the industrial aesthetics are good to me). but since they're monitor headphones I knew what I was getting into.

if you can deal with the wire, these are the best headphones you'll get for under $400 (avoid the ones with bright plastic, they're usually a sham).

they WILL survive extended travel/transport (the folding is nice), they WILL offer the best sound you can find for the money, they CAN play whatever you throw at them."
156,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these headphones plugged into my desktop computer at work or to my phone to listen to music or podcasts. I wanted my headphones to dampen ambient sounds, be comfortable enough to wear for a couple hours at a time, and play sounds.

I have missed calls while sitting at my desk because I had these headphones on listening to music at a normal volume and didn't hear my phone ring. I am happy with the sound dampening.
They are pretty comfy. I can happily wear them for a couple hours.
They play sounds. I've never had great headphones before and it is terrific to hear better bass and better sound overall than I'm used to listening to.

I didn't realize the cord on these was 10 feet long. This is very long. If I'm walking around with these plugged into my phone I have to gather the cord up and stuff it into a pocket. I would love if I could get these with a much shorter cord. The coiled format is great for a 10 foot cord, though. It's reasonably manageable and the coating on it is a bit rubberized, not shiny plastic. It's nice."
157,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very comfortable and have a pleasant, balanced sound. You will hear every little detail in a recording with these. This is great if you use them for editing purposes. If you listen to compressed audio (streaming/youtube/mp3s, etc), you will hear the imperfections in there. If you listen to high-quality files, though, you're in for a treat. Very detailed sound in all frequencies. It all sounds very balanced. All the highs and mids are there without being harsh. All the bass is effortlessly there without being boomy or overbearing. They have that ""monitor"" quality to them. You'll hear the recording the way the producer intended it to sound.

These are easily the best-sounding headphones I've ever owned so far. They provide a very pleasant listening experience no matter what I throw at them. ""Balanced"" is the best way I can describe the sound. Unlike most other headphones, these don't make my ears tired.

Highly recommended."
158,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've now had these headphones for about 7 months. I wanted to wait and see how they would hold up over time. So far they've been perfect. I was considering the Grado SR-60 as I heard they had the best sound under $100, however there were quite a few things that made this pair more appealing.
1. The Grado's are open backed, which may allow for superior sound, but apparently also makes your music slightly hearable to those nearby. I bought these for blocking out outside noise in computer labs and the library so I think this pair is a more practical choice as they have very little noise bleed.
2. The collabsible factor is a little iffy but makes these headphones a very pragmatic choice as a they can easily collaspse and be stowed away for transport. This feature also brings up my one (minor) complaint with these headphones. The mechanism to collaspse them feels a little flimsy. Again, this is a very minor issue, but it sometimes feels as though the hinge should be bulkier for the amount of pressure that's exerted on it. It should be known that this has yet to give me a problem and I did not hear it being an issue with anyone else when I looked at other reviews for these.

One more very slight complaint is that the material on the earpads can get a little sticky after listening for a while as it doesn't breathe very well. A popular option that I tried is to upgrade the pads to the Byerdynamic velour pads. With these new pads the headphones are amazing for long listening and extremely comfortable.

On the whole these are a great deal at this price and are a very solid pair of headphones. I would give them my full recommendation."
159,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect, I can hear every details, mid and high ranges are very clear, low range is very solid. The bass feels naturally strong and not over powered.
The sound is not very good with cell phone, but sound is brilliant with laptop or computer 3.5mm jacket.
Only small amount of volume with laptop, same as my earbud volume setting, but this one makes very loud and clear sound, and I can get feeling in a real stage.
It's very comfortable since all ears are covered. Sound leakage is almost none."
160,5.0 out of 5 stars,"""I may not be an audiophile, but I can definitely recognize a great sound when I hear it. This Sony mdr-7506 has a great, outstanding sound. As you may know, this Sony has 1,562 reviews, of which, 1,220 are 5 Stars reviews. Well, you can add to that my 5 Stars and make it 1,221. Amazing! I started these headphones with a burn-in process. When I started listening to my music, on my Ipod, the sound was good. But when I connected my amplifier to the Ipod, the sound really came alive. I think they have the most pure, strong, and natural sound I ever heard. Listening to my favorite songs, they got my full attention. The only think anybody can say they lack is a little boost on the bass side. Again, my amplifier provided just that. The highs sound great; the treble, no piercing sound there, just perfect. The singers voices were clear and present. I will definitely, without a doubt, recommend this Sony to anyone---on this planet. You will always enjoy your music. Happy listening."""
161,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these AWESOME headphones since NOV2013. I use them for my broadcast and they are still working fine after 5 months of heavy use. They're still sounding great, and showing no wear at all. They're prefect in every way and quality. Please trust me when ( "" I "" ) tell you it's worth buying.... they are worth it. Sound is crisp, clear, and they are just what they claim: ""Studio Work.""

If you're looking for headbanger boom-box overkill bass these aint it. These are (Professional) and only used for Commercial radio by stations like WLW-700 and Station like WSM-650, not to mention many recording studios use this exact model. I've researched them in depth long before I purchased them here, did my home work and proud to say they are worth every penny. Again remember these are for Commercial DJ work NOT for listing to music as one would do after a hard days work. These are designed to assist one in professional editing and sound recording for broadcasting. (There really is a huge difference if you know anything at all about sound mixing and studio broadcast work)."
162,5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is the best cans you can have under $100, period!! I have several cans vary from Bose, AT, Phillips, AKG, and Koss, yet this is one of the best sounds from my collections. No artificial bass or re-engineered sounds, just flat but you can appreciate what a headphone should be. The weakest point could be the cans is not comfortable for longer usage. I limit less than an hour and taking a break for awhile."
163,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I already own the ""on the ear"" Grado SR60 and the wireless Sennheiser RS170. Both are excellent. These were my points of reference for comparing my new purchase.

I was looking for an ""over the ear"" set to listen to short wave AS WELL AS portable MP3's and Pandora without disturbing those around me.

Initially thinking that extremely faithful reproduction was not that important for my primary use, I looked at the less than $50 cans. I learned this was a mistake. Among the best rated among the less expensive units was the Monoprice, which is what I ordered. After testing and comparing it with my other phones, I determined they were unacceptable. They lacked ""air"" and sounded like there was excessive harmonic distortion, possibly from reverberation inside the fairly large cans. Choral lyrics were distorted, not from cone breakup, but from internal resonance, I suspect. Those were returned and I upped the ante and ordered this Sony.

The Sony sound is dryer, not as much low-mid, but cleaner mids and highs. These phones will rival the two really nice ones I already own, but with a different purpose.

The form factor is also better: lighter, less bulky, and more comfortable than the Monoprice, feeling very much like my Senns but with a wire."
165,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! I can't get over how good these headphones sound, look and fit. I am usually very critical of audio gear as I can really appreciate great sounding equipment. In the audio world usually you get what you pay for with exception of some ridiculous overpriced brands. So it's rare that I come across something that is truly a bargain and that's what these 7506's are. For $80 I don't think there is anything that can beat them. The sound is like butter, smooth and accurate and very detailed. Are there better sounding headphones? Sure but your going to have to spend $300-$500 to do it, yeah their that good. Bonus for me is their not corny looking like beats audio or some of the new sets out there. I've been wearing them for several hours now with no fatigue issues as the fit is really good and I have a really big head.

I've known about this model for years as I've seen many professionals using them in radio and in studios and just assumed they were company issued. Now I understand why I see them used so much they are truly a great value.

Stop reading and just buy them you will not be disappointed."
166,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great sounding cans. Very accurate, flat sounding, closed-back headphones. These are my daily, high-mileage headphones when I'm at work where there's a lot of ambient noise. The padding is comfortable enough to go hours at a time without hurting your head or ears. I also have a two pairs of Senns (Momentums for my phone, and HD650s in my quiet mancave) both of which cost at least twice as much. These Sonys can rival either pair as far as SQ goes, especially using a decent DAC like a Dragonfly. And they're quite durable meaning you can just throw them into a bookbag and not worry about breaking them. The sound-quality per dollar spent simply can't be beat."

168,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using a cheap $17 pair of Sennheisers on my computer for years and they finally broke. I decided to splurge and try some better headphones. I'm not particularly picky about sound quality, but I will say I did notice a huge improvement in sound. The question is whether I had a problem with the sound coming from the $17 pair and I honestly have to say ""No"" That said, here are two issues with these headphones that I do have a problem with. The coiled cord is really hard to work with if you're just going to remain stationary sitting down. The cord is heavy and gets tangled so I had to wrap it around something on my desk to reduce the length. Also, after wearing it a few hours it sometimes hurts my ears and I have to readjust."
169,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this home and plugged it into my Yamaha MOXF keyboard, IPAD, and IPHONE--WOW. I own some audiophile quality stereo gear and did so I am very selective. After reading tons of favorable reviews, I purchase these headphones with some reservation in that they were so affordable yet so highly rated. They blew away my Sennheiser 380 HD Pro's which cost more than twice as much. They are so good, I brought another pair for my office. The best review I found was at thewirecutter.com site:

http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-150-over-ear-headphones/"
170,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been using these for the past year and a half. I have a set at work and at home. I recommend these headphones to anyone who's looking for a huge step up in audio quality with a reasonable price tag.

They might feel a bit light and flimsy at first compared to other monitors, but you'll find that they're actually very sturdy. My pair at work has been in use for years and years and the only thing that I needed to replace was the earpads (which can be found on Amazon for ~$11). Their light weight is actually really fantastic because you can wear them all day comfortably.

The cable is great too. There's a rubber sheath where the wire joins the connector housing, which allows it to take considerably more abuse than the standard headphone cable. This is important because the cable itself can stretch up to 10 ft, and when it's compressed it can be a bit heavy. The connector itself is gold-plated with metal housing.

Keep in mind, Sony first introduced this model in 1991. 25 years later, it's still a top seller. Between the price, audio reproduction, and build quality, this is clearly a winning formula."
171,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to pair with my iPad. I want to watch video and listen without disturbing folks around me. These headphones are an excellent replacement to my now disgraceful-sounding Apple ear buds. These headphones give superb sound quality.

I might have only two complaints. First, the cable can be a bit annoying or cumbersome during use. I had more than once to detangle myself from a wrap-up in a seemingly never-ending spiral of electrical cord. I refused blue-tooth because I wanted sound quality, so I accepted the trade-off. Second, the headphones can be very warm to wear. My ears would sweat. These are certainly not the headphones to have on in a hot day at the beach.

I was otherwise very pleased with these headphones and highly recommend them for their exceptional audio quality."
172,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones. I've owned them for several years now, and very happy with them. The sound quality is fantastic. Everything from low bass to crisp highs are rendered accurately. They sounded a little harsh when they were new, but once they broke in the sound softened up and mellowed out. Now they sound sweet and smooth. I use them for everything. They are also light and very comfortable. The coil gives a long reach, while still staying short when that is preferred.

I would recommend these to anyone."
173,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unlike other popular headphone brands which are weighted to give the appearance of quality, these are super lightweight and comfortable. I wear them for hours at a time and hardly notice. Good at blocking out noise in the room, and your music is hardly noticable to anyone else even at louder volumes. Personally I like the long springy cord, less likely to get stuck in your chair wheels than other kinds. The one downside is that as others have said, the material on the cushions will eventually degrade and fall apart. Such is life I suppose, better something superficial than to have them actually break."
174,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are without doubt the best headphones I've ever owned. The sound quality is incredible- rich and full without over-emphasizing any part of the sound spectrum. Bass is amazing and brain scrambling. Mid range is clear and precise and not at all obscured by the lower and upper registers. Highs are crisp and clear.
When I put them on for the first time, the fit was comfortable. They are very good at blocking outside sounds. The first music I found on my IPod that I wanted to hear was Dvorak's 9th Symphony. Wonderful. Instruments were distinct and clear. Horns sounded rich and full. A little Springsteen and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper confirmed that these phones will handle a broad range of musical styles. Sgt. Pepper was the album that made an audiophile of me back in the 60's when it was released. At that time, I had a cheap portable stereo with a tilt out turntable and fold out speakers. I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day. I heard things from that music on his system that I had never heard on my cheap stereo, and I was hooked. These phones at less than a hundred dollars give me everything I heard on that high end system all those years ago. I've seen headphones listing for a hell of a lot more, and I can't imagine that they can sound that much better than these Sony's to justify spending several times more for them. I consider these to be an incredible bargain worth every penny."
176,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to replace my Bose SoundTrue in-ear headphones. When I first listened to these, I was not overly impressed, but as I continued to play through songs, I started to notice that instruments I could not clearly point out with my last headphones were much clearer. And when I started listening to some songs from ""The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Symphony"" I have as WAV lossless files, I noticed a night and day difference! It was like I was in front of the orchestra performing it! These headphones seem to truly take advantage of high quality sound files. I strongly recommend them."
177,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile but I am very picky when it comes to how music sounds and am never really satisfied because I know it can always sound better.

In the past 7 years I have used Bose (over the ear), Shure SE215 (in ear) and most recently, Sennheiser HD595 (over the ear) and honestly wasn't expecting much with these Sony's.

I was really happy with the Bose and they lasted a long time and sounded good but are falling apart after 7 years of use. Next came the Shure SE215's and I am very happy with these and they are great for mobile devices. Next came the Sennheiser because I wanted something good for listening to music while on the computer and I was actually shocked at how poor they sounded compared to the others (no external Amp on any of these) but they are very comfortable.

Anyway, when I took these Sony's out of the box and plugged them in, I was amazed at how good they sound compared to the others I own. When I say good I mean, really, really good.

You can hear so much more detail in every song, any style of music, but the biggest difference came when I plugged them into my Roland V-Drums and started playing. I had no idea how much I have been missing.

I hope anyone who considers buying these reads as many reviews as possible because that's really what made up my mind to buy Sony."
178,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i am not going to write a long revie but theses headphones are xcellent! i have a set of ath m50s that i love but did not want to destroy them. wgen i was looking at headphones it was between these 2. bought ath m50s. later i bought a roku 3 and could plug headphones into the remote for tv when wife was asleep. like all headphones they take a few hours to burn them in but after a few hours they became awesome. i am into clarity and volume and these are so clear and crisp. the have very good bass but not mind blowing. i now find myself using these all the time. for 2x s the money you will not find a pair that is better. very comfortable, lightweight and foldable with a leatherette case. in my opinion the 2 vest headphones are ath m50 and sony 7506. ps. tried ath m30s because of ath reputation and did not like at all. alot of distortion and seemed very cheap. if u read revirws on amazon before you buy and ignore the comments that morons write you always will get a great product."
179,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I will not do a 5000 word review on $100 headphones, or an audiophile ""let me tell you how smart I am"" dissertation either. Sound is purely subjective. I like em or I don't.
I bought these after getting the Sennheiser HD 480 Pro. I connected both to a Touch at 80% volume for 31 hours straight. The HD 480's always needed near full volume (love the low end) but that muffled effect didn't go away. The 7506's were clean and crisp, perhaps a little too bright, bass is tight and NOT boomy. The 2 side by side; Sony is my preference, although bright the overall sound is more pleasing and comfortable to wear."
180,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These head phones are known for their excellent performance, and they are very comfortable to wear all day. They really are good for musicians or computer users. They are not so good if you need to move around a lot while wearing them. They do not block out external sounds enough to be useful in a noisy environment. They don't fold up so they wouldn't fit in a guitar gig bag. But these headphones last and last, and are not terribly expensive. I have used mine for years, and they are still in great shape and look nearly new (no cracks, peeling, etc). Some of my other headphones fall apart after a few years of use, the foam crumbles or vinyl peels, but these have held up."
181,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are absolutely THE best headphones I have ever used. They aren't the best studio monitors in the world, but they definitely are the most rugged. Their audio reproduction is still surprisingly good, if a little strong on the highs, but for the cost and the fact that they just don't break, they pay for themselves many, many times over.

I had gone through multiple Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic, and AKG monitors previously. Something always broke or worn out or just plain went bad in alarmingly short time spans. I have had countless cables get brittle and break, drivers start to distort over time, but after extensive use of the MDR-7506 for over 3 years now, the only thing that had worn down are the stickers on the ear cups. The cable has survived the metal casters of my chair rolling over it countless times with no visually apparent damage, I have dropped the headphones similarly countless times without as much as a scratch. These poor headphones have been through hell, and yet they keep fighting strong.

My only complaint I have with them are with the stock ear pads, specifically. At first, I had replaced them with Beyerdynamic velour ear pads. While comfortable at first, a little over a year later, and they had become completely covered in this horrifically disgusting layer of oil and dirt that was literally caked on. I set the headphones down on a piece of paper on my desk overnight, and in the morning, the paper had a giant oil stain on it. Needless to say, I was mortified. I eventually replaced those with the Brainwavz Sheepskin ear pads. While stupid expensive, they avoid the sucking powers of cloth and the flaking qualities of pleather. Highly recommended, if you don't sweat easily, that is.

To sum up, these headphones are unassuming tanks; They look cheap and flimsy at first, but these guys pack some serious punch and are cost effective to boot!"
182,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just bought a third pair---we LOVE these headphones! Crystal clear sound quality (this, coming from a hard-of-hearing person) that is superb, especially for the price! Doesn't interfere with my hearing aids or make them ring because my ears are covered. WIN! My teens LOVE these headphones and will probably own a couple pairs each before too long, to keep for school, travel, backup pair, etc."
183,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When my last pair of Sony MDR headphones finally gave out after many years of dutiful service, I was set on buying the most similar version currently available. Unfortunately, the quality of the build of headphones had gone down. The cushions started to peel away after about a year of use and then the left side of the headband broke off just recently after 3 years of use. They are also not truly over-the-ear headphones so it starts to get uncomfortable on your ears after a couple of hours of use, such as watching a movie."
184,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OVERALL: Great headphones with faithful sound reproduction. Cannot imagine there's a better value out there - was surprised to find that these industry standard phones are under $100. I 100% recommend these.

I run sound at church and needed headphones that will faithfully reproduce the signal. An audio pro who does both studio and live work gave a clinic for our sound team and recommended these.

I cannot be happier.

Affordable, comfortable, perfect amount of noise cancelling, exceptional sound reproduction - what's not to love?

I'm also a drummer and these work great for reducing the db assault on my ears during practice. I hook them up to my iPhone to listen to the click or songs I'm trying to learn. Everything sounds great. While the db from the drums is reduced it's not muffled in a way that interferes with practice. For example, I still know if my rim click sounds right or is slightly off.

I love that the 1/4 adapter screws on and off so it won't accidentally get left behind when I pack up or switch jacks.

The cord does not seem like it will tangle easily and I have not had any issues yet of it kinking up and don't anticipate that to be a problem.

The 1/8 inch plug housing can interfere with connecting it to a phone depending on the case you have so you may have to modify your case (enlarge the hole that goes to your headphone jack), take the case off, or what I do is carry an extension cable.

I do recommend buying a case for them.

I can't imagine anyone regretting buying these especially for under $100."
185,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an old pair of Technics headphones that felt and sounded great. Unfortunately the ""leather"" portions on the headband and ears are flaking and look horrible so it came time for a new pair. I bought Sol Republic's but wasn't happy with its sound quality. After looking up headphones this Sony headphone had good reviews and are apparently used in many recording studios so I figured I'd give them a shot. I was blown away at how good the sound quality is on these. The Sol Republic sound like CRAP compared to these. I bought my GF a pair of limited edition Hello Kitty Beats by Dre and these destroy the Beats as well! For the price and quality sound these are hard to beat. I definitely recommend buying these."
187,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these on a recommendation from a friend, he said they are an industry standard and he and many people he's known have owned theirs for many years. He himself said he's had his for 10 years, and as you'll see it's not uncommon for people to say they have had them for that long.

Packaging:
Freaking sweet! I guess I didn't expect much for headphones but it comes in a pretty nice box, solidly packaged. It was sitting on top of some ruffled silver cloth, looked great. Includes headphones, large jack connector (not sure what it's called) and warranty info / disassembly instructions.

Build:
These things are built like a rock. They are also beautiful. Just looking at the screws and the stitching of the leather on the headband I'm highly impressed.

Fit:
This is a point I docked a point, maybe I just have a big head or ears. The first day I wore them my ears got a little sore, they aren't real tight mind you, but probably a result of me being an ear-bud style kind of guy for so long.

Audio:
Look I'm no audiophile, but man can these pump! I never knew what I was really missing musically. I've discovered so many new things in the music I listen to. The base isn't overwhelming but it's nice. Have you ever been in a car with wayyyyy too much base to the point you couldn't hear the actual music? I have, and hate that. If you're looking for extreme base well, go put some subs in your car! These like any good headphone will excel when connected to a better audio device, like a headphone amp, or a good computer sound card (and yes you can tell a HUGE difference). I had these hooked up to a Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeMusic Card (a midrange sound card) and there was a huge difference from on board computer audio (heck my headphones where noticeably shaking). I'm now getting a top of the line ASUS card that has a built in headphone amp and expect even larger gains.

Other Thoughts:
On recommendation from a friend I got different earpads. I got the velour earpads meant for the Beyerdynamic DT250/DT280 from [ ... ], you can actually find the link to it right here on Amazon by searching for ""Beyerdynamic DT250/DT280 Replacement Earpads Headphones"". At the time of writing they are about [ ... ] shipped. They have a larger ear opening. I've seen others say that their ears can sweat when wearing the stock ones for a long time, but these are great and won't stick to your face so check those out.

These leak sound a little, it's not terrible but keep that in mind if your looking for a pair of headphones that won't leak at all these are not it.

I will update when the new audio card comes in next week."
188,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great. I recently replaced a pair I've had since 1998. They're especially great for listening to music made with modern instruments, including rock and some jazz. They are possibly a bit too ""technical"" for classical music, and will certainly expose flaws in recordings that you wouldn't ordinarily hear on lesser headphones. They're comfortable enough for multi-hour listening sessions and fit comfortably.

I listen to these through my Mac via an Audioquest Dragonfly 1.2 DAC and typically listen to music encoded with a lossless codec (such as ALAC or FLAC) played back through Amarra Symphony.

There are certainly better sounding headphones available through Amazon, but all of them cost twice as much as these, which are a bargain anywhere under $100. I've listened to music through a lot of different equipment and I've never heard over-the-ear headphones that sound anywhere near this good for less than $250."
189,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones! I use these coupled with a portable headphone amp for gaming, youtube viewing, music listening, etc.. These have a very flat audiophile sound that's meant for the most accurate listening experience. That said, if you are someone who doesn't care for accuracy and who just wants that exaggerated bass sound then these will not be the headphones for you."
190,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have 4 pairs of Headphones priced between $79.99 and $250.00 and I must say these are very impressive. They have a well balanced sound perfect for my recording studio. I use these most of the time for mixing. They are comfortable as well.
191,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are some of my favorite headphones... They sound great and aren't bass heavy like many others are. They run a little hotter than many other headphones I have like my AKG's. Great quality at a great price. These work better than many other headphones costing significantly more.
192,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm no audiophile but bought these because thewirecutter.com ranked them as the best in a certain price range. Indeed, they're great. Bought them because I needed reference headphones for my voice over work and they do a wonderful job of not overemphasizing bass, treble, etc. Just a nice solid sound reproduction which is what I'm looking for.

They do get a little warm after wearing them for extended periods, and the ear cups are a little too small/shallow for my ears. Haven't worn for a long enough period to tell whether my ears would hurt after extended listening sessions (many hours in a row)."
193,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently produced five CDs for the Yale Whiffenpoofs and spent many hours listening to singing. The most difficult task was working with a recording engineer in Florida while I was in Connecticut. He would put the transcribed music on the server for me to listen to, and I would send back my comments and suggestions. It was important that I hear the music as clearly as possible, and after trying 8 different pairs of headphones, I am convinced the Sony MDR-7506 headphones are the best available. The only other phones that were comparable were the Sennheiser HD650s, but these cost roughly three times more. But I prefer the Sony's for their realism and sound stage.

Sound stage is an abstract concept that is difficult to explain. When earphones provide a good sound stage, the listener feels both left-right differential but forward-back depth. This capability is a perception, not a reality, and has a lot to do with how well the music has been engineered in the sound studio. But some headphones present a full sound stage and others do not. I have always appreciated the Sennheisers for doing this well, but the Sony MDR-7506 headphones do it the best. This gives the music a depth beyond that generated by stereo, and allows one to listen for extended periods of time without fatigue.

I even recommend these headphones if all you are going to do is listen to rock. The bass response is flat, not enhanced, however. But I have listened to some well engineered rock with these and it comes alive. The midrange is alive and crystal clear. Vocals are so realistic that you are transported. Sometimes it takes my breath away. I love these headphones."
194,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm working in a small home studio where I generally record no more than two musicians or singers at a time. I needed to purchase two pairs of headphones so that I could monitor the recordings while also allowing the musicians to hear themselves. After doing considerable research, I settled on these the Sony MDR7506 headphones.

First, they're widely used in professional studios, so you know they're going to have good build quality. Second, they have a relatively flat frequency response. If you're looking for bass-heavy phones, something from Beats will probably make you happier. But in a studio, the flat response of these phones really works well.

I also really like the coiled cable. I've had phones with both coiled and straight cables, and the coiled seem to be less of a hassle overall, especially when you've got a dozen other cables snaking around the room to mics and instruments.

Being able to easily convert from a 1/4"" jack to a 1/8"" jack is a really great feature that's fairly common on headphones like these, and it's appreciated.

Finally, the price is what really seals the deal. You can find better headphones, but they're going to cost a good deal more than these. Altogether, I think they're great for small studios or traveling musicians that need a solid set of phones."
195,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had this headphones for 4 years now and they are still working great. no problems with them other than that the ear pads started to get worn down so i bought some new ones, the sound is just amazing in this headphones and i would buy another pair of them when my other ones break down. This headphones can really take a hit, I have been using them weekly for 4 year and I usually just trow them in my backpack without the protective bag around it, and they still work well. the cord is doing well and like i said earlier they are still working like they wear new. The sound quality on this ones are also amazing, if you want anything close to this that i have tried you need to go 2-3 times the price.

I use a lot of time traveling around and if i sit in a car or flying i will use them for hours at the time, I can easily wear them for 5-6 hours at the time listening to music, listening to audio books or watching movies, they work great for everything. It don't matter if it is loud music in the car or you are on the plan. The headphone block out most of the sound. At the same time you can play the music as loud as you want to without the guy next to you hearing anything.

I would recommend buying this headphones to every one. they are maybe not the most stylish ones, but they are dissent looking and if you care more about the look then the sound than you can spend your money one a lot of other headphones, but this headphones have the best sound in there price range. unless you a looking for a pair $200-300+ you this is the headphones for you."
196,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned and listened to a ton of headphones and earbuds ranging from $12 to over $400. I would not consider myself to be a true audiophile although I have amazing ears and can tell the difference between good and great headphones. I can honestly say that these would be Considered GREAT!!!!! The amount and quality of sound that these put out is phenomenal! If you wanted a great pair of headphones for less than $100, then these are for you. They easily sound better than my $300 Bose QC25's. And the bass absolutely THUMPS! If you have never listened to a pair of good headphones then these will blow you away. These will play any note your ear can possibly hear with ease. I've listened to the similarly priced Grado SR80e Prestige Series Headphones, and although the Grados had slightly better highs and mids, these absolutely DESRTOY the Grados when it comes to bass. The bass was tight and loud and made Hip Hop/Rap And EDM sound incredible. I personally thought that the highs were too harsh and bright but most people will actually like it and feel like it has more detail As for comfort, these aren't so great. It might be because I'm spoiled with high end headphones but to me, these felt rather cheap and light. They're On/Over-ear headphones. They squish uncomfortably against the bottom and top of my ear. And the cord is slightly annoying. But for headphones less than $100, these will not disappoint :)"
198,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To start with, these are very similar, all the way around, to the MDR-V6s. The MDR-V6s are excellent. These are a little better. They seem to be a little less efficient than the MDR-V6s, but they are listed as 1 db better. The headband spring also didn't need to be decompressed to the same degree.

The frequency response is excellent: very extended at both ends and flat as a pancake (I know, 'avoid trite similes like the plague'). These are very involving. The soundstage is excellent. These come very close to my favorite Shure SRH840s, but at about 1/3rd the price.

Assuming my ears don't fall off (they are very comfortable, but they are also mostly sealed), I could listen to these all day."
199,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had Several Sennheiser DJ headphones plus the Sony ""DJM's"" (silver, round, with the plastic housing swivel). While I enjoyed the reference quality sound of the Sennheiser better, once they bit it I wanted something more affordable. These phones do the job. The bass levels are not out of control (which they were for the DJMs, and are for non-professional, non-audiophile phones like Beats), something I don't need while trying to figure out how much bass I need while DJing.

I don't feel that these phones have all the range and precision of Sennheisers, but the price is definitely right. Headphones only last three years of combined professional and personal use with me, so I'm happy with my decision to use these for the next three years.

Also, as to durability: they SEEM durable enough, and I've heard they are durable. If they last 3 years, I'll be more than satisfied!"
200,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased the MDR-V6 about 7 years ago. Loved them and bought these for my brother. They are identical to the MDR-V6 and he fell in love with them too after listening to mine for a few days.

These headphones are for monitoring thus they have an exceptionally flat/neutral sound to them. This is something I love. You will hear imperfections and minute sounds that are hard to hear on headphones that ""color"" the sound (be it with bass or treble). But these just play whatever you give them.

Excellent presentation with the red satin. They also seem to last forever"
201,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have very high quality recordings of Chicago's (Chicago Transit Authority) ""I'm a Man"" and ""Questions 67 and 68,"" as well as Canned Heat jamming with with John Lee Hooker, ""Whiskey and Women."" I selected these three songs because there's a lot of range in these songs covering many instruments (a wide variety of percussion, strings, horns, electric, distortion, and different voice textures). It's very easy for these songs to become muddied due to the richness and complexity of the the various ranges. I listened to these three songs through these MDR-7506 first. Then I listened to it through a pair of Koss UR/29s, then through a pair of Sennheiser HD 202s (because these are the only headphones I have available and wanted to compare them). Then I returned to the MDR-7506s.

When I first listened through these headphones I was stunned by the clarity and separation of the instruments and the clean character of the sound. When I listened to these through the Koss UR/29s they were about 8-10% muddier (to my ear). The Koss UR/29s are surprisingly clean but they seem to miss the highs and too many of the instruments blend, losing distinction, and some subtle sounds of instruments were nearly undetectable. Still the Koss UR/29s are good headphones and sound very nice for listening to music. For $30.00 they're a heck of a deal. The Sennheiser HD202s actually sounded like there was a curtain between me and the sound of the music. In fairness these Sennheiser HD202s are $25.00 or $30.00 also. The Koss UR/29s put them to shame.

Then I went back to the MDR-7506s and I was very pleased; ""thrilled by the quality of the sound"" is a better constative. These headphones are remarkably clear and they convey the recording as it was engineered and intended to sound. I got them for about $82.00. A little pricey but considering the quality of the sound, well worth it. I would not chase the Bose, the Beats, or the other high-end offerings because I like the music presented as intended, whereas Bose loves to shape sound, and the Beats are definitely engineered for enhancing types music as well (typically the base and highs). One last thing, these are comfortable and relatively non-intrusive on my head; that is, they're easy to wear. The UR/29s are comfortable as well but again, the difference between these and the MDR-7506s is significant.

Note: I recently purchased these so I am critiquing the quality of the sound only; if I remember to come back here in a year or two, I'll give a followup regarding performance and durability over time. I purchased a set of the Beyerdynamic replacement ear cups and when the originals fail and I replace them, I'll probably write the follow-up piece at that time."
202,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really wonderful sound quality. They are pretty clear. I can't tell if the low end response is a little weak or not, it could just be me. I bought these not knowing much about what kind of headphones to pick up for audio editing to video/mixing. These were recommended as the standard classic workhorses that last and stay comfortable all day long by pro studio engineers and editors. If you are looking for a great set to use for these purposes, look no further. That said, considering very few will ever listen to your products this way, you should really be mixing with a decent set of studio speakers.

Four stars because for the price I expected a little more in frequency and low end, but they are def solid and sound great."
203,5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW! This is the best headset i have owned and provably will ever own. Reading other reviews that were negative gave me the impression I was missing out on something better. So I headed to the audio store and checked out headsets that are double to triple the price of this pair. This headset stood above all that I tested. Not only did they sound better but they were way more comfortable. I can see these lasting for a very long time and I plan on keeping them. Could use a DAC but definitely not needed.

Pros:
-Good high notes
-Great bass range that never seems to bottom out
-Great Mid's
-Can wear them ALL day
-Long ""tangle free"" cord

Cons:
-Does not block outside noise
-High notes can hurt sometimes
-When not plugged in the cord can drag on the floor and the jack can get damaged
-Not so tangle free but better than others"
204,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these in January 2016. They came with a leather pouch, an adapter for headphone jacks larger than 3.5 millimeters, a service manual containing a diagram of the user replaceable parts, and a piece of paper with warranty information.

Ever since the first time I used them, I've considered them to have excellent sound quality (5 out of 5 stars), with accurate reproduction of whatever I listen to through them. There was no break-in period at all. I understand why these have been used in some recording studios.

Regarding comfort, I wear glasses, and I think the headphones are comfortable when I use both at once. I have noticed that sometimes I sweat around the ear pads, but that doesn't bother me.

If you are looking for studio quality headphones, I recommend considering these. If you are looking for headphones with a lot of bass, I'm not sure you would be satisfied with these."
205,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to replace/complement my Grado 225's so I had high standards for headphone sound quality. The great thing about the Grado's is the sound quality, the bad thing is the comfort. I felt, after reading countless headphone reviews, that these would be a good choice. I did not expect them to equal the Grado sound, and they are not. Then again, they are less than 1/3 the price of Grados. The comfort level is very, very good. I am occasionally bothered by the band pressing on my head, but that is after many hours of listening. Another reviewer of this line of Sonys complained that the wire going to the ear cup broke from taking the headphones on and off. Being forewarned was a good thing as I was able to pull some of the excess wire down so that the headphone flipping as I take them off did not put stress on the wire. These are designed to fold up and that is my only real complaint. The ear cup flips into the folded position when I take them off, and then requires a few seconds to flip them back into position before putting them on. This happens ALL the time and though the time involved is small, the irritation is not. It took about 50 hours to break them in, and the sound quality is fine for TV, movies, and background listening while I read. They are absolutely a good value and I would absolutely buy them again."
206,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Listening to my iTunes music collection with these Sony MDR7506 headphones, it's like my mp3's got a free upgrade to a higher bit rate. My other headphones (Audio-Technica ATHM40FS Precision Studio Headphones) sound somewhat flat, imprecise and washed-out in direct comparison. The Sony headphones are superior, without question producing clearer and more accurate sound. The Sony's also weigh less on the head, resulting in less neck strain after hours of use, and they fit more comfortably but without sliding off. The Sony's have a coiled cord which is less likely to tangle or trip people. The Sony headphones work great when plugged directly into my portable MP3 players (Sansa Clip and Coby models), do not require an adapter, and can be worn around the house because the cord is coiled and does not drag or tangle. The Audio-Technica is not practical for use with small portable devices because of the very long cord and need for a bulky adapter. Over all, the Sony headphones sound better, fit better, work better and are well worth the extra cost as compared with cheaper products."
207,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to own a small project studio and I had SIX of these headphone sets at one time. I never should have let all SIX get away during liquidation. Someone once told me that I should never pay consumer prices for great audio. Once you own professional equipment, consumer audio never quite sounds the same for the price.

Anyways, as you can tell I sold my equipment and the headphones with it. That was a mistake. These headphones were the main stay of my productions, and editing. I now had to settle for in-ear buds which never stay in for me. Or, I have the complimentary headphones one gets when buying popular language learning software. (Yikes!) But I persevered through that muck for about 5 years to purchase again these headphones. My ears are in a blissful state once more! Thank you Sony for never giving up on a good product!

These headphones have a GREAT sound!!! I like the other brands, you know...Senn, AT, AKG, etc. but I LOVE these Sonys. They have a crisp, clean brilliance of sound while maintaining a full, rich bass presence. Nothing is muddied unless it's in the recording that way or your amps just won't reproduce the sound cleanly.

I gave SIX pair of these phones away and I regretted every minute I went without them. I am fortunate to find them here for a VERY low price of $77.XX. I paid about $110.00 for each pair in my studio.

I am SO glad to have these Sonys back! Each pair is almost identical to the next in the Sony MDR-7506 line. These sound pretty much the same as my 6 pair in my studio.

As far as total transparency, these phones tend to accentuate the bass while leaving the mids and highs about level to a ""flat response"" EQ setting. The closed design does help reduce ambient noise considerably. In my estimation, these PROBABLY reduce ambient noise by about 15-22 dBs.

The comfort of these headphones is amazing. The foam cushions keep the drivers from putting pressure against the ears causing discomfort. They are not too tight in their fit as to cause headaches from wearing these phones for long periods of time such as in the back of the mini-van for 6 hours while watching the latest Scooby Doo episodes on DVD.

One more thing...volume. These phones can take the volume without distorting on their own. Any distortion that comes through those drivers is most likely due to a bad recording or amps that cannot reproduce sound that well.

You want some advice on what to purchase for headphones? Buy the Sony MDR-7506es. They are by FAR the best audio bang for the buck!

Hope this helps!!!"
209,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this as a gift for my girl friend, who is an amateur musician, of the new century type (vocals, synths, etc). This is just an excellent product. As other reviews have stated, this is standard equipment in recording studios all over the world. What gets more professional than that? Basically these blast my non-modified Grado SR-80's (purchased a couple of years before this, and excellent head phones in their own right, out of the water). My music sounds different (as in better, more clear) since I got this: and I have a MP3 (320 kbps), FLAC and vinyl collection that I listen to every day.

210,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love these headphones. I was prepared to spend in excess of $200 for a good pair of headphones but I'm glad I continued to shop. There is good contrast to the ranges and the sound is full without feeling like it's right on top of you. The bass is good without too much artificial 'thump'. They are also comfortable with my glasses, which has not been the case with other headphones I tried.

A couple of things to keep in mind that some may consider a drawback: the cord is heavy, which is to be expected with professional headphones. This makes mobility awkward if using with your phone or smaller devices. Also, they can get hot if you're not in a climate controlled environment. I use these headphones for chilling at home, so none of these things are an issue for me. So, at this price point, the value can not be Beat (pun intended)."

Just because it says Bose on it does not mean it is the best. My ear cups fell apart after a few years of barely using them and I needed to buy another headphone set as Bose will not sell parts. They make you buy completely new equipment. The only thing you can buy is aftermarket junk that does not fit properly.
I am glad I took the time to look online. These Sony Headphones are dynamic in sound and without a doubt, several classes up in quality over Bose and all the rest in the survey that were ALL at least $200 more.

212,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me just say that these are the greatest headphones I have EVER OWNED, period. This is my birthday present that I got for turning 18. I love everything about these headphones. The sound is perfect from what my ears are hearing. The comfort is almost perfect, but they do get annoying after a few hours of wearing them. They fit around my big dwarf head which is safetly to say that they'll fit anybody's head. haha It blocks out a lot of exterior like talking, computer fans, etc, though it's not perfect. You'll still hear dog barking, people yelling, jet engines, etc. I don't trust that this could take much of a beating, and I feel like I could snap these headphones in half if I really wanted to. As long as you aren't going to snap them in half or have an angry fit and throw them across the room. I think that this would last for a while, though the ear paddings, not really. It's not flimsy, it's just not indestructible. haha I would hope so because these are very expansive. I've been using them for 3 hours now and been addicted. I just love wearing them. haha When I got it in the mail, the packaging was if I was buying something expensive. It wasn't like it was half assed and no bubble wrap. Actually it was wrapped in a very soft material and jumbo size bubble wrap. The packaging was nicly presented and everything was secured. I love the silky bag that it came with. I didn't get the free software, but I did get the free adapter which I will be using for my keyboard.

Sound: The sound quality is exceptional at any price point. The sound reproduction with these headphones is extremely well rounded, clear and distortion-free at any volume. I can see why these would be desirable in a studio setting. The bass is deep the highs are crisp and the mids are in full effect. These are enjoyable headphones to use for listening to music from classical to rap as well as for spoken word audio like podcasts or talk radio.

Quality: So far so good. These have been around a while which speaks to the solid design. Some of the materials feel a little cheap and the overall feel of the headphones is slightly low-rent. The ear cup and headband leather feels cheap and the padding is not nearly as nice as the Bose QC15/25 (the standard for comfort in my opinion). They are in no-way uncomfortable even after an hour or more but could be more comfortable. The cord and wiring seems very robust. I would like the option to plug in a shorter cable for us on a computer or listening outdoors on a walk/hike or while travelling. The casing for the electronics however seems like pretty nice quality plastics. They seem rugged and all the hinges and hardware seem tough and I see no reason they wouldn't hold up to years of use.

Value: Value is an 11/10. Seriously, if you appreciate a quality set of headphones and think you can't get good sound and/or build quality for less than $300 should rethink your headphone search. These may not be the king of the mountain at any price. But, for $80-$100 they CANNOT be beat.

But what prompted my late review was being put in the unfortunately position of having to use a pair of my ""old"" (i.e. cheap) headphones yesterday. It was distracted to try to listen to music while working, because of the huge difference in audio quality (coming out of the same computer, same playlist and same streaming service). I have grown too accustomed to the quality you get with these (very reasonably priced) headphones.

The've all broken the same after about 8 months of heavy use. I'd keep spending money on them though because they were labeled for ""DJ Use."" Honestly it's all marketing bs for companies to get people to buy their products. I remember the days when expensive prices actually meant that something was going to last a lot longer. Not the case with most head phones on the market today.

These Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone's have with stood the test of time over and over again (if it ain't broke don't fix it).

During school I worked at the college radio station and all we used were these Sony's. I'd nearly forgotten how bad we used to treat them; they took such a beating that I thought all headphones were built this way. Not the case. The only thing I was see going on these is the ear pads (which are replaceable. As much as I use these, the way I take care of my equipment, I won't be needing to replace the ear pads for the next two years).

When I bought them last year there were something like 82.00. Very much worth the price even at 98.00. To this day if you ask me what are the best head phones to DJ with I will tell you to get these. They are also amazing for the Studio as well. Go figure.

Update: 10/14/12
Just replaced my my ear pieces as they were tearing on the inside and had this weird flaking issue. The foam pieces I replaced them with are excellent (Pearstone delux ear pads), have used them for the past three days with no issue; and def no flaking (which only starts to happen with the originals after a year or two depending on use).

The only weakness these headphones possess is the foam ear pieces which are not as durable as the Pearstone's I just purchased. I recommend buying the Pearstone Delux earpads (they go for around 20.00) along with the MDR-7506. You will not be disappointed."
232,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I work primarily as freelance radio producer and occasional DJ and am no stranger to Sony headphones. Having babied a well-worn pair of Sony MDR-V700 headphones for the past decade for general studio/work use, I was in dire need of a new set of cans.

The 7506 has a long reputation as a solid set of workhorse headphones with above-average sound quality. I've seen them used in countless radio and recording studios time and time again for years now. Having logged about 20 hours or so with them thus far, I can see what all the praise is about.

The fit is comfortable for longer sessions and the earphones themselves, as mentioned elsewhere, can be driven quite loudly before any audible distortion kicks in. I'd describe the overall sound quality as balanced: highs are sharp without a piercing quality, mids are present without any muddiness and the bass is punchy and warm without overpowering the rest of the spectrum.

Mind you, this is only as good as your source material, but in playing back typical 16 or 24-bit WAV audio in the studio (as well as 320 MP3s and even some older vinyl) the 7506 has done well with each source so far. No complaints.

I'd say the only caveat with the 7506 is in its design. They're NOT the sturdiest of headphones on the market in terms of build quality. They're considerably lighter than others nowadays which adds to the comfort factor but can be an issue over time where durability is concerned. They do fold up for transport but the wire to each earphone is exposed - another rarity compared to other current models - though said wires are held somewhat firmly in place.

I'd say the key to getting the most out of these in the long run is to handle them somewhat delicately. My older MDR-V700s were notorious for breaking at the hinges but having babied them for so long it's not terribly difficult to keep them usable with a bit of proper care. These ship with a soft leather carrying pouch which should be adequate for carrying these around in most situations but a hard-shell or zippered vinyl case (Slappa, UDG, etc) wouldn't hurt to have on hand either.

Overall, on sound quality alone and comfort alone, the 7506 is a must-have for anyone who spends a good chunk of their life living in headphones."
233,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Stunningly clear sound and at an amazing value. What's not to like about these universally highly-regarded headphones.

Well, it would be nice if they had a replaceable cable, and that way you could choose a length to suit and whether it was coiled or straight, but other than that quibble, they sound great and are comfortable to wear, and surely that's the main thing to keep in mind.

I have several other pairs of headphones, costing many times more than these, but the stunningly clear precise sound from the MDR 7506 draws me back to them, time after time.

My thanks to Sony for not selling them for $500, even though they probably could. An amazing bargain."
234,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a pair of these I got from I think Crutchfield back in 1998 and I broke those a few times and repaired them by buying some replacement parts and by making some parts, I even rewired it because the wire gor messed up

I finally decided to replace them and after doing some research I decided to just get the same type since I loved mine so much

the new ones look the exact same and they have the exact same box, my old ones said ""Made in Japan"" and the new ones say ""Made in Thailand""

they sound great and the dual tip is useful for traveling

there are better headphone manufactures out there but for this price these are the best deal by far if you arent looking for ultra portable"
235,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sometimes older is better. I was looking for over-ear travelling phones (as I have grown tired of earbuds). I have used MDR-V6s in the studio for two decades and have always loved their clean, try, reasonably flat qualities. They are also comfortable. Sure, the cushion material eventually cracks and flakes, but they just keep sounding great.

Anyway, as a love of Blue mics, I was holding out hope for the Mo-Fis, which I ordered within minutes of their availability and primptly returned because they are so heavy (see review). I continued my search for a short time before putting on the V6s, suddenly realizing that the answer for my travelling needs was already on my head. Shopping Amazon led me to discover that the MDR 7506 cans were about $15 cheaper (and are basically the same). So, I used the savings to buy a pair of the Beyerdynamic velour pads (much softer and cooler).

They arrived about an hour ago and haven't left my ears since. The 7506s compare favorably with every set of headphones or earbuds I have ever used; Sennheiser, AKG, B&W, Etymotic, Shure, and now, Blue. They sound amazing with little or no coloring (I want my audio to sound like it was recorded). Pus, they are light enough to wear for hours (half the Mo-Fis), fold better than most over ear phones for traveling and they hold up. They are efficient enough that my iPhone and iPad drive them with plenty of leftover head room.

Apparently, the proverbial ""wheel"" doesn't need to reinvented. Now, my V6s live in the studio and the 7506s travel in my bag."
236,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for my teenager as a holiday gift. She wears them for hours a day and loves them. She listens to a wide range of music including classical and jazz, and she praises these headphones above some of the other, more popular ""rap artist"" headphones because they are more balanced and accurate. From my perspective, they seem fairly sturdy and they are priced quite reasonably when compared to the ""more popular"" headphones that seem to appeal to the eyes more than the ears. Sony has made this model for a long time, and they stay in production for a reason."

238,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones had a great, balanced studio sound, not overboard on the bass like so many headphones that are sold today. However, the build quality is very poor. Like many other reviewers, the right channel stopped working entirely after about 6 months of use. I'm pretty handy with electronics, but couldn't figure out what to do to fix these. I took them apart, tested the connections, used an ohmmeter to try and pinpoint the failure/short, but to no avail. These are junk. Sorry Sony, but you have a serious quality problem with these headphones and you are damaging your reputation as a quality electronics product manufacturer."
239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Being in radio for over 21 years plus voiceover work for much of that, these have been and are still...my go-to headphones of choice. The Sony MDR7506's are awesome and I find give a good overall sound. I have 2 other ones around the house and studio. Which, I just realized, they now make replacement ear ""muffs"" for them. So I can fix my other two. But if you need new ones, you just need to get them. And not worry about whether the wife will be happy or not. Say you need them for work. Bonus: you get to write them off if you're in ""the biz""."
240,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son lives these headphones. He said that they're very crisp. He said at first you have to get used to them, because you hear things you didn't hear before with normal headphones, but soon realize that you have been missing so much ! He uses them to create music and to game online. I'd recommend these. For the price, these are great headphones."
242,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have been around forever, and there's a reason - they do everything well. Very balanced with a nice, even response curve. Highs and lows both sound fantastic, as do the mids. They are very comfortable with the included ear pads, but if you plan on using these a lot, do yourself a favor and buy some different ear pads (the covering will flake off eventually, so might as well replace them early on.) I have these hooked up to an amp for my computer, and I have no need to spend more money on a nicer pair, as the sound is fantastic. It would be helpful if you could exchange the cord for a straight cord, as the headphones would be a bit more portable (you probably wouldn't want to wear them out of the house though, as no would accuse them of being lookers,) but no complaints otherwise."
243,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these when I play guitar and don't want to wake little ones or the neighbors. Comes with 6mm adapter for the 3.5mm jack on them and they both fit the intended ports snugly. The definition is quite clear though at twice the price or more you'd get something better with noise cancelling or surround simulation, though I don't need such. Overall, a great set, comfortable as heck, fullness of sound across the range without too tinny or bright in the high frequency range (in a good way) and was highly recommended by a couple guitar/audio enthusiast sites fir a budget set after I did some research. I'm very pleased and also like the idea of a warranty unlike most cheaper sets. They even came with a decent bag for scratch protection as well as a package that does a good job if you would rather keep them put away. The cord even feels durable enough to last awhile for a change. Recommend!"
244,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really REALLY like the sound quality on these headphones. In fact, it is the sound quality that inched it up to 4 stars instead of 3. I played around with many different brands at local music shops and such and frankly, these were on par with everything but the most expensive as far as sound quality.

Now for the dis: As with most headphones of this style, they do not let your ears breath so wearing them for prolonged periods (more than 30 mins.) means you are going to sweat in them, possibly a lot. Sweat breaks down electronics as well as ear-pads (not to mention being uncomfortable). The other one that almost put these in the 3 star territory is the obnoxiously heavy cord. From using them on an electric piano to smart phone to portable guitar amp, the cord is constantly in the way and constantly a pain. I realize this is a problem for all corded electronics to some extent, but this thing is heavy so no matter how you position it, gravity does it's thing in short order and it is pulling on the input jack of your device (premature wear) as well as the headphones (wrapping tight against your neck and causing a lot of strain on the point where the cord goes into the headphones which means this will eventually pull out and fail).

All in all, they are nice and I like them, just be prepared to fuss with the cord a lot or come up with a way to clip it to your clothes or something because it'll drive you nuts."
245,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best, most accurate headphones you can buy, a classic design since 1991. These are the real deal, made in Thailand, not one of the fakes flooding the market right now. A better pair for the money doesnt exist. These are great headphones for listening to music if you enjoy an accurate representation of what the recording provides (as I do) and if you're a bass-head do not fear, simply adjust the bass slider up and the treble down a bit on your Amp/Equalizer and enjoy! These headphones are comfortable and fit any sized head, but if the cushions are not good enough more cushion-y pads are available from numerous sellers on Amazon. As for durability, these headphones are well made and solid. It is important to note though that they have exposed wires on both sides of the headphones which are small and can easily become caught or crushed if the headphones are adjusted into the storage position. This is the reason for some reviewers finding the sound stopped working on one side, as they likely unknowingly crushed one side of the wire. If these wires are damaged it may not be visibly obvious. Take them to any half-decent electronic specialist and they would be able to resolder the damaged wire no problem, Sony even includes in the box, a schematic for the headphones with all the wires shown making repair a trivial process. So, just be very careful when folding them or better yet just avoid folding them at all unless you really have to. Also, the wire is quite long which is great for plugging into your hi-fi setup and sitting/laying down 5-6 feet away. This long cord also makes these very impractical for use with Walkmans on the go, so don't even try, just use a cheaper pair for on-the-move listening. These also block out sound quite well, so don't walk down the block with them on for that reason too, you'll probably get hit by a car. All in all, these are wonderful headphones and I hope to get many many years out of these!"
246,2.0 out of 5 stars,"What I received was a bass frequency free headset. I first compared them on BBC 6 live stream to my ancient 50$ Koss portable phones.
The Koss are a bit dull in the mid upper bands, but even for a small open back design from the 80's deliver credible bass.
I then played a few tracks on the iPod I have at work and the Sony units were over the top on mid/high frequency and had no bass at all.
I can only guess these were defective since so many people likes them. Sent back to Amazon. One star is for the set I heard.. ither folks seem to have had a better experience.

They are light weight and comfortable for the 25 minutes I used them.. and assume they'd do well as all day units.An extra star for that."
247,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Initially too bright and with a ""cardboardy"" bass, I burned them in for about 70 hours playing random music from my iPod at a regular listening volume. I don't know how much I believe in all that, but I swear they sounded less strident in the highs and the bass had become a smoother and solid experience.

They are not to my liking for the brightness of the treble, which is not strident, but the bass cannot keep up. The highs are fine, only the bass is too quiet for me and not to my belief, accurate. If you were using these to master, you would keep messing with the bass and treble on your mixes to accomodate these headphones' negative characteristics.

Positive is that they still sound balanced, and they sound good. I think most people will notice there is quite a good sense of ambience presented by these, a rather spacious openness but the midrange, while perfectly functional, doesn't inspire. These are very careful headphones, they seek not to offend. They are sort of the Toyota Avalon (""A Lexus in all but name"") of headphones. Above the Camry, but not quite Lexus.

They are extremely comfortable, I love the design. I love the way they fold. These are some of the most well-designed headphones I've ever seen, amazing. Fat, thick cord that will never let you down (heavy, though!). You can wear these for hours (I can... I have a small head, more on that in a sec) and never feel a thing.

I have noticed with these, if I press them into my ears a little harder, they sound more impressive. The bass and lower mids come up and I really like their sound, at that point.

I wondered if people with big heads might be getting a better, more satisfying sound out of these because maybe the speakers press closer, thus correcting some of the bass problems I sited.

Bass is there, and accurate, just not with the 'oomph' that it should have. It's like it represents the bass, but it doesn't really sort of, appreciate it. And these headphones are like that with the whole spectrum, like I said, they're kinda like a Camry/Avalon thing where everything is fine, but you're not exactly inspired. Except by the design and comfort, that is a huge plus!"
248,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall better than audiotechnica M50x.

Sound: I am not an audiophile but have owned Audiotechnica m50x, bose qc 25, v moda m100. Great detailed, LIVELY sound with GREAT bass response. Some of the details brought forth are due to weight on highs/treble rather than actual quality of the drivers. Bass is better than V moda m 100, bose qc25 probably at par with Audiotechnica M50x. Overall sound more open than audiotechnica.

Comfort: Unbelievably light weight. More lightweight than Audio technical M50x and also more comfortable. I wish the ear cushions were made of a little more plush material. There are so many custom much more comfortable ear cup cushions available on amazon though.

Portability: NONE. The cable is a like a snake you would need to wrap around your neck or something before you try to walk around with there. CABLE IS NOT DETACHABLE. If you listen on your pc/laptop all the time, you will be good. But I had to return my pair for this very same reason. Audiotechinca win on this stage.

Price: Refurbished for 69 dollars on amazon. If you want some serious sound quality and do not plan to walk around with the ultra long cable you cannot have a better pair of headphones for this price."
249,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first one I received didn't work on the left ear. Any sound that passed through it had a buzzing sound. This really made we worry as I've never spent more than $40 on headphones before (and i've had to some real good ones, old ones, in the past) and the first time I talk myself into buying $80 head phones . . . and decided to go with SONY because of their reputation, and the left headphone was garbage.
Don't let that detract you because you already know with Amazon, it's super easy to replace items. Amazon paid for shipping to return it and already sent out a replacement. The replacement arrived 2 days later and wow.

The sound is AMAZING. These are what I expected for a quality pair of SONY headphones.
I'm sure the people who buy $300 headphones would look down on headphones like these, but I'm a working class man and everything has to be in my budget. I'd be interested to hear a $300 headphones vs these $80 ones, because curiosity . . . .... because $300 is alot of money in my world.
I think these are great headphones and will be using these mostly in a studio enviroment as well as casual listening.
I find them to be VERY comfortable, and pleasing to listen to. I don't think you will be disappointed."
250,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros
- Decent sound
- Easily compacted. Great for traveling on the airplane, it compacts upwards, and comes with a little bag to store it in.
- Long cord. I don't like wireless and the cord extends out for long distances which is useful.
- Adjustable. Can be adjusted.

Cons
- Uncomfortable. I literally had to make these max size to take pressure off of my head, and I have a small head.
- Sound doesn't reflect the price. There are much better headphones in the 100$ max price range compared to these guys.
- Gets warm on ears pretty quickly.

Personally, I wanted to return them, but I was traveling for longer than a month and surpassed the time to return them. I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
251,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very nice headphones for the price, but they don't do a great job blocking background noise if you're on an airplane. I knew they weren't noise cancelling when I bought them, but have seen several reviews saying they're a great travel headphone because the over the ear, closed-back style helps block noise. I was recently on a flight a couple of rows away from a crying baby and they really didn't do much to block that out. I bought these to replace a set of Sennheiser HD 598 Cs Closed Back Headphones that somehow got lost on a recent trip, and the Sennheiser's do a MUCH better job at blocking out background noise. Of course, they are about $75 more expensive.

Compared to the Sennheisers, these are smaller and easier to travel with because they fold, and adding a case to the Sennheisers makes them even bigger. I was hoping to use these instead for that reason, but I'm going back to my Sennheisers. The Sennheisers also have a little better sound quality IMO, although I do think for the price these Sonys are excellent. Based on sound quality, price, and portability, I'd take the Sonys, but the better noise reduction on the Sennheisers makes the Sennheiser my choice for travel."
253,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried many headphones in my quest to find the best for the money. Sure there are $500 pairs out there that drive reference quality speakers, but for the price these are all a casual listener or even budding audiophiles need. I used to record using these headphones as monitors in college and ended up returning to them even though now I use them as pure listening cans. The biggest pro is that they sound absolutely spectacular when plugged into an iPhone or android phone. It's hard to find cans that perform in this area without some ridiculous onboard EQ that obscures artists true intentions for their mix/music. They are rather flat sounding but I prefer that so I can hear the original artist intended mix.

Look there's a reason these are the most used headphones in the sound industry. For the money they blow most competitors away or at the very least match more expensive models consistently."
254,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an expert, compare to many reviewers here, so take this review for what it is: I like to listen different kind of music, so I like headphones/speakers with a nice response, but also I can't afford 10k$ stuff.

These headphones are great for the price.
The sound is really crisp.
The response is really large, it performs equally well from classical music to the bohemian rapsody to heavy electronic music.
I compared them to Beat and JBL headphones (at least four times the price) and the sound was clearly *way* better.

But it is not the perfect headphones: the wire is really cumbersome. Perfect for staying at your office (you can keep them and move a bit around, it is really an incredibly long leash!), but it makes the headphone heavy if you want to take a walk, for instance."
255,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great for long studying sessions and long nights coding. Combine them with top quality flac tracks and you will be in your own world. These headphones do a great job of isolating you and the music. They are a bit heavy and are definitely not meant for physical activity. If you use them while outside your ears may began to sweat and the cable will get in the way. In addition the plug is huge in comparison to a mp3 player or ipod.
As far as sound is concerned? They are studio headphones! Remember this. That means that the songs will sound just like they are supposed to sound. This means that these cans do not amplify bass or treble. They way the song was recorded, that is the way they will sound. This can take some getting used too coming from other styles of headphones which are designed to amplify some aspect of sound (like bass or treb). Initially this may make you feel like the headphones sound too ""low"". However, once you get used to all of this you will come to enjoy hearing your music just the way it was recorded. Clean and clear. Heck, you may even notice new notes and sounds that you have never heard before. The only reason I am not giving these cans a perfect 5 is because I am not superbly blown away by them. But for the price and quality; they are definitely worth it."
256,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to muffle outside sounds, but what I discovered was I'd been missing a lot! I had been using bluetooth earbuds for my transcription work. I didn't like the feeling of being ""tethered"" to my desk, so I went wireless. I had no idea that I was missing critical information. These headphones not only helped remove a lot of the buzzing caused by the bass in the audio, but it also helped me hear small mutterings that I had been missing. As a court reporter and transcriptionist, it's important that I hear every spoken word and type it for the client...once I started using the MDR7506, I found I had been missing so much!

Now I'm able to hear every utterance, even when two people are speaking at once, I'm better able to discern them apart and catch every word. While these headphones don't totally block out my dogs barking or the sound of the washing machine, it does help to sort of fade them into the background because what's going on in my ears is so much clearer.

For music...it almost gives me chills listening to music that's clear, crisp and beautiful. I'm no audiophile but I can say that these are incredible for listening to music. Movies on my laptop? Sounds really nice and makes playing with my equalizer a lot of fun too.

The only drawback I've found is that the ear covers, the vinyl or whatever it is, makes your head sweat. I had read other reviews and purchased a pair of Beyerdynamic EDT250V Headphone Ear Pads for ""just in case"". Glad I did too - I had to put them on within 30 minutes. Now they're the perfect set of headphones!"

Great fit, solid construction and MOST important of all they sound awesome and don't color the original mix....I have owned many pairs of headphones and unless all you want to hear is Head Pounding Muddy Bass Thump these are Great!!! They are not made to be gangsta rap thump cans if that's what you want keep looking. These are pretty flat Eq'd spectrum sound designed to reproduce the mix NOT color the mix with enhanced thump, for the price there is no other choice for me and I been into this stuff since the late 70s. Hope this helps somebody out."
258,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones just arrived in the mail today from Amazon. I needed something that was compact and still sounded just as good or better than my old Sony MDR-V600's while still costing me less than $200. I read exhaustive reviews and comparisons on pairs by Sennheiser, Bose, Audio-Technics, AKG, Sony, Graco, and a few others. I must give a tremendous thanks to the top three ranked in-depth positive reviews on this site for guiding me to this purchase that was a no-brainer in the end. These headphones are about half the size of my MDR-V600's when folded up and make that old pair sound like tin cans. These have bass, but nowhere near enough to please the kids that drive around with their fenders rattling. I listen to real music and no rap at all.

Since these would be traveling with me on a long trip, I first tested them on my Sony boom box hooked up to a flash drive containing all of the music that I would need. Granted, this is a low tech audio source, but that is one way to compare headphones, since faults of each set will be made much more obvious. Again, these MDR 7506 beat the pants off my old MDR-V600's and have a more authentic sound reproduction as well. The next step was to compare the two sets hooked up to my iPod Classic with the volume set to about 80% and the EQ set to ""Rock"". Again, it was no contest and these new ones win easily. I also did not have to adjust volumes for either pair. Then I got to thinking as to why I even need to bring that bulky boom box and flash drive, when the iPod Classic fits in the palm of my hand and can be charged up with my wall charger. The boom box is not what I consider to be portable, even though it takes batteries and I had only intended it to be used in my hotel room.

One other thing I remembered from reading all of these reviews is about how modern CD's are too compressed. I remember when I first started to rip my entire CD collection 8 years ago and asked another music nut about the bit rate. His advice was to use 128 kbps because very few ears could detect the 320 kbps ripped files that take up 2.5 times as much storage space. So with that in mind, I chose to rip one very long song (Awaken by Yes) at 320 kbps and compare it to my version that I previously ripped at 128 kbps. I tested both versions under each pair of my old and new Sony MDR headphones and I could not tell the difference. However, both versions detected a ""mistake"" left in during the first two minutes, which sounded like someone dropped a silver dime during recording it and they just could not remove it. Under regular speakers, this cannot be heard, but this shows how a great pair of headphones can let one hear things in a song that were never heard before. Again, I thank those highly ranked positive reviews for reminding me of this.

So what do I think about the few complaints on compression rates for MP3 files now? This is nothing more than a pathetic excuse to give bad reviews to new music releases and brag to fellow music fans that they have several thousand dollars worth of equipment. For studio work, the higher bit rate is probably needed, but for the average listener, 128 kbps should be sufficient. Some of those bad music reviews also tell me that some people are just too lazy to adjust the volume knobs.

Update on June 16, 2016: Oops, I forgot to mention comfort, so I tested them in my back yard this evening hooked up to my iPod Classic. Talk about concert sound that one can take with them anywhere and give the neighbors no reason whatsoever to call the police on you! I wore them for several hours and the only discomfort was from the bug bites under an approaching full moon. I wore protective clothing, but the little buggers still bit all over my hands. If that was my only discomfort, then these headphones feel like they are not even on your head. Incredible!!!! They also did not drain the battery of my iPod as I had initially feared. The cost of all the songs on this iPod make the cost of these GREAT headphones seem like nothing at all. As for outside sounds venturing in, only during very quiet passages in the long musical epics did I hear anything at all from my home AC unit. As for anyone being annoyed by sound leakage from these headphones, I seriously doubt it (just tell them to get a life!)"
259,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It would be difficult to overstate the impact that the Sony MDR7506 headphones have had on music production, broadcast, audio engineering, and consumer appreciation of ""reference level reproduction"". Indeed, the MDR7506 is the ""go to"" headphones for industry. Period. They are the original Xerox machines of photocopying, they are the Kleenex of facial tissue paper, they are the Listerine of mouthwashes, the Corn Flakes of breakfast cereal, the KDKA of AM radio stations. Often copied, rarely duplicated, the MDR7506 stand as testament to the idea that good design trumps all even in this day of breakneck technological innovation. Released some nearly 3 decades ago, they remain the industry standard.

Before I continuing, let's get old thing out of the way (if only because it seems to be repeated in so many headphone reviews and provides a point of context for a younger generation or two). Yes, these headphones sound better, are better built, last longer, and will give you a more enjoyable music listening experience than will ""Beats / Monster Beats / Apple Beats / Beats by Dre""...oh, and they cost much less.

To my own ears, the 7506 provides that ""motion thump"" that is necessary to bring modern pop, rock, EDM, and other bass-heavy genres come to life. It's not overly bass-y and certainly not distorting or loose. It's tight, rich without being too brassy, and balances the wide field into the highs naturally and with as flat a response as you're likely to hear without a laboratory.

As a synthesizer programmer, lifelong player, sound designer, and enthusiast, I always describe the 7506 this way: They are the only cans that can accurately reproduce an open cutoff saw or supersaw. Period. Everything else is relative to the 7506 cans. For those who aren't synth heads, let me put that in English: ""You hear EVERYTHING""... and in the proper ratios and levels. Good or bad, there's no kimono to lift with filters with these cans, the sound is naked and true. If you can't mix with these, then give up on mixing even with open air monitors, you'll never hear well enough to get your room acoustics right.

Yes. They're just that good."
260,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I love the look of these things, the design is timeless as far as I'm concerned. And I really like the 1/4"" adapter that screws on, it feels solid. The cable is of a very nice quality as well, it feels well-made without being too heavy.

However, these are some of the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever had. The pads are very ""hard"" on my ears, and they're pretty small, so they sit on top of them instead of going all the way over them. Combined with the pressure that it squeezes my head, it begins to hurt after a half hour. Then there's the band that goes over the top of your head: it's hard, has very little give to it, and overall feels terrible.

But after the comfort problems, sound quality is the biggest let-down here. The highs are very harsh, with vocals and certain types of music actually hurting my ears at even medium volume levels. Exaggerates sibilance and sounds a bit like listening through a tin can. The bass is almost non-existent, especially if you loosen the fit a little bit. The mids are rather decent, but that's about the only thing that I can say I enjoy about the sound."
261,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not generally someone with a lot of audio experience. I decided to buy a pair of these headphones because I started a podcast and I needed recording headphones to go with my Blue Yeti. They do work for this purpose-- they isolate sound. However, there is a sort of electronic buzzing that almost always seems to be there when I'm recording, when I'm listening to music, even when they're just plugged into my computer. I bought the first pair refurbished and I thought that the fact that they were refurbished was the problem, so I sent them back and brought a new pair. I tried plugging them into my laptop, and they're much better, but unfortunately they still have a little bit of white noise that you can hear when listening to music or audiobooks..

I'm not exactly sure what the issue is. I know these are supposed to be high quality recording headphones. I'm happy to get advice from those who know what they're doing because I'd love to love these headphones.

Otherwise, the headphones do ok as recording headphones. They fit nicely and are comfortable-- I have a small head so I find a lot of headphones to be uncomfortable. So if you're a podcaster, they'll work for their intended purpose, but you may need something else to listen to music."
262,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ooooooh boy. I mean, if you are interested in headphones and do not own these, you are in the wrong, my friend. It's as plain as that.

As a musician and general music nerd, I have pretty high standards, and I'm positive you can not do better for the money than these things. Not only that, but they're actually so good that while yes, you can do DIFFERENT, and you CAN do better, you can't do MUCH better. I can't remember the last time I was in a studio that did not have a pair of these sitting around for reference, and I've been in studios with some people who have worked on some pretty big things. Everyone in the industry knows them. That being said, they have a very specific sound profile. I am the kind of person who likes to explore different sound profiles in different pairs of headphones. I think generally speaking these will cater to a lot of people, but probably not everyone.

The pros:

-Very comfortable. Can wear these for pretty much all day without getting uncomfortable.
-Great, crisp sound that will allow you to hear intricacies especially in the upper mids
-Amazing price for the quality
-Will last you your entire life if you don't abuse them

The cons:

-Those foam pads will deteriorate with time. You'll need to replace them. I guess it depends on use, but in my case it took around 4-5 years (and the pads are a very cheap replacement). Actually, they'll deteriorate even if you do not use them.. just the name of the game. Not a huge deal.
-Because the sound is focused very much on mids, trebles, and generally higher frequencies, it can get a little fatiguing. I haven't had many issues with this, but if you are using these for a while and switch to another set of ""mellower"" headphones you will notice it.

As for the sound profile, as mentioned they're generally focused on higher frequencies, but the bass is still very tight and perfectly audible. I listen to literally every kind of music and they are applicable across the board, though certainly shine with rock music.

I own a bunch of nice headphones that I've paid more for than these, but if I had to own one pair I think these would be the ones (although my new Beyerdynamic DT 770s are giving them a run for their money). One pair to rule them all. Muahahahaha.

264,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? If your looking for quality sound at a affordable price, this is your best option. It's funny, I've had these for 5 years now and decided to try ""newer"" headphones to compare them to these and the differences are minimal if non existent. I tried the Bose, B&W, and Beats. The B&W were the closest, then the Bose. BUT were great but nothing worth the extra $, and the beats were trash (can't believe people spend so much money on junk). Reliability = 100% These are like the civic's or camry's of the car industry, they just keep working (and I'm rough on them!) Another awesome reason to buy these is that parts are replaceable. For example, about a year ago I had bent the jack by dropping my laptop on the floor landing on the jack that was plugged in (derp). But because Sony makes a replacement coil, I was able to easily install a new one! Anyways, I'm not going to go into technical detail with this review because there are several of those already, I'm only posting this to share with you good people the awesomeness of these headphones.

THE ONLY CON: The only con that everyone has already explained are the ear pads. Mine lasted about 4 years before starting to flake, now in there 5th year they are really looking sad. Though there is good news, Amazon sells Beyerdynamic replacement ear pads that won't deteriorate because of its hybrid construction, you can find them here: www.amazon.com/Beyerdynamic-EDT250V-Headphone-Pads-Black/dp/B0016MF7W2"
265,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband is a professional voice actor and as such, spends a lot of time with headphones on and recording in a tiny little booth. Comfortable, great sounding headphones are a must and for those in the recording industry, the MDR7506's are industry standard for a reason. These headphones do a great job of not bleeding through the sensitive microphone my husband uses. Bleeding click tracks are a huge problem in some studios, but the MDR7506's really keep the loud click noises away from the microphone. The pads go around your ears, which is a much more comfortable way of wearing the headphones than the ones that go on your ears. He gets headaches if they don't go around your ears. Also, the earpieces are a little bit tilted, which seems to give the headphones a really fantastic fit. The only complaint is that the cable is set up like a spring. That's nice for cable management, but it means there's a bit of pull if you need some length out of the cable. Other than that, these are fantastic!"

Highly Recommend!"
267,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because of all the great reviews. Any headphones are very subjective, but I found the highs very harsh and I found them not very balanced, lacking mids. I ended up with another pair that I liked better. Again it's subjective. The first pair I got sounded horrible. My recommendation is to try a few different headphones to test them out and choose the ones that sound best and work best for your needs. Also, my old Sony headphones were made in Japan, now they're made in Thailand, so I'm sure there are quality differences. The headphones are okay, so that is why I gave them 3 stars. I was hoping that I'd love them."
268,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The way music is meant to be heard. That line didn't resonate nor hold much meaning for me until I put these headphones on and listened to music at home for what felt like the first time in my life. No joke. I didn't know Bass had actual character to it. Before these headphones, Bass served as a heavy muddled effect to rule as overlord over the mids,highs,and lows. With these Sony headphones, Bass sounds like an actual live instrument complementing the musical gang as a family working hand in hand. Each instrument from vocals, to guitar, to bass and percussion have a vibrant LIVING element to them. I love the long stretchable cord as I have a habit of walking away from the computer too often on a short leash (ouch). These headphones are very comfortable with no audible sound bleeding unless someone is at kissing range (and even then it's very quiet). Perfect for the studio, watching movies, or listening to music at home or on the go. Nothing Can beat these headphones in this price range hands down. I can't believe it has taken me 32 years to finally be able to listen to music and not just hear it."
269,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Background: I got tired of all the mixed reviews of best “closed, around-ear” headphones fewer than $200, so I got 7 of the top recommended brands/models and decided for myself (luckily, they had a 15 – 30 day trial period). I needed a “closed” headphone so NO sound (for listening enjoyment only) could be heard by people around me. I’m somewhat of an audiophile and an ex-band director…so perfect sound is important to me (note: I listen to concert band, jazz, orchestral movie soundtracks, choral, classical, and even some pop/rock/country). My “control” for testing was music from my iTunes Library (apple Lossless files) on my laptop with advanced soundcard. I wanted to spend fewer than $200. Here are the following results:

1st place: Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. (score: 90/100 points) Pros –It does a variety of tasks really good with no real weakness at anything. It’s best for listening enjoyment…not professional studio monitoring as advertised. It has very warm sounding vocals, a balanced sound (with very slight favor to lower mid range & upper bass), and comfortable (loose) fit on my ears/head. It handles thick, polyphonic music passages with ease without distortion…while keeping the main melody/vocals volume and tone quality still cutting through with warmth. The sound feels like you’re in a very large professional concert hall! People with large heads will appreciate the fit of these comfortable headphones. Cons- Although you have the feel of being in a large concert hall, the distance to the stage seems a bit too far away…perhaps the 30th row. These headphones are the highest price of those tested (around $170…ouch… but, it comes with 3 different chords to the headphones/ and bag).

2nd Place: Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. (score: 88/100 points) Pros – Very balanced sound throughout the registers…no favors to any register!!! It can be used for both studio monitoring or listening enjoyment. The extra-deep bass extension can be “felt” during musical passages…nice. This Headphone has as a very “live” performance sound…like you’re on the 5th row during a concert. Best headphones for listening enjoyment under $100 (only $99!). Cons – The tone of melody/vocals sound a bit thin or “electric” at times during thick/polyphonic textures in musical passages…especially male tenors and trumpet/alto sax solos. Although you feel like you’re on the 5th row during a concert, it sounds like you’re in a small auditorium rather than a concert hall. Fit may a bit tiring after a long period (good clamping pressure).

3rd Place: Sony MDR-7506. (85/100points) Pros - These headphones must be the best at studio monitoring…or when you need to be critical and “dissect” music…every detail can be heard throughout every register (you can even hear faults in the recording you never wanted to hear before). The sound feels like you’re in a closed room with a live band)...not a performance concert hall/auditorium (there is a lack of reverb) good for recording professionals (and only $86!). Very clean and articulate at the “attacks” of instrument/vocal notes (not much sustain with these headphones) throughout all of the registers. Cons – Very bright sound…taxing to the ears after a while (Treble is very pronounced). Must use an equalizer to add bass/warmth to the sound for listening enjoyment...Yes it’s a pain, but then they do sound good after those adjustments.

4th Place: Bose SoundTrue, Around Ear. (80/100 points) Pros – These headphones have a good, balanced sound throughout the registers (Note: you will have to turn up the volume on these headphones). They are very comfortable and “light” on the head….you almost forget you have the headphones on. Cons – Sound is very “speaker” sounding...like you’re at a concert to hear your favorite band in the 50th row, but the stage is full of speakers playing CD recordings of your favorite band; therefore, there is just too much distance from you to the stage. Price is too much for this headphone ($150).

5th Place: Koss SP540. (75/100 points) Pros – These headphones are very cool looking, and somewhat comfortable (I have normal/smaller ears). The sound is not balanced…favors the bass/mids…good for rock/rap lovers. Mids and treble sounds have been somewhat muffled…so the bass and lower mids “boom” throughout your music. Cons – Feels like you’re sitting behind the band at a concert. Not worth the $150 price tag. Note: I have a Koss 35 Pro A and love the sound of these headphones (but they are half-open designed, not fully closed) and I hoped these sp540 models could compete…disappointed.

6th Place: JBL J88a. (68/100 points) Pros – These headphones are the most comfortable…no competition in this department! Bass is very heavy….rap/rock lovers will appreciate these headphones. Cons – The mids and trebles have been purposely muffled…almost non-existent...feels like you’re sitting behind the band during a concert (with cotton in your ears). Price is good ($99), but come on…try to have some balance throughout the registers.

7th place: Grado SR125. (65/100 points) Note: This is the headphone I’ve had for a couple years...and why I started a search for a better headphone. They are not what I needed because they are “open designed”…thus, people around you can hear them. Pros – Very crisp and clear mids and trebles…you can hear every detail. Comfortable fit. Cons – no bass what-so-ever…thus, bright and airy sound only. It feels like you’re sitting on the 75th row at a concert! These headphones are rather expensive (around $120 bucks when I bought them 2 years ago…$150 today)."
270,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have been the industry standard for audio recordists both film and television for decades and for a well deserved reason. They sound natural with out coloration. A clean rich full sound that's not basey or tinny. They fold up compactly and are versitle able to be used either with 1/4"" TRS or 3.5 headphone plugs. The only weak aspect to them is the rim or edge of the ear cusion - the vinyl cover - breaks up quickly and easily where in no time the vinyl coating flakes off and the cloth backing breaks apart. There are third party terry cloth covers sold for these though which extends the life of the ear pads. Otherwise, replacement earpads are fairly cheap and readily available. I currently own many sets and have owned many over the years. One thing to watch out for, like so many of the popular items out there the counterfeits are almost more plentiful than the authentics. Buying on Amazon is likely a more reliable source for the real ones made by SONY where as many on eBay are being sold are copies - certainly not all but many. Just be aware that there are fakes being advertised and the real deal sounds well like the real deal."
271,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was on the fence about whether or not I really needed these, as my Sennheiser 448's were still serving me amazingly. Then our kitten bit through the cable, so im like ok, its a sign. Clicked 'checkout' and so far have not been disappointed!
Recieved them and, just as a precaution, almost immediately turned on a super long video of ""pink noise"" on medium-low volume to try a burn-in. I made the mistake with my Sennheisers of just plugging them into my ipod and having the first song start off loud and with an abrupt snare crack, so that kinda hurt em right off the bat.
But connected to an ipod is where I feel other reviews on these babies kind of combine, i.e, the ""good, solid bass"" vs ""meticulously analyzing your music"". Leaving the EQ settings on 'rock' gives a great punchiness that people like to compare to say, Beats - except garunteed these Sony's handle it much better. Everything is clean and clear, with the soundscape of a great studio recording session - tight ambience with very present instruments. Switch the EQ to 'flat', and you really hear everything with an almost perfect balance - mids, highs and lows. The sound stage widens, but everything is still very nicely present. You lose the puncy bass, but in an ideal mix the bass shouldn't be overpowering anyway. In my opinion, the flat EQ on any device is definitely the optimal setting to get the full benefit of these headphones - save adding a little bass for movies.
The package warns that ""at higher listening levels, outside sounds may be reduced"". They weren't kidding! Listening at a mere comfortable level reduced my girlfriend to nothing but some distant resonance. Can't wait to try them out in the field or recording my drum covers! I feel like I'd have a much more solid playing session when able to hear a more dynamic mix of the other instruments. That being said, I keep listening to all my favorite songs through these, expecting to truely experience the music for the first time or rediscover it, as some have described. I'm not sure it's that big a jump. I mean from earbuds of anykind, I don't doubt that it is a new experience. But even if you've used any sort of high-end headphones, the difference in quality will be noticable, but not astronomical.

But I didnt just buy these to plug into an ipod. I'm a musician and intermediate-level film-maker and was looking for sound dampening headphones for recording audio as well. I unfortunately havent hsd a chance to try them out in either scenario yet, but i also havent had them very long. My only concern with them is when editing, that the flat sound will result in over-processing of the sound files dynamic range, resulting in way too much bass. I recently had my first film to be shown at a film festival and it sounded very much in the theater as it did on my Sennheisers that had higher highs and lower lows. I guess in a theater scenario, too much bass or high end isn't really a deal breaker, but it'll take some getting used to to edit with a flatter-sounding audio monitor. Which I guess in the end is really a good thing; because if they sound good through something virtually unprocessed, itll sound great on most anything!
In the end, a great buy and an all-around amazing set of headphones!"
272,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone who is very particular about the sound of my headphones, these are some of the best that Ive ever tried. These are studio headphones, designed for recording and production, meaning they have a very true, neutral sound. Most of the major, popular brands 'color' their headphones with extra bass, or a very high/low sound. This is unacceptable for the styles of music I enjoy. I listen to primarily mathcore/deathcore/djent and various other forms of eclectic metal. Most headphones muddle the sound of the complexity and do a piss poor job of playing vocals and any synth/keyboards.

If you listen to any music that has any form of complexity beyond mindless repetitive thumping, then take your Beats and throw them in the trash and buy these.

My one main complaint over previous models of this headphone by Sony, is the exposed wires coming from either side, as you can see in the picture. These wires are very thin, and easy to pull out. Very easy to snag a finger or something into the small loop, and boom, ruined. Of course, they were designed for studios, not working out, like I was using them for. So be mindful of what you intend on using them for.

They are light, have a good snug yet comfortable fit, and for under 100 bucks, they're really hard to beat."
273,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a fairly nice Yamaha Clavinova CLP-430 digital piano. So many things to love about this instrument; the sound quality of the built-in speakers is NOT one of them, which was a big disappointment to me when I purchased the instrument. The point of a high-end digital like the Clavinova is that the quality of its sound recording should sound very close to an acoustic piano, but the built-in speakers make it sound tinny and fake--it sounds like the digital it actually is. I really wanted a nice set of headphones that would allow me to truly hear the professional sound of the instrument the way it was meant to be heard - clear trebles, rich bass, etc. I chose this set after reading many reviews and felt it would best fit my needs - it did. Thanks to these headphones, my piano sounds so much like an acoustic, you can barely tell the difference. This product really allows me to enjoy my instrument, so that made me pretty happy.

This set is very, VERY comfortable. I have a rather big head and it fits snugly without being too tight. It never gives me a headache. The pads are soft and large enough to cover my ears easily-actually, they will cover my ears and a smallish set of drop earrings, too. The cord is pretty long, so it doesn't get in my way when I play, which is very important. The cord is also weighty enough that gravity prevents it from bouncing around while you are moving, while not so heavy that it would drag the headphones down. The set folds up neatly and easily, so it is easy to fit in a suitcase and not worry overmuch about it being broken during transit. The set also comes with a 1/4"" jack. I found the price to be reasonable for the very good quality of the product.

It does not have noise-canceling technology, but does a good job blocking out sound, which is so wonderful because it lets me concentrate on playing without being distracted by all the other things constantly going on in the house. I don't listen to any other music with it, but I imagine it would be similarly useful if you want to listen to music without being disturbed. I have a very loud window-unit air conditioner in the same room as my piano, but I can barely hear it with the headphones on. I also don't hear my roommate watching TV or talking on the phone in the next room. If something blew up or someone was screaming bloody murder in the next room, I would be able to hear that and respond to an emergency; otherwise, I don't hear much in the way of external noise.

Would I purchase again? Yes, if mine were worn out, I would happily replace them with the same product.
Would I recommend to a friend? Yes.
Did I receive a promotional credit on this item? No."
275,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny. The clarity is absolutley amazing!! Seriously crazy good sound. Highly recommend buying the wicked cushions ear pads too. Makes these headphones over the top comfortable!!! Also if using with a samsung note 5 you will need the fospower 3.5mm female to 3.5mm male adapter to work. The headphones come with a 3 pole (2 ring/TRS) jack. The samsung note 5 only recognizes the 4 pole (3 ring/TRRS). I tried plugging them directly in and they didn't work at all. Plugged in with adapter works awesome!! On my daighters iphone 6 it plugged straight in and worked without an adpater. Hope that info helps someone.
276,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I think these are pretty decent. I doubt very much that the response really is as flat as people claim though. They are VERY bright-sounding. That being said, these are designed to be used as studio monitors, not ""hi-fi"" headphones, and in their intended use (to monitor sound) they do a decent job. I find the sound too bright and fatiguing for use as ""hi-fi"" headphones though. My old Sennheisers are much better suited to that job, but then again they cost about 5 times the price of the Sony MDR-7506. These are 100 times better than the ""other"" studio favourite (the Beyer DT100) which are also supposed to be flat-response but instead just sound absolutely horrendous in every respect! The fragile material used on the earpads is a strange choice for a model which is supposed to stand up to professional use too.
But, overall, for the money, they're pretty decent. I doubt they can be beaten at this price level."
277,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to replace a pair of Bose QC15 headphones that stopped working out of the blue. Bose seemed completely uninterested in fixing them and I'm not about to hand them another $300 for new headphones. These are a lot cheaper so I decided to give them a try. Overall I prefer them to the ones they replaced.

Pros: Sound quality is a lot better with these, largely thanks to a better low-end response. They're a lot more comfortable to wear all day. There's no active noise cancelling, but once they're over your ears they kind of naturally seal out all sound anyway. No noise bleed at regular listening levels.

Cons: The cord is really heavy and non-removable, so it can take some time to get used to the lopsided feeling. I would have liked to unplug it and replace it with a smaller lighter one. Also, these are somewhat collapsible but not in a way that feels secure or makes them safe for stuffing in a bag like the QC25 did."
278,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After 35 years of marriage, the wife wants my vintage floor standing speakers gone. Happy wife...you know the saying. So I remember how back in the day when I lived for music, even though I had these great speakers, I could never wait to put any new music through my headphones. This was my answer! Research the heck out of everything in my budget and settled on 225i Grados. After almost a year with them I'm listening less and enjoying music less than ever. Then I realize I'm just not crazy about the sound. Not wanting to spend an arm and leg to find out, and seeing how the Sony's were in contention in the first place, why not? I could always return them.
Not in your life!! THIS is what I was missing! I seriously cannot believe how these just trounced the Grados. I pulled out my best recorded cd, went back and forth between the phones. The Sony's were clear, concise, alive. I can only describe the Grado's as muddy.....sounds blending into one another. I never would have noticed it without hearing the Sony's.
If you love the sounds, there is no reason to get anything else or pay more. I paid almost 3 times the cost of the Sony for the 225i Grados, and it's not even close. Not even."
279,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these primarily for PC gaming, which usually includes listening to music. They sound as good as headphones can probably sound. Never been impressed with headphone sound quality compared to the effect real speakers have. I have them plugged into the 1/4"" headphone jack on my Onkyo TX-SR70 receiver, which receives audio from my PC via optical cable. I like my bass to have more kick and ""oomph"" to it so I used an EQ/preamp software to adjust accordingly. These headphones are capable of producing a satisfying amount/volume of low end bass, without much distortion. And as some reviewers have noted, they have excellent ""punch"" with transients. An old song I had listened to many times suddenly surprised me with a sudden bass impact I never heard before. (Keep in mind I'm using a preamp to improve dynamic range, the only thing holding me back before was my inferior headphones..so don't expect this just plugging them into an ""ipod"".)

The one thing I appreciate the most is the cord. My old cheap headphones ($30) have the typical straight cord, which is constantly finding its way into the crevices of my chair's caster wheels. The coiled cord with these is just the right length too, so that they reach my bed while sleeping at night.

These headphones do a decent job at reducing external noise. Previously I had ""on ear"" headphones which pretty much acted like open back headphones, so that there was no sound isolation, and everyone could easily hear what I was listening to. The closed back design also has the added bonus of improving sound isolation the greater the SPL. Which is great for me, so that I don't have to hear my loud roommate. The only caveat is that when you take the headphones off while playing loud music/sound, they're basically like small speakers and can be heard through walls/doors, or anyone nearby.

The frequency response definitely sounds flat, which makes a lot of songs sound rather lifeless. Which is exactly how headphones should be- neutral and accurate. I like my bass to have a more dramatic sound with greater impact, so in order to make songs come ""alive"" I had to use a preamp and precise EQ adjustments."
280,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this to listen to music from my computer. The cord is nice and long and coiled, so it doesn't get in the way but lets me move around. The sound is good. My only issue was that the ear cups weren't super comfortable. The padding is too thin, so it pressed against my ears rather than cupping my ears. I ended up getting a pair of Brainwavz Replacement Memory Foam Earpads for another $20 which made these headphones much more comfortable"
281,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waffled back and forth about whether to order these. Added them to my cart, deleted them, added them, deleted them and then finally decided to pull the trigger and WOW, I'm glad I did !! These are spectacular !!!

Design/Comfort: 4 out of 5 stars---The MDR7506 headphone have a very basic, non-assuming, and somewhat retro look to them but don't let that stop you from ordering them. The clamping force is perfect. Not to tight, not to loose. Just right. They are very comfortable. I can barely feel them on my head. The earcups are comfortable but do not completely cover your ears. They are about the same size as my ears and feel like a large, on ear style. This is the only bad thing I would say about the design/comfort but its really not bad. They are very comfortable, they just don't completely engulf your ears like most traditional circumaural headphones. These are closed back headphones with minimal leakage.

Build quality: 4 out of 5 stars--Construction is of plastic and metal. The earcups are plastic but feel very sturdy. The headband is metal (or at least the adjusting band is). There is no padding on the top of the headband but don't be concerned by this because the headband only makes an ever so slight contact with the top of your head and is very comfortable. The earcups have some play in them to allow for a perfect seal but they do not rotate to lie flat. They fold up into the headband for carrying and the headphones can get very small when folded to make them very portable. Overall, the MDR7506 feels very sturdy and I expect it will last for years.

Sound quality: 5 out of 5 stars --It is no wonder that the MDR7506 (and its older brother, the MDR-V6) is the industry standard for monitoring/reference headphones in the recording industry. This fact, in itself, should tell you all you need to know. But, if you want to know about how they sound, the best word I can use is B-A-L-A-N-C-E-D. This is a very neutral pair of headphones. Lows are very tight and warm but do not bleed over into the mids. Mids are very crisp and right where they should be, Not to forward and not diminished by the lows. Vocals (which reside in the mid range) are as near perfect as I think you will find. And finally, the highs are pristine. No fatigue in the highs and no simbilance. There is absolutely no harshness to the highs. Highs arrive right on time and in the correct balance to the rest of the spectrum. Despite the closed back, the soundstage is excellent and sounds much larger than most closed back headphones.

What these phones are not:
--They are not a fashion statement.
--They do not have overpaid celebrity endorsements behind them.
--They are not colored headphones with overbloated, muddy bass. (if you are a basshead, its probably best that you move on)

However, let me give you a WARNING:
These are a suburbly accurate pair of headphones that are very revealing and unforgiving. Don't blame the headphones if the audio you are listening to doesn't sound good. If the song sounds bad, it is most likely a POOR recording. A bad quality recording will still sound bad with these headphones and will probably sound even worse than it does thru your apple ibuds. These headphones accurately reproduce the sound given them. A very high quality recording will sound spectacular, a bad quality recording will sound like crap. Upgrade your quality of recordings before you blame the headphones.

Now for the cons, which are minimal:
1) The cord is coiled, non-detachable and it is heavy. This may be a distraction to some and it makes them a little inconvenient to carry around. I would like to see Sony offer them with a detachable cord that could be swapped out for a straight cable.
2) The earcups are not as big as traditional circumaural headphones. If it would not change the sound quality, I would like to have a little larger earcups that completely cover my ears.
3) There are wires that are exposed on either side of the earcups. Not really a big deal but by being exposed like they are, I would think that they would be prone to getting snagged on things which may cause damage to the headphones.
4) The earcups do not rotate to lie flat. May not be a deal breaker for most folks but would be a nice feature.
5) From what I understand, the ear cushions wear quickly and need replacing frequently. Would like to see the ear cushions made of a little more durable materials."
282,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Outstanding DJ and studio headphones. I have only ever owned these and AKG k240's, also awesome, but tried and used many others. The AKG's are incredibly comfortable, as they have much bigger earcups and a suspension system. The Sony's can be stretched to make them more comfortable (The very top band can be firmly stretched wider, worked for me), but there is no comparison comfortwise,the AKGs are like pillows. For 4 hour DJ gigs, these Sony's are comfortable enough. For long studio sessions, I go with the AKG's, especially when I'm tracking instruments (I play guitar, bass and sing as well), I forget I'm wearing them. As for audio quality, the Sony's have more presence and tighter response (i.e. mids and highs), the AKG's are a little less detailed- that doesn't mean the Sony's sound thin though, not at all, they seem equal in low frequency response to me. If I had to say which was more ""accurate"" I'd say the Sony's due to the extra crispness and detail (seems like a flatter frequency response overall to me), but that's pretty subjective, unless people are going to listen to your music on the same speakers or headphones you created it on, there will be ""inaccuracy."" Hence my desire not to go too crazy with my work headphones, I've never spent over $100. I would only go more expensive for pleasure headphones, with noise cancelling, etc. The main thing is, learn what your headphones/speakers sound like, and mix accordingly. The Sony's have a closed design, so they're well suited to DJing, but I still need an external amp to boost the signal in a cranking DJ setting (I always use earplugs too, which fit in these cans no problem. In-ear monitoring is honestly better, but the problem is people keep bugging you when you're DJing with in-ears, when you use headphones it's easier to ignore people interrupting you since they can see you're working). I use a Topping NX1 portable headphone amp, again not ""obsessive audiophile approved"" but very good value. If you're looking for absurd comfort and good sound, go with AKG k240's, they're the same price, at least the older gold AKG's. If you want tightest response and closed headphones, go with the Sony's. Can't really mess up too badly either way."
283,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these based on numbers -- of buyers and reviews. 4,000. One 5 star review was detailed and professional and stated that the quality was closer to a $300.00 pair of phones. I think this is right. The sound is great and you feel like you are there in person. The one downside was a bit less dynamic bass. I corrected this by adding an inexpensive little boomcloud 360 amp and this makes it perfect --- with a choice, use it or not.
After a few hours, these are not as comfortable as Sennheiser 414 - but the reality of being there makes it worth it. Great deal for the money."
284,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This particular purchase was made as a gift but I have used this model of Sony Headphone for years in professional recording studio environments. The quality of these phones is high so they last a long time. presuming you don't just downright abuse them. I use them for studio work because Sound quality is predictable, consistent, and beyond compare. Great reproduction across the frequency spectrum and clarity that lets me focus on the details. Now please don't interpret this review to think I don't use anything else... I do. I have a few different models of phones that I use professionally. But, I will say that I will continue to use the SONY MDR7506s for as long as they continue to make them. They are a solid, standard, and consistent tool in all our studio environments!"
286,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife got these for my birthday. I did a lot of research and came to the conclusion these would be the best for the price.

Needless to say i am not dissappointed. I listen to a lot of Trance and house music sometimes techno and the crystal clear audio with the lows mids and highs sounds like listening to a higher quality track of music, however i am using premium streaming at 320k mp3. I have also tested lossless codecs and the sound is beautiful.

Bass is pretty heavy on my unit. Some people are reporting no bass but i can hear the low and high bass pretty well and it definitely has a hard boom to it however it seems this is more apparent where the artist intended it and not artificial like equalizer settings.

Older or lower quality songs you can hear sometimes the dirtyness of the track and the white noise in background but equalizing eliminates it.

Mozart and symphony sound very nice on these.

The headset is light and portable, long cord is nice as i use these at work, only complaint is the earpads can get fatiguing after a while that i do need to take a break after 2 hours or so but otherwise i even use these when laying down in bed. Quality of materials is strong and pretty flexible. Cable is nice and thick, gold strong headjack that is also thick.

I feel very satisfied and happy with these and they do work with my android lg flex 2 as well as my ipad 2. I dont know if each unit is hit or miss but i definitely got a hit on this one."
287,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They Sound amazing. I prefer these over the mx50's Audio Technica which I returned. The technica's had more bass but they hurt my ears and made them hot. The bass was overwhelming for the music I listen to. The bass covered up guitar parts and synth parts.

These sounds great on the high end and mid range. Plenty loud, great for playing guitar with.

I played my guitar through the focusrite using the audio technica's mx50 and it sounded like poop. The headphones sound cool for listening to music in general. In fact I'd say they sound ""cooler"" than these. But again, if you want to get technical and really learn the sounds of guitars and amps that's being used in songs - these headphones are better for getting source sound from the guitars.

I have a SMALL head and these hurt... I'll sadly be returning these - going to try AKG. They seemed looser and with open backs. Might be better for guitar."
288,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very pleased with these earphones except the ear cups are too small. By the 2nd or 3rd day my ears started screaming when they saw this coming. I tried earphone pad replacements but couldn't stand the smell so I'm back to the pleather, which can be hot and sweaty in my humid climate. I finally bent the head bar to widen it so the pressure would not be so tight and wear it far forward, toward my forehead so the tops of my ears are not being pressed down and only the lobes get squashed. I'm female and small boned. I do not have big ears. I can't imagine how big guys could get their ears totally inside these ear cups.

The cord length is perfect for using with my laptop in bed but it stretches enough if I need to move to say, answer the phone.

I do wish the cord was replaceable. I don't like anything that makes a product potentially obsolete when just a little extra would allow for repair instead of replacement.

Yeah, those are a few negatives. But overall the sound quality is excellent. When the cord wears out I will probably try something different but if the sound quality of other brands is not equal to this I would buy them again."

They're comfortable enough, but the plastic on the earpads gets sweaty after a while. Similar products usually start flaking off quickly. I bought a pair of replacement pads that have a soft suede feel to them and are much more comfortable.

Other downside is the cord. For their nominally intended market (professionals in studios) it's probably great. And for sitting at my desk it's fine. But I'd like to use them while walking around - and for that the cord is a bit much. A detachable cord would be a big improvement."
290,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the standard bearing headphones of the industry they said..

So I think 10 stars would be better to show the proper ratio. I would have given it a 9 if that were the case. However we have 5 stars so ill give it a 4.5.

Sound:
They sound very nice. Wonderfully balanced, good response across the entire sound spectrum. I am able to hear things in my albums that I had missed before. I am coming from a Bose QC15 because they finally wore out and the sound quality of the Sony's compared to the Bose are far better than the Bose. Of couse these are two different animals to compare to one another but its what I used.

Build:
Quality seems quite nice. Very light weight which was surprising. Seems like it will hold up well.

Comfort: This is where it fals a little short for me. The ear cups are not deep enough and my ears begin to hurt after wearing them for a little while. Problem is solved by purchasing a deeper ear seal which is available out there but not on Amazon. I cant understand why the ear seals are so slim, they certainly shouldn't effect the sound quality."
291,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is easy to see why these are one of the standards when it comes to audio engineering. Detailed, uncolored sound, unlike most consumer-grade headphones. They aren't available in 16 colors. They probably aren't on display next to the broken red, blue, or plaid cans at the local electronics store. No, these are professional headphones.

If anything breaks (unlikely, but possible), the exploded parts diagram makes repair rather easy. This is also useful for disassembly. The pair I received had a bead of solder that rattled when I moved my head behind the left driver. I removed the small, metallic ball instead of sending them back to Sony under their ninety day warranty. If I had to complain about something, it would be the short Sony warranty. I know, it is probably never used on the MDR-7506, but a company with a professional product line should not, in my opinion, offer the same warranty that covers the $10 earbuds. I can only half-fault them for the solder, as they showed me how to take them apart. No Internet guide required. After all, the initial model (MDR-V6) was released in 1985, 9 years before Amazon and most of the Internet."
292,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love these headphones. I had been using an old pair of cheap AKG's that I got as a free bonus with a purchase a decade ago and wanted to upgrade to a better pair of headphones for recording vocals. I got these based on the reviews. I absolutely love their construction and how they are put together. Nice strong feeling hinges, comfortable and they fold up really nicely. I just didn't like the frequency curve on them. The mids and mid-highs seemed too pronounced for me. I used a couple of different sources to make sure that wasn't the issue. Walked away and came back later to try again to make sure I wasn't just hearing things weird. Nope, just didn't like their sound. Please remember that sound is totally subjective and they just didn't suit me. You may feel otherwise. If I can find a pair of headphone built like these but with a sound curve that suits me better that would be perfect!"
293,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are THE classic recording studio headphones - I hope they keep making them forever! Just be aware that they might not be the best for simply listening to music. The stereo field is very wide which helps some music but hurts other - in some recordings in can tend to bring the right and left (usually instrument tracks) to for forefront and push the center (usually vocals) to the back. In others it brings a clarity I'd never heard before - one was the Broadway version of My Fair Lady with Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews - I started to listen a bit just to sample it with these headphones and wound up listening to the whole album. Who knew they could record with such high fidelity back then?

Another thing to remember is that the purpose of the ear cups is not to exclude outside noise, but to prevent the sound from the headset from leaking back into the microphone. They are not noise canceling.

I use these for sound recording including a lot of overdubbing and couldn't be more pleased!"
294,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really great sounding headphones for the price. I've owned various Sony headphones in the past (mostly the cheaper $20.00+ versions) and they were always decent sounding. So when I was looking for a more affordable replacement for my old Audio Technica ATH-M50X headphones, these stood out to me. I'm glad I got them because they're almost as good the M50Xs. They're very clear with distinct highs and mid ranges. Bass is alright, they don't sound like you have subwoofers strapped to your ears (I like my bass to really BOOM) but it's ok. I would give these an 8.5 out of 10 on the sound scale.

And the packaging...Sony really went all out with it! Dat satin cloth packing--I've never seen headphones packaged that way. And I know most people don't really care for or pay attention to packaging design but I really dig the almost retro look of it. It really goes with the look of the headphones."
295,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm no professional nothing, but these are the real deal. Over the ear, nice comfy cups, good solid rubber coil connection. I'm not paying $300 for Beats or similar headphones. I've read a couple reviews wishing they were louder and I actually agree. Don't get me wrong, they are plenty loud but when I'm listening to some kick ass rock and roll late at night, I want volume!

Update - I got a good deal on the Beats Solo 2 wireless headphones and bought them. Just for the heck of it. The sound was just as good as my Sony pair but they were ""on ear"" as opposed to my Sonys ""over ear."" Even though the Beats are a class act unto themselves, they were uncomfortable on my ears after only a few minutes. The wireless aspect was nice, but I'll take this Sony pair over the on ear Beats any day. And the Sonys cost about a third of the Beats. I will buy these again when my original pair wear out. I ended up returning the Beats."
297,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are familiar with and liked the Sony V6s and if you ever used the Sony 7509s, you'll love these phones. (These were the replacements for the venerable V6s with the new 75XX designation). These are portable-friendly like the V6s, light and foldable and they have the studio sound of the 7509s. For those who have never listened to either phones, the V6s were considered the sleepers of their day and the 7509s remain studio standards, rivaling the Beyer Dynamic DT770s. Sony sold a plethora of all three of these phones.

They are clear, articulate, flat and true. No artificial fluff, no emphasis, just musical and easy to drive with their 60 ohm impedance. I have the 7509s in my studio and I had the V6s which I used with my portable set up for years. Unfortunately, they bit the dust and I couldn't wait to get these. Made in Taiwan for Sony and they are solid.

In full disclosure, there was criticism of the V6s for being a tad bright but note that this criticism came with the advent of CD. With cassettes, they were the 'bomb'. Sony corrected that with these phones, hence the 7506 designation.

For the money, they can't be beat in my opinion and the sales and review numbers appear to bear this out."
298,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The MDR-7506's where introduced in 1991 for the professional audio market. They are the slightly upgraded cousin to the MDR-V6 which was introduced 1985. They have gold jacks and use a different driver that some believe is ""more closely matched"" to each other. Take that as you will.

The MDR7506s are universal thought of as the standard in audio monitors with a very flat curve and highly detailed sound.

I bought this as a replacement to my Klipsch Image One generation 1 when it became apparent that the Gen 2 versions of that series were something of a downgrade.

The differences in the two are very apparent and what you might choose honestly depends on how you want to listen. The MDR doesn't have a ""punched up"" bass like most modern headphones do; so with bass heavy tracks, they might sound lacking.

On closer inspection, I noticed that the klips use a very punchy and fluid bass line and very warm vocal range to make them sound pleasing, and don't get me wrong, they do, but you lose detail.

And the devil is in the details. The MDR's are the industry standard because you actually hear more. Modern music, in many cases that are mixed for autotuned vocals and bass bass and more bass might not sound as ""pleasing"" as it would on a different set of cans, but on older tracks, properly mixed modern tracks, and classical music, the MDRs really shine.

It really just depends on what you are looking for. Some headphones are really ""cramped"" - no highs, no lows, must be bose, some go for a ""pleasing"" sound, and some like the MDR's go for a nice, flat, detailed sound.

Really these are from a era where Sony was the name by which all consumer electronics were judged. Trinitron may have left us, but the MDR7506s have stood the test of time and will be with us for the foreseeable future. If it isn't broke, don't fix it."
299,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using professional grade headphones for a few years now even though at the time I wasn't making music or anything of the sorts. As a person familiar with professional headphones I can say that the level of sound you hear with these vs non-professional headphones of a similar design is unmatched. My previous headphones reached their limits and began messing up really bad so I wanted to try Sony's MDR-7506 since the really good reviews on it wasn't generic and very informative. When I first got these headphones they gave me a slight headache due to the heightened amount of new sounds I could hear from them compared to my old headphones which were more expensive than these. After about a day or two I adjusted to the new sound quality I could hear with these and ever since I have been loving it. Making music or listening to music while drawing with my tablet has never felt so great as it does now, but don't be discouraged by the price. These headphones are relatively cheap in comparison to some of the more expensive options out there, but they contain much more sound quality than the competitor brands. The MDR-7506 is very comfortable and can adjust to fit anyone from kids, teens, and adults however I don't recommend something this powerful for kids since they tend to be a little careless with listening volumes.

The uses of the MDR-7506 is more than likely for professional sound recording, but I use it for everything including sound recording now. Playing games on the PS Vita and 3DS also sound amazing with these headphones and watching movies on the computer or TV via aux is really nice. There are some about $10 to $20 cheaper, but they won't compare to the sound quality you get with these. This is the best price you will find for headphones of this caliber."
300,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't really owned a lot of headphones, and certainly not any studio-quality headphones, but let me just say that I was amazed at how comfortable these things are - they're easily the most comfortable headphones that have ever been on over my ears, which I'm sure will end up saving me from a lot of discomfort. As for the sound: It's very crisp and clear, and compared to ordinary cheap headphones they give you a much better sense of the location of each instrument in the mix -- which is great because I bought these to get started in music production. My ears almost felt a tiny bit disappointed by the lack of bass, though; It sounds a bit flat and quiet compared to what I was expecting... Perhaps that may actually be a good thing in the case of audio production and mastering, since it provides a bit of added clarity. Overall, the whole thing feels and sounds pretty darn good for something in this price range. If you're just looking for a pair of casual listening headphones then you don't really need these... But if you're trying to do some high-end recording or mixing on a budget, then these are a great deal - if you want better, you're gonna have to pay more."
301,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Classic tracking and mixing headphones in recording studios for as long as I can remember. I started my studio in 1999 and still have my first pair of these that I use for tracking. I just bought a new pair to go along with the 8 sets in the studio. You can't beet these for realistic representation of what is recorded. They also are very quiet while recording so you don't get bleed noise from the headphones making racket while musicians are tracking vocals, which is a common problem with some headphones. These are comfortable and quiet...and very affordable for a professional product."
302,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Clean sound with perfect amount of bass and highs. Best sounding headphones I've purchased so far. They will bring out any flaws on your vinyl or turntable but they also pass on an amazing amount of information. Cliche I know, but I really did pick out missed items on old vinyl such as: Grand Funk, Some kind of Wonderful, backing vocals never heard before with some soft ""can I get a witness....can I get witness..yeah yeah"" Three Dog Night, Never been to Spain, the opening bass is crazy defined and punchy, clear and picked up amazing detail. These are flat sounding but the best soundstage of any headphones so far. Vocals are clearly defined without being harsh, you can visualize individuals singing on a stage or studio, each voice is distinct. Haven't heard it this clear even with a pair of $3000 tube amps and some $7000 pair speakers. Only place I've heard it this distinct is if I was playing live myself and through our own monitors. If you play guitar/bass and sing, it's that clarity.

Ran them for a few albums and very impressed. Linda Ronstadt Used a Denon & Onkyo receivers in Direct mode. Bass exceptional although some claim it's too flat, I think it's perfect, never muddy.

Cons: Although it's very flat response, I think there's a peak in the midrange. Running through EQ section I was able to bump up bass just one notch and it then seemed perfect. Could be just my hearing; everyone is different."
303,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Almost 10 years I had on a very good pair of headphones before the right side gave out. Looking at the options and knowing I did not need the very, very best since my ears have degraded with time, I started with the cheapest. Let's just say I quickly elevated my search and hit upon the Sony MDR7506. For me it fit all my requirements and then some. Yes, they do get warm with extended listening, but then I also experienced that with my previous headphones. What I do find is these headphones keep out more noise. Also, I was tricked into taking the headphones off to hear absolute silence when I thought I heard dogs barking. It was in the recording I was listening too! Technology has given me an excellent choice while $40 less than what I had spent on my older pair. I am happy with the Sony MDR7506."
304,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There was a time when Sony could use the power of their brand name to gouge consumers (they were the Beats of the 80s), but those days are long gone. Sony is still hovering around the top of the heap in quality-control, but they no longer command a premium pricing structure, and as a result their pro-grade headphones represent a great mix of quality and affordability. These headphones are both comfortable and solidly made. I personally hate the extra loops of speaker-wire extruding from the intersection of the headband and earpieces, but that's unfortunately not uncommon with monitor headphones.

As for sound quality, MDRs represent a step up from anything else in the price bracket. Keep in mind that these are not intended to be used for everyday listening at the gym etc. If you want a pair of consumer headphones that will bump up the bass and scoop the mids, grab a pair of Beats (if you're made of money) or stick with Shure/Bose. But if you need to have access to all the sonic colors in a mix--a flat EQ with plenty of character and warmth--these are going to fit the bill.

One star deducted for those ugly, clumsy loops of wire."
305,4.0 out of 5 stars,While I tend to look for higher end (higher priced) audiophile stuff for my listening needs I decided to measure the reviews and order this Sony set of cans. Quick delivery...actually same day! These did live up to their other reviews. Very well balanced. Very comfortable. Very nice listening. Whether they need a break in period or not these are very nice cans for the money. The loudspeakers I currently use in my system actually deliver better sound...but when there's a conflict of listening sources in our home these phones will solve the problem. I've used more expensive cans in the past which were marginally better in terms of presentation but also cost much more. I don't need to impress anyone...just want to enjoy my music...and these cans will work well for that.
306,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the earlier version of this headset, for my husband, about 1988 or so. Yes, I honestly did and they have lasted all those years, until this year. I know, almost 30 years and they were still working? Yes, they were, that is how well Sony makes their products. One of the wires broke on the headset and my husband could no longer hear anything out of the right side. I could not find any where to repair this issue, either.

So, I went on Amazon, thank you Amazon for having great products for your customers!!! I found the same kind of Sony Headset that I have gotten my Husband about 30 years ago. It is comfortable to wear, has a 9.8 foot cord to connect to your A/V receiver or TV and plays excellent Bass when listening to music on your Stereo/Surround Sound unit and TV. My husband is one happy camper. He can't believe how good the sounds are, in the headset. He is blown away by the Bass sounds. Plus, when he has them on. . .He can NOT hear anything else, including me. LOL

I highly recommend this headset. It has all that you need to get great sound, it truly is noise-cancelling and it is a Sony who makes wonderful equipment for the Audiophile. Sony also has an excellent reputation for producing excellent products, to sell to consumers."
308,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing, especially for the price. These headphones were introduced in 1991, so surely something in this price range has come along that is better, right? What I found, nope. These are still the king. I researched several headphones before making this purchase. I narrowed it down to these (Sony MDR-7506) and the Audio Technica ATH-M50, which at the time of this review, were $50 more than the 7506. I had seen both headphones recommended numerous times. Luckily for me, 2 co-workers had the 7506 and the M5's, so I was able to AB test both.

I listened to a variety of music on each pair. Here's what I found:

Sound:
• Treble - The 7506 is a fairly bright headphone. It does tend to push the highs a tad, but I didn't mind it. I didn't find it painful to listen to, even after an extended period, and I liked the detail that it brought out in some songs. The M50 did not seem to push the highs as much, but to me, it felt a little bit more restrained and almost muffled sounding compared to the 7506. Not bad, just not as ""airy"". Overall, I preferred the 7506

• Mid-range - Both headphones did well in the mid-range, but I thought the 7506 was overall more clear.

• Bass - This is where I thought the M50 would win hands down. After many reviews that I read, I expected the 7506 to really get trounced here. This was definitely not the case. It could be just my tastes in sound, but the 7506 had very tight, detailed bass. The M50 had slightly stronger bass, but not quite as detailed as the 7506. I would guess, like many things audio, this will be largely subjective on which you prefer. I did not find that the 7506 was lacking at all in bass, though.

• Comfort - This was probably the biggest plus for the 7506 vs the M50. The M50 felt much heavier to me and squeezed my head a lot more than the 7506. The 7506 were light and much more comfortable. Complete win for the 7506. The pair I tried had the Velour ear pads, which may have helped with this. I highly recommend those as well. You can find them here: http://www.amazon.com/Beyerdynamic-Velour-Earcushions-MDR7506-Headphones/dp/B0016MF7W2

• Price - Even with the upgraded ear pads, the 7506 came in over $30 cheaper. Win for the 7506 here.

• Build quality and durability - Both sets of headphones seemed very well built and durable. I don't see any immediate issues with either pair. I've heard many people with 7506 that have owned them for 10-20 years with no issues except for needing to replace the ear pads. I also read numerous people with M50s since they launched (5 years ago) with no issues either.

Conclusion:
Not surprisingly, I ended up purchasing the 7506. They were cheaper and I liked them better all-around. I'm sure there are other people that would do the same AB test and prefer the M50, so your mileage may vary. I actually ended up purchasing 2 sets so I could have a set at work and a set at home. Highly recommend these headphones and get the Velour pads as well as they are a very worthwhile upgrade."
309,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an audio/video professional, and for the money these are awesome. They're not quite as good as the Sony 7520's costing about 4x more, but they're a great buy for the $. I've used Sony headphones for decades in my work... they're rock solid. I can't speak to how long they'll last yet, but I'm still using another pair that's over 15 years old, so we'll see...

That being said, I do feel that in many other product areas Sony has really gone downhill. And their customer service is godawful."
310,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best! I have tried so many others but found these to be clearly superior. I like to listen to theater organ music whether on CD or over the internet. This is a very difficult instrument to record and to reproduce accurately whether over speakers or using headphones. There are so many layers of sound all coming at you at once. The base is deep but subtle with a lot of differing textures instead the the loud dead thud heard in so many other genres of music. These headphones right out of the box do the best job of faithfully reproducing all of the above of any that I have tried or unfortunately purchased. They should do even better after burning in.

Listening to a live performance of a pipe organ, one is impressed by the ""airiness"" that only an organ has. It has to do with the sound being produced by wind and by the acoustics of the building in which it is housed. These headphones do an excellent job or reproducing that as well. I don't get that feeling of having something plugged in my ear or even listening to headphones. That was an unexpected bonus.

I had tried to get by with headphones in the $30-40 range but the learned the hard way that he who buys cheap, buys again. I am aware of the fragile leather ear cups from other reviews, so I will treat these gently because these are so comfortable."
311,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair and I bought another pair a couple of weeks after.

Coming from a pair of Grado SR-80i, I will point out that these sound very different. The Grados are open-backs with lends a wider soundstage and better mid-range definition. The Sony MDR-7506 are closed-back, has more top-end and extends much lower in comparison. If you love your Grados like I do, this will take a while getting used to.

I do not think comparing the Grado vs. Sony makes much sense given the difference in operating principles. Yet if someone needed a clue, I found the Grados more forgiving on bad recordings. The Sonys on the other hand will tell you as it is. If you can afford 2 pairs of headphones, I will suggest the Grado for HiFi and Music appreciation (read as enjoying) and the Sony for more critical listening where accuracy is important (monitoring).

Both a great set of headphones for the money. I do digital backups of my vinyls so the Sony sees more head time."
312,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair of these over 10 years ago as of 2017 and these are very good studio headsets.

I do, however, have one issue with them and that is that they do have a higher frequency within the 3 khz to 8 khz area which you may have to compensate for if you are looking for a true flat studio range.

Now with that said, these are great for normal music listening with a wide dynamic range.. picks up high ranges very well.

I actually have had 2 sets of these MDRs over the years just for the enjoyment of listening to music.. Very good Noise cancellation."
313,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a nice around-the-ear set of headphones at a reasonable price. My choice came down to these and the Audio Technica ATH-M50x headphones, which cost nearly twice as much.

The sound from these is awesome. It had been probably 20+ years since I'd worn ANY over-the-ear headphones and I was instantly reminded how wonderful they are. You will notice things in your songs that you hadn't noticed before.

While these are not noise-cancelling, they do a good enough job of limiting noise. I've worn them on planes and while walking on the treadmill.

Be advised that this comes with a long cord. The product listing mentions the length of the cord, and it is accurate....and looong lol. I have it resting on the back of my neck when I'm doing dishes for example. This may be a deal-breaker for some.

They do fully cover my ears and as a result my ears get warm, especially when I'm on the treadmill. I know these aren't designed for working out, but be advised the pads will be wet with sweat if you work out wearing these. I usually just dab them with a paper tower and let them air dry.

Finally, headband is slightly uncomfortable for me at times. The padding of the band is good not great, and my shaved head probably doesn't help. Also it may be that they a little breaking in.

That may sound like a lot of complaints but to me they are minor. I like these headphones a lot and wear them often. They sound sooo much better than the earbuds I've been using for so many years. Getting these was a blast from the past, a reminder of how great music sounds through a good set of headphones."
314,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is so much I want to say about these head phones, but I'll keep it brief.
Maybe you shouldn't get them; all my other headphones sound like garbage now.
Whenever someone plays music from their phone speaker, it hurts me. Once you hear these, you can never un-hear them.

These headphones sound amazing, and are totally worth the ~$80 pricetag. Nothing I have sounds better.
But they aren't very portable, and are surprisingly large on your head.
They are amazing, but leave them next to your computer, and get something else for out and about.

For sound, they get an 11/10, they aren't made to be portable, and they aren't very portable. But I still bring them to work with me whenever I remember."
315,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you've only had iPod quality earbuds and midrange speakers like me, these will change the way you listen to music. The sound is warm, clear, distinct and enveloping. With the Beyerdynamic Earpads, they feel like a fleece for your face. The long, telephone style cable is excellent for fiddling, although it is a little bit of a pain to tuck it away if you're going for a walk. Which you really shouldn't be doing anyway because this sound is so enveloping that you won't be aware of a mugger until they have your money.

I guess the looks could be a downside for some people, but I get a bigger thrill from seeing professionals use my headphones than having them be clear of text, snazzily designed and a pretty color. Also, at least for me, you can't really comfortably sling them around your neck for a minute when someone's talking to you, you have to just take them off."
316,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for some time now. So I think it's time to write a brief review on them.
First and foremost they are comfortable even on my large ears. It takes many hours of use before they become uncomfortable.
They sound fantastic. They aren't bass heavy or anything. They are well done. They also do a descent job with noise cancellation even though that's not a feature. You can still hear through, them though (nothing crazy though). The cord on these is nice. It is very long and springy. You won't accidentally rip your headset off with this cord. I have a sound card which really brings out the greatness in these. Of course everyone has a preference. I tune up my equalizer and theses sound perfect to me. I would recommend getting the Soundblaster ZX with a nice pair of headphones if you like to change up your settings on demand. I love the combo."
317,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had been getting into video editing for some time and never really understood the true value of having a great headset. After much research and seeing these have been the industry standard headphones for decades thought they would be a great place to start to start improving my sound for the videos I edit. These headphones are awesome! If you are using them for extended periods of time (several hours) then you may need to take them off from time to time to give your ears a break but can generally keep them on for quite some time which is great.
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair from this headphone line in the past, and used them until they basically fell apart (one side stopped working, and the cushioning material for the ears eventually peeled away.) And yet after trying myriad other brands, I rate these as my personal best. After my first pair died (took several years of daily use), I went on a quest to try a bunch of different headphones. After wasting hundreds of dollars over the past couple years on everything from fancy $200 pairs, cheap Amazon-branded pairs, and plenty of random ones from places like Big Lots or Walmart, I finally just came back to these for a meager $15. There's simply no beating the combination of comfort (especially for people with glasses!), sound quality, and price. I work in front of a computer for hours at a time, and almost always have headphones (and eye glasses) on. I probably have a larger than average head shape too. Every single other pair I have tried ended up making my ears hurt before long, except this one. While the construction quality is decent, I do expect to run through a new pair every couple years, but at this price point, it's really hard to complain. In summary, I am so thankful these are back in my life."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones for music and movies for the price. I have never owned a big-money pair of headphones & after buying cheap ones that I had to replace multiple times due to breakage, I decided to get these after a recommendation from a friend. After buying them for myself, I also bought them for each of my kids. They're great for average use... i've never been bothered by outside noise, they are comfortable, and the sound is of good quality. They also are much sturdier than the cheapie $10-$20 ones I've gotten before. (My kids haven't broken them, which is a minor miracle)

I do recommend getting a bag or carrying case for them (I use a Crown Royal bag:) it certainly helps protect them and they do seem vulnerable at the hinges where they collapse for storage.

The only thing my kid complains about is the wire is kind of short. I prefer it because the wire is nice and thick and never gets tangled. with my previous cheap ones, it was always the wires that were delicate & one or both ears would go out. These are so much sturdier. (I think he just finds them too short when he wants to sit in the recliner with his iPad on the table & watch his Minecraft. If you don't require your headphones to meet these specific and ridiculous needs, the length should be fine.)"
2,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first tried these on, I found them a bit uncomfortable. My over-ear phones are much more comfortable. But, I plugged these in and listened (I'm a guitar player and spend a lot of time listening to musical details. The sound was amazing! At first I thought I wouldn't like these, but the sound came out and I was blown away. I can't believe $15 headphones sound this good. I bought these as backups to my AT over-ears and wasn't expecting much but these are really really great. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because they are a tiny bit uncomfortable."
3,1.0 out of 5 stars,I previously bought a pair of Amazon light weight headphones. Today the Sony headphones I ordered 2 days ago came. Price between the 2 almost the same. However that's where the similarity ends. The Sony headphones don't fit snug...slide all over...outside noise is barely muffled...the sound quality is not bad. But since they don't fit at all can't really appreciate the sound quality. They are going back tomorrow.
4,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great! I'm not an audiophile, so I can't really tell you how the sound compares, but they sound fine to me. I was more impressed with how long they lasted. I took these on several flights, had them in my overstuffed bags, dropped them and generally abused them. Unlike all other headphones I've had (which generally last me 3-6 months), these lasted 2 years! They got caught in my work chair and the pin was bent when I stood up, otherwise I think they might still be going. Since I will be traveling in a few weeks, I've already decided to purchase the noice-cancelling Sony's for a bit more.
The downside to these headphones (and reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the cord is a bit long and would get stuck between chairs, desks, etc (which is what eventually led to their demise). The cord was different which was good because it didn't seem to get tangled so often but bad because I think that's also why they were constantly getting caught in things. Lastly, I like headphones to fit snugly, these were lighter weight (which I don't like as much) and weren't so snug-fitting. Probably better for people with larger heads."
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for $7.99 on a lightning deal. They are excellent for the price. I ordered two pair: one for my 3 year old and one as a travel pair of headphones. The sound quality is impressive for the price. These are on the ear headphones, not over the ear. So, passive noise isolation won't be as good. However, they are quite comfortable. I could easily wear these for a couple hours while watching a movie. The physical size of the headphones make them a good choice for children. Sure, they aren't brightly colored, but I'm willing to bet the sound quality and price are much better than you'd pay for a branded set of crappy headphones. Also, I was surprised at the quality of the cord. I was expecting a thin, cheap cord. It's actually fairly thick and tangle resistant. Only complaint I have -- I wish the cord connected at a single point, rather than running to each ear piece. But, again, for the price they're darn good quality.

Update: I've now used these headphones several times on the treadmill. I like them even more now. When running, you'll occasionally run into a set of headphones with a seriously flimsy cord. As you run, a flimsy cord will bounce and become seriously annoying. These don't do that at all. I love how the solid cord just hangs with minimal movement. Also, the ear pads will get a bit sweaty, but nothing a quick wipe won't rectify. I'll let you know how they hold up for exercise use."
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these to carry around, mainly to have something that isolates noice a bit more than EarPods, they do the job, they are comfortable (though if you have a bigger than average head they might not be as much) and the sound quality is ok (they do have a bass booster which helps not hearing external noises but its a hindrance if you are looking for sound quality). The material quality is also ok, I read a lot of reviews stating that these broke almost immediately, and though they are not sturdy or particularly well built they should last a good amount of time provided they are not mistreated. I give these five stars mainly because of the price."
7,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived on time & in good / new condition. Sound quality is mediocre, but these are a heck of a lot better than dealing w/ the tears-inducing migraine that comes from headphones that squeeze my ears and jaw. They're not as comfortable as they claim to be, but markedly more comfortable than the Amazon Basics ones of similar appearance. If you're looking for something practical, and can handle a very short cord, like if you're on your laptop, these are for you. Wouldn't use them for exercise or movement of any sort. I'll probably buy them again, if they randomly short out on me. I'd say they're worth the $15 I paid, but if the price goes up, I won't buy them again. :) -Account holder's progeny"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW - Picked these up today after wearing the ZX100 for the last 3 years and wearing through the lining on the padding.

Sounds is incredible, rich bass, not 'deep' as Bose/Beats might sell you, just a solid, full, well balanced sound, much better than I expected from a $20 pair of phones. Looking at the cost difference between the '100's and these, the $5 is laughable.

Feel is fantastic, quality materials, folding pads is awesome and a thick cable with the right angle connector makes life easy. Tug to hard one way? Pressure gets pushed into the wire connection, not the actual plug which (one of my favorite, and most often utilized features of the 100s) so they won't snap on you.

Cost, well, if you can't shell out $20 for a decent pair of headphones it might be worth spending that money elsewhere.

Very happy, terrific product and price point. Blown away!"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These phones sound really nice, for being under $20. I have owned at least 30 different headphones since 1974, and these sound as good as any of the $100 Sennheisers I had back when Elton John's ""Rocket Man"" was new music. The power requirement for the voice coils in these phones is remarkably low: They sound great for listening to music on a cell phone or tablet, and you won't even have to crank the volume up to maximum. Some of the headphones I have owned recently don't work well with mobile devices, requiring more output power than the audio chip in a cell phone can provide - that won't be a problem with these Sony ZX-110 phones. They sound just fine on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S at 50% of max volume. Frequency response is very good for economy priced phones, with clear treble and adequate bass response to let you ""feel"" the drums and bass guitar. Soprano and contralto vocals sound nice and clear, without that ""muddy"" sound that cheap phones give that don't have enough high-frequency response. These phones fold up into a very small, compact footprint that is easy to store in a medium or large purse, or any briefcase, backpack, or laptop computer bag. The cord is 3 feet, and has a 90° angled plug. This cord length is great for use with a cell phone in a shirt pocket, although not really long enough for home use with a desktop computer. If you are going to use these phones to listen to music on a home stereo or desktop computer, you will need an extension cord, but these aren't terribly expensive.
COMFORT: Sony got this right: these phones grip your head just firmly enough to stay in place, without squeezing you to death. I have had a couple of Sony phones that were horrible in this respect, with way too much compression on an average sized head; that's not a problem with these phones. The ear pads are very comfortable, and they don't press hard enough on your earlobes to make you need to take your earrings off to use the phones.

SUMMARY: A Typical Sony economy-priced headphone with much better sound than you might have expected at this price point. Folds up very small for carrying in a purse or laptop computer bag, Very comfortable to wear for up to several hours.

PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
11,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the worst sounding headset I have ever bought. $3 airline headsets have far better sound than these. They are also very inefficient. I can barely hear the left speaker with the volume on max. I have bought many headsets for myself and family, including a number of Sonys. I never had a problem with Sony before.

On the plus side, they are comfortable."
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My brother loved it. The first ones I gave him (2 years ago) still works, but the leather has been deteriorating for the regular use. For that reason I got a new one for him."
13,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The package had already been opened, the manufacturer's tape/seal was cut in one area and the box looked to have been bent in that area to allow for the product to be taken out.
One strike against, but maybe someone just didn't like the fit. So I open it up and the head phones are great!
The cord is thick and sturdy, the head phones rest well on my ears and head, perfect! Happy camper.
I plug them in and.. click click.
Click *music*, click *nothing*.

Seems this was a returned item as it's quite defective. :(
The plug has a small area that is moving in and out and with each movement the sound is being disrupted.
I've returned it for a full refund and will try once more to get a working pair as I did quite like them."
14,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I need several sets of fairly compact folding headphones with decent sound and a good price, so ordered these along with two others to try out (the JVC HAS160A and the Panasonic RP-HX40-G.) Having used Sony products in the past, I expected these to outperform the others, but they didn't. The sound isn't as loud as the others, and it's fairly muffled, not clear. Clarity is important in my application (hard of hearing assistance), but even for casual music listening, these would be disappointing. I tried them on a small battery player and a more powerful Yamaha mixer, but couldn't tell a difference in the sound quality, just more volume on the mixer.
On the plus side, they have a little better bass than the others, and are probably more comfortable to wear for long periods (I only tried them for about a half hour.) And they look more impressive, being quite a bit more bulky."
15,3.0 out of 5 stars,These are cheap and totally okay headphones. They don't have fantastic sound quality but you get used to it after a few minutes. They seem well built and collapse into a more manageable shape if you want to carry them in a backpack or whatever. Honestly I would not buy these again because I like a bit more sound quality but now I know. Would be a decent gift or for someone who just needs decent headphones at a low price.
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In this household, we care a lot about sound quality. We're spoiled with great 2 channel stereos. For headphones I listen to Grado headphones, at least until they finally broke down. Recently we found ourselves surrounded by headphones.

So, in a headphone shootout here at home, two kids, two adults we came to this conclusion.

$200 Beats (paid $70 black Friday sale price): 1/4 picked as fav. (the teen)
$120 Bose: 1/4 picked as fav. (the mom)
$10 Sony: 2/4 picked as fav. (the audiophiles, dad and 10 year old)
$20 Apple earbuds 0/4 picked as fav. (universally hated)

We listened to uncompressed rock over an iPod shuffle, or Youtube.

These ""giant killer"" Sony phones have a clear, detailed, open sound. Meaning that the music don't sound cluttered between your ears, it seems to extend to around your head. Bass has real detail: you can hear the note, the reverb and the string pluck. For bass, these beat the Bose and Beats, with ease. Also, unlike Beats, you can actually hear people talk to you when you have these on. Not everybody in my family thought these were the best sounding though, my wife preferred the Bose.

The low point: they aren't as super comfortable as the Bose. Everybody agrees the Bose are the super comfy pair. Technically, these were not the loudest, but they were plenty loud enough!"
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,These head phones have amazing sound at an incredible cost. Was not expecting such great quality for $10!!!!!
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my electric/digital piano (Korg), as I live below my landlord, and cant play over my amp. Not used to headphones, and liking the sound of the amp, I thought of this as an experiment. With budget being at the forefront of my mind in this experiment and with many expenses related to a move, I gave it a try, and to my surprise, am pretty impressed with them. What I was thinking, that the 'directness' of playing thru an amp' would not be equaled by a headphone, is actually not the case; the headphone puts me more in my piano world, to the exclusion of anything else, and in that way makes it even more direct.You cant really sing along with it but I knew I had to forego that with the landlord above me, so I do that elsewhere. Instead I focus on the piano parts. I chose this head-phone for the extra bass, as I like to hear the deep piano bass sounds akin to a grand, and it does deliver in that range as well. Considering the budget, and knowing there are probably better and way more expensive professional phones out there, I 'm very happy with this purchase."
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable for extended use even though I have a larger sized head.
Sound is good and balanced for such a bargain price set of head phones.
Not bass heavy nor too bright with the highs, just a slightly over emphasized mind range.
So adjust the EQ on your player to suite your own taste. I set mine to boost the bass and treble.

Just don't expect audiophile quality from a $15 set of headphones and you will love these!
I use mine for listening to music on an ipod while landscaping and using power tools.
Perfect! No worries about spoiling an expensive set of headphones.

One caveat: volume levels are fine with my MP3 player or Tablet, but when used with my desktop computer
the volume levels are low. It maybe my computer set-up or sound card (ASUS Xonar DGX), but all my other
earbuds & headphones have good volume levels when used with the same computer. No problem for me
as I only use mine for listening to music on an ipod while landscaping and working with louder power tools.

Edit: 11/10/2015:
I found some settings in the Asus Xonar DGX sound card software that amplified the signal if using higher impedance headphones, so now I have good volume levels when using my computer as a source."
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The quality of the sound is really just amazing. There is practically no difference between the quality of these sony headphones and a pair of Beats ones that cost a couple hundred bucks extra. If you're looking for inexpensive headphones with fantastic quality, look no further. You won't be disappointed!"
22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price these are pretty great. (I paid $17 ) They have a good quality of sound, fit my larger head, and aren't uncomfortable to wear for a few hours in the office. The way they are built they also provide quite a bit of noise reduction/isolation. With the volume fairly low, it is easy to tune out the room around you."
23,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are wonderful. Great balanced sound and comfortable to wear. I'm not one of those folks that can really tell if there is anything minutely wrong with the bass levels, etc. Just a regular person looking for a nice set of headphones that wont cost me 200 bucks,these did the trick. Bought another set in white to match my tablet ( yes, I'm that girly) -- BUT-- I will need to get an adaptor since the plug guage is different on my Samsung tablet. No biggy. Still will recommend these highly. Also, husband has been abusing them ( dropping, stepping and sitting on them ) and hardly a scratch ."
24,4.0 out of 5 stars,"these headphones have amazing sound for the price—like seriously. they felt. a little cheap at first, but after a day I found myself loving these headphones. yes—they do have extra bass—but it's just the right amount. it's nice to see Sony not using their brands name for some extra cash."
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are only $25 headphones so don't expect $200 headphone quality, but they sound good enough to get through the work day. The microphone works well. I still preferred my old JVC headphones that broke after 10 years but I just needed something cheap and quick for now"
26,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Disregard any negatives you've heard about these headphones, they're amazing, especially if you configure an EQ or equalizer (most media players should have EQ settings, and also some computer's audio drivers come with the EQ software already built-in that you can access through your audio settings) on your phone or pc or whatever device you use, because then you can customize the entire sound range of these headphones to which the output can actually surprise you. They're nice and compact and fold up nice and easy as well. I specifically got this version for the microphone so i can scream at people in online games and skype/ts. Although the mic isn't exactly the best quality, its quite decent still if you're looking for a bottom of the line mic thats cheap and wont quit on you. If you use a dual jack splitter you can plug both the two separate jacks into"
27,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great basic headphones. They have a nice sound and are pretty durable. I have used them for almost a year now. Scony has always been a favorite of mine for headphones, going back to the ones with fuzzy ear muffs and a thin wire that went over your head. It is your duty to celebrate your independence not to have to use wireless headphones that need to be charged every few hours. So get these retro classics and enjoy music the way it was meant to be enjoyed."
28,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Music sounds crisp but not as good as Bose headphones. I wouldn't use these for sleeping purposes there uncomfortable and bulky. The ear cushions fit perfectly for my somewhat large ears. As I said for the title, I have used them for gaming. I play a lot of destiny in Xbox one s. Destiny requires a lot of chatting to play especially for raids. The jack connection fits any Xbox one controller. Highly recommended."
29,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very comfortable but don't do much as far as blocking out sound going on around you. I can hear pretty much everything through these. I have small ears and these were not too big either. The top was not ""tight"" or constricting as with other reviews. Good fit. I use them when I am at the gym working out and after wearing them about 20-30 minutes they do make you sweat a little bit but it is not noticeable until you remove them. Not bad for the price but if you are looking for something to block out at least a little bit of sound these are not for you."
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these since Christmas and I can tell you, you wont be disappointed. I have used primarily for movies and video games. I work nights so the nights Im off I usually stay up late and don't want to wake the family with machine gun fire from my video games and movies. I plug directly into my receiver and Im amazed. Strong bass but not overpowering, the mids and high are fantastic. Music sounds great as well but my opinion its movies that really show off there potential. Would buy again in a heartbeat. Do your research Sony if you want great sound Beats if you want a B on the side of your ear."
31,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It's hard to complain about a $20 pair of headphones but these are supposed to have ""extra bass"". They don't, in fact I think they may have less bass than any other headphones I've ever owned. These aren't the worse over ear headphones in the world, in fact they're not terrible, but if you're expecting the ""extra bass"" in the headline you'll be disappointed."

42,2.0 out of 5 stars,Uncomfortable to ears. Don't recommend unless you have larger ears perhaps/
44,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is good for $10. I prefer the cups to go over my ears, but these do fold up quite nice so I guess that's the trade off."
45,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a huge fan of these. They quit working after about 2 months.

The wire seems to short out on these pretty easily.

There are better headphones at this price range."
46,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad. It is what it is - a rather restraining, and controlled design. Its output volume is clearly suppressed. If you listen to classic rock or alternative, this is perfect. But if you want high output and ear drum tearing base, this is not for you. I doubt if this is good for jazz either because it's just not dynamic enough."
47,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these headphones. They even fold up for easy storage. I've had them for 2 months and they still work perfect.
48,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a okay product, but not as comfortable as I expected."
49,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones! They fit comfortably around the ears and block out most background noise. The length of the cord is great as well, as it gives you room to move around without getting pulled off."

61,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these at work and they work well. They are light, don't hurt my ears and sound great. Can't beat the price!!"
62,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The material is a little cheap, and the noise is not amazing however it serves its purpose and it works very well at a reasonable price. It adjusts nicely on my head and doesn't easily fall off. I would definitely get myself another one after mine breaks. Good product!"

73,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It came on time, works fine, good quality, fits well, and very usefull... the mic works just fine!!"
74,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these headphones every day. They are the first I've found - regardless of price - that don't break contact somewhere along the wires. Why did I buy another pair? The plastic covering the foam has begun to tear.
75,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headset, good bass and comfortable enough to wear all workday."
77,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Sound and comfortable. Only minor issue is the super long cord. I'm short (5'2) and this thing basically touches the floor. Can get annoying if you're doing a lot of moving around and whatnot. Not a huge issue though, still love these, especially for the price."
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones. Bought these just to have something for airplane rides. They feel cheap, but sound isn't too bad. I have heard better, but for the price I pay, and only plan to use these on airplanes, they're perfect!"

82,3.0 out of 5 stars,it's ok.
83,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Headphones
84,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great if you do not need noise canceling & the price is great.
This is not a noise canceling headphone but the outside noise is dimmed - even more so while listening to scriptures, or teachings - sometimes when there is a pause, you can hear dimly the outside noise/talking/TV, etc.- depends a great deal on how loud the outside sounds are.
But for my basic needs, these work great.
The ear part does go Over your ear but I have not felt any added heat like some I have tried.
The band can be adjusted and I have not had problems with my reading glasses while using these headphones.
The USB cord is approximately 3 feet long and the ear plugs fold up for easy story."
85,1.0 out of 5 stars,Really low quality headphones. Sound from phone would sometimes go in and out depending on angle of plug.

89,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've gone through quite a few pairs of headphones around the $15-20 price range, and I would say these are my favorite. They have a fuller sound and better bass response than others I've tried, and as I've found by accidentally dropping them an embarrassing number of times, they're also very durable."
90,5.0 out of 5 stars,Theses are the best! They fit well sound great and are easy to pair and use....great for the price!
91,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are solid headphones. I used them with my phone to listen to music or watch movies, good even sound. Don't know how they perform in a noisy environment though as I only use them in my house. They go 'on' the ear, not over it, unless you have really small ears."
92,4.0 out of 5 stars,For a budget pair of headphones these do what I need and they sound decent. If anyone is on the rocks about the best cheap pair of headphones they feel a little cheaply made and over time the headphones will more then likely break but that being said for the price you are paying and if you are careful with them they may last longer.
93,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great.
94,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my 92 year old mother who is blind. She gets braille books and needed new headphones to listen. She loves how they feel and sound.
95,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound at a great price. Was pleasantly surprised when we bought these that the sound was as good as it was highly recommend them
96,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones - they make my ears sweat after a while but are a nice alternative to the earbuds.
97,5.0 out of 5 stars,Granddaughter loves these--good sound and are comfortable. Good value
99,5.0 out of 5 stars,this a quality product well worth the money

103,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound... could use a slightly longer cord for office use, and next time I might go for more noise cancellation... but a good headphone overall."
104,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is good, product inexpensive."
105,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my son but ended up falling in love with them too lol. Fantastic sound. So much better than I thought it would be for $20. I'll be buying a second pair just for myself. =)
106,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great headphone, low price. acoustics and base are very clear with these headphones. Only wish they were more durable."
107,5.0 out of 5 stars,sony does it again. great headphones. good fit.
108,1.0 out of 5 stars,broke and the volume was low no bass . no bass at all
110,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great. A little big for my 3 year old but it isn't a kids one. This is our second pair!
111,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is great, but no noise cancellation. I mean you do get what you pay for."
112,4.0 out of 5 stars,For $20 they are worth it. I wouldn;t go so far as to say they're amazing but for the money they work well.
113,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Headphone!!! Light weight. Very satisfied sound and Microphone is clear. I use it all the time!!! Value for money!!!
114,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these just under three weeks and the ear piece stopped working. Used less than 30 minutes per day when I did use them, iPod playing on very low volume. Truly a disappointing result. Great price overall, but when you price out how much I paid for the little use I got from them, these became too expensive to bother with."
115,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The reason why I have to give this a two star rating is because you can't swivel the ear peace from side to side, only up and down. And because of this I hurts ear after a couple of minutes of use. The sound quality it's very nice."
116,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I mistakenly bought these to play my PS4 with. When using with PS4, the sound is very quiet and the bass is no better if not worse than my iphone earphones.

They sound pretty good with the iphone, but only because they provide more bass than the iphone earphones.

These headphones might make a good paperweight or perhaps I can re-gift them."
117,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was amazed at the sound quality that they produce! They fit nicely on my head and are super comfortable on the ears. I hate earbuds so this was a nice alternative. I got two pairs for my kids and now my husband is mad because he doesn't have a pair too! I got them on an Amazon deal but I would have paid more. They are great!
118,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use these headphones everyday at work. Have had no problems with them except the cord is very short. I had to use an extension, but the product does what I need it for and they are cheap enough where nobody at my work will steal them."
119,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Work great, use them every day at work. Why pay more?"
121,4.0 out of 5 stars,GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE!! I REALLY COULD NOT EXPECT A BETTER PRODUCT IN THIS PRICE RANGE!!! HAPPY JACK
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,Used as a cheap headphone for elderly in a nursing home. They get loud enough for all the patients and the quality is good for such cheap phones. They seem to be very durable and would recommend in a lost cost case.
123,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprised to see for the price what high quality headphones these are!
124,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The pair I got was defective. They seemed well made, and comfortable for the price."
125,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice sounding inexpensive headphones. Sounds MUCH better than the price. They have some added bass, but not too much.I bought these for a 12 year old girl and they were the perfect headphone for her. I'm happy and she's happy."
126,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the money!
127,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones work alright, but I mainly bought these to be a work headset for skype calls and the microphone does not work if I plug it into the headphone jack. So this is mostly useless for me and are just another pair of meh headphones."
128,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice headphones just not terribly big. They don't really fit over your whole ear. Sound is good though.
129,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones sound supremely good for their prices. This was a wonderful purchase.
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphone have a crisp, clear sound. Comfortable fit. I like the way the ear phones fold inward for travel convenience. Great buy!"
132,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this for my boyfriend after his headphones broke. He loves it and it blocks out sound around him so he can focus and only hear what is on the screen or music. It totally helps block the children out when he needs a bit of break from the world.
133,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had the old model they lasted 10 years hope these will do the same. So far... Awesome!
134,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for myself and my daughters. We love them - the sound is great, and they feel good on our ears."
135,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beats the heck out of ear buds all around! Just use them at my desk in a noisy office. Sound is great, bass stands out as being the biggest advantage over my crappy earbuds. I've heard some parts of songs I didn't know existed!"
136,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke the first time i put it on my head.
137,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unexpectedly low quality from such a marquee brand. Very low volume output and uncomfortable fit.
138,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Product description was right on. Great product, works as advertsed. God bless you. Thanks"
139,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sony quality at a great price. The enhanced bass is very noticeable.
140,1.0 out of 5 stars,Scraped on the outside plastic. Just opened the unsealed package. Don't buy.
141,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They seriously last for a very long time, only downfall is that they do hurt your ears."
143,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have held up so far, and considerably good quality considering the price. As noted in other reviews, after a few hours of usage, the headphones start to hurt my ears from the pressing, but it's not often that I wear them for that long. If you're looking for affordable headphones that help to block out noise, would recommend."
144,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have good sound quality for the price (I'm not too picky about the sound). My only complaint is that they are a little tight. If you wear glasses, you won't be able to wear these headphones for long periods of time without your head hurting."
145,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad at all. A bit boxy and unclear, but decent sound given the price. Comfort is good, as is build quality, again allowing for the price. Great if you don't want to be that guy who waves around his Bose or Beats headphones so everyone can see. Good value for the money. Couldn't ask for more."
146,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed something that was comfortable, had good sound quality and reasonably priced. I read all the reviews, I've had good experience with Sony and the price was exceptional. The headphones are wonderful, very comfortable, they actually fit and I've never bought a headset that fit right out of the box and the sound is theater quality. The added bonus, I was hoping it would work with my Roku and it does... beautifully and it works with my hiking radio, weather radio, it works with every device I have... amazing. You can't go wrong with this headset, it would be a great gift too."
147,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent headphones at a Huge savings over Hip Hop coolio beet box overpriced marketed to ding dongs headphones . You know, those really cool headphones that may get you robbed because you have a serious identity crisis, have too much money or are getting your money for free. Seriously, if you spent $200+ on a pair of headphones (unless you are a dj or work related--and you get a tax write off), you might want to go stick your finger in a light socket to remind your brain to function correctly. These work just fine... you can spend the difference on your college math class. Hey...you wanted my opinion."
148,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because my other pair of headphones, made by a different company, broke. When I received the headphones I wasn't that impressed, but then again these are $20 headphones. When I plugged it into my MP3 player I could barely hear my music unless I nearly maxed out the volume. My gummy earbuds have better sound quality than these. If I could, I'd return them but instead I bought a pair of Monster headphones and will keep these as a backup. As for the mic, it's pretty decent. When I first used it however, the other person on the phone kept complaining that they could not hear me. But now I think it is okay."
149,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones exceed their price in quality. I'm not an audiophile but I do know a thing or two. I used these Sony Extra Bass 110APs with an iPhone 6 playing 320kbps MP3s as well as a PS4 playing Destiny for voice chat and game sounds. The sound is very balanced and crisp for folk, country, rock, and punk with adequate bass for hip hop and EDM. More on gaming later.

I have a very large head, 7 3/4 hat size. These are just fine. They are very light and the headband extends beyond my needs.

I do not like noise canceling in any form as it contributes to artificial characteristics and I like being able to hear cars and pedestrians as I walk around the city. These headphones are great if you share my tastes. I wear these on the bus to and from work every day and while walking around downtown. The volume and audio mix blend well with ambience and they are light and fold up well into my bag.

For PS4/Destiny the sound was adequate but not particularly engaging. Voice audio was great and my friends reported my voice sounded better than the PS-VITA earbuds as well as the PS4-included chat earbud. The bass was underwhelming for game audio, however. Everything was crisp and detailed but I wanted more bass for explosions and gunfire.

To summarize, these are great for an iPhone commute but only fair for PS4/Destiny."
150,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really good headphones. Very simple, portable, and great quality for the price. My only complaint is that if you are using it on a machine that separates the headphone and mic jack, you can only use one or the other at a time. There is no split plug for this. You would have to buy something to split it separately."
151,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for workout headphones to wear while I'm on the treadmill at the gym. I had earbuds but I can't stand those things and they keep falling out of my ears. These are the perfect alternative. The sound is great and the price is perfect. They are light and very portable and fit nicely over my ears so I can drown out most of the external noise of the gym and listen to music or podcasts.
152,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price I have to give a 5 stars. Don't expect a sound like a expense headphone! But the sound is really good. I loved it! I bought many of this to our translation system of our church. Also I use it to listen music as well and it does a excellent job.
154,3.0 out of 5 stars,Cable wires are too short.
155,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones! Love that they collapse and make it much easier for storage.
156,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound great. Fit great. I use the for gaming.
157,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice set of headphones. Works very well.
158,4.0 out of 5 stars,Just perfect for my needs. Excellent quality for the price. I always expect the best from Sony and they've always delivered. Been a Sony consumer for forty years.
159,5.0 out of 5 stars,works well
160,5.0 out of 5 stars,Needed something for the gym that wouldn't slip out or off while I worked out. Sound is great!
161,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Stuff
162,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
163,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 6 yr old son goes through headphones like underwear. These are great quality name brand set.
165,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only issue I have with these headphones is that they aren't comfortable if you use them for over an hour. I wanted cheap headphones for gaming (I know these aren't gaming headphones, but hey, I'm on a budget) and these just start to hurt my ears after a while. But otherwise, great headphones for the price!"
166,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent head phone, has a bit more base than I like. All in all they're ok."
167,5.0 out of 5 stars,love the them cord can be just a few inches longer but great
168,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are nice. The only thing is the plug in end is to small to fit in my computer or stereo. I will have to buy an adapter to fit on the other end. They didn't say I needed this adapter. So I really have not been able to listen with it yet. Did not know that you can only use with a smartphone. Very disappointed.
169,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice inexpensive headset . Good sound quality. Great buy for those not wanting to spend lots for high quality head sets.
170,5.0 out of 5 stars,great - work as well as the more expensive headphones. Highly recommend
171,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazingg value. Very comfy as we. Sound quality is about 9.5/10
I like that it doesnt comepletely block out outside noise also. Just in case someone is trying to get my attention or if someone is alerting me of any danger. Also, i just like to be aware of any loud noises around me."
172,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These Sony Headphones are an excellent buy for their price. The original pair went under ""Field Modification"" by Buster my dog."
173,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wish was a Little louder but cool so far!!
174,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It sounds alright however I would recommend an equalizer for these.
It feels alright for a big head however the headband will stretch a lot when used constantly."
176,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works good but I have had better for the price that is softer on the ears
177,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price they are great. We use them in flights mostly.
178,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great intro/basic headphones. Muffles sounds a bit and the sound is good. Made of plastic and seems sturdy but I can imagine someone breaking the fragile like hinges where the cups fold. Take care of these heaphones and they will last for quite some time.
179,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unbelievably good quality for ridiculously low price! We are extremely happy! THANKS!!!
180,2.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful quality sound considering the price but one side stopped working after a week.
181,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was a gift for a friend for Xmas. I know he love it.
182,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Am amazing quality, very good separation, bass is very good, and structure is durable. Bottom line it is the bargain of bargains."
183,5.0 out of 5 stars,very good ear phone great price ty
184,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not so good sound but its okay for a 20 bucks headphones..
If you want a premium quality than dont go for this.."
185,4.0 out of 5 stars,great sound but low volume
187,3.0 out of 5 stars,i was a bit disappointed with the quality and the cable length. can't really use it well with my desktop
188,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, great price. If you are a serious audio person I wouldn't recommend these but if you just need something average and is soft on the ears these are great. They fold up pretty small and are easily adjustable."
189,5.0 out of 5 stars,comfortable and sounds great?
190,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work really, really well. The reviews were very helpful and I'm very pleased with them."
191,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable headphones, especially for their price-point. There may be objectively ""better"" options, but these work fine for me, as I use them to listen to podcasts or audio books while working at home: they don't need to be particularly noise-canceling or fancy. They are a pragmatic choice."
192,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well and I haven't had any problems with them. The sound quality is pretty nice for the price too.
193,1.0 out of 5 stars,Crap. Used only for a few months with a roku remote and right speaker went out. Also anyone comparing these to the Beets has obviously never used them.
194,4.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter is very happy with this product!
195,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the bass sound as well as the comfort. They are light weight and work well with my computer.
196,3.0 out of 5 stars,They are OK stopped working a month after I bought them
198,5.0 out of 5 stars,excelente producto!!
199,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clear sound and mic works extremely well. Better than the OEM apple headphones with mic.
200,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are the best headphones j know for the price. Not very noice resistant but then again they want rated to be.
201,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice headphones, would purchase again. Did in fact, in white. Only problem with them seems to be they fit my head a bit too tight, but sound is great."
202,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are an excellent value for the price. I have bought them for all of my kids. The headphones have endured some rough treatment and they still work well.
203,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really good headphones. I don't usually post reviews,but am really impressed with this buy!"
204,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They're OK for the money. Not a lot of high end, but I really wasn't expecting much. Cable is very short compared to others. I have others in the same price range that sound a lot better, but I also realize sound taste varies. Life would be rather boring if we were all the same."
205,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived early works great price is right
206,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound and good bass. These headphones are a great value.
207,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good pair of headphones. Fits ok with a good sound quality. The gold in feature is not the greatest and sometimes closes to easy. Only thing to make it better would be a volume control on the cord. Was worth the money you pay for it for sure.
209,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very flimsy. Did not last very long.
210,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Sony headphones for my don to use with his iPad.
211,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Weak.
""Extra bass"". Not really... or at all. My earbuds have more bass.
I used these once and gave them to a friend.
Put the money you'd spend on these towards good headphones.
...unless you're buying them for a kid or something."
212,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a gift for someone for Christmas. They love them. Great sound, great price."
213,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds great and the price is right !
214,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These seem to work pretty well. They are not quite as loud as my other pair of the same brand. But, that's good for the kids."
215,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great, but hurts the ears"
216,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
217,4.0 out of 5 stars,These work well and produce good sound for the price. They could up nicely too. The microphone will play/pause/skip on ios but not adjust volume.
218,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received these headphones today and I am really impressed with the sound quality at this price range. Good deep bass, not boomy. Just really good tonal quality... highs to lows. Comfortable, sturdy, great sounding and inexpensive. What's not to like? Better than average by far!"
220,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice product, like it a lot and good job of describing."
221,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my 9 year old. He likes them a lot
222,1.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones were not quality. The metal piece broke off that you plug into the unit making the headphones completely unusable. I would assume that that piece is sturdy and strong buy I was mistaken!
223,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones, they are cheap but work well, not much to complain about"
224,3.0 out of 5 stars,Honestly the sound is just okay. They fold up which is nice and the noise cancelling is awesome but overall they are just okay. My daughter has louder headphones she got from her elementary school at the fraction of the cost and these things were $14! Wha!?!
225,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound really good, they just aren't very comfortable."
226,5.0 out of 5 stars,great!
227,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like them, I like the folding design, I just wish they were a little louder."
228,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Whenever I buy headphones, I make sure to buy the ones that go over the ear because I wear mine usually over the course of a couple hours per session. On-ear was a really bad idea, especially at the default configuration (I have a small head, I didn't bother changing the configuration because any bigger I thought it might slip). After about 20 minutes of wearing the headphones at the default configuration my ears started to ache and hurt, I couldn't spend too much time with them.

However, the sound that comes out of these beauties is absolutely amazing! Excellent resounding bass, not sub-woofer quality but a close second. The treble is very balanced, I can crank these up to high than I usually have and not have to worry about sharp cracks due to the audio track peaking at kicks and snare hits. On previous over-ear headphones the max i could set my overall volume was 25%, which at the time was good enough to hear just about everything. With these I can crank them past 50% and more and not have to worry about any sharp cracks. Truly a good pair of headphones for the price.

Regarding the tightness i felt earlier, I was able to adjust the length to fit my needs. The tightness lessened to the point I was able to wear them for extended periods of time, the pads are very much comfortable even if they appear thin. I still prefer over-ear headphones, which denotes the 4 star. That's just my bias.

These headphones are fold-able to fit comfortable and compactly in medium sized pockets or carrying slots. They will almost never tangle, as noted by the semi-circle shaped cords. Although when you first get them, it might take a while to straighten out the curls. Nice strong and thick cable. Lastly, regarding external noise. Most of the noise is largely contained within the headphones, at least within my experience.

[I'll post some pictures later to emphasize my points, although there are a good number of reviews that already showcase this.]"
229,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good set of headphones. Typical Sony quality.
231,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are comfortable, sound decent and they collapse nicely so the storage footprint is smaller than any on-ear headphone I've seen. I've used them with phone, tablet, computer, TV. Works great."
232,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Work and sound great, but for 2-3 months only. I just sent second pair to Sony for replacement. Probably will try something else."
233,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for money. Took a little longer to get to us than I would have liked but happy with the product
234,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter was extremely shocked when she tried her these headphones she got for her birthday. She said they are better then her iphone ear buds.
235,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Descent sounding cheap phones
Great price
Don't expect great... you will be ok
Spend more if you really want great phones"
236,3.0 out of 5 stars,These are okay as long as you don't play too loud. A lot of static on high volume. I got them cheap so I didn't expect much...
237,5.0 out of 5 stars,good bass love them i had the older verson tthese are much better
238,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke within a week poor sound quality as well
239,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice. Neat tone and fits well
240,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice, comfortable headphones, not too big or clunky, not too small."
242,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I felt compelled to write my first review because of how incredibly impressed I am with this product. I've been listing to music at work using a couple different kinds of ear buds and after my last pair broke I thought I'd try an over the head set. Wow, I didn't realize what I've been missing. These sound great and they're super comfortable."
243,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not that great bass.
244,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality like I have come to expect from Sony but compared to the zx100 they are not as loud so if I walk with these outside I can't really hear them. Bass is great though
245,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for gaming
246,1.0 out of 5 stars,One side did not work.
247,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones. 2 months later it still works. Good buy for the money.
248,4.0 out of 5 stars,High quality sound.
249,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Headphones. They sound a lot better than i was expecting for the money spent. Could be more comfortable but again they sound good. Very compact and can go anywhere. I use them to plug into my laptop for audio.
250,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones for the money. I mostly use them for iTunes and movies on my computer. I just can't see spending 150-300 on headphones.
251,5.0 out of 5 stars,they are great!
253,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones provide great balanced sound. Not bassy or tinny. Can't beat the price as well.
254,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great fit Great sound
255,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Packaging was a little weird -- no box t speak of, very minimal, with labeling entirely in Chinese. But who cares, as long as it works."
256,5.0 out of 5 stars,use these every night to listen to the radio .....
257,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice. Lightweight. They work fine for routine listening. Not extremely high quality, but they do the job very satisfactorily."
258,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound.. I use them at work riding on the zero turn.. the last ones I had were hard to hear over the noise, but these ones are loud."
259,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for wearing while walking, working etc."
260,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice headphones with pretty good sound quality. The folding feature is pretty convenient when you have to pack.
261,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thanks, Great product."
262,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Music sounds excellent, and has some bass, not much, but a lot more than ear buds.
For the price you can't go wrong."
264,5.0 out of 5 stars,i love this headphone.. it one off the best headphone that i ever got.. the bass sound so good and it doesn't kill the highs or the mid. am sound guys i and i love listein to music that has good bass on them. and i am kinda picky with some head phone. i have use alot off headphone and i end up selling them because the way they sound. but this headphones sound great i love it.. the sound pair i got came out bad i don't if it was mines but they was so nice that they send me a second pair with out no question ask. (i still got to send the old pair back) i will give them 5 start because this is the only headphone name brand that i keep buying for the reason that they sound awesome..
265,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good pair of inexpensive headphones. They are durable. I have bought both the black and white models - just not for myself. I prefer the white ones since they are easier to find in clutter. These can not touch my SONY V6 headphones, not even close. Of course, I don't want anyone to touch my SONY V6 headphones so these fill that gap nicely. After more than two years of use I was surprised that these did not fall apart. These are not that comfortable but that's not the point, these are nice for being $20. In this same price range I paid more than this for ear bud headphones, all of which fell apart. Most of my ear-bud headphones suffered the same fate of having their cables break on the inside.

it's not fare to compare these to more expensive headphones. If you are buying these for yourself and can afford it, of course get better ones."
266,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are perfect for me. I have small ears so the ear plugs most people use don't work for me. These fit nicely and are adjustable. The sound is good, even at ear popping volume. I haven't had a need to use the microphone yet, but I like having the option. There is no way you can use these for sports, but that is not their purpose, so I'm okay with that. I use them mainly to listen to my Amazon prime music on the iPad. Overall, I would say these are an excellent value. I would definitely buy them again if something happens to the current pair."
267,1.0 out of 5 stars,Overal this was a good purchase—until they broke only after a few months. for no apparent reason. The sound qaulity is great for the price but the durability of these headphones is very questionable did not expect this from Sony. I have had headphones from other brands for around the same price or cheaper and they have lasted a lot longer.
268,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Mediocre Headphones. From the first day they kept acting up: slight and I mean SLIGHT pressure on the cord (specifically the L shaped part that plugs into your device), will cause songs to skip or pause. Doing that will also activate Google Voice for some odd reason. Imagine listening to your favorite song just to have it be interrupted by Google Voice 30 times, or have it skip to the next song before your favorite part comes on. I’ve purchased headphones from Sony in the past and I’m surprised that I received such a disappointing product."
269,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound may not be as good as a sennheiser HD 202, but it sure can last longer. I bought these for my brother and it's been going strong ever since. My bro plays a lot of basketball so these headphones get exposed to a lot of heat and sweat. However, my sennheiser hd202, which I bought with these sonys, is losing sound on the left speaker. I didn't even use my hd202s that often.sony makes better headphones than sennheiser."
270,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't let the price fool you, these headphones are in fact great! From deep house music to crunchy blues/jazz rock music, they deliver a good experience, and are awesome value for money for 15 bucks. The only issue I have is sound leakage - if you try to turn up the volume, people around you can hear a little bit and it might not be great in an office environment, but I guess you would have to go as high as at least 50% on the volume levels for noticeable leakage. Have had them for a week now and loving the experience."
271,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones. The sounds quality is ok, they aren't really noise cancelling but my husband loves them. We had a different pair that were very expensive and they broke after a few months. These have lasted a while now. The rope is thick and strong and we haven't had any breaking or anything like that which often happens. The ear pieces are comfortable to wear for extended listening time. I would really recommend and buy again."
272,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones after reading various reviews and can fully endorse what other people have found. The sound from these has a very rich bass without compromising the higher end frequencies. They perform much better than the price suggest...they certainly aren't cheap and nasty in their sound quality. They seem to be really good at blocking out external sounds, and I'll be up-dating when I've been on a plane journey which is why, for now I've obly given 4 stars. With good sound deadening on a plane, I'll be up-dating to 5 stars. I'd recommend these to anyone except, obviously, those who are only concerned with being seen with some hugely expensive trendy brands of headphones which, in my experience, have worse higher frequency response at increased volumes."
273,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't go wrong with these headphones. I don't listen to music enough via headphones to justify spending more than $25 so this was a perfect option for me. Build quality and sound quality are great.
275,5.0 out of 5 stars,Haven't used them yet. They look just fine. Nicely delivered intact and ready to use.
276,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had to throw them away as they lost sound on one ear. Didn't have them that long.
277,1.0 out of 5 stars,"There's something wrong with the audio plug. Static or compromised sound, depending on how I turn it or reseat it in the port. Wish I'd tested these when they first arrived instead of waiting for my old pair to die."
278,1.0 out of 5 stars,The left side of the headphones does not work. I had to sent it overseas and now I am in a position where I cannot even return the item.
279,4.0 out of 5 stars,"a lil bit uncomfortable to wear for long periods of times, but does the work"
280,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great clarity, nice firm grip. The ear cushions are designed so I can still hear background noised, phone, secretary, front door, ect."
281,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible for the price I paid, 20 dollars. These headphones are very comfortable, and made of high quality plastics. You would never guess that these headphones were 20 dollars if you didn't buy them. Rich bass, clear sound and good volume- what more could you ask for?
Only thing that annoys me is the fact that these went on sale 1 week after purchasing."

291,4.0 out of 5 stars,good sound and comfort.
292,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, there isn't much out there that can compete with these. My previous headphones were twice as much, yet only a bit better. Noise cancellation on these is surprisingly good. They can be uncomfortable after a couple hours, but it isn't painful. Just take a break, and you're good to go again."

308,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent bday surprise .. No more ear buds !!!!
309,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sony appears to be willing to let their reputation be harmed for money. These are no better than a knock of brand.
310,5.0 out of 5 stars,Even better than the larger over ear headphones
311,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones! Light weight, don't pinch my head or hurt my ears, and have a good sound quality for the price."
312,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really good sound, Has a slight intermittent buzz sound in one of the ears."

317,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product for the price. Microphone is clear and haven't had any complaints about the quality of sound on the other end. Only complaint is the ear part is a little in the small side, but quality of sound and microphone are great."
319,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great set of cheap headphones. No reason unless you're one of those "":See how much I can spend on ear candy stuff"" then you might not like them, but I do and enjoy my music."

337,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are crap unless you like listening to the right channel only. They broke within 2months after buying..
338,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent sound quality for the price. These Sony headphones are comfortable to wear for 2-3 hours. Longer periods of use may warrant a higher priced pair. However, these headphones are a great value for moderate headphone users."
339,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price and where I'm using them.
341,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones for the price.
342,4.0 out of 5 stars,Solid pair of headphones with a mic.

344,5.0 out of 5 stars,The product was great ...love it is noise reduction and the sound quality was as we exopected
345,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price you can't beat it. I haven't had them very long yet so I should update this review 3 months from now. As of now everything is great. They aren't 100% noise canceling (if you are in a professional studio) but that should be obvious according to the price.
346,5.0 out of 5 stars,best company so helpful and professional will recommend to everybody
347,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They don't totally suck, but close. These reviews must be fake or for a different product. Should have gotten a $10 pair from Dollar Gen. - would probably be the same."
348,4.0 out of 5 stars,Could be louder but overall good sound
349,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice.
350,5.0 out of 5 stars,Handle lowend bass note's better than i thought.
352,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product
353,2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones broke within 3 weeks of use. The pin snapped off where it plugs into our iPad. We had normal use by a 9 year old. I have sent the seller a message for replacement but have notyet heard back
354,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price is these headphones are good.
355,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, good sound. I had to get used to the 'on the ear' instead of 'over the ear' but once I did they were fine."

357,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, very comfortable."

366,5.0 out of 5 stars,As described
367,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound only on one side
368,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is product is so bad, this actually ruined my mobile. After using this improper manufactured 3.5 jack my mobile is not working or recognizing any other brand ear phones or head phones properly. Very very bad and poor."
369,3.0 out of 5 stars,"prefer the sound from earbuds, but these are ah-ight."
370,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work GREAT!!
371,1.0 out of 5 stars,"no high frequencies on these headphones. if these were truly sony and not some grey stuff, i am very disappointed with sony."
372,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great headphones for the price, my son love them."
374,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They sounded pretty good and the mic seemed to work well. After 6 months of frequent use, sound stop working on the right side. Had it not broke after 6 months I would have rated it better."
375,3.0 out of 5 stars,The cord wasn't strong enough got spoilt fast
376,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great noise cancelling product! Others can't hear the sound while you are listening to music! Great product at a great price!
377,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work fine. Good price. Would recommend. They were a gift to my adult son to use with his computer.
378,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value and sound!
379,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great price and great craftsmanship! I cannot believe how nice these headphones are for the super low price. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a quality pair of headphones at a bargain price.
380,3.0 out of 5 stars,suitable
381,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these on one of the deal of the day items. My grandson loves them.
382,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice headphones. Got them for my RV to watch TV at night without disturbing the boss.
383,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product
385,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The shipping was very fast and the audio is very good quality. The cord doesn't get easily tangled. And something that I didn't notice in the pictures (maybe it was in the description), is that the audio jack is the kind that is at a right angle, making it seem far more durable and long lasting. And I can appreciate that since my other headphones had retired after one or two years because the audio jack had gotten askew or even broken off after one fatal fall. My only concern is the joint where the headphone swivels because it feels a bit delicate but it has been holding up pretty well. For the price, I am beyond satisfied."
386,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. Great sound, very affordable, and super easy to use. I travel with these all over the world (they are very compact and fit into a nice zip bag). Comfortable (I usually have issues with headphones -- very sensitive ears). I even sleep with them lying down on the plane (in business). Sometimes they get a bit sweaty when I use them to work out in, but I just wipe them off with wet paper towel."
387,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my son and he loves them. They are comfortable with clear sound and ""great bass"". He especially likes that they fold easily and I love that they have survived being beaten up and abused in his backpack and are still going strong after three months."
388,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a LOT of reviews before making this purchase and I REALLY wanted to love these headphones.. I mean, they're Sony's! I was looking for high quality Bass headphones. Sadly, these are not as good as my husband's Kanen i35 Headphones that he bought here on Amazon for under $20. First of all, they have a much looser fit than the Kanen's, so you can easily hear noise around you, preventing a fully enclosed feeling when it comes to listening to my music. The bass quality was also inferior to the Kanen's. I listened to a nice high, bass song like M83's ""Midnight City and did a side-by-side comparison of the headphones and clearly, Kanen's sound came through very loud, clear and with a fuller bass. Had to make sure to share my experience so hopefully it will help someone out when they are trying to make a purchase decision. Good luck!"
389,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked the price to sound quality ratio of these headphones HOWEVER the jack is very flimsy. I broke my first pair sitting down with my phone in my pocket. The jack bent, and from then on I had to hold the cord at a particular angle to get sound in both ears. I assumed the fault was mine and bought a second pair, but within a week the cord got caught on a doorknob I was walking past, and with very little force, the jack snapped right in half, leaving the metal part in my phone. I don't think I can afford to keep replacing these every month."
390,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a really nice set of headphones for the money. I've never been able to get accustomed to those small earbuds most people use. After a few minutes they make my ears sore. I travel alot also, so I need headphones that will cancel some of the noise from the loudness of the airplane. I'm sure a big set of ""noise cancelling"" headphones would work a bit better in this regard, but for what they are, this set seems to do a fairly adeqaute job. The sound is really good, they are comfortable, and I absolutley love the ""fold up"" feature this model has to offer. These headphones will easily fold up, taking up minimal space in your carry on luggage. Glad I purchased!"
391,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality , comfort, and volume. I have had these before and after 5 or more years they wore out from cleaning the pads.
Great Price and just bought 2 more. The only con you might find is the core is 4 feet. I have had a 8 foot extension for years so it doesn't bother me. Excellent purchase."
392,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for something to replace my Sennheiser HD 201’s, the connection of which broke on one ear. I first tried the Sentey Warps based on all the glowing reviews, but the inadequate bass response deprived the music of real presence for me. These inexpensive Sony’s did not disappoint. The sounds are clear and smooth with reasonably good definition in all frequency ranges. The emphasized bass lets you feel the music without becoming overwhelming. Having said that I should point out that the higher frequencies and even some of the mids are more recessed as compared to other headphones that I own. That may bother some audiophiles. Nonetheless, I am very happy with my purchase – especially at this price point. I like the fact that I will be able to use them with my Android phone. Since these are worn on the ear and not over the ear, they do leak sound so they probably aren't the best for an airplane or other situations where others are nearby."
393,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony's headphones never cease to amaze me. My last Sony MDRZX100 headphones (The older variant of these headphones) broke in one ear cup after using for a year and a half everyday. For only paying $35 for those headphones at the time, I opted to get this pair of newer and cheaper headphones. The sound is crisp, bass is rich, and mid-tones can be heard amazingly! For only $20, I got an extreme upgrade from the previous headphones. Sony is an amazing company to get cheap headphones for a GREAT PRICE!"
394,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These Sony Headphones are ideal for my use with a portable radio. The sound is clear and has good frequency response. They are a bargain at
this cost. There is one minor drawback: the separated wires from the phones to the spot where they combine on the cord twist up into little
""pigtails"" that are annoying. I can't keep them straight. Otherwise, I recommend them. William"
396,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not good sound quality, very low. The left ear blew within 2 days of use"
397,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great and are very comfortable on my gfs sensitive ears.

399,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product, the sound is really amazing, you'll enjoy these earphones, my brother love them!!"
400,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this and find it okay as far as headphones go nothing special about it but I am satisfied.
401,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These aren't bad headphones. The sound is a bit muffled, but I've been previously using earbuds, so that's normal. Comfortable for the most part, easily adjusted. Not bad for $20."
402,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was for my great grand daughter and it works very well for at school
403,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had bought 2 pair of these. Initially these were great, but after a couple of months both pair only produced sound from one ear."
404,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Keeps my neighbors happy. Playing piano at night I can hear what the neighbors cannot. The quality is not high end, which I cannot afford. This is an OK solution. Cancels outside noise pretty good too."
405,5.0 out of 5 stars,"used on plane, great for the price!"
407,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am rather picky about my music and the quality of sound during playback. I can say without pause or hesitation that for the money I spent ($15 and change, no shipping) these headphones ROCK! They are tremendously comfortable - to the point of almost forgetting they're on! I bought these and a cord extension so I can get up and walk about a bit without taking off the headphones. I love them! Great sound, nice clarity, decent depth/bass response. I've tried headphones for two and three times as much money that weren't as good as these."
408,3.0 out of 5 stars,I like the fact I can use my head set for music and talking on my phone. However the headset is too big for my head and falls off. I wish Sony would make a headset that is a bit smaller. The volumes are not always clear or loud enough but I like the headset.
409,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good
410,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for a kid with a tablet on a 5 hour car ride to the beach. So what if he gets icing on them because he can't eat his BoBerry Biscuits® in the car without making a huge mess? They're pretty cheap, so it's totally worth it."
411,5.0 out of 5 stars,very good purchase!

423,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these earphones. Great sound quality. Durable. They have even withstood a brief moment in rain. My only complaint is that they don't get very loud, so if you're a volume lover like me, I would try another pair of headphones."
424,5.0 out of 5 stars,great.
425,4.0 out of 5 stars,The cord isn't as long as I thought. Only about 3-4 feet.
426,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap but good for the price
427,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice headphones except one thing , the padding on the ear pieces they aren't very comfortable.Other then that nice sound , am told by people the mic also sounds nice. It also seems very sturdy. If they changed the padding they would for sure be 5 stars for the price."
429,4.0 out of 5 stars,decent sound for the price. Comfortable enough to last a few hours of use.

431,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gooood
432,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this as a gift for my cousin. It has been 2 months and this headphones haven't stop playing almost 24/7! They are amazing and my 15 year old cousin is thrilled with them!! I have already recommended it!! I got more that I was looking for at an excelent price!!

438,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what the doctor ordered.
440,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product, reasonable price and fast shipment."
441,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these due to how often I need a headset on my laptop and phone. I actively used these (two different pair) for a few years.
During that time period I learned that the headset is HIGHLY prone to shorting out on one side. Sometimes the mic doesn't work after a good while of use. Sound quality isn't too great but the folding mechanism is wonderful for storage whether it's in a purse, backpack or just on your lap while you're waiting somewhere.
For the price-- if you need something fairly quick and don't mind replacing them often and are *only* needing them for your phone or light computer work-- I think this is okay. If you'd like better quality for voice and sound-- I wouldn't recommend these at all. If you'd like a product that's going to last over a year-- don't. Go look somewhere else and invest a little more money. I expect these to last for six months with heavy use."
442,1.0 out of 5 stars,Right channel failed after 2 weeks.

444,3.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for. Was looking for a cheap pair of head phones and this is exactly what they are. Sound quality is decent. Ear pads are thin. Noisy when adjusting on ears. They are good if you need a pair of cheap headphones!

453,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound for a very low price (considering the high quality) ... it does NOT shut out outside noise (but it doesn't claim to), but this headset is both comfortable and has great quality sound!! Very satisfied!"
454,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They work great, but don't use them for noise cancelling purposes. Also the microphone isn't the best, but overall good sound."

468,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very uncomfortable and made of cheap quality. Returned but was only refunded half of what i paid. Thanks?
469,1.0 out of 5 stars,"OH THE PAIN! These headphones have cheap thin padding. After a short time you will feel the hard plastic speakers jabbing you in the ears. But you will have already opened the package and used the headphones. So it will be too bad for you. If you love the sensation of sharp plastic piercing you earlobes, this is the headset for you!"
470,4.0 out of 5 stars,good buy for the price
471,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy them.. they don't have extra bass like they say
473,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got them in one day! Great HP's for the price and my needs.
474,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these on sale from Amazon as a gift for the wife who wanted some headphones, but wasn't looking for anything expensive. She like them and just recently comment on how nice they fit and how good the sound was!"
475,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We use these in our training room and they seem to work pretty, helping cancel some of the noise coming from neighbor computer users."
476,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for $20 for son. Couldn't ask for more at that price.
477,5.0 out of 5 stars,ok
478,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is similar to the previous model which I also have. The materials seem of lesser quality, though. It is lighter, but it feels...cheap. Even the cord is thinner and looks prone to breaking if it gets caught on something."
479,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty! ! Definately would buy again
480,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can't go wrong with these headphones if you're on a budget. The seller gives you what you payed for in a timely manner.
481,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sound. highly recommended
482,5.0 out of 5 stars,ok
484,5.0 out of 5 stars,An great product very recommendable
485,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are some of the best headphones I've ever owned and easily compared some of the beats headphones everyone seems to love. This is the best deal you're going to get for headphones at this price. Maybe I'm being generous but these are amazing
486,4.0 out of 5 stars,OK for cheap headphones.
487,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved it and been using it every day at my office, to listen to music whenever I feel like falling asleep."
488,2.0 out of 5 stars,Cord has a short in it and left ear speaker keeps going in and out.
489,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t last long. Have to buy a new pair

495,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality for the price. They last long if you dont handle them rough.
496,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is great but the control button aint that responsive
497,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good quality earphones; comfortable; nice audio.
498,5.0 out of 5 stars,My boys loved this as a Christmas gift to my three boys.
499,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Surprising sound quality and bass. No reason to spend $200+ on dre beats, unless of course you want to be one of those mindless cool guys that wouldn't know the difference anyway."
500,5.0 out of 5 stars,i love my sony headphones!!! the sound quality is above average
501,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality sound. No complains based on the price I paid.
502,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: The price is affordable. The headphone is lightweight and does not hurt your ears and the volume is decent.
Cons: The cord is too short and the volume cannot be adjusted. In summary I your looking for a very simple headphone with mic this is it.."
503,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have great sound quality, and feel very sturdy.I would recommend them"
504,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are basic headphones, no Bluetooth and no mic for phone calls but if you're looking for an inexpensive great sounding pair of headphones, you found your product!"
506,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones give good music, good sound. I only use them for an MP3 player while doing cardiovascular exercise, and they are suitable for that task. The way that the ear pieces fold means that they won't crack in a suitcase, which is nice."
507,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They do the job. They don't do anything for noise cancellation and the cushion is rather FLAT not puffy like shown in the photos. They fold but every time I fold them I'm super careful because it just feels like it's going to break at any moment. It hasn't so far. Be delicate with them and they may last. I purchased them for a specific purpose and that was to be able to hear microphone levels for a specific project - so for that purpose they work great. They're not very tight on my head either, so that's a plus!"
508,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones! I wanted to upgrade from my earbuds for grad school and these are serving me quite well! I like how they fold up which makes them easy to slip into my bag. I use them every day and they're a very good pair of headphones. I'm not some expert on different headphone specs, but I just use this with my iPhone, and occasionally my laptop when I'm working in my office, and I think they're fantastic."
509,5.0 out of 5 stars,We bought two headphone because we didn’t want to share. Best decision Ever. These are of excellent quality and the price is fine. We use them several times daily. They are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
510,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for $7.99 during the holiday season. I don't recall if these were a lightning deal or just a general sale but I guess that doesn't really matter much. I gotta say, they perform better than expected. I am by no means an expert on headphone-quality, but I know what I like and I like these headphones. They are sturdy and they sound great. I use them almost daily at work (going on two months now!) with no problems.

They may not be the fanciest headphones out there but if you just need a simple headphone set for casual use, you could do a lot worse than these."
511,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are just great for the price and then some. I bought these to replace the costco headphones that are battery assisted and where like 60 bucks. So those 60 dollar headphones broke at the dang cord, and cannot be replaced. This cord is the best you can buy and likely wont break the same way as it is protected and flexable.

Sound quality is awesome. The battery assisted ones could go a little louder, but after listening for hours like I usually do, my ears were sore. This is great sound right to the point where it is dangerous, but not hitting that line.

Very comfortable as well and very light. Dr. Dre can kiss it, I'm fine just using these great headphones, crazy good. Will buy a couple more and store them for gifts and extras."
512,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. One has to look at their use type to determine their needs of course, but for likely 90% of people the goal is sound quality, comfort and reliability for the money and these Sony's really are fantastic for the price I paid ($20). I use these everywhere, including at the gym where they stay in place better than many earpiece units I've tried, on my mp3 player, tablet or computer for music or tv/movie watching, for audio books and for phone use. There is a slightly cheaper version of these that don't have the microphone but for hands free talk from my phone I can hear those I speak to very well and I also am told I can be heard well too. True these headphones don't have quite the ear hugging pads of some of the higher priced noise cancelling one's but they are still very good at blocking sound and are quite comfortable. These also have good extension for different sized noggins and while lightweight, they feel sturdy and well crafted. My kid has $200 Beats which take less abuse than my Sony's and in less than 3 months hers are already having sound issues while mine keep playing great. I'll be buying another pair of these just to put away, that's how much I like them."
513,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My ears are very sensitive to the touch with any headphone, and ear buds usually do not stay in my ears, and if I can even get them in, they are quite painful, even long after taking them out. Most low-priced over the head ear phones are also uncomfortable on my head and ears, and the older ones never sounded good.
I've only used these once for a couple of hours, so I can not comment on how long they last. If things change, I will amend my review. With these, the sound was clear, left and right separated well, and did not press too hard on my ear. When I took them off after a couple of hours of use, my head around my ears was slightly sore/sensitive, but that did not last longer than 5 minutes. As I said, that area of my head is quite sensitive.
For $15 I highly recommend these."
514,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for under 8 dollars, so I wasn't expecting much. They turned out to be a good set of headphones. The sound quality is good. They are comfortable on the head and ears. The only minor complaint is the person sitting next to you can hear everything if the volume is turned up. And since one of the main reasons you wear headphones is to not bother anyone with your noise, it loses one star. The cord is short, but if you use them with your phone or laptop, it works out perfect. I bought these for a TV, so I might have to buy and extension. All in all, I would definitely recommend these."
515,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First and foremost these are great headphones, especially for under $20.

I'm not an audiophile by any means, rather a fairly regular guy looking for a pair of headphones on a budget that will still do a good job delivering great sound quality. These are absolutely the headphones that will do that. Sound quality is excellent from fountains of Wayne's ""Stacies Mom"" to childish gambino's ""Oakland."" Comfort wise the headphones are also excellent, there is no pinch, they're very lightweight, and the ear cups are very comfortable.

The only reason I give these headphones 4 stars is the build materials. Because they are a low cost headphone they are made of a fairly run of the mill plastic, along with that the swivel design is something that I can forsee breaking in the future, it's not flimsy, rather just the mechanism is of it puts a pretty good deal of torque on a fairly small joint.

If you're looking for a pair of new headphones buy these. For the price they can't be matched, just remember you're buying them for less than $20 so don't expect any thing too crazy in the build materials and quality"
517,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fairly good sound for the $20 price and comfortable enough for what I use them for. If you want perfect comfort and sound you should spend more money. I use it for music practice obout an hour at a time and it works well for that.
518,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones for the price.
519,4.0 out of 5 stars,The headphone sony is very good. Not bag.I recomend
520,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these to replace a slightly more expensive pair of headphones I bought a few years back. The sound quality is comparable. They are made pretty well for the price, and the chord is especially well made. Decent to above average sound quality for the price. If you're looking for an inexpensive pair of headphones to binge watch Netflix or Hulu with, you can't go wrong. Just got them today, and thus far, I'm very happy! Something else that has nothing to do with quality. I'm legally blind, and have trouble seeing the little L and R written on the headphones to distinguish the left phone from the right. Well, the left phone has a tiny little bump on it that I can feel that the right does not. I have no idea if this was done intentionally, but it is EXTREMELY helpful to me."
521,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are nice. Comfortable and fit perfectly.
522,5.0 out of 5 stars,good sound for the $$

535,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the headphones, they work very well on my laptop. However they don't work on my Galaxy S5. After I bought them I saw reviews say that, I guess I just assumed they would work. The jack doesn't stay locked in on the phone. Bummer."
536,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not loud at all, no bass and no clarity. Got it for $7 so no big loss."
537,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds great

543,4.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are great amazing if you say so but the cable need to be more strong it's to weak
544,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The quality is as good as a $15 pair of headphone should be, I use them mainly for my vocal booth,so they don't really have to be the best. Another thing is the cord is way to short.I'll be buying a aux cable extender next"
545,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones! The sound is amazing. Very comfortable on the ears. Ideal for any genre of tunes you want in your ears. Highly recommended!

*Update*

Do NOT buy these headphone. For $8.00 more you will have a world of better sound with these:
Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black)
Now, I cannot believe how much better the Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black) sound for just a few bucks more. Man, did I throw away $16.00 on the Sony's..."
601,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't beat the price/value
602,4.0 out of 5 stars,It works really well but often my ears hurt from listening through them for long periods of tim.
603,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound was OK, nothing fantastic. But after a few days of light usage something broke on the right headphone. Not planning to take them apart to see what happened. I'm going to return them. The quality is pretty laughable."
605,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awsome sound and price
606,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are very good headphones, the only thing that bugs me is the 90 degree plug, otherwise I'm getting close to the point where I can say that this has been the best pair of headphones that I have used, because they have lasted longer."
607,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound
608,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good
609,1.0 out of 5 stars,The head phone broke off in my phone . the small jack piece .
610,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
611,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the money
612,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product was made of cheap quality. It broke in few day after we started using it. The mic was producing echo and noise on the other side of the phone. I won't recommend it.
613,3.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are rather lackluster but they have a price that cannot be ignored.
614,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great sound, mic works flawlessly. No complaints at all."
616,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love them
617,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice for the price
618,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quick delivery and product is as advertised
619,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You get what you pay for , very cheap"
620,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, just not loud enough for me and or cancel out enough noise. I would say these a ok if you are in a some what quite room. mic works... feels fine on the head, not to write mom about, but it has a good feel."
621,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality for a good price
622,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product was as expected.
623,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely not ""extra bass"" but they're still pretty decent."
624,1.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones fell apart in about a month. Bought Sony headphones a set of 3 years ago while kids were younger and it lasted three years. That's why I bought this one. Not durable at all.
625,1.0 out of 5 stars,One of our pairs just quit working and he doesnt even use it that much
627,5.0 out of 5 stars,My second purchase. One for home and one for work. I use them for voiceovers in videos. Mic picks up voice very well. And they sound great too. Fits great. Soft ear pads. Headband easily adjusted to fit you.
628,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I bought these to replace a pair of ZX 100 headphones I managed to break about a week ago, after almost four years of regular use. They sound better than the previous model, which is a bonus. The cord feels sturdier. My only issue is that I'm worried I'll break the earphones off of the headband, as they swivel down instead of folding over sideways. That will be entirely my problem, however, because even that part of these headphones feels sturdy."
629,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony's for only $17? I thought-what a great deal! They're even well rated. I'm not sure by who though. The sound quality was just meh, and let it be said that these are ON EAR headphones. After 15 minutes I had to take them off because my ears hurt so bad. While wearing them the foam in the ear pads makes a crunching noise every time you move your jaw or facial muscles. They only fold up minimally, and they also don't come with a carrying bag or case (which for $17 is kind of expected.) If you're looking for on-ear headphones you should probably keep looking for something more comfortable."
630,5.0 out of 5 stars,"listen, i spend 15$ on this set of headphones. i have spent over 300$ on a set of headphones.

this thing is portable, i don't have to worry about wrecking these, sounds is solid,

and they are comfy, i can wear these for several hours without it hurting my ears.

solid buy for me, used on my macbook, and iPhone 6 plus, has a nice connection with extra room

for phone case plastic. cable is well made with durability in mind."
631,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiphile. I primarily use earbuds to totally block out all background noise, I'm wearing them now listening to Spotify to drown out my loud cow-orker that doesn't understand I'm not interested in his f***ing phone conversation. Anyway....

I slipped these on at home, again listening to Spotify, and discovered there are a lot of frequencies that buds can't reproduce. I really like these.

The combination of price and quality, to this point, earn it five stars."
632,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved the headphones, but the cord died after 6 months and I’m stuck with headphones that I needed to buy a new cord to plug into my iPad or iPhone, that’s a different color than the headphones.. I’m not happy with these. Will not purchase again"
633,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I give these headphones a 5 star rating for sound quality and comfort. Sound quality is amazing and they are comfortable on my ears. The headphones I had before I purchased these were the old model to these headphones and they lasted me a really LONG time, years. I was looking to buy that model and came across these. Newer version for less amount of money. The only drawback is, if you have a desktop computer the cord isn't quite long enough. I had to end up pulling the computer tower out and closer so the cord wouldn't pull. I had expected the cord to be longer (like the old model) but other than that, no issues with these headphones."
634,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two of these, a black pair for my teenager and a white pair for me. She uses hers with a gadget that makes hers into bluetooth connectable. That means she can listen to her music (if that's what you want to call it) and watch t.v. (American Horror Story? No thank you.) and I don't have to hear it. We both love the comfortable fit and great sound. Of course, they don't have the same sound as much more expensive headphones but, they are well built and deliver good quality sound."
635,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to replace other ear buds. I am the person that can not have ear buds in my ears for very long before my ears hurt badly. These work great and are very comfortable to wear, yes they are a bit bulky, but that is to be expected with this type of headphones. The sound is great, but it is nothing close to noise cancelling headphones. I didnt expect them to be for the cost of these. They are just what I expected them to be."
636,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are good but the inner part of those headphones gets damaged very soon. Same for all headphones of that kind. At least, those were not as expensive as disappointing and overrated Bose!"
638,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am extremely pleased with this headset. I bought it for two main purposes, listening to music on an iPad and plugging into a headphone amp while I practice what I laughingly call my guitar playing. The headphones excel at both, sounding much better than the admittedly good iPad speaker and faithfully reproducing the guitar's tones. (Though that last isn't always doing me any favors.) The headphones sound every bit as good as my gaming headsets costing four times as much. The bass is strong without being overpowering or artificial or distorted, midrange and treble are equally pure and balanced.

One issue that is a plus for me but maybe not you - the cord is very short. Great for iPad and guitar, not so much for gaming or work."
639,5.0 out of 5 stars,great
640,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding
641,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and very comfy on the ears. Bought these for young children and they love them!
642,5.0 out of 5 stars,Needed some affordable headphones for the family to use while on flights to/from Europe. These headphones did the job (comfortable and good sound quality) and didn't cost hundreds of dollars.
643,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very Nice. I love the sound of the speakers. I,m not an expert on music but the tone is marvelous. I just wish the wire was longer or that they would make them wireless."
644,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound. Fits great on my head, and awesome price."
645,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got my moneys worth , although the plastic its made of could be a little sturdier, but its something anyone can live with.."

647,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price these head phone have extremely good sound quality.
649,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had previously written a review saying the right side would go out with any jiggling of the cord. I'm not entirely sure what has happened (heated up, shook loose, etc), but the cutting out has stopped and the headphones continue to sound great!"
650,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice headphones for the price. Sound good.
651,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my husband he loves the sound great value for the price.

653,2.0 out of 5 stars,broke quickly
654,4.0 out of 5 stars,"('No Mic' review) For the price, a very good quality headphone. I have a larger head, and it fits me alright without too much pressure. Not the best out there for sure, but well worth the price and the sound quality is very good."
655,5.0 out of 5 stars,They're great no complaints at the moment.
656,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product
657,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought a pair of headphones similar to these nearly 8 months back but my niece thought it would be okay to break them. So I bought these and they work really well I especially love the microphone. Overall great buy for the price.
658,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good phones
660,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound!
661,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They are fine for an inexpensive over the ear. I bought them for outside work, the don't keep outside noise out much."
662,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The extra bass comes at the expense of the highs.
Muddy sounding vs bright.
Very good noise cancelling for telephone use in trains."
663,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible packaging. when i got my headphone the box was open. When I test them out, only the right ear works."
664,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are alright. Its good for the money you pay. But for a few bucks more (sometimes near the same price if it's discounted), I would recommend the Sennheiser HD 202 II."
665,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great pair of headphones. Audio is good and it is comfortable. Not too expensive either.
666,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for our 10 year old daughter who prefers on ear headphones and she loves them.

669,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything went fine. I am pleased delivery, quality, service. Thank you."
671,1.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones worked for a 6 months but have stopped working. These have not been abused or used improperly. They have a 1 year warranty but I have not heard back from the Amazon supplier.
672,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound was great while they worked. Stereo plug broke in less than two months.
673,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!
674,1.0 out of 5 stars,The aux connecting piece is loose. Constantly cuts off my connection with my iPod. Very annoying. If it just moves a little to the left or right the music stops. I wish I hadn't of bought them now. I cry at night.
675,1.0 out of 5 stars,ordered it received - put it on phone and only 1 side of the ear phone is working - so saad had to return
676,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value, look a lot more expensive."
677,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them! I use them for books and music on my Kindle Fire an also when I Skype. My hearing is not so great anymore and these are perfect.
678,1.0 out of 5 stars,After a few weeks use there is no sound out of 1 ear and I am unable to return do to seller's return policy. Sucks!
679,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding deal. Great sound and low price.
680,4.0 out of 5 stars,I'm not going to spend $$$ for a pair of headphones because some celebrities are wearing them. These work just fine.
682,5.0 out of 5 stars,A++++++++
683,5.0 out of 5 stars,ok
684,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound a bit muffle at low level
Not producing natural sound like the bose. Good bass"
685,5.0 out of 5 stars,EXCELLENT PRODUCT
686,5.0 out of 5 stars,FANTASTIC !!
687,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst headphones. They broke within two months. I wish I could exchange or return them.
688,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome headphones for the price.

690,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great, especially if you have a smaller head. :) I have a pair of these both at home and at work, and they're really comfortable. Sound is good."
691,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got this for $17 6 months ago and have been using them everyday they sound good are durable I highly recommend
693,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works for the inexpensive cost.
694,5.0 out of 5 stars,light weight worth the money
695,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product
696,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic sound from these headphones. Earbuds do not sound anywhere near as good as these do. Great range of sound and very good base. These are a steal for the price. Sound good with my Iphone 5S or sansa clip.
697,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price for good product
698,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work well
699,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound and fit great. For a cheap pair of head phone, you can't go wrong."
700,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The set we had broke after two months; the swiveling joint on the LH earpiece/speaker came apart on one side. I fixed it; just needed to find the small metal pin, reinsert it into the joint and screw everything back together. Unfortunately, it promptly broke again, so apparently ours was defective. I have been working with Sony Customer Service (not always an easy proposition- let's just say English is not the first language of their mostly otherwise helpful and courteous CS representatives) to get a replacement under the 90-day warranty. Had to call them twice in two weeks, then had to send the defective ones back at my expense to Sony. Quite frankly, not a stellar experience, there...
The design of the swiveling speakers is neat, and when it works, convenient for storage. Don't know if the issue we experienced is widespread or not. The headphones' electronics worked fine, and before we had the problem with the swivel joint coming apart, my daughter really loved them."
701,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not heavy duty but they get the job done. They fold up for travel.
702,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
704,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The size was as expected, but the sound was lacking definition."
705,4.0 out of 5 stars,good sound at a decent price.
706,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love them. Great price.
707,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They look nice, I haven't had a chance to try them out yet, since I can't get my MP3 player up and working."
708,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a my 2nd purchase of these inexpensive headphones (after my daughter swiped my first pair). Great for everyday use.
709,3.0 out of 5 stars,I have had these earphones before and the quality is great. The first pair broke and the second pair the left ear had no sound.
710,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are okay, but based upon the glowing reviews I thought these would be comparable to the AmazonBasics On-Ear Headphones. They are not! In the lower bass register, these headphones have a noticable lack of bass compared to the Amazon's. Also, across the mid and upper frequency range, these also can not compare to the Amazon's. Efficiency is lower as well. So, dollar for dollar, the Amazon headphone is a clear winner in my book."
711,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The cushy ear piece comes off easily, and doesn't go back on easily. The sound is better than the price would reflect."
712,5.0 out of 5 stars,Received in great condition!
713,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not high quality for audiophiles but the folding earphones make them easy to carry to monitor my Sony video camcorders.
715,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing head phones i always spend alot of money on cheap headphones and when i found them it was a miracle. They bend alot and the end of the cord doesn't stick up like most headphones. And the sound is amazing
716,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good.
717,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is good but the volume is so so.
718,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought them for my mom, she said they are so perfect!!"

721,5.0 out of 5 stars,headphones is good for privacy and listening pleasure
722,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for the price. My son loved these for his Christmas gift.
723,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony is King ,Very Good"
724,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones, music is clear and great sound. Comfortable to wear and soft on your ears."
726,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good headphones. They produce good, clean sound, presenting both high voices and deeper, more potent drums and bass. Excellent for the low price, though not quite up the level of the $200-$300 headsets out there."
727,5.0 out of 5 stars,work great
728,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really nice pair of head phones. Sound is great!
729,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice clear sound
730,2.0 out of 5 stars,This is a cheap Sony. It stopped working 38 days after getting it.
731,3.0 out of 5 stars,value for money
732,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my kids and they sound great.
733,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones arrived promptly and in good shape. They work well. They arrived on 10/29; I've carried them around in a backpack to a few places and so far they are proving to be sturdy; no loose wires or loss of sound in either of the ear pieces.
734,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall quite good.
735,1.0 out of 5 stars,Brand new and the right side doesn't work.
737,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work great.
738,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hurt your ears after 30 mins
739,5.0 out of 5 stars,great item for the price
740,1.0 out of 5 stars,Even at this price this is a poor quality product. It feels flimsy and the sound is of a muffled quality. Would not buy again or recommend.
741,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound out of headphones. Only issue is that the earphones hurt after sitting on the ears for a while, although this may be a personal issue. Can't beat the price!"
742,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My old headset's padding was flaking all over my head, it looked like a had patches of seaweed around my ears. So I decided to order a cheap headset and just decided on this one. Id prefer something that covers over the entire ear like my last headset, but I don't really mind"
743,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
744,5.0 out of 5 stars,husband loves them and says the sound quality for the price is awesome.
745,2.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap looking and uncomfortable. Sound is ok.
746,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price.
748,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an amazing stereo headphone for the price...The sound quality is really good...I would give the product 5 stars, but they are hot...Having said that, I live in S. E. Texas and we are hot as thunder down here...However, I'm looking forward to walking dogs this fall and winter using them...I'm a pet sitter and dog walker, so they'll serve a double purpose :) !"
749,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the headset - it's comfy, good sound, fits my iPhone, and almost fits my laptop - if I hold the button down while I listen, I can hear both channels when I'm listening to my laptop. Apparently the mini-jack is an updated version since my laptop - about 4 years. I still give the headset an A."
750,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones seem well built and sound nice for the price, however, mine stopped working on one side in under 3 weeks of light usage. Would recommend as the quality is very good for the price, though. Likely my case was isolated and customer service will fix it I hope"
751,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am happy with the sound . The cord could be longer, but I can live with it, I needed an adapter to interface with my receiver- fortunately
Radio Shack was still in business. The ear cups are minimal, not big and soft like some, but again I am getting used to them. Also the
phones kind of feel fragile-need to handle them gently. The description on the internet did not mention the size of the plug- I guess everyone
assumes you are using an mp3 player. Overall I am quite pleased with the quality & value"
752,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So it seemed at first that these were a great deal at a nice price. They are lightweight, but with clear sound, foldable, convenient. However, with light use (3-4 days a week for about 2 hours a day), they've stopped working after 6 months. We can plug them in, and if you wiggle the cord around *JUST RIGHT*, they'll work for a few minutes, but otherwise they've gone bad."
753,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is very good. The headphones look amazing for its prize. I looked for some cheap headphones with good sound quality and this were the best choice.

*If this review was helpful for you, please click on ""Helpful""*"
754,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because I needed a cheap pair of headphones for the gym. I had very low expectations, but WOW these have an amazing sound for the price (under $15)! Fit my head nicely too."
755,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift for my mother, who suffers with a hearing deficit from aging. She loves the clarity and needed volume boost that these Sony headphones bring. And the price...WONDERFUL INDEED!
Thanks folks!"
756,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound alright, but the build quality seems a little low, and the cans got scratched a little in transit because they moved around in the package a bit. They're minor, cosmetic, scratches... but I noticed them immediately upon opening the package. Kinda left me disappointed.

I take good care of my stuff."
757,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds quality is good on these, but be aware they are NOT loud. I wore them while using my airbrush with a very small, not terribly loud compressor and found it mostly drowned out the sound (cranked to full volume), which had never been a problem with most ear buds. I then tried to use then while mowing, and after attempting 4 different mp3s, had to give up and switch back to my old ear buds that came with a phone or tablet or something. I'd consider returning them, but they were like10 bucks, so I'll keep them for sitting at the computer and such, but I am disappointed."
759,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price!
760,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect quality
761,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. Trust the Sony name. I'd answer more questions but I can't hear you cause the music sounds so good!
762,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great price and great sound.
763,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work great
764,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product
765,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid product for the price. No where near Bose quality but a lot of bang for the buck. Generally comfortable although I prefer cans that cover the whole ear, 70's style."
766,2.0 out of 5 stars,They stopped working two weeks after I bought them
767,1.0 out of 5 stars,The quality of sound and equipment is not at all good
768,4.0 out of 5 stars,For the price very good headphones.
770,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product.
771,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these headphones! The sound is outstanding and they are very lightweight. They fold up and compact into a smaller unit for travelling and are nicely designed. Thanks for offering them.
772,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice bargain headphones. I bought two more pairs.
773,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No problems with this item, well made, very comfortable to ware, just what I ordered. See no problems on shipping, price very good, thank you."
774,5.0 out of 5 stars,good buy
775,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound and cheep.
776,1.0 out of 5 stars,The connector broke for no apparent reason after several months of very limited use. Noise cancellation was not perfect and the volume level was rather low while the product worked. I will not buy this headset again.
777,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works good.
778,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good
779,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works with Android and Apple. And Sound is Perfect!

782,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and great sound.
783,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are used and sometimes the sound fades and isn't as good as it should be, but when they're working properly they are a good set of headphones"
784,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressed by the quality of these headphones. They are not super loud but they are loud enough. You cannot beat the quality for this price!
785,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent headphones for the workplace. Comfortable enough to wear all day and sound is pretty good. They don't do much in the way of noise canceling, but that's good when you need to hear things at work."
786,5.0 out of 5 stars,Basic headphones but they work great and also good for phone conversations with the built in mic on the the cord. With earbuds people sitting next to me could hear the conversation and there's no issue with these
787,4.0 out of 5 stars,Did not fit into iPad that had a lifeproof case.
788,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this headphone very much. I can't use earbuds which are very availble to purchase. So I was delighted to find these and so happy they aren't expensive like those I had found. A great value for a fair price.
789,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the beat headphones in this price range
790,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are good for the money. Need a little power though..
792,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound at a great price. Dont be fooled into thinking you have to pay a lot for good sound quality.

797,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones to use with the ps4 for listening to music and talking to friends.
798,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had them for over a month now, they work much better than I even expected and the bass is as good or better than anything else you'd find in the price range"
799,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sorry nothing special. It serves it's purpose. If need you serious earphones, spend the extra money."
800,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice and quick....
801,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was delivered on time. And working as expected.
803,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound for very little money!!!
804,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, it's a no brainer. Enjoy"
805,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work really well quality sound for the price
806,3.0 out of 5 stars,its okay .. not bad for the price.
807,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well. Does not cover ears.
808,3.0 out of 5 stars,"can't complain, got these for under $10 for the kids, they are good for the intended users and purpose. :)"
809,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good fit and quality, good product"
810,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a very large head, and these are pretty tight. The sound quality is good, but if you have a big noggin I would suggest looking for a different set of headphones. These have me a headache after 10 min."
811,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sounding entry level headphone.
812,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy!
814,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and the cord doesn't get tangled.
815,3.0 out of 5 stars,It was okay. The cord that it has is very thin. Audio is okay.
816,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, better than earphones, and it's only ~$20. Only problem is that the left speaker broke after a few months. That probably wouldn't have happened if the jack were better built. If it weren't for that, it should have last multiple years, and I'd give it a perfect score."
817,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
Good sound quality for price
Cord is durable

Cons:
Not that comfortable for long periods of time"
818,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lost a $99 Bose (not noise-canceling). Replaced with these Sonys. Just as good - really. Bought another for my wife. A month later bought 2 more, figuring at some point we'll misplace them!"
819,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is okay on these, which was expected- they are $15. I didn't expect fantastic sound. However, I was upset because the comparison chart said the headphones would be over the ear headphones and I definitely received on-ear headphones. I feel like that was really misleading and should be corrected. I originally got these headphones because of the great reviews and I was sick of the headphone jacks on my dollar stores headphones. I can honestly say that the jack on these headphones is even WORSE than dollar store headphones. If I move even the tiniest bit, and even when I haven't moved at all, the sound will come out of the laptop speakers instead of the headphones. I willing to put up with the fact that these are on-ear, but the jack is annoying me so much that I was moved to write a review. I never write reviews. I thought I was making a better investment with these headphones, but honestly I'd rather stick with the dollar store ones. I am extremely disappointed with these- do your research before you by them instead of being blindsided by the good reviews."
820,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Volume has to be turned up a lot in order to get the full extent of the sound. Music can be heard from pretty far away, which isn't ideal."
821,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, product but can wear the headphones for longer than 20min without having to let my ears rest. But if money's tight theses are a really great ""Cheap"" option."
822,5.0 out of 5 stars,VERY GOOD
823,2.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working already.
825,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good Product
826,4.0 out of 5 stars,they work fine; and it's nice that they fold
827,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I only wish the ear pocket was a little larger... I have big ears... Other than that, they work great..."
828,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It took awhile to get used to the feel of wearing these after using in ear buds for so many years. The sound is great for the price, and they are ideal for watching movies on my tablet at night without waking my wife."
829,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ive been wasting so much money buying earphones that wouldn't last even two months. When I got this it lasted almost a year. Great headphones for just $20!
830,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They were perfect for my 11 year old son. Not too bulky, nice sound. They were a great price, too."
831,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are not Studio quality but they sure sound good.
832,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke after a few days of use.

837,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not Bad product...But I AM DISSAPPOINTED WITH MY AMAZON CREDIT CARD. INTEREST IS TO HIGh,from syncronity Bank...I have good credit.....Need a bettet rate of interest.Thank You."
838,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had sony headphones before and they lasted quite a few months and I thought these were the same ones I had bought before but from my surprise these aren't but they're even better than the ones I had. It really sticks to my head and great quality too. I like these a lot.
839,1.0 out of 5 stars,Will be returning.
840,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought 7 months ago. The metal plug in broke off in the tablet today. Seemed like a good pair of headphones, but it didn't last long."
841,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use these for gaming and they sounds and work great. Not much else to say about them. The mic works good and the sound is very clear.

843,5.0 out of 5 stars,works great
844,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
845,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my son 13 years old. He reports that they are great. ( he wanted beats but I was going to send 200 or so on headphones)
847,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for the price. Good sound and pretty comfortable. If they get lost or stolen, it is not the end of the world."
848,5.0 out of 5 stars,As usual the sound is great and its Sony!!!
849,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable. Decent bass.
850,4.0 out of 5 stars,A Lil more bass pls.
851,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not enough bass, rattling in right earphone, not the best buy, but it works nonetheless."
852,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had bought the MDRZX100 headphones; and I enjoyed them but the 110's goes to another level. I was expecting good, clear sound but I was completely surprised at the bass response. Great purchase."
853,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm hard of hearing and I use them to talk on the phone I'm my shop or office and they work great. Mic. Is good and the quality of the set is very good. The jack is not too fat to get in the hole with the otterbox on note 3 or I rhino on tab 4. Works great on I pad 2 and I used them on one of my scanners. No brainer deal of the price. Haven't listened to music on them yet but for the money you can't go wrong. Saw the ad and review on dippler and bought them right up. I hate ear buds and the falling out and waxing up and these fixed it for me.
854,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic! My brother stole from me; they were THAT good. Don't let the price fool you, these are good quality headphones. Thanks, Sony!"
855,2.0 out of 5 stars,I'm only keeping them as a back up pair. The sound quality is bad for the price.
856,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had it for awhile now and still holding up great, sound is good and comfortable on ears and the mic feature is clear when answering calls."
858,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are great!!
859,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the money, I don't think you can beat this headset. I am very happy with the sound
quality, again for the money. I use this headset while walking and it's, so far at least very
durable."
860,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not great. Just not great.
861,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product
862,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my son and am convinced that all headphones fall apart. They are not meant to last anymore. Very disposable. For their life span they were great.
863,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphone is very convenient because of the microphone. However, the sound quality is poor, and it even cause noise when I am listen to certain musics. I think it is not worth."
864,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product Great Price
865,3.0 out of 5 stars,"TONS of static on these, still looking for a decent pair"
866,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality for the price. I was pleasantly surprised.
867,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clear sound. Nice fit. Decent noise-canceling. Lightweight. Stellar value.
Not for people who need excellent bass drivers, and the headphones can get kind of uncomfortable after a half hour of use.
However, for less than 20 dollars it's hard to argue against getting these."
869,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You can buy any audio or video product with the Sony brand name with confidence and know you're getting a well-engineered product that will function very well for a long, long time."
870,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really excited to receive these but they lasted me 2 weeks before the headphone jack literally got stuck to my computer! When they worked they sounded great but the fact that when I pulled out the headphones the jack was still in my computer was really disheartening, Luckily I used tweezers to take the headphone jack out so crisis averted but can't say the same thing about the headphones. Needless to say not buying again...and I am beyond disappointed I wasted $15."
871,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these only for listening to CD's from my portable player...I am not an ""audiophile"" so my rating is only based on my personal evaluation and not any professional quality scale...they sound and work fine and are comfortable to wear ...others, more quality prone may have a different
evaluation, but again, they are just fine for me..."
872,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the way these headphones are so compact when you are finished using them. These were a course requirement and I didn't feel like spending an arm and a leg for headphones that would do pretty much the same thing. The jack is a bit fishy at times and sometimes, you hear static. But, again, these were required and the cheapest recommendation for my course. That's the only reason I bought them. And, I usually love all Sony products. I have several GREAT Sony products, so I am kind of disappointed with these."
873,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones have great sound quality for the price. The only thing I will say is that after about a year of use the chord starts to shorten out a bit. And that's after avid use as I wear them to workout at the gym four to five days a week for two hours a day. Great pair of reasonably priced headphones.
874,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was curious if there was a difference between these and a ""higher class"" set of headphones so I purchased these along side the
$70 Audio-Technica ATH-M30x. I first tried these Sony headphones on and was quite pleased. Nice bass response and good overall sound. I was satisfied.

But then I tried the ATH-M30x and noticed the difference immediately. These had much better dynamic range. The highs where a lot brighter and the lows were even lower and more defined. Most importantly the mid range (voices) sound much much clearer.

I tried these Sony headphones again and they sounded pretty bad now. I could really hear how bad the voices seemed muffled and all the treble I was missing.

I'm not suggesting to get the ATH-M30x, as I'm not sure if I'll keep those either (now I'm curious about a higher class headphones). I'm just saying when you compare the Sony's to other headphones they are actually not that good."
875,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good service by amazon. Item not damage during shipping. Item arrive mint in condition. Sound and voice quality is good. Great sony product with a good price point. Recommeded by my friend. But the downside is the wire is a bit fragile. The 2 wires below the the 2 ear cups on each side. If you set the headset down resting on those 2 cable connection to the ear cup. The wires will be easily damage. The weight of the headphone will be pressing down on the thin wire connection causing some static to the headset. Can be fix if you know how to open it and straighten the wire back. Got to be very careful how you set the headphone down. It's a Android headphone. If you want to use it with a PC, need to buy a audio mic splitter adapter like the creative had."
876,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my niece and she loves them. They fit perfectly and doesn't hurt her ears and it also blocks out sound.
877,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice sound but these are awkward when you're exercising. They don't stay well on top of my head unless I'm stationary so i end up trying to make them shorter/tighter. They also hurt my ears after about 30 minutes because they hit right on outside of auricle (and neither are my head or ears larger than typical). We bought 2 pair and my 7-year old son likes them a lot, perhaps because he's got smaller ears they fit him better? I gave my pair to my other son (13) and he also likes them for use gaming. Definitely worth it for that."
878,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the 4th pair of sony headphones I have purchased because we love them. I have 2 pairs at home and send a pair in with each of my children for school. These include a microphone so we will use them for the Raz kids assignments at home when my children need to read a story into the app. Great product.
880,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect way to hear and talk on phone.
Answered real problem."
881,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good sound. Definitely worth the price.
882,4.0 out of 5 stars,good sound
883,2.0 out of 5 stars,one of the headphone stopped working within 2 months
884,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for low price.
885,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love them as expected
886,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've used these a few times since I got them. They are great. Comfortable and the sound is great. I love the fact that you can fold them up. Makes it so easy to put in my laptop bag. I highly recommend them.
887,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for a child who is disabled. He loves them! The way they fold up to the sound quality!
888,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Would give it one star, but took account the low price. No mid-tones, and even ""crackle"" sound from both ears. Hello Goodwill!"
889,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't beat this value!
891,5.0 out of 5 stars,the best headphones I bought in relation to value
892,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate these headphones They are not NEARLY as good as the previous version that Sony is obsolescing, the Sony MDRZX100. Here's how Sony is cheaping out in the new design:

1. no strain relief at wire and ear cap -- more likely to break, i.e. crappier
2. plastic design of housing is molded to be more lighter and more hollow, i.e. weaker and crappier
3. new hinging design seems to be quite weak, less smooth and more shear-y (it's this weird, crappy plastic-om-plastic bearing), gives the tactile feel of crappier quality.
4. wires to aux have a thinner casing -- i.e. are crappier

Darnit, Sony, stop cheaping out and obsolescing the old design."
893,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price performer.
894,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones hug your head and have a great sound! They block out the TV that my husband keeps on for background noise, and I can listen to music in PEACE! Hehe .. I love them!"
895,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love them look good amazing price
896,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Was not blown away by sound quality, but they sound clear and the price was great."
897,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my kids. Great quality and price.
898,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than expected and the value is greater than I paid. Delivery was fast too.
899,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good cheap product. Sounds good. The cord could be a bit longer.
900,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very Good service+good Price,Work very nice! Thanks You so Much!!"
902,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice. Its good for general purposes.
903,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good bang for the buck.
904,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones! Why spend $100 more for Dre beats when these get the job done!
905,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable and clear sound, (for someone going deaf, I can't say how it would be for a professional.) Nice price for the quality."
906,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It sounded nice while it lasted, but after about two months of standard, regular use, the jack broke off from the rest of the plug and cord of the headphones."
907,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, inexpensive phones."
908,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent seller. Recommended
909,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Strong and good sound but quiet, just do not get loud."
910,4.0 out of 5 stars,nice for price.
911,1.0 out of 5 stars,One side stopped working after 4 days
913,5.0 out of 5 stars,cant go wrong for $7 and its a great pair of headphones
914,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these on May 15 on July 2 the right side stopped working.
915,4.0 out of 5 stars,very vell
916,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, jack went out after couple of months as to be expected."
917,4.0 out of 5 stars,not loud enough to use with my Sylvania DVD player but I have a hearing problem and hoped these would help.
918,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived on time and a great product!
919,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Works, but isn't really any different than using a pair of cheap earbuds."
920,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is terrible. Cheaply built. Would not buy again
921,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke after about two weeks
922,3.0 out of 5 stars,The fidelity isn't as good as I expected from Sony headphones.
924,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for my 5 year old to listen to her tablet.
925,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for the price. I just wish it came with a little bag to store it.
926,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first bought these last week the sound was great, one week later my left speker went out and the right one was nothing but static. so these head phones suck."
927,4.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for!!
928,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound for the price and the mic is a bonus.
929,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound but a little to small to fit over my ears. Good price though and I'm generally satisifed with the purchase.
930,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great.
931,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better sound than i expected with this low price! I will buy again.
932,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is good. Very thick cord with a right angle on the end made for a pleasant surprise. I bought them for my 7 year old and they fit him comfortably and the foldability saves room when on the go.
933,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For their price, these headphones are actually pretty good. I haven't had any issues with them at all. The folding isn't problematic at all and the quality is solid."
935,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones works great sound is good and they are comfortable to wear.
936,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good!
Thks."
937,1.0 out of 5 stars,can not adjust properly.
938,5.0 out of 5 stars,sound great
939,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In love with the bass, really nice piece for EDM"
940,5.0 out of 5 stars,"love these headphones, and I'm still using them!"
941,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound for a low price.
942,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ears muffs are pretty small and I do not have big ears! :(
943,5.0 out of 5 stars,the sound is great the price is great too!
944,5.0 out of 5 stars,very nice headphones for the money
946,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice headphones for a phone or laptop. Great headphones for the price, well made and the sound is very good. Surprising to get this quality sound at such a low price."
947,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They are a sleek design, but not very comfortable. I'll keep them on hand as a spare."
948,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have this headphones permanently plugged to my computer at my office. I use a switcher to alternate between headphones and speakers whenever I need to keep the sound to myself. I work on video editing, so I use these ALL the time. After almost two years they are still going strong with nice and crisp sound. I do not hear any distortion or buzzing. It's true what other reviewers mention, they feel a little cheap, but guess what? They are! I bought them fully knowing that they would be everyday working headphones and not leisure or audiophile ones, for that I spent a lot more money and got much better sounding quality. Even so, I took them home a few nights ago (I used a good case protector) to use while at bed and while I could clearly hear the difference between this pair and the good ones, I could still listen to my tunes without issue. They stay on my head at all times.

For $15 these are as good as it gets. Totally recommend them. If they break it is absolutely worth it to buy a new pair, the newer model even has a microphone for less than what I paid originally."
949,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's not bad for the price, but has some pretty bad sound leak at higher volumes, and what is this quality?

The photo attached is HOW THE HEADPHONES CAME IN. This kind of build quality is not okay, that is what I would expect from a used pair of headphones, not from a new pair.

Pros:
- Easy to use
- Comfortable to wear
- Folds up for easy storage

Cons:
- Single layer cable, is not braided
- Terrible QA, see my picture
- So-so build quality
- Leaks audio at higher volumes
- Shorter cable
- Presses on your ears

All in all, I guess I would buy it again, but maybe next time I'll give the MDRZX100 a shot because those were the ones that everyone was recommending, but I saw these and got these instead. I do believe these are cheaper than the older model though, so I'm not entirely sure."
950,5.0 out of 5 stars,ok for gaming
951,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hubby loved them so im happy great product !
952,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this headset . Great volume and clarity
953,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great deal.
954,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound could be louder and clearer but for the overall price they work very well. Easy to store as well.
955,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was to my 13 years old brother and now he can't listen anything without his headphones, so funny! when i tried it, i couldn't heard the outside, it was like only heard the music that is playing and for my is good."
957,5.0 out of 5 stars,great earphone i recomended to friends
958,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't go wrong with a Sony headphones
959,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great cheap daily use headphones. This is about my third pair.
960,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great in quality and fold to an easily manageable and smaller position so you can store it more easily.
961,4.0 out of 5 stars,good phones for the price
962,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Its working also with laptops...The sound its clear and the bass you will can hear pretty well...for this price, it deserves all the money."
963,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good basic headphones, the kids like them."
964,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price.
965,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good deal for the price
966,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great and suit my needs well. Lightweight and collapsible, I can take them with me when I need to."
968,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound for the price.
969,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gift for hubby, he loves them"
970,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just what I was looking for. Easy to use, comfortable and good sound."
971,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best choice I ever made buying these.
972,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds pretty decent, but wasn't as comfortable as I thought. My ears may not be suited to these on the ear type headphones. Found my ears hurting after an hour or so due to the pressure."
973,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son enjoys them.
974,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my son's computer lab class.
975,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Per description headset should cover the ear but it is on ear and very tight, start getting pain after a while and become red."
976,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not great headphones. In the past I bought much better and much stronger headphones for $12! I wish I could find those again. These don't even have a volume adjuster. I bought these because of all the great ratings but was disappointed.
977,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome pair of low-cost headphones. Sony quality at a no-name price. Comfortable with good sound performance
979,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really good product for the price!
980,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good headphones, so far. used for more than 2 months and going great."
981,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and work great! The kids fight over who gets to use them!
982,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great price
983,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good deal:) comfy and good sound.
984,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very light and comfortable. Exceeds my expectations, especially considering I got them for $10. I prefer these to the $70 over-the-ear headphones I bought a few years back, since those often leave my ears sore after a few hours. The sound is adequate for my needs. I am a writer and sit and write for long periods of time. I enjoy listening to classical music while I write, and these headphones suit that purpose well. I would purchase these again, and in fact, will likely purchase a pair to take with me when I travel."
985,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are okay for the price, I expected them to be a little louder though!"
986,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very nice headphones, I just wish it had a longer cord, but really nice"
987,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for the pricepoint. I have a pretty large head though so they're kinda tight but for most folks the fit will be good. sound quality is great as well
988,1.0 out of 5 stars,Came broken. Just one ear was working
990,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are SO nice, that my parents have found them and are now claiming them as theirs. Lol which works for me, at least they're happy. My nieces and nephews also like them, since they're small and fit over their small ears."
991,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for my son for his birthday it's the same kind that's at best buy but they only have it in white (kids and white oh no) so I bought the black ones online. They work great and fit them great I also like how they fold so when you put them away they are not real bulky. They even fit adult well too sometime I need to use them and they work great for me as well.
992,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sometimes, I use my Amazon Earbuds to listen to music in a restaurant or other places where I should be quiet, but these Stereo Headphones sound even better. I wish they'd bit in my vest pockets easier.

My ears are highly satisfied, and join my fingers in highly recommending them to you."
993,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not a bad headset. Works great with my xperia z3. My phone is picky when it comes to headphones/headsets. This works great and it holds a clear conversation.
994,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As headsets, they work fine. Sound is clear and audible. There is no ""Extra Bass"" as the title suggests. The construction is lightweight, but somewhat cheap feeling. For a regular listener, I would recommend. For someone used to Beats, or even Bose, I would stay away. the price is nice, but the quality is lacking."
995,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for music listening, bad for music making. Despite what ever reviews say, these are not even close to a flat response; there is a ton of bass. My pair was only good for about an hour before one side cut out as well. Returned and not replaced....I'll look elsewhere."
996,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll start with the good things: they are a very good set of headphones (for the money). they have good sound quality for $20 headphones (the bass was a bit lacking but...). now let's talk about the bad things. they broke, and not in a ""oh crap they snapped in half"" kind of way. more like they just stopped working. it was most likely my fault and that's why i'm giving it a four star review but i still feel like they could have lasted longer. i mean sure they lasted awhile for the money but still SIX MONTHS. thats all i had them for. i already ordered a replacement that is ten times the price. the Logitech G933 Artemis Spectrum."
997,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audio specialist but for my purposes, these on-ear headphones are great! I use them with my iPod, computer, etc. They're light weight and provide above average sound quality; especially at the higher ranges, where many other ""economical"" models sound shrill. This one doesn't, and the bass sounds great. I highly recommend them for anyone who can't use in-ear headphones or earbuds, especially for this price!"
998,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound and easy to pack. It adjusts to just what I need with just a gentle adjustment.
999,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these headphones barely two months ago and already they are starting to malfunction. The plug has some issue so the sound sometimes shuts off in one of the ears. Now I am not someone who mishandles my headphones: I had one pair of headphones for well over a year before they stopped working and I ended up buying this one. For this one to start acting up after less than two months tell me that the product itself was faulty, considering that I haven't even been using it as much as I have used other headphones in the past. I wish I could get my money back."
1001,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound quality and comfortable.
1002,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice quality, great sound for $20, but easy to tell they are cheaply made. The plastic connecting the two headphones feels like it could break at any moment. Other than that, if you're looking for cheap headphones that still sound great, these are it!"
1003,4.0 out of 5 stars,work great and good sound for the price you pay.
1004,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product and prompt shipping, thanks so much!"
1005,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, but hurt my ears after a while. Too tight."
1006,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Surprisingly, the sound quality is extremely good. Compared to Apple iPhone or Beats headphones, these are a welcomed experience."
1007,5.0 out of 5 stars,These ear phones were recommended by my tablet guru friend. He knows what he's talking about. Really good sound for the money.
1008,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best headphones I have ever owned to date. Extremely good bass response.
1009,5.0 out of 5 stars,For another grandson and he loves it.
1010,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything said in the description is true. Good product, good price. That's all that needs to be said."
1012,5.0 out of 5 stars,make the music sound real good really impressed
1013,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use them every time at the gym, great sound , it fits great in the head without falling or moving , and i can listen to music and talk on the phone with the push of the button on the cord."
1014,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work great and reasonably priced.
1015,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well. A little smaller than expected. Fits on my ears rather than covering over.
1016,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
1017,5.0 out of 5 stars,9.99??? best deal ever. bought these for the kids. sounds great.
1018,5.0 out of 5 stars,works great
1019,2.0 out of 5 stars,The grips are too loose and Ear buds are small to feat into head. In the pictures it looked great but not in reality. Not happy with this product. Sorry!!
1020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got them as a birthday gift for my dad in January and he loves them. The mic works great and he loves the clarity and sound quality of the headphones.
1021,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Felt cheaply made, however the sound and comfort for the point are great."
1023,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my husband for the computer. He loves them. Comfortable and good quality for the price.
1024,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Work wonderfully, but could use a longer cord."
1025,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very cheap plastic and very low volume. Save your money.
1026,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After 4 months of normal (not everyday) use, right ear stopped working. Sony is giving only 90 days of warranty for this product so I had to throw it away."
1027,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones! Definitely one of the best options at this price range
1028,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones, just note the cord seem to be a little shorter than other headphones I have purchased before."
1029,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price these give the best sound quality
1030,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great base sound for only 15$ well worth it. They fit perfect and can use them for a couple hours without having them hurt my ears.

1032,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clear sounds. I really like it.
1034,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound. I can plug it into my computer and listen to music, then into the phone to take a call. Very convenient."
1035,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Price is good. But the audio quality is below my expectation. So, just OK."

1042,5.0 out of 5 stars,"GOOD SOUND TO THEM, CLEAR, NO STATIC"
1043,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Though the headphones worked fine, they should add another foot or two to the cord. It is so short I couldn't comfortably work at my desk with the computer directly underneath with the length provided."
1045,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My brother enjoys these headphones. They are cheap, but much better than other ones around the same price."

1052,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect! Exactly as described, awesome sound. Mic is good for online gaming and at a fraction of the price of expensive gaming headsets and can take anywhere. Guess just wish there were more color choices."
1053,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is really good but I find it tends to be a bit quiet to my tastes. I like my music incredibly loud, but if you're looking for some easy listening these headphones will go great."

1056,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They are junk and come with a 30 day return policy. By the time I checked them out, it was too late to return them. One ear doesn't even work."

1059,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not a bad pair of headphones. Great sound quality and comfortable. Microphone is also great for phone calls or skype. My only complaint is if you are listening to loud music im sure the person next to you can hear it too.
1060,2.0 out of 5 stars,didn't like
1061,3.0 out of 5 stars,Cord is short and lasted about 2-3 months before breaking. Good sound poor build.

1065,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy them. Just as good as super high-end headphones for a fraction of the price.
1067,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable and light weight for use with laptop. Not 5 stars because when listening to music loud, person sitting next to you can hear the sound."
1068,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good
1069,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It was just what I needed - Clear reception, fits well, not too expensive, I just needed it to listen to the dialogue on films I watch on Kindle Fire - not for music."

1079,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect so far
1080,5.0 out of 5 stars,Long lasting Headphones
1081,1.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones sit in the ear. You can hear everything around you. I'm sure everyone hears you too. They're not loud at all. I wouldn't even say their a medium. The bass is pretty much obsolete and the speakers rattle. They're cheaply made and easily fall apart. Very fragile. I find that shopping for headphones on Amazon has become a task because the item is always broken when it arrives. I found a better pair for 23 bucks at a local store. The mic doesn't work well at all and people say they cannot hear me clearly. Consider spending an extra 40 on a good pair or visiting a local store.
1082,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor material and build, make it feel like fake Sony product."
1083,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great brand and worker great for the month than no more they died out
1084,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are pretty good headphones. The cord feels kind of flimsy but the sound and comfort is 5/5.

1091,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the headphones
1092,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son uses them in school and they are recommended by his teacher.
1093,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work amazingly well. Get a warehouse return. The package is a bit crinkled but they work amazingly well.
1094,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones rock, they were for my son and he and I fight over them. I love bass and for the first level headphones, the bass is awesome."
1095,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very good headphone for the price. I have an earlier version and my wife got this one and likes if very much. It helps to block out external noises making listening easier.
1096,3.0 out of 5 stars,For the money they work OK the comfort is superior for the price
1097,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT SOUND
1098,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great set of headphones for a cheap price. My brother uses them all the time.

1102,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clear sound and very comfortable ear pieces
1103,4.0 out of 5 stars,"good quality headphones with more than decent sound , a little uncomfortable after prolonged usr but overall very nice"
1104,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can finally throw away the headset that came with my Walkman !!!! Sony products rock.
1105,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for its price😊
1106,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my boyfriend and he is super impressed. Very happy with this purchase :)
1107,5.0 out of 5 stars,These hold up to the abuse a 7 year old can dish out.
1108,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Headphones!!
1109,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice
1111,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have gone through too many headsets because of broken wires at the input point - I truly love this product, and - it's comfortable and the sound is excellent."
1112,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had a pair like these for a few years now but got tired of moving them from desktop to laptop so I bought a second pair. Great stereo sound in both pair!
1113,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It does its job. It does not have the best quality, but with under 17 bucks, great bang for the bucks."
1114,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good for $15. Using with Netflix on PC and sound is good. Cord is only three feet long so you have to be close to audio source. Works great with iPhone.
1115,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, but not as nice of a design or cool look as I was expecting, If you want an extremely simple, plain, but good sounding headphones, then these are for you. For me, I enjoyed the Skullcandy Lowrider Headphones more for about the same price. They have a bit cooler look, and extra padding that is especially nice. The sound is about the same.
Skullcandy Lowrider Maroon/Brown/Copper On Ear Headphones"
1116,5.0 out of 5 stars,These seem to have very good frequency response. It really adds a lot compared to listening with earbuds or small speakers. They are a little uncomfortable after a while.
1117,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just love these headphones. Even though they're less than $20 they wow my ears better than the generic ones for similar price, & they are sturdy to. Before these I was buying a new pair every couple of months. Top it off they're comfortable. I tend to forget they are there sometimes."
1118,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are actually pretty good. I've been using this style of headphones for years now, and I usually buy in this price range, as they tend to break after about a year from normal wear and tear. These are one of my favourites in my price range.

Some of the things I like are the soft ear pieces. I wear glasses so generally after a while my ears will start to ache when I use headphone. I can wear these much longer than most. The sound quality is good, although I wouldn't call them totally noise cancelling. The folding parts aren't amazing, but it saves a bit of space.

All in all a great pair for the price."
1119,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Head Phones and The mic works great too. Bone Jaring bass clean highs and no muddled sound. These sound like they cost much more than they did. The mic will not work with a laptop or other computer, it's made for a small triple right connection like in a Cell Phone (look at the plug to see all 3 rings). Light weight great sound and great microphone = no complaints."
1120,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Wrapping the cord around them is a bit troublesome. They are quite comfortable. I sometimes use these with my head resting on it's side on a pillow, if that says anything."
1122,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice stereo son
1123,5.0 out of 5 stars,Much better then my buds
1124,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's not the ""quality"" Beats by Dre but it gets the job done. Sound is good. I primarily use it when working out. No issues."
1125,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice product...reasonably priced, good sound, nice fit. They withstand the abuse I give them...I use them at work so they get tugged on and snatched off frequently...no probs yet."
1126,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great volume.
1127,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for the money
1128,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had this product for one day and I left the headphones plugged into my iPad. I placed the iPad and headphones in my bag and placed the bag on a chair. The bag that it was in slipped out of the chair and fell to the ground and the headphone jack broke off in my iPad. I called Sony to explain what happened and they refused to give me a replacement. I would give everyone a word of caution. Buy at your own risk, because Sony will not replace or refund after having it for just one day."
1129,4.0 out of 5 stars,"great quality; foldable, will take little space when folded; great for travelers; probably the best quality you can get in this price range ($10 on Amazon)"
1130,4.0 out of 5 stars,quite comfortable
1131,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter's father ordered these for me and I love them. Great sound for under $20, comfortable, and I like how they fold up and fit conveniently in my bag."

1138,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my husband he loves the sound and the fact it works very nice with his Samsung 3 phone, I can't complain his happy."
1139,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are a steal! It's amazing how Sony can build such a high quality product and charge such a low price.
1140,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT
1141,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are excellent with music but I don't like where the microphone is. on them.
1142,5.0 out of 5 stars,"awesome deal, last pair lasted 4 years of hard use"
1144,4.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones met my expectations. I have had no problems and enjoy using them. I would recommend these headphones to anyone wanting good headphones at a great price.
1145,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for my daughter May 1 and the right side stopped working within two weeks. That was quick smh
1146,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Headphones.

1149,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy and price well made very happy.

1152,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the money, these headphones sound great. Definitely recommend these!"
1153,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible headphones at a great price. They sound like they cost much more. Pick these up if you need something affordable yet high quality.

1166,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast shipping, excellent product equal happy customer. For a affordable price these headphones are great. I'm glad I gave it a chance."
1167,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave it 5 stars because of the price and sound quality. If these cost $50 instead of $15 they would get maybe 2 or 3 stars. But with these I apply the 80/20 rule.....at 20% of the price of higher end headphones you still get 80% of the quality. With the 80/20 rule its the other 20% of quality that can really drive the price up :-)

Build Quality; Good enough, little cheapy/plasticy. The padded ear pieces are good enough, and the chord is a nice bonus as its thicker (less prone to damage and tangeling). One mark against them is I found the padding to be a little too much, making my ears a little warm after a couple hours. Some headphones have less padding and a more open design.

Sound; With brands like Bose and Beats I expect a bias in terms of sound profile (eg. too much hi/lo, too much bass, etc...). With the Sony's, the profile is pretty even from the low to mids to highs. Songs with heavier bass sounded fine, with the bass neither under or over emphasized. In terms of quality there's no noticeable distortion. Nice and clean.

If Sony built these with slightly better materials, and added more emphasis to the bass and treble, they could probably sell them for $50+. And, I'm sure they do."
1168,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For what they are, they deserve 5 stars. I'm more of a habitual user of earbuds, but I wanted a set that I use specifically and only for around my house. For the longest time, I used one pair of earbuds for everything, which led to me constantly having to go to my car or back into the house to get them. For starters, these headphones are very well built! The wires are relatively thick, but not obtrusively so, and the plastic feels very rugged and durable. They are extremely comfortable. I was skeptical of their comfort level considering they don't fit over the entire ear, but the cushy pads work very well. I have no problem wearing these for hours. The sound quality is quite nice. Now I will admit that my buds have a little more sonic depth, but don't worry 13 year old boys- this has good bass, the most important musical quality for anyone under 16. The sound quality is, at most, 4 stars, but I didn't expect perfection (nor did I intend on using these for my music player). These are perfect for watching movies, shows, or YouTube. The fact that they fold up is just a fun little bonus. If you just need a set of headphones for generalized computer use, I can't see you doing wrong with these."
1169,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been buying this particular style of headphones from Sony for no less than 5 years. We are a family of ten with a lot of gadgets and gizmos that require headphones. Plus several youngins' who need headphones for school. This latest adaptation is slightly different from the original in that the cords are flat. Performance though continues to be outstanding. We only ever need to replace these because they've been lost. In the no less than 5 years we have been purchasing these we've purchased other ""top quality"" brands that just do not offer the sound quality or comfort that these do. Frankly, the price is always right and as long as the product is able to withstand a family that includes and bunch of little ones we will continue to purchase well into the future. You will not go wrong buying these Sony headphones."
1170,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are the definition of ""bang for your buck."" I actually own their predecessor, the MDR-ZX100. There is a little more bass than the 100s, but it's not going to blow you away. The cans do a good job of delivering music at high volumes with no distortion. The jack is more slender than the 100s, and should fit into most iPhone cases (fits into mine with no problem). The inline mic picks up my voice just fine, but note there are no volume controls. Just one button to wake up Siri or to pause music. The 110s also fold up a little more nicely than the 100s, and they will fit nicely in my backpack while laying flat.

I suppose if there is a drawback, it's that Sony used a glossy plastic for the exterior of the cans. That means you'll have fingerprints visible. But that's all I can think of as as drawback.

Overall, if you are looking for a replacement for an aging set, even if they are the 100s, I'd say go for it. If the inline mic is not something you think you'll use, there's a version without one that will save you a few bucks."
1171,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones worked well with my Android smartphone (Droid Maxx) and tablet (Nexus 9). However, when I switched to the iPhone 6S, the smartphone started to engage Voice Control for no reason and with no physical intervention. The Voice Control would occur randomly whenever the headphone plug is rotated, which would occur if you were exercising or just moving around. I had the iPhone 6S replaced per Apple warranty, and the same symptoms occurred with the second iPhone 6S. I then used a different headphone on my iPhone 6S, and it worked fine.

So be wary on using this headphone on an iPhone with headphone jack..."
1172,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received these. I got them primarily for use on my computer, mostly just listening to videos but also to use with voice recognition software, so I got the one with the microphone..

I'm not an audiophile, but I did want decent sound in case I use them on a music player. They sound just fine, as you would expect from Sony, especially at this price point.

I'm quite happy that they work very well with Dragon NaturallySpeaking, which I'm using to dictate this, so the microphone is quite adequate.

What is nice is that the microphone is on one of the wires and it is not more than three or 4 inches from your mouth. Again quite happy with the fact that it works quite well with Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

I can't see me using this for telephone calls. For some reason I don't feel comfortable with over the ear headphones, or earbuds for calls. I don't get a real sense of feedback to be able to modulate my voice. For phone calls I prefer a single ear unit.

The big disappointment is that, like so many Sony headphones I've had in the past these things are so tight, it squeezes your head like a grapefruit. What I've done is take a hairdryer to the headband to heat up the plastic, and attempt to bend it a bit to loosen it up. I've had some success in making them more comfortable. At least this plastic is somewhat malleable, because I found that some of the other plastics are almost impossible to bend without breaking.

For me they'll do the job quite well for something under $20.

After wearing them now for just a few minutes I remember what I hate about most headphones. The vinyl earpiece cover always make your ears hot.
Now I'm on the search for foam or cotton cover to go over these."
1173,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are some of the best headphones you can get this side of $50. Great sound, sturdy cable and connector, and very affordable. I got a pair for listening to Chopin at work and have been very happy with them. Comparing these against a set of bose on-ear headphones, the bose do have a noticeably better sound, especially if you're like me and prefer to listen to music in FLAC. Otherwise, on just mp3 these will fit the bill nicely. While these don't have noise cancelling, like the bose, they do get quite loud and don't have noticeable distortion. Lastly, while comfortable these do get uncomfortable if you're wearing them for more than 3 hours at a time. So that's you, the most comfortable headphones I've had were the bose in-ear buds due to the silicon inserts. However, those headphones died after two years because it had junky wiring and didn't hold up to getting tossed in a backpack the way these have. But at this price point, there's an incredible amount of value to these."
1174,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are JUST what I was looking for: a budget set of commuter headphones. I need headphones that are closed, so as not to bother the people sitting next to me on the subway. Sound leakage on these is negligible. Thumbs up.

I need headphones that are smallish, and foldability is a plus. These are smallish and they fold easily. Another thumbs up.

They are lightweight, and feel a bit flimsy, so I would expect they will not stand up to much abuse. Luckily I have a headphone bag to keep them in when they're not on my ears or hanging around my neck.

I also wanted headphones that are not garish. These have a simple, classic and understated design that will not draw attention to themselves or look dated in a couple of years. Thumbs up.

The sound: so far, I'd say the sound is very good, especially for such inexpensive, closed phones. I'm listening to some Van Halen and the frequency range is good, with lots of punch and lots of presence. Another thumbs up.

Not sure I buy into the whole ""burn-in"" mantra, but I'm interested to see if they sound better in a week or two. Also curious as to how they'll handle other music styles (classical, jazz, etc).

So, first impressions: this is a GREAT set of budget commuter headphones. Superior, in my opinion, to ear-buds, which I can't stand.

EDIT: Ok, first real negative. The hard plastic headband is not comfortable after a little while. I'm going to have to superglue some padding to make them more comfortable."
1175,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nice cheap set of wired headphones from Sony. The do what they're supposed to do, deliver sound in to your ears from whatever device you've plugged the 3.5mm audio jack in to. I use it to listen to audio from my laptop in bed when watching Netflix/TV/etc. while my spouse watches the regular TV. They are on-the-ear headphones so they probably won't be the most comfortable to wear for long periods of listening but they work just fine for me in short stints. I like that the jack is an L-shape so it doesn't just stick right straight out from whatever device it's plugged in to."
1177,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have large ears but these probably won't fit over-the-ear as described on most people with normal size ears either. However, they will stay snug to your ears with loud and great sound regardless. I was really surprised that headphones this cheap could be this great. This is the first time any electronics have exceeded my expectations in decades since most companies purposely misrepresent, i.e. falsely advertise, their products like the Amazon Fire Stick that won't even work properly with Amazon Prime videos, let alone all the other streaming services. Let's see how long this review stays up after I just told everybody the Fire Stick is pathetic."
1178,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones. I purchased these for people at my work trying to be able to block out noise and to be able to do online training. They are lightweight, not clunky at all, and work well. The sound quality is nice too. Don't be fooled by how cheap they are, they still are quality."
1179,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as comfortable to wear as suggested in the product description. Sound quality is very good but it is difficult to wear them for extended periods of time. Rather disappointed but am keeping them
1180,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love that these fold up. I've had them for around 6 months now and they still work wonderfully! Great for if you need over ear headphones that won't break the bank.
1181,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these things for a couple of years now. You honestly can't beat the quality for the price. They're comfortable, and they sound good enough for work headphones. I haven't had any durability issues despite a few drops."
1182,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is mostly not bad, but in just 18 months of use the right earphone stopped working, unless you jiggle the cord close to the plug in some special way. If you're listening to stereophonic music this is completely unacceptable. Nothing happened to this device; it just stopped working properly one day."
1183,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price - these are the best! They have a relatively flat response and they don't sound as good as other more expensive headphones like Beats. But they do the job well. I think they sound better with classical, blues, acoustic music than they do with bass-heavy styles like hip-hop.

They are very comfortable and look great."
1184,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap as gas station headphones, but sound considerably better than the gas station ones.

Short, but sturdy, cable.

I have a giant head, but they fit ok when fully extended.

Won't be winning any contests with higher range headphones, tinny, they crack on rare occasion, but serviceable. I bought them primarily to bring to places where people might try to steal my headphones, like business trips."
1185,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Delivered as promised. Very satisfied with these headphones. I plan to use them on future plane trips, so the folding feature and ear coverage to help block out the ambient noise is very important."
1186,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Simple yet effective. Only thing that surprised me is how quiet these are at higher volume settings on my iphone. I don't need music super loud so I don't care too much about that. The single button w multi function works like a charm. They arnt too sturdy, but they fold flat which is great for backpacks etc. and for the price, you can't beat it."
1188,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, you really can't beat these things. I have some really, REALLY nice studio headphones for when I'm doing audio mixing or I want to listen to something and make a really big thing about it, but they're much more bulky and I'm always afraid that I'll damage them somehow.

These headphones were meant to be a cheap alternative that I could use at home. They sound really nice! I got another pair for work as well."
1189,5.0 out of 5 stars,"they might be cheap but they're excellent. sony is my go-to for headphones and these don't disappoint. the sound is full and rich (maybe it's just my awesome music...), they're not too tight but don't feel like they're going to slip. they fold flat which will be handy for traveling. $15 is a great price for these. i'm almost happy my other ones got smashed. :)"
1190,5.0 out of 5 stars,great
1191,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very surprised at how good these sound especially for the price point.

For years I have been enjoying my also inexpensive Koss Titanium Pro25 headphones. Cheap but good triumphs over excellent and expensive for me because I have many opportunities to lose my headphones.

These sound a bit ""cleaner"" to me, the music and spoken word are more distinct for some reason.

I recommend them to you!"
1192,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son uses for school-they use blended learning where the kids have some lessons on computers so he uses them several times a day. They block out outside noise and have good sound for cheap headphones. Plus they are not expensive so if they get broken, it's not a huge loss."
1193,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great sounding headphones. There is a ridiculous slew of endorsed, unbelievably overpriced, bad sounding headphones out there lately. Don't be silly and stick with the tried and true. If you need to pick a status symbol, pick something other than headphones.
How about a face tattoo? ...
Please do consider these things carefully."
1194,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great! It's a good price for a great product. I have had these headphones for a few months now and they still work great, and I have even dropped them a couple times. The headphones are adjustable and very comfortable to wear. I was suprised by how clear the sound was a first, these are definitely high quality headphones, I would definitely recommend them."
1195,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Can't beat the sound for less than $18. Clear with just enough bass. Yes, you can spend more money. Yes, you might get better sound. You won't find better sound at this price. They are also solidly built. They flatten easily for storage and are comfortable to wear. I use these for recording. I can hear myself and my music clearly."
1196,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable and great sound! I bought these for my own 2nd grader, after my 7th grade students told me how much they loved them. The ones my students have been using have lasted well...and those kids aren’t always kind to them."
1197,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've lost and left behind the more expensive ones over the years so I got these. They work just fine and sound very good. They fold up nicely and fit in my backpack easily for easy access. The cord seems to be more durable than my more expensive headphones. If I loose these I would not hesitate to purchase again.
1199,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Sony loyalist. I am not an audiophile. I am rugged on the electronics I use (see clumsy and oafish.)
I have tried the other value brands of over the ear headphones.
You get more than you pay for with this product.
Or at least more durability."
1200,2.0 out of 5 stars,"these headphones have very mediocre sound quality, and are very quiet. These do not muffle any outside sounds, but they're comfortable enough. if you need a throwaway pair of headphones, these could work, they also feel very cheap. For a Sony product I would expect something better."
1201,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are our favorite headphones for our children ages 12 and 5. We have three sets now. They fold up nicely and fit in the pocket behind the seats in the car so we always have them handy for traveling. My daughter also folds up a pair in her school bag to have for a long bus ride back and forth. I first bought them when they were on sale and then went back a few months later and bought another set at full price because I was so happy with the quality. My kids go through ear buds/headphones quickly as they are young and tough on them. We still have all three sets of these we working well close to a year later.
1202,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent headphones for the money for studying or listening to music when you want the sound to be more immersive and enveloping. There are way better headphone out there, but these do the job."
1203,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality of these headphones is absolutely amazing for the low price.
I bought these for my 10 year old son as basic headphones for school and using as handsfree with a cell phone, but listening to music he and I were both amazed - these sound much better than my $100 Monster Headphones.
I was so impressed I bought a 2nd pair for myself!
The treble is a bit light, so boosting treble in the music player gives an even better balanced sound, this is probably due to emphasis of the extra bass - the bass is great, full and thumping.
The sound stage detail is also excellent and expansive, you can really pick out each instrument and singer.
Enjoy!"
1204,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are ok for a set of headphones that you use casually. I needed them for studying in a noisy apartment and they worked pretty well. Needless to say, they are not high quality. They are a lightweight plasic and are rickety and cheap looking. They can be uncomfortable during long term wear but the sound is decent."
1205,4.0 out of 5 stars,Its rare that I spend money on high dollar headphones. I have had great luck with Sony headphones. I needed a cheap set for my desk as work and have been extremely impressed. The sound quality from these headphones is on par with my previous $50 set from Sony so I am happy about that. My only complaint is the ear cups could havve slightly more cushioning to make me happy. For $17 i am extremely happy and certainly would purchase another set should i lose these on my commute home.
1206,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic headphones. I bought two pair; one for work, one for home and I am very glad I did. The sound quality is very good and after the initial itchiness, of having something covering my ears, I find they are very comfortable. They do not block outside noises but I have no problems hearing my programs or music at low volume.
I highly recommend these headphones!!"
1207,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I want to start off by saying that I'm a bit of a bass head. I like strong heavy bass that doesn't sound like the headphones are breaking. These headphones don't do that for me. They don't get loud enough for me to truly enjoy the music and though the bass is not terrible, I'm not able to enjoy it because of the low sound. But, if you aren't specific about sound I would still say don't get these, Sony has a pair for 10 bucks that is not bass boosted but sounds basically the same. You can enjoy your music just the same with the cheaper ones."
1208,5.0 out of 5 stars,quality headphones at a real bargain price how could I let that get away? thank you for having just what I needed the old head phones were shot
1210,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not sure if I just received a bad pair but the volume capability on these is somewhat low. I am currently listening to music on full blast (something I rarely do) and it still sounds fairly quiet. The overall quality is pretty good, though. The headphones are VERY comfortable and the microphone works well, too. My only real complaint is the volume, which is only about average, but adequate."
1211,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am using these exclusively on my PS4 and they work beautifully. Game audio sounds great and my friends say my voice sounds super clear through the built-in mic. I'm glad I didn't get any real gaming headsets like Turtle Beaches because these Sony ones do the job just fine.

I also tried them on my Galaxy S5 for music with the Poweramp app and it also sounds great."
1212,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Other people compared this H.P. to beats and bose. I haven't heard to either one so no comment on that. I purchased it cause of that review.
I compared it to the unit I have the Koss Porta Pro. No comparison but of course it's not fair since Koss cost three times as much. For the price I think sony is good but I regret buying it."
1213,4.0 out of 5 stars,Inexpensive but decent quality sound for under 20 bucks. Like the folding feature fits nicely in the backpack. A HUGE plus is the angled plug-its much more durable than the better sounding sanheisers but the sanheisers have a plug which plugs in perpendicular to the computer and fails after only a month or two making them totally useless.
1214,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These phones are a great deal for the money. I usually don't like Sony products but these are pretty good. I use them at work, plugged into either my computer or iPhone and they sound pretty good. Haven't had any complaints about the mic either. conversations are nice and clear and music sounds pretty good for a cheap pair of headphones."
1215,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this set of headphones exclusively for making phone calls on my iPhone 6s Plus. I could not hear on my phone and others couldn't hear me, but this set of headphones eliminates that problem. This mic seems to be just the right sensitivity and the sound is great for calls and music. The price is great too!"
1216,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know much about the technical stuff, I just know that these work well and the sound is great. I also appreciate that they will fit my head! My head is kind of small and many headsets will not adjust small enough. They work well for my husband, too. (He's got a normal head. :-p)"
1217,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones, i wanted something I could occasionally watch movies on my PS4, and play PS4 games with, this did the trick perfectly, You can really hear the stereo surround sound in action movies and anime, and the microphone works great talking to other players while gaming, it is real clear and crisp. It's comfortable for me for a couple of hours, after that it can get a little uncomfortable but I'm not complaining because that can be said for any headphones since they are made to be worn on your head over your ears. I'm glad I didn't spend $100 on an expensive pair, because these sound just as good to me."
1218,5.0 out of 5 stars,A replacement item for my 70 something year old mother. She liked her original one so much that she asked for another one. She tells me that it's the only headset she has tried that she can hear the news reporter clearly.
1219,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for my sons birthday and a month later 1 side of the headphone fell off! And of course it has been little over a month and they wont accept returns.
1221,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely can recommend this headphones! For the price you pay you get good quality. Pay attention: have to use them as you receive them because you might get by mistake a pair that malfunctions, like I received in the dirt place. The replacement was very simple and easy tot do, and very fast."
1222,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great. They're comfortable to wear, have a nice sound, and fold up nicely. Total 5 star except my kids thought so too and now I have no idea where they are. 4 stars for you Sony."
1223,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are decent for what they are. They tend to hurt the top of my head after just an hour of having. Loosening them up doesn't help, because the weight of them slide back down your head. The actual sound produced by them is pretty good, and the cord is a cord that doesn't get stuck easily with other cords because of how smoothy and not grippy it is. I would recommend them for a cheap temporary replacement set of headphones."
1224,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been waiting for a decent pair of headphones since 1978. :) This is first one with well designed plug connection - sturdy and not likely to break or fray the wire with use; the slight angle of the speakers over the ears fit the natural shape of your head comfortably, the sturdy design, without bulky size or protrusions of the head band, and the apparently few parts show great attention to detail in design and manufacture. Best bargain for about $10 bucks I've had.The loss of bass audio signal in most headphones of past seems perfectly compensated for (I don't know if they acutally use a signal boost, or just great enclosure design over the ear). Good work Sony. - Great, timely service and delivery from Amazon marketplace vendor too."
1225,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a great back up headphones while I’m waiting for my replacement wireless headphones to be sent to me , good sound"
1226,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this headphones for about seven months now and they have yet to give out on me. I'm surprised, usually my headphones wear out quickly but not these ones. Worth the buy, especially for the price."
1227,5.0 out of 5 stars,We have three boys ages 9 to 13. I was tired of ear buds that stop working after a few uses or get tangled and broken. Also my 9 year old has one ear canal that's smaller so he can't wear ear buds. No way was I spending $$$ for some of the other brands. These have been great! They've been using them for almost 6 months and all three pairs are still working great!
1228,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Right out of the box, the wiring was faulty at the jack end of the cable. If I keep the cable still, it's not a problem, but if the cable moves in any way the sound is compromised. The cable thickness seems pretty cheap, so maybe that has something to do with it. If the cable wasn't an issue, I'd give the headphones a 4 out of 5. At times, the bass seems to slightly overwhelm the sound contrast, but it's not bad, and the headphones are fairly comfortable."
1229,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Can't beat them for the price. Not studio quality, but I didn't expect them to be at this price. I would recommend these."
1230,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleek design and great sound.. It's well worth the price since I didn't want to buy a headset that was $100 for a preteen.
1232,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these on December 18, 2014. Using them literally EVERY DAY 24/7 (school, gaming, listening to music, sleeping)
dropping them
yanking the wire by accident
etc.

These headphones are unreal for the value.
They broke on July 6th, 2016 when one side stopped working."
1233,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use them to play on my home console and they do the job perfectly. Sound is great for music, games and movies with everything being fairly balanced."
1234,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for young ones that are careless and toss things around Bought 6 months ago and still same new condition. Clean flat EQ is perfect for kids also so that extra bass does not damage their young still developing ears, and still hear their cartoons/movies/music clearly."
1235,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As long as you don't want to hear classical music at full super-ultra high fidelity to be able to hear the baby rattle used in the back of the orchestra or bang your head with heavy metal and become deaf in the process, these headphones will to the job."
1236,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great for listening to sound board mix. Also works great for gaming.

They have a very good response range, lots of bass up into high frequency response.

Very impressed for the price!

This is the best Sony product I've bought in a few years!"
1237,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a great pair of headphones considering the price. They won't sound as good as a pair of Bose or similar high end headphones, but at this price, you can't expect it to. That being said, the sound quality is quite good, they don't sound tinny on the high end, and on the low end, they've got some real bass. Build quality also seems to be good, they feel pretty solid, but if you're rough with them, I'm sure they wouldn't last. They are also very comfortable, I'm pretty picky on comfort, but these feel good. All in all, I would say these feel and sound like a $30 or $40 pair of headphones, so at the price of around $15, just order a pair, you won't regret it."
1238,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones to listen to music on my mp3 and phone...very happy with them. They have a excellent clear, rich sound and very comfortable to wear !
You can not beat them for the price. I have had more expensive headphones that are not as good. You won't be disappointed with these. I highly recommend!"
1239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A little heavy, but long term wear (gaming) is not an issue. I really like the clarity (I am not big on spending tons of money to listen to music... so 'good' is enough for me) and these are very clear and have a good range.. highs and lows.

I also use this in my guitar amp and works well (Peavey Vypyr VP-20) clear and loud.

For the price its a good buy."
1240,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived fast, plugged them in and they sound great. They have a major draw back for me and it might only be for me but they are extremely hot against the outside of my ear. It became uncomfortable within 30 seconds. It's like wearing ear muffs in the winter. Going back to an inner ear bud model."
1241,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a nerd when it comes to sound. These headphones SHOCKED me at how well they sound and work with my SmartPhone. The mic is even clearer than my previous OEM set from Samsung. Worth the cash, and believe me I was prepared to throw these away if they sucked. They are AWESOME! I am so happy I took a chance on these bad boys."
1243,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this headset based on previous reviews. I am very pleased with this headset. The sound quality is very good. For the price these can not be beat. I only occasionally wear headsets to listen to my music so I am not an audiophile buff. For my listening these are very good.
1244,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite the other reviewers hype, these are just OK headphones. I have a big head and find them tight and uncomfortable. The ""natural"" position for these headphones is about 1.5"" apart, which means for every inch you stretch it around your head, the tighter it gets. The sound quality is muddled and has little sparkle or clarity to the highs. The bass is OK in the mid bass range, but sub bass is very poor. I won't bother to return them, for $15 bucks it's not worth it. Don't misunderstand, they are fine for the price...I understand these are not $300 headphones, but my Audio Technica's are relatively cheap too and blow these out of the water."
1245,5.0 out of 5 stars,These have lasted me along time. They are comfortable and the sound is great. I would and did buy these again. Now my daughter uses a pair of these. She was going through headphones at least once a month because hers kept breaking. She has been using these for a few months now with no problems.
1246,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is a little dull but can be compensated for using the windows equalizer. Only first in one direction, and the headband could really use some padding at the top to prevent soreness over long periods. That said, it met my expectations for a cheap pair of headphones for the office. Adding a volume switch to the cord would rate it another star."
1247,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are most excellent! I had my previous pair for 5 years before they started to deteriorate, so I bought these updated ones, and am completely satisfied with their quality!"
1248,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my kids to use on their iPads. Can't beat the price and they work perfectly, no complaints. Good quality and I am not worried about them breaking or getting lost because they are so cheap. Would buy again. Perfect for small children on their electronic devices. Standard headphones, nothing fancy, no bells and whistles, just what we were looking for."
1249,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have several sets of the MDRZX100 phones, but wanted one with a mic for my cell because I do a lot of conference calls. These sound every bit as good as the zx100s and fit my pumpkin head nicely. Happy Customer. I dont need 250.00 headphones to leave in the car or out where the small grandkids can get them. THese work and I believe will work fine for all but the most discerning (or Brand-conscious) user. Studio quality sound? No. Perfectly listenable sound for most people? Yes."
1250,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The cord is way too short. I can't sit at my desk and have it plugged in to my tower and type without it pulling out of the jack. Additionally, it needs padding under the top of the headband (or whatever that part is called). I had a headache within moments of wear and I don't have a large head! That said, the sound was fine. I didn't want to mess with getting an extension cord, so these are going back."
1251,3.0 out of 5 stars,Audio quality wasn't as good as the previous Sony headphones I used which I misplaced. Good enough for the kids.
1252,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a professional video guy. I use these for hand- held shooting and/or situations where my $140 Sony headphones might get damaged or lost. These phones sound great and have the perfect cord for camera use. They fold up and slam into the camera bag no problem.
1254,5.0 out of 5 stars,"very good headset. good price too. I did a lot of research online about headset. I did not want to pay $200 for a noise cancellation headset from other brands. This one works really good and has good sound quality. It is small than my whole ears, so it is not a studio type headset. This would be a very good travel headset for me because it folds very well. I wish it had included a protective casing which it does not. If Sony could include a protective box for no additional cost, this product would really rock!"
1255,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these and plugged them into my phone right away. Mad impressed. I’m a music recording and mix engineer so I’m picky about my sound. These headphones are loud but still keep a solid frequency response. Crisp treble and bass heavy (not too heavy, it’s juuuust below perfect). I’m going to be using them at the gym so style and fit were important, they look great and fit really nice and snug. Overall fantastic headlines."
1256,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these for guitar practice. They sound great and I don't think they are distorting the sound with any bass bias. Love the price.
1257,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived as described and quickly! I ordered two pairs for my sons to use at school. They fit perfect and the quality is great. Great deal for the price.
1258,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect! Bought for a special needs child is rough on anything with a cable connected to it. He goes through headphones life face wipes. These hold up great and they don't get too loud. Normally headphones last him a few weeks. This model lasted a year. Saw them here and got them for better price than the local store has them for.
1259,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for my child who really enjoys using them. My children don't really like to use earbuds since they don't really fit a child's ear. Although these are bigger than earbuds, they work a lot better for this purpose. When our kids were younger we used to listen to audiobooks on long road trips and the content of the audiobooks wasn't always the most appropriate for children. These would be great at blocking up the ""grown up"" material while the kids watch movies or listen to music or their own audiobooks on their tablets."
1260,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to wear at work and I liked that they were smaller ""profile"". I work in an office, so I can't wear big, imposing headphones since people expect me to be available when they stop by. I have a small head and these fit comfortably on my ears and across my head where the plastic band sits. Most importantly, they have good sound quality.
I noticed the material on the ear pads looks as if they'll tear easily. I hope these hold up for at least a few years. I would suggest that you don't have earrings in when you wear them."
1261,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They have great sound quality for the price and are decently comfortable but they broke after 6 months.

Edit: I replaced them with a pair of MDRZX310's I got on sale for $14 (so actually a bit less than these 110's are atm) the price as of now has gone up to $22. I would very highly recommend spending a little more to get them. The build quality feels much better, they're more comfortable, and there's a noticeable improvement in audio quality. If for whatever reason you're stuck in the $15 range I'd recommend the Amazon Basics headphones for $14.99. The audio quality is identical to these 110's but they're noticeably more comfortable and have a superior build quality."
1262,5.0 out of 5 stars,"had an older model but stepped in them. good sound and durability, definitely worth the money I have another pair as a back up but don't see needing them any time soon. Good sound!"
1263,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable and light, just as good as more expensive headphones. They are durable. I bought a set for my son and he likes them very much."
1265,4.0 out of 5 stars,I find these give me clear sounding music and audio books on my iPhone. But after an hour or two I find these headphones are applying a bit to much pressure to my ears for comfort. YMMV.
1266,5.0 out of 5 stars,These come in perfect. Especially when you want to play your music and other's are sleeping and don't want to hear your type of music. Great to have if you're not near a radio to play music. 30 hours of playing time.
1267,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing super special about them but they work perfectly fine. They meet my expectations, so what more can you truly ask for. Haven't had any issues so I'm happy about this buy"
1268,5.0 out of 5 stars,Younger enthusiasts have no idea how fortunate they are to be able to enjoy true high fidelity stereophonic sound at such a low price. Back in 1980 my favorite phones were a pair of Koss that were so heavy on my head I referred to it as a boat anchor. They sounded great...but set me back $50...(That's 1980 dollars..two days wages for many back then) But they didn't sound any better than these light and comfy Sony's...and less than 20 bucks which is..what.. $5 in 1980??
1269,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered these for my son's iPad mini which has a lifeproof cover. The piece is too short and doesn't stay in the earphone jack. It is loose and falls right out. So it doesn't work for us. Waste of money.
1270,4.0 out of 5 stars,My son uses these with his ipad. The work well and fold up for easy portability. Wish they had a volume control on the chord.
1271,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh goodness if these aren't my most used item. I bought these without much thought. I needed a pair. But I love these. They are comfortable and durable and they stand up to my devil make care way of life. Tough little guys, I'm not easy on my things at all."
1272,3.0 out of 5 stars,It will work in a pinch. Not a Bose. Not a Sennheiser. They are comfortable and does NOT squeeze the head like a vice grip after ten minutes. Low volume.
1273,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the sound quality and its lightness. It is also glasses-friendly: wearing them with glasses do not hurt my ears.
1274,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are great sound for the price. They're stylish and have a clear sound. The reason I gave it 4 and not 5 is because they hurt my ears after a few hours. It's not a huge deal. I still recommend these
1276,5.0 out of 5 stars,"my all time favorite pair of headphones!! these work like a charm! just the right amount of bass, treble, middle-tone, and comfort most othes only claim, and this is a SONY! these even fold-in nicely on themselves after use. just right for my panasonic SA-AKK-330 stereo-system. which still works just great!"
1277,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not sure why people are whining about the sound quality.... I think they sound good. Are they $200 BOSE headphones, of course not, and that's why they don't sound like them. Excellent for the money.

My only complaint is they are fairly quiet with my Galaxy Note, I don't have a volume issue with any other headphones"
1278,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are nice headphones for the price. They sound good have quality lows and highs; not boomy or tinny. I recommend these against anything in their price range. I have three other sets of headphones that cost a lot more from other manufacturers that sound terrible compared to these.

I was a little disappointed with the construction. I am sure they will last for years. I have an older pair of Sony MDR-V202 these are replacing. The older set sounds a little better, but not much difference. The new construction has no cushion on the head piece and the ear pieces are hollow. The cushion doesn't matter much unless you're bald like me, but the ear pieces give a hollow clank noise if they or the wire is bumped against something."
1279,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing for their price. Super stoked. Would buy again! I'm a musician and avid music listener, I bought these for around the house listening and potential gym going.

Update, 11-6-16: The cord is short as hell. Just FYI."
1280,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They are ok, not wonderful, but just ok. Sound is acceptable, and they are somehow comfortable, besides they are a little too warm."
1281,5.0 out of 5 stars,These offer excellent sound quality for headphones that cost so little. I was extremely impressed.
1282,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones seem to sound ok for the price. The cord is somewhat short, so whatever you plug it into cannot be too far away."
1283,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't realise the ears fold in. That's not a major issue, however.

What IS an issue as that there seems to be a problem in the cord or jack. Many times, I can only hear it out of one side. Not what I expected from Sony brand.

I'm just going to go back to my Grumpy Cat earphones"
1284,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound, noise canceling and easy to fold. Product came with perfect features just like the descriptions. I recommend it for everyone looking to use a mine headphones everyday. I use it everyday to ride the NYC train and from work. Simply the best Sony products. Thank you amazon prime👌😎!"
1285,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yes! Finally I can watch my Amazon Prime shows in bed. The sound quality is amazing and they are very comfortable on my ears! I am not an ear bud person unless I have to use them at the gym...so these are right up my alley!
1287,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is exactly what I've been looking for. These headphones are light and comfortable with good sound quality. I can wear them for hours with no discomfort at all. They don't squeeze my head, make my ears sweat or do any of those unpleasant things other headphones have done. My only complaint is that people can't hear me very well through the microphone. I find I have to quickly pull the headphones out if someone calls me while I'm listening.

FYI The cable is about 3 feet long.

But as I bought these primary to listen to music I'm only taking one star off."
1288,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is based on my first impressions with the ""110's"" on a number of mp3 player, and a number of ""100's"" (the previous model https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WODP20/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) that I have had and used over the years.

Pro - Sound Quality
So far I DO notice more bass in these new (my first pair of the ""110's"") pair of headphones and unlike prior experience with Sony (and other companies too ...) earbuds where the ""new great model"" .. didn't sound as good as the prior ones did ...

These 110's just add enough to the bass and possibly treble too, that makes it definitely sound better then the 100's though it doesn't fall into the trap I described above, when sometimes they add ""more bass"" and it turns out the bass is so strong, that it drowns everything else out. I have to say that this is not really a knock on the 100's .. I do still like them but for the same price on either ... I'd go with the 110's but if there is a ""good deal"" on the 100's and I was getting them again ... I am not against getting another pair of the 100's either.

Yes these are ""cheap"" headphones and probably not as good quality wise as a really expensive pair though I do recall some reviews saying they tried these along side a pair of ""$200 Beats"" and while the did say their friend's Beats did sound better ... they personally would rather get maybe two or three pair of these and still have say $150 left over ... meaning ""they do not sound price-vs-quality of the sound"" .. 'that much better'

Pro/Con - Build quality
These ARE plastic headphones of course, though I do not agree with those that say ""oh its like they are from the Dollar store ... the plastic is horrible ..etc etc""... just if your going to buy a much more expensive pair of headphones ... your will probably get better quality too

The one downside that ... I admit I see in these, and are a problem in the pair of ""the 100's"" that was 100% caused by me ... AND EVEN THEN that exact pair, needed fixing but still sounds great ... I am using THEM while typing this review, is the part where the 100's and the 110's ear-cups move. I am not sure ""how it could be made better"" but that was the exact point of failure for my long-used pair (again 100% my fault for HOW the break,happened) .. note that if it wasn't for me they would still be fine and that is after 3+ years of HEAVY use and they still work ... so maybe it's fine for being able to fold (in both models I mean)

Pro - Fit
I am not sure if i can say one way or the other ""I have a big head"" (100% not a small head) but they fit fine .. even out of the box. Heck after that DIY type of repair I did on my broke pair .. .I had to flip them backwards and .. they for the most part still fit great ... these 110's are no different.

By the way I have glasses (regular and sunglasses used when wearing these) and just like the 100's, these are nice and comfy ... not too tight or too lose, if you ask me

??? - The cord
The cord looks different from the 100's I have and I like the cord ... basically I think some of the cords on others are way way too small and that always leads to the problem of one of the two sides going out for good ... The cord on the 110's looks a tad smaller diameter wise but really if that doesn't mean that issue I just described DOESN'T happen .. I do not really care... I just want the headphones to work for a long time ... if the cord is different but there are no issues ... this change is fine by me.

Plug - I will keep this review updated IF there is a change but I have no had these for long enough to comment on some of the reviews who keep having issues with the plug breaking ... NOT on this pair but my other pair of the 100's get plugged into and unplugged from stuff for over three years now and often too ... never had a problem .. but then again I cant comment on these. for now.

Summary

I would recommend these no question ... though if your expecting a super high end sound (aka are an ""audiophile"") you MAY BE disappointed though as someone who loves his music ... I think the sound with the right equalizer settings, on the device or program your using... I do LOVE the sound of these.

Update - After using a new pair of the ""100's"" ... aka the prior model

Really ... the 110's do have the slightly higher bass and that is not a bad thing either .... the new pair of the 100's I am using I actually thought were the 110's (I just forgot what headphones I was using)... THE POINT? ... they both have great bass and I think the pair that I use to wear daily (the broken pair that still works great.... just doesn't fit perfectly anymore)'s fit actually effects the bass ... that old pair I hold the earcups closer to my ears than how they ""sit"" now .. .and I hear alot more bass.

Between the 100s and 110's ... if the way each one of them fold doesn't matter to you for say fitting them into a caring case .... I recommend both 1000% (no typo) ... find the best deal ... if you can get one a little cheaper than the other ...cool ... there is more bass by a little bit on the 110's but do not think I am saying a new pair of the 100's are weak in that department."
1289,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My old headset has been around a while, and maybe that's what makes these feel ""off."" The fit is a bit on the snug side (which seems common with many headsets). The sound also seemed a bit ""heavy."" Maybe it's just me. After lowering the volume control a little, the sound quality improved, so perhaps I just grew accustomed to the old headset I've been using. Overall, for the price, the quality is very good. Headset cord could have been longer. I use these for gaming, so I really need to watch if I want to get up to reach for something as I don't have several feet of excess cord to work with.

* UPDATE *

Had to drop my rating to two stars. Nice headphones, but my pair had the left speaker start to fail not even a month after they arrived, and they didn't see much use. I expect better quality from Sony. :-("
1290,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is GOOD. The product quality is GOOD. My issue is more personal and might not be an issue for you but I find that these hurt my ears. They don't squeeze 'hard' but apparently my ears are just sensitive to ANY pressure on them. I wish I had gone for the ""over the ears"" version instead of the ""on the ear"" style these represent. If your ears aren't sensitive, the build quality and sound quality is very good and you should buy them. If your ears don't like 'pressure' on them, get the OVER the ear or IN the ear versions."
1291,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own several pairs of headphones and a pair of ear buds for travel. I spent a good amount of money on my travelling ear buds because I use them a lot, and I want them to sound good. For my home headphones, though, I really don't want much. I just want something that sounds clear at a low volume and will last.

None of the other pairs of headphones I have owned have lasted. They'd develop a short in the wiring somewhere, and the sound would be horrible. So far, these things have outshined any of the other ""cheap"" headphones I have purchased. In fact, for the price point that these things have, I would venture to use the word ""amazing"" to describe them, much to the chagrin of Louis CK.

These do not sound as good as my travel ear buds, but I paid five times as much for those. For $20, though, this is as good as it gets for headphones."
1292,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed these for work. No microphone, just wired headphones. I was gonna get the Amazon Basics one but they were the same price so I opted with Sony. I see lots of people with these for music. I don't use them for music, primarily so I can't say too much about sound quality although I'm confident they're fine for the average user. Good design, foldable, comfortable, and adjustable. No complaints."
1293,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good set of headphones to throw around and not worry too much if I break it given its cost. The plastic headband started to weaken and spread quite a lot only after a few weeks of light use, but again, given the cost I am not too worried if I break it - but I'm knocking a star off for it. I wouldn't buy another one pair if the band breaks because I don't have a large head and the band stretching this much shouldn't happen for an average sided noggin. The stretched band also results in a looser fit which means a reduced seal with the ear that lets in ambient noise. The ear pads are comfortable despite sitting on the ears for hours some days - maybe that's due to the spread headband. The set is pretty light. The cord is on the longish side if you just use this with your cell phone.

The lows frequencies are almost nonexistent. There's just enough to let you know there's a drummer pounding the bass, but it's definitely nothing overpowering and not punchy or boomy - it's just barely there. The mids are recessed and slightly veiled and the highs are just meh - I don't think there's much reach on the high end. But really, this is nitpicking because these sound so much better than a $200 seat of Beats and an outstanding value at $15 which is what I paid for mine. I think these go as low as $10 on occasion. For the cost of a set of winter ear muffs, I have a decent set of headphones that play music well enough for mass transit commuting - and also keeps my ears warm ;)

My better set is Audio Technica's ATH-A900x which are probably on low end of the high end, but those are too unwieldy to take outside imho. So comparing these two headphones, I can easily say the set of Sony's has great price to performance ratio."
1294,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why are headphones $300? I understand that certain people are discerning, but I suspect that i's just a status symbol. Especially after hearing the clear and rich quality of these headphones. I've always trusted Sony as a brand and they have yet to let me down. These headphones are comfortable, have a great high end and a nice (not overly thumping) bass. Why would I pay more? I was a little skeptical about the folding design, but in practice, the natural shape of the head stops them from folding accidentally."
1295,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Part of the reason I am giving these headphones a five-star rating is the incredible price I got them for on amazon - $10! For just $10, these are excellent headphones! I picked up a couple pairs so that my kids can use them in the van on long car rides when they want to watch a movie on the portable DVD player. We used them over our Christmas holiday travels, and my wife has been taking them to the gym with her, too, for use with the treadmill monitor. (We both despise earbuds and consider them one of the worst inventions of the century!)

Hopefully, these will last a lot longer than the no-name discount headphones my wife purchased at the local drugstore last year. Those were more expensive than these and we had problems with those after only six months of use. Both of those have gone into the garbage can and have been replace with these Sony headphones. Definitely an upgrade!"
1296,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to replace Sony MDREX86LP in-ear earbuds, which I had for 5+ years and still sounded good, but I now found myself needing something that was not inside my ear. I need headphones that have great sound across my very eclectic music collection-- mainly classical, opera and classic rock, but occasionally some jazz, country or pop-- and are comfortable, because I listen all day while I am working. Price was also a significant consideration-- I can no longer see my way clear to paying $50+ for a set of headphones. These deliver on all accounts! The sound is rich, vocals and instruments come across very clearly and distinctly, and bass response is excellent without being overly ""thumpy"". The pads are comfortable on my ears for all-day listening, and these are also very lightweight. The appearance is basic, classic, and not at all flashy, so they can pass for a professional appearance at work. The cord is thick and sturdy, and the size is widely adjustable. The folding feature is neat, but these stay at the office all the time so not that important for me. I can see it being convenient for traveling. All in all, I would buy these again and again if I were to lose them or break them, and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for an excellent set of headphones at a very decent price."
1298,4.0 out of 5 stars,Plastic is a little cheap feeling and I could see it easily breaking within a short while. But at this price range it is expected. These have nice cushy ear pads that rest ON-EAR. They also have a mic and can work with Iphone/Android for calls. All and all a nice pair of cans for a lil over $20
1299,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones for the price and size are very impressive. I am very particular about the sound of headphones, and the overall range they provide, and these are awesome, for the size and weight. They fold nicely to fit in a pack or bag and don't hurt your head after hours of use."
1300,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have a few expensive pairs of headphones but I came back to these because they are the most comfortable. The other brands are heavier and the ear pieces make my ears hot. The sound quality is excellent. If you do not need heavy bass from your headphones these are well worth a try.
1301,4.0 out of 5 stars,First of all i want to say I made my purchase of these headphones on the 11th of March and I recived them on the 16th of March. Im Kind of upset about this because I payed for priority shipping. Now about the quality of sound for me though For some reson I put the volume on my celphone on full and yet it sounds like its only on medium or low low medium if that makes sense. But u get what u pay for. All in all they are very confortable I can see me using these at home all the time. Not when I go out because they take up space and are not as easy to just pop in your purse never mind a pocket as earbuds are of course. I do recomend them thought if u dont mind that the volume isnt as loud. Then again guess thats a good thing and your eardrums will thank you.
1302,3.0 out of 5 stars,"OK for a computer but don't waste your dough for music. If you want a GREAT inexpensive set for music that gives you sounds you never heard, buy a set of SONY RP-HTF600 SONY headphones for $26. They are OUTSTANDING and better than the $300 with a guys name on them brand!"
1303,2.0 out of 5 stars,I gave it two stars not for sound quality but for the exoanding. They do not welk at all and hurt my ears.
1304,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for my husband, who is bedridden and spends a lot of time on his Kindle. He completely gets lost into what he's doing with these on. Think you can hear outside of the headphones if you want to, but he doesn't, so they more or less cancel any outside noise if you want them too."
1305,2.0 out of 5 stars,"As far as sound goes these were great, they did a pretty decent job canceling out noise on the airplane. I returned them because they didn't stay over my ears/were a bit uncomfortable. They're a good value for the money but I would rather have ones that cover my ears rather than sit on top uncomfortably."
1306,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for my Fiance, he is a musician so quality sound is very important to him. He didn't like the Bose that we tried and HATES those Beats by Dre headphones but he loves how these sounds, and when I told him how much they cost compared to those he almost fell out of his chair. I guess I found his new set for the future."
1307,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best headphones on the market for the price. I am replacing an old set that I wore the earmuffs out on.
1309,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones work pretty nicely. I paid a very low amount for the headphones that I got. My only complaint is how cheap they feel. I'd suggest paying a little more and getting better quality but if you're trying to low-dough it or just needing a pair of headphones, get these."
1310,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for my ten year old daughter, who has a tendency to drop, toss and/or leave electronics in dangers way. Many reviews said these are terrible, I highly disagree. I have listened to a variety of music using the headphones, including classical instrumentals, they have a great sound considering the inexpensive cost. A lot of bang for your buck."
1311,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are comfortable, adjustable and sound great. The cable doesn't tangle easily and is thick enough that I don't have to worry about my cats chewing through it. However, I wish there was a way to make it fit more tightly, as it is very apparent that they could sound even better if not for the relaxed fit."
1312,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent headphones. Nice to talk on the phone with. Problem is when you have the headphones off your ears and resting them around your neck, you cant turn you head very well. It's uncomfortable and annoying to have them around your neck. The collapsible feature is pointless. They should have used the resources to allow the headphones to lay flat when they are resting around your neck."
1313,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great basic headphones. Great Mic as well for using on phone calls. Soft on the ears.
1314,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my daughter to replace the Sony headphones that broke on her previously. These headphones were great at first but now they have a short in the left ear and you hear nothing.
1315,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered this set for myself and my daughter borrowed them and begged to keep them. I ordered another pair and my son took them over. Guess it's time to order me another set! They are affordable and the sound quality is excellent. I use them to watch a movie or listen to music on my Kindle.
1316,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sent 1st one I received back bc when the jack swiveled it created a lot of static. The replacement was much better but still had a little static with significant swiveling but kept it. Good sound quality and plenty of bass. Reasonably comfortable. Great for the price.
1317,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are high quality. I was looking for new headphones when I found these. The sound quality is excellent. I rarely have my volume turned up more than half way. They cancel out outside noise pretty well. They are very sturdy and the foam pieces are very comfortable on the ears. The mic picks up great. I use these for Skype all the time and people never have problem hearing me. These are some of the best and cheapest head phones I have gotten. I love these!
1318,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good but not great, they don't get very loud. i had been using the 20 dollar sony headphones and they are much better at a similar price point."
1320,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Inexpensive, yet excellent sound. Because the price was so low, I wasn't sure how the quality would be. I'll never buy another expensive set of headphones unless I have to. These are great, but I would prefer a bit more ear coverage."
1321,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones to replace an older version of the same. The sound is nice for the price and since this is my second pair, I'd obviously recommend."
1322,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality of these headphones is pretty good. However, I found them to be intolerable to use in noisy environments. Of course, they are not considered to be noise isolating headphones. However, their acoustics seem to magnify environmental sounds. I used them on the bus, and road noise sounded worse with them on my ears than it did when I removed them entirely. I returned them for a refund."
1323,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you! These are perfect! The sound quality is amazing. I feel like I'm at a concert wearing these XD
1324,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an average size head and these fit well. I use them for an hour or two after everyone else in the house has gone to sleep. And for the hour or two of use they are comfortable. After a couple hours they start to press against my temples. Did I mention that I wear eyeglasses? Anyway, these seem like they may work for train travel, which is what I got them for. The great thing about train travel is that you don't need noise cancellation like you need on a stinking old aeroplane. If you need a reasonably priced set of headphones for home or train, get these."
1325,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for a youth! I ordered these for my little brother and he loves them! They have good sound, are light, can take a lot of damage. If you want some durable headphones for a preteen/young child, these are good. Otherwise if you just want a good cheap pair of headphones, these are for you."
1326,5.0 out of 5 stars,typical sony quality.
1327,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is one of the better cheaper headphones available. Might be ideal for travelling as it folds flat. Clamping force is about on par with a sony MDR-V6. I honestly wished it sounded like my V6 though. It seems to emphasize the midrange over the other frequencies. The price point however makes it easier to overlook its deficiencies. The cord is a bit thicker than the cords available on competitors products. Overall a good product for the price.
1328,5.0 out of 5 stars,We love this headphone for our kids!! So durable for them!! We have them in Black now and had White ones..
1329,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound slightly dark. Overall they are timbrically correct and articulated. Worth every penny. I usually listen with AKG 701, Sony MDR D77 and Beyerdynamic DT990 pro. These little Sony hold their own."
1331,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are really a good value! I had to replace these for someone else and for the price it was great
1332,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use these every night while my husband is asleep to watch YouTube videos and not disturb him. Comfortable, fairly lightweight given their bulky look, can't complain."
1333,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good price and good product. I got these for a gift and they were great. Good sound and easy to set up. Just plug in and use. No problems at all. I would buy from this seller again.
1334,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is good for cheap headphones it is rather impressive, less impressed that the jack broke off inside my phone in my pocket after a few weeks, I had a pair of these for over 3 years so not sure if I did something particularly strenuous or if it was the quality of the headphones but either way if you are looking for cheap headphones go for it but be careful not very rugged."
1335,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are my absolute go-to! They're very good quality and extremely durable for their price.
1336,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones work well and the sound quality is great. They have decent bass as well. They aren't nose canceling, and while they are comfortable at first, they get uncomfortable after an hour or so. They don't usually leave my desk at work, so I haven't been rough on them, but they seem reasonably sturdy for the price. Good buy."
1337,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphone at this price. I use it in m bedroom so no worries about noise. It is adjustable so I can use it for a long time.
1338,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought two pairs of these for Christmas 2014 gifts...one for my mother-in-law and one for my husband. They are both extremely pleased with this product. My husband can't stand using ear buds but loves his new headphones! They have terrific sound quality and are tangle resistant. A great product at a very reasonable price.
1339,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these for my son as a Christmas gift, but his others died, so he got them early. He says that they're better than his old ones (same make, different model), so I am very happy with this purchase :-)"
1340,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and comfortable for inexpensive headphones. I had a previous pair for at least 4 years and accidentally turned the ear piece the wrong way in the dark and it broke off. These should last a long time.
1342,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent value. Work well and don't have to panic if you can't find them at this price!
1343,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb sound coming from my small CD player using these phones. Thanks!
1344,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These fit weird. They seem like they should be over the ear headphones, but they aren't quite. They are not the most comfortable headphones in the world. As a matter of fact, I would say that Amazon Basics ones I bought are much more comfortable.

Having said that, the sound quality is excellent. Good bass, true sound without static."
1345,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband love his head phones for his computer. Great price and works great.
1346,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as ""fill-in"" Xmas gifts for my 12 and 8 year old sons to use on their tablets and the home PC. Sound great, look slick and fold up to fit better in their backpacks. At 10 bucks a pop... Money well spent! And Amazon shipping continues to amaze. I ordered on 12/22 at about 8pm, selected free 5-8 day shipping knowing they'd be here after Xmas, delivered to my door at 2pm 12/24. This is why I only buy TP and detergent at walmart. Bravo Amazon!"
1347,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Sony MDR-ZX110 stereo headphones are well worth the money: bottom line – these are nearly a match for more expensive headphones. Sony advertises a frequency range of 12-22,000 hz but does not quantify it. I made my own measurements, with an accuracy of +/- 0.5 db from 15 hz to 18,000 hz, that show these headphones provide nearly flat response, within +/- 2 db from 30 hz to 11,000 hz. Many expensive headphones do not perform as well, although their build quality and listening comfort may be better.
Evaluations are usually subjective and each person has his own hearing response function and preferences. Since I am an engineer, I like to see data. There are a number of frequency response graphs made by Headroom that you can find for reference. I have a studio-quality Sony MDR-V6 and found a chart for it by Headroom. I made my own measurements and got very good agreement with Headroom’s results, +/- 1 db. The V6 has nearly flat response, mostly within +/- 2 db from 15 hz to 11,000 hz. Sony advertises a frequency range of 5-30,000 hz. The Headroom graph also shows a sharp dip around 6000 hz. I see the dip at loud signal levels above 100 db but it nearly goes away at comfortable listening levels of 80 db or less. The Sony MDR-ZX110 has a very similar frequency response to the V6 at comfortable listening levels, but develops enhanced bass and high frequency dips and spikes at loud listening levels. At comfortable listening levels there is little difference between the two headphones. In the 25+ years since the V6 was introduced there have been a number of improvements in headphones so that an inexpensive model like the ZX110 can produce nearly comparable results."
1348,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Use these on BART and they don't really block sound out very well. I know they're not advertised as noise isolation, but it's almost as if they should really be advertised as Open back headphones since so much ambient noise is allowed to bleed through. Also the extra bass isn't at all noticeable, the mic quality is on par with the included in ear headphones that came with my Galaxy S3, which weren't very good to begin with."
1349,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price you can't beat these headsets. They fit nice and don't feel heavy or make my ears hurt. Sound quality is good and I like the way they fold up so they don't bump out of by computer case and run the risk of smashing them. If your looking for a good headset at a fair price you won't go wrong with these. The seller delivered earlier than expected and the packaging was very good. Would buy from them again no problem. Very Satisfied.
1350,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loud them since the first gen . Cheap great sound no so much volumen.
1351,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought it for my father and he loves them. He is a big fan of Sony and their headphones. He says that both the quality and the price is great and that he doesn't know any better headphones when it comes to this 2 things.
1353,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, Amazing. Indeed it is, and I'm not referring to its price...only. Its light, gently on the ear, and enjoyable is the sound it generates. Its performance is encouraging, and its difficult not to neglect other things listening to this headphone. Another is being purchased to ensure consistency with this inexpensive, but delightfully enjoyed headphones. Its worth it....get two."
1354,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for the price. I paid $8.55 including shipping. They sound amazing. Wish the lightning deal allowed more than one purchase.
Sure they have no padding on top, but they are still worth much more than I paid and I think all reviews need to take price into consideration so these are easily 5 stars."
1355,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Naturally, they won't compare to a $60 or more pair, but for the price point I've never heard a better set of headphones. Design-wise they're a little small and plastic-y (as one would expect for the money) but the overall audio fidelity can't be beat for the price point."
1356,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just wanted a pair of headphones for the occasional plane flight, because I hate sticking ear buds in my ears. I wasn't into spending $200 on a pair of fancy headphones. I didn't expect much from these, but I was pleasantly surprised. They aren't noise canceling, but they are comfortable, fold up for packing, and do the job. WAY better than ear buds."
1357,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These arrived quickly, they fit OK, but they only worked about 10-14 hrs and then stopped for not obvious reason. Amazon as always made right. Not sure what happened with them since the reviews are reasonable I assume I just got a bad pair."
1358,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice!
1359,3.0 out of 5 stars,No real complaints but I guess I was looking for something a bit different. I have in the ear headphones for when I work out and see many folks with over the ear headphones doing the same. The sound quality of the Sony phones is just fine but I was unable that I would be able to hear so much outside noise. Guess I should have tried a pair before I bought them. I now use them when I am on my computer and they work just fine....much less noise in those surroundings. I guess I could give them 4 stars but I am deducting a star for my own stupidity for not checking them out better before I bought!
1360,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Feels comfortable but the cord is very short! Use this if the audio port is close, like in a laptop, but not when the desktop is under your table, etc. Should have read the specifics. Cord is about 3/4 meter or 30 inches long (or short). Decent sound by the way."
1361,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The ear pieces never sit quite flat on my (large) head. My daughter has the same issue, despite having a smaller head.
The sound is good, but not exceptional. After a month of regular use, I have noticed no problems with reliability.

Decent value for the price."
1362,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these today. They sound fantastic. Way better than a similar, more expensive pair of sony headphones that I got a few years ago at Target. unbelievable price. Would be nice if they came with an adapter for 1/4 inch jack, but then they would have to charge more."
1364,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like others have said, the fact that these are less than $20 is fantastic. It's not the best sound quality i've ever had, but I was just looking for over the ear headphones for work when i need to be recording calls from another in-ear microphone. These fit the bill well, have a microphone on the line and are comfortable. They don't completely cover the ears like some headphones do but they work quite well. They don't come with a case, which is a shame, but not the worst thing in the world. I also like that the chords don't get all tangled like iphone headphones do."
1365,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pleasantly surprised, especially at this price point (paid 13)."
1366,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds quality is A Ok for less than $20. Been using it for at least 3 mos 3x a week but the right cups doesn't work anymore. Suddenly, just stop working while i was listening to my music... I chech all possible scenario but it just gave up.."
1367,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They work ok for the price.. I thought they would be bigger and cover my whole ear, but they just go on top of your ear.. I would try the Amazon brand before these next time.. But they are ok for budget headphones and fold up nicely to hang on the wall."
1368,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 14 year old grandson was born with autism. He loves the computer but we had to remind him to turn the volume down. With the headphones we no longer have to be at him to turn it down. We love them.
1369,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great affordable headphones used on the plane. Would advise.
1370,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these during a flash sale for $7.99. I mainly use them for listening to music on my phone and for late night gaming on a PS4 when I don't want to wake up the wife and kids.

These are a sturdy pair of headphones. Most headphones under $20 are flimsy and cheap feeling but these are very solid. I wish there was a head pad though since the plastic is a little too hard for me.

The sound quality is great for the price point. These are perfect for basic every day use. Initially I thought the sound quality was poor but it was caused by me being used to the in ear buds I've been using. Once I was accustomed to the new headphones the sound was great. Although, one thing I don't like is that these headphones are quiet. On my phone, I have to turn the volume up almost to the max. This just might be my personal preference though since I like to tune out all outside noise when listening to music.

These are not a high end pair of Bose or Beats so don't expect perfect quality. These are a great pair of solid headphones that are more than adequate for every day use. As long as you keep expectations realistic you'll thoroughly enjoy these headphones."
1371,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these primarily for my new smartphone (LG tracfone). The music quality is good and they are comfortable and quite adjustable. My complaint is with the control button. The instructions suggest the Smart Key app. The app is configurable for 1, 2 and 3 presses. For example, press once for Pause, twice for skip to next track, three times for previous track. No matter how many times I press it it only does start/pause. In addition if I am playing iHeart radio it will jump to Google Play. I have not tried the control using the phone yet."
1372,2.0 out of 5 stars,Heavy on the low frequencies with the result that mods and highs are lost. Ok if you are listening to YouTube music because the quality of the source is usually awful.
1373,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are awesome for the price. I have bought 3 sets because I leave them in hotels or my kids step on them. At the low price, it's not a big deal to replace them."
1375,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are pretty good headphones for what they are. If you're looking for a pair of low priced, decent quality headphones, then get these. I was pretty surprised at how nice the sound played through these. I just got them today, and the first thing i noticed when i put them on was how comfortable they were. They have a nice, tight fit, and they cover both your years completely. They also do a nice job drowning out back ground noise. I was listening to music at a pretty soft volume, and i could barley hear my sister calling my name from right outside the door. They also fold in, so they're nice and portable. They are definetley not a disappointment. After all, they are made by sony, so you can't go wrong with them."
1376,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what i was looking for ..Great price and fast shipping
1377,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these over a year ago and still use them every single day. Comfy, great sound and I've dropped them quite often. Durable and well worth the price."
1378,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have used Sony over-ear headphones for many years because they are an unbelievable value. I'm pleased to say the tradition continues. These sound great and are comfortable. I bought a few pairs for the kids to use at school and plan on buying a few more for around the house.
1379,4.0 out of 5 stars,These Sony MDRZX110AP ZX Series Extra Bass Smartphone headphones are fantastic when it comes to the great sound coming out of them. I wasn't to sure what I was going to get from them. The name Sony stands for quality and so you expect to pay a higher price for them and that was ok. But these headphones were not expensive at all. These headphones are everything you'd expect from a well-known company that everybody has owned some electronic product with their name on it........... S O N Y!!
1380,5.0 out of 5 stars,these are wonderfully comfortable for a person like myself who watches tv all night next to a normal sleeping person. I really think they are GREAT!
1381,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones for the price. I use them for audiobooks so I can't address their suitability for music. I can wear them for hours at a time with no discomfort. I would buy again.
1382,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased! Sound is great! Very comfortable and nice looking! Folding makes it easy for storage and worth the price!
1383,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is great but only as long as the outside isn't super loud. It will hurt your ears after a few hours but overall it fits snug!
1384,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's okay, but not great. However, it does serve the purpose while exercising."
1386,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones for the price, bought these as an extra set, I've used them with my iPad, iPod and MP3, they're comfortable and have adaquate sound."
1387,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great when I have conference calls on my cell phone.
1388,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Keeping in mind that these headphones are less than $20, they are very good. I wear them when on my computer so that I don't bother the family. They are on ear headphones, but still reduce outside noise to the point where I can't hear my wife in the next room (oops...). I am not an audiophile, but the quality is good enough for me. For the price, I think they are one of the best pairs on the market."
1389,4.0 out of 5 stars,The headphone set works great... except that the voice could be a little bit more crisp/clear.
1390,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones provide both comfort and high quality sound. They are easy to adjust and very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The sound quality is clear and consistent. They conveniently fold-up for storage and the cords are sturdier than average headphone cords and don't kink.
1391,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are really comfy on my ears. And I wear a lot of stud earrings so that's pretty important to me :) Also, the inline play/pause button is always crucial to me so I don't have to dig out my phone and have somebody repeat what they just said to me. I like that they fold too. I've never used the mic feature so I can't really say yay or nay about it but overall I'm happy with this purchase."
1392,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my son as a present last Christmas. They have good sound and very comfortable to wear. He'd been wearing these all the time until I gave him a set Bluetooth headphones recently. These Sony headphones still work great as his backup.
1393,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome product. I will order more. When you use the earphones all noise is block out.
1394,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great. Highly recommend. Comfortable fit. Great sound. Quality all around.
1395,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones to quiet the kids in the car. Bought some sets for a long car ride while on vacation and the kids never complained about them hurting and they sounded good. I wish it was a single wire model but for the price these are great.
1397,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad headphones, but very low noise isolation from surround. When I put it on I hear what's going on around me without any attenuation."
1398,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Just ok.
They're far too tight on my head, and I can't even bend them much to loosen the vice-like grip. Also they cut out even if I only move my head a tiny bit. I'm guessing the connections are very weak.

Someday when I can afford it, I'll buy some nice headphones to help block noise at work."
1399,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones. Works with all my gear. Great sound, Great price. As expected from Amazon and Sony."
1400,5.0 out of 5 stars,My kids love these headphones! They are inexpensive but fairly durable. They are comfortable on the head and ears.
1401,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great at containing the noise so others aren't disturbed by it. Decent sound, too. I've heard $300 sound systems with less clarity for frequencies made by electric guitars."
1402,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my husband; he loves them. He says they fit well, are comfortable, and have a great sound. We usually sit on the loveseat together; and, if he uses them on his laptop, I cannot hear a thing. So, they are apparently well insulated."
1403,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great. The bass is clean with a stereo sound you will enjoy. The music comes alive with every beat from the drums, every strum from the guitar and every note from the wind instruments. Light and easy on the head and ears, you will love these as much as I do! I recommend these not only for the quality but the price is easy on the pocket."
1404,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first pair of these headphones survived over 2.5 years of heavy use without any problems. In contrast, I have had similar cheap headphones break in under a year. These sound good enough for casual use and are quite comfortable to wear, even with glasses. Given the price, I am quite happy with these."
1405,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like these headphone. I got these along with a long cord extension to watch tv at night in the bedroom without disturbing my wife. I used wireless for quite a while but found the short battery life starting to become annoying. The sound quality of these headphone is great! I have no qualms about recommending them.
1406,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm extremely happy with them. Very well balanced, and the most comfortable over-ear headphones I've ever had. I feel like this was a STEAL.

The microphone works very well, no one can tell I'm not on my phone. The Smartkey App was not impressive, but I don't really care."
1408,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! I have headphones from several top makes, Grado, Ultrasone, and the Sony MR-1. They all retail 10-15 times this set but the difference in sound is much closer. They are crisp, punchy and refreshing. Almost can’t tell you are wearing them. The mic works fine too. I use them with my iPad and PS4. Don’t hesitate, you won’t be disappointed."
1409,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are the best I have ever bought. I'm not a big fan of earbuds, so I am constantly looking for good Headphones to get. These have been amazing! For the price, you get what you want and so much more. They are so durable as well, I've had them for 2 years and they are still rocking!
I love Sony and its quality products. I totally recommend these for anyone who wants to get good things at a lower price :)"
1410,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i've had these for almost 2 years. my cat played with them, and they were still working fine afterward despite them being frayed where he chewed on it. now the line that connects to the right ear pad is finally completely torn off as a result of his chewing. but they are still working otherwise on the left side. i've tried skull candy headphones and earphones which hv never lasted me more than 6 months...and for $40/pair they've lost my business. so i gotta say i am quite happy with how long these Sony headphones have held up despite getting beat up by my cat. In addition, i like how these headphones don't apply much pressure to my head and are comfortable. i've tried other headphones that have nice cushions on the ears but felt too tight and got my head to hurt. Also, i like how these headphones (and over the ear headphones in general) don't make that squishy sound in your ears like the silicon earbuds do when you walk or run."
1411,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are comfortable. I love the over the ear design because they do somewhat block out the other sounds in the room. I'm not an audiophile but I think the sound produced by these headphones is perfect for the discerning listener. The price was better than I could find anywhere else. Around $15. They are lightweight so they are easy on your head and easy to carry around.
1412,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second Sony headphone. The clarity and comfort is great. The padding on the ear pieces are soft. For the price I can buy 10 instead of the more expensive over priced ones. Great quality for good price. Very happy with my purchase.
1413,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Someone said these headphones were great for people who wear glasses.

I wore them for 10 hours when I accidentally beat the entirely of soul reaver 2 on twitch stream. (I got caught up in the story..I love that game)

None of that behind the ear ache that you get with other headphones. Nothing like that.

Very light weight headphones. No surround sound though, so if you want that you'll have to look elsewhere. otherwise they're perfect."
1414,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Look, I have a pair of Sony MDR V6 headphones that are hard to match even by big names like Bose, and are way better than those expensive brands that are just made for looks. Compared to them, the sound of these is just OK. Even so, even these modest Sony are better than a lot of other more expensive products out there. So, it's a matter of what kind of use you are planning for them. I have them for use at the office connected to my phone. They do the job while I do mine... and we get along fine. Besides, they allow you to take calls. The sound is clear on my end, and so far nobody has noticed that I am wearing headphones when I take a call. Conclusion: if you are looking for inexpensive headphones that do the job, this is a good choice"
1415,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just a heads-up: do not leave your headphones out where your little black kitty can find them. Tests have shown that little black kitties are extremely naughty and, for some strange reason, they think that headphone cords taste just like beef jerky. Oh, by the way, this pair was a replacement set."
1416,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to replace my favorite Sony Walkman headphones, which are hard to find these days. Plus, I don't like earbuds. I use these in an office environment connected to a smart phone for listening to streaming talk radio, music and podcasts. They are comfortable and sound crisp with nice bass. The cord is thicker and more durable than what is found on other lightweight headphones. I can plug the jack into my phone without having to remove my phone case. As an added bonus, they work well at blocking out co-workers' conversations. At this price, it won't be a disaster of they got damaged or stolen. I recommend these headphones."
1417,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The other reviews that say you don't need to buy expensive headphones to get a good, responsive sound are spot on.

I bought these as a replacement for computer some JVC computer headphones on my work computer that fell apart after years of use.

The sound is amazing. The headphones boost the low frequencies bringing the base forward, but the upper frequencies remain clear and distinctive. Using them for playback from the Amazon Cloud Player app on my iPad, to my ears the higher frequencies while clearer than the old headphones, could have been brought forward a little bit more. However they remained exceedingly clear. This preference (again to my ears) is easily adjusted with any playback application that contains a graphic equalizer.

With or without a graphic equalizer, the Sony headphones brought out portions of the music tracks making it almost like listening to music with an upgraded quality. I actually bought a second pair for use at home.

Perhaps the more expensive headphones are worth it to audiophiles, but for the money these are by far the best headphones I have come across."
1419,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice headphones for the price. They work great for casual use and are comfortable to wear. They don't isolate outside noise very well but do sound good for the price.
1420,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very happy with these! I've had them for a while now and they're still doing great. The sound is wonderful, and the headphones are easy on my ears. I have psoriasis in my ears so they're usually very sore, which is why I can't use earbud type headphones. these are very comfy. They stay put without squeezing my head!"
1421,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound great and work well with my galaxy s3 and my old portable CD player. It works well for taking phone calls. FWIW, I'm not using the Sony app for the headphones. Only con is that they make your ears sweat a lot when working out. Comfortable while wearing glasses."
1422,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using it for a while, I am going to give it a 4 for the price and build. the missing star is for the sound quality.
I had better expectation before i purchased it because it is a Sony. I got a free basic headphone when i bought a MD player many years ago. Although the headphone is a ""kit"" that comes with the MD player, it serves me well through the year. I thought I might get better quality by ""purchasing"" a new better one from Sony. after comparison, I found the sound quality to be pretty much the same or not as good as my old kit. the sound quality doesn't feel ""full"""
1423,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy with these for the price. My son has the $100+ version, and of course, they are better (more noise reduction, larger ear cover). But these fit my needs just fine."
1424,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They are OK. Kinda flimsy, don't feel that secure on my head. (A woman's reg sized head). Sound quality is alright, nothing amazing. An ok pair of cheap headphones if your not depending on them for too much."
1425,2.0 out of 5 stars,There's no way the ear cups are fitting over your ears. They have to be some of the smallest I've ever seen
1426,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned these for over a year. Work great! Sound is well balanced and clear. I mostly use this headphone for skype and can wear it for hours at a time. Great value for the price, would buy again."
1427,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Sony MDRZX110AP ZX headphones will not disappoint. They look great and feel great. The sound on these headphones really surprised me - in a good way. They have pretty good sound for 16$!! The mic also works wonderfully. It worked on my Xbox One but I had to change a few settings so the sound from the headset wouldn't echo in parties. The ability to fold these headphones is a really cool feature, because it makes them easier to carry around. The headset has a button on the wire that can pause and play content. Overall, these headphones do not disappoint."
1428,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, love how they fold up, I put them in my center console and pull them out when I need to use them."
1430,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love these!!!! I bought another pair just for my daughter because she keeps taking mine! I'm going to buy another pair for when I travel. <3 <3 Definitely recommend these!"
1431,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very high quality build and extrem lightweight! The bases could be a little bit deeper, but for that price and if you like on-ear headphones, go for them!"
1432,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome, used the speakers to install a stereo in my motorcycle helmet, sound quality is very good and loud and the foam ear covers limit noise nicely."
1433,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good budget headphones. I've bought a few pair of theses over the last couple of years. My daughter uses them daily. They won't last you forever with heavy use but very affordable so I don't mind having to buy again.
1434,3.0 out of 5 stars,They're okay. The cord is easily damaged.
1435,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is as awesome product for the price. I got it for 18 bucks and I love listening to music. Its adjustable and easy to carry. I use it for my daily walking and sometimes in gym. Not too heavy.
1436,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound, is great comfort, can wear them for several hours at a time without any discomfort. My generation still prefers this style to earbuds. I personally prefer wired instead of bluetooth. Will buy these again if and when my current pair wears out."
1437,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wouldn't say these are the BEST headphones, as they feel very plasticy and like they could break if mistreated... but these stay at my desk and are used for listening to music in the background while I'm working on things so they don't have to be top-notch. Well worth what I paid for them."
1438,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just started working from home and needed something to help block out external noise (children) and something comfortable to wear for long periods of time while working on my computer. Very comfortable to wear, easy to adjust to my big head, good clear sound (I listen mostly to podcasts and comedy bits...not much music). Good price point and very comfortable to wear. Would recommend."
1439,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was pleasantly surprised with the whole purchase experience. In fact, it was one of the most satisfied experiences in a long time. The order itself only took 24 hours to reach me and the product was a very good condition. I have been looking for a foldable headset for my phone for a long time and I always like Sony in my entire life. This didn't disappoint me at all. I highly recommend this product and seller on Amazon."
1441,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We were very happy with these headphones at first - good sound quality, great price. However, the headphones fell apart in under a year. On one pair, the cord broke at the connector piece. One another pair the plastic headband piece broke. We were not hard on these at all and they never left our house, so there was no reason for them to break. Very disappointed."
1442,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for the price, fit nice, sound good!"
1443,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered these for my kids in elementary school. I was tired of the cheap headphones breaking all the time. They work great and sound good. The angled plug in jack is awkward with protector cases but it works. The cord is really thick and I like that.
1444,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fine headphones. They feel great on my head, and sound is ok. For low range headphones they are just ok, because they are better headphones out there for the same price. The sound was not as loud as other headphones of the same price. The end of these headphones came when they fell from my desk and the pin that let the headphones to fold in pop out. Making them useless."
1445,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok. The head phones volume is very low need to boost the volume on my sony receiver. Not really that great for mobiles.
1446,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are tremendous headphones. The sound quality is excellent. I have a pair of ""Beats"" that were $150 bucks....this pair sounds just as good as the beats for a fraction of the price! The bass is full and rich and the sound reproduction in the mid-range and high range is crisp and clear. Overall, the sound reproduction is super. Very realistic. These headphones are well made, and had a nice, ""solid"" feel. These headphones are excellent and I would say ""stop looking, buy these."" Completely excellent value. Great product!!"
1447,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price you can't go wrong. Sounds great and the cord is long enough to sit my table on the end table and rest comfortably in the chair watching a movie.
1448,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for my daughter who is in kindergarten hasn’t broken them yet
1449,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for what I needed. I bought some other old skool headphones that did not block out the noise on the plane, these did. That's all I wanted was to watch movies and not hear the noise. I bought two pairs, one for my kid."
1450,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It a hearty pair of headphones , it last really long even with the roughness of everyday life( exercising , getting tangles, getting pulled,rain,etc.) and it sounds great."
1452,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my son a while back. He absolutely LOVES these headphones! After buying Skullcandy and being utterly disappointed, these headphones are STILL going strong."
1453,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ear piece connecting to the headband broke after four day of usage. It's cheap, so that quality is cheap. The sound quality is cheeeeeaper yet. I am surprise Sony would put out such a junk. For this low price and low quality of junk, I didn't even bother to get it exchanged."
1454,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is the second one and I still like it
1455,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Work well, use them to listen to movies on my iPad. Good bargain."
1456,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good, but there's is a 2.5, headphones 🎧 Jack.. And the 3.5 jacks, on my phone doesn't fit in really well….."
1457,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for my wife to use with phone and laptop. Excellent for the price. The sound quality is very good and the microphone very clear on calls. I don't think you'll find a better pair of headphones for the price.
1458,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for the money. They are very inexpensive and sound great.

They also fold flat, which is nice when traveling with a backpack/messenger bag."
1459,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price for what my husband wanted to listen to his You-Tube.
1460,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter started using this headphone and within a week she was complaining that she couldn't hear well. The volume would go up and down by it self or she could only hear on one side, if at all.
Update: LilGadgets just reached out to us and figured out the problem, a faulty cable. They'll be sending a new one to replace the bad one."
1461,3.0 out of 5 stars,Daughter was psyched to have these to feed her Nivana cravings...broken minijack 2 months later...good sound while it lasted wouldn't buy a second time...need headphones that can stand up to a pre-teen.
1463,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These were good while they lasted, but they broke after just under a year of usage."
1464,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent sound at the price point. Not for audiophiles who sit on amazon all day spanking their ear lobes to sennheisers.
1465,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had my old Sony 100's for over 5 years..The only thing was the ear pads got a bit worn,sound great as ever.
My old Sony headphones broke a few days ago..How? My shoe got caught under the headphone wire
and they broke...I was going to get the same pair of Sony headphones like I had before,But after reading
great views on these Sony 110 ZX I said why not..Well I Love them fits great on my ears and the music is
crisp and the sound perfect!!"
1466,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Most reviews were right for this headphone If you are needing a headphone for light use. Just don't expect the same quality audio as one to three hundred priced headphones. I bought these to use occasionally at work, and mainly to listen to talk radio. They fit well, and there is enough material or cushion that should satisfy most. Good value."
1467,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for my PS4 and it plugs in directly to the control and works with the mic. Online friends never complain about the mic quality. Saved me money on buying more expensive gear. Durability is good too as long as you take care of it. Very comfortable too.
1468,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones by Sony do not meet my expectations. First, the headware's stereo field is severely lacking in my opinion. They do not provide the amount of stereo quality/depth which I expect. Additionally, I find the product uncomfortable to wear for long periods. I suggest that Amazon customers purchase headphones by another manufacturer."
1469,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is great. Took forever to get them. I deducted two stars because they are quite large...pictures can be deceiving. I was looking for the smaller earpieces because I use these to travel with. My other ones just plain wore out!
1470,4.0 out of 5 stars,"the volume is a bit low on these, however easily compensated for by just jacking the vol way up on your device, otherwise perfect, incredible sound, separation, and great soundstage, bass is not overpowering (thank god!"""
1471,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good head phones fit great
1472,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I was looking for. They are perfect for everyday listening and are comfortable. I love that they fold up for easy travel and storage. The ear pieces are well padded and help cancel out extra noise.
1474,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Was hoping for a better product, but will find a use for them. I have a cheaper set of these that I bought at Walgreens and can hardly tell a difference. There is slightly more bass but higher frequencies disappointing."
1475,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect Budget headphones for anyone who is on the go. They fold up quite nicely and are actually around my neck at this very moment!

Pros : Good jack length, fold nicely, surprisingly good audio quality, cheap

Cons: Not too comfortable

Overall : I'd recommend this product for anyone who needs a set of headphones that do their job without all the extra cost."
1476,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good set of headphones for the price. I bought this 6 months ago, and is just as durable now as the first time I put them on. Sony has always been a brand I really trusted, so this was a no brainer for an affordable replacement. Sound quality is pretty good, and got a pretty good deal on them."
1477,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two pairs of these. Great value for the money. The cable could be a foot longer, but they are the length as advertised. I think a lot of thought went into making these, and they're made well."
1478,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphones work awesome, the audio quality for the price is excellent. The materials feels very resistant also the cable. It's easy to carry because of the compact design and the folding function. I totally recommend this headphones for the price."
1479,3.0 out of 5 stars,They sound good but they are definitely not as loud as any of my other ones. I wouldn't order them again
1480,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, but poor volume compare with others headphones I had. Maybe is because of the price."
1481,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work really well. I bought them for a long international flight. They fit easily into my backpack.
1482,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought there after I refunded the Amazon over the ear basic earphones for my brothers birthday. He had the same pair years ago but snapped the cord when the warranty expired. He uses them on his IPhone 6 and on out Lenovo computer with no problem.
1483,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm actually kind of surprised by all of the 5 star reviews for these, these headphones are really muffled sounding, almost like listening to things through a pillow. They're very comfortable and nicely made, but there are much better sounding headphones in this price range. I bought these instead of another pair of Sennheiser HD201s (which I've since given away) because the Sennheisers were a little bit uncomfortable, but I think I'd rather have the sound quality of the HD201s than the comfort of these headphones."
1485,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice solid pair of headphones great sound great price. Great alternative to wearing earbuds
1486,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is alright but I'd prefer that the sound wouldn't resonate outside the headphones. The bass quality is acceptable. I bought them because of the reviews' claim about them being just as good as Beats Headphones. At that point, I was fairly intrigued. Once I tried them, I knew to be much wary of the reviews from now on. Some people don't know what they're talking about."
1487,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great price, sound, and blocks out outside noise."
1488,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, Good price."
1489,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These should really get 4.5 stars. They aren't audiophile sound quality, but for $13, they are completely useable for most listening tasks."
1490,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These were really nice headphones. They fit comfortably, and were easily adjustable, a great pair for the price. Until they broke less than 6 weeks later. I've had $5 headphones last me longer than these did, and when I tried contacting both Sony and Amazon for support to get them replaced, I was told by Amazon that since it was past 30 days, they wouldn't refund or replace them and Sony never responded to various requests for help. My advice: save your money and pick a different set of headphones."
1491,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the ear pads. I can hear my music clearly but doesn't bother anyone else. The microphone was just an added bonus for me. Rarely use it to make calls but when I do the person on the other end hears me clear as a bell. I recommend.
1492,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sounding headphones and the price is more than fair.
1493,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for mobile phone and Mac for conference calls and Webex. Bluetooth ones might NOT be stable.I wish SONY could use thicker wires though.
1494,5.0 out of 5 stars,VERY GOOD HEADPHONES CAN HEAR MUSIC GREAT
1496,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for my son & he is just thrilled with them. Due to ear infections, the doctor insists he use over the ear phones rather than ear buds when he listens to his music or watches a DVD. These have been perfect. They arrived quickly & were very reasonably priced. They fit his head well & give great sound. Hopefully they will last a long time."
1497,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a bad replacement for my poor Sennheisers that fell victim to my cat, good sound quality, comfortable fit."
1498,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Was skeptical how well it sounds given the purchase was close $10.00. I am pleasantly suprised at how rich the sound is and the bass is perfect. Not overbearing and not tinny. The only downside which is the comfort for over the ear phones. This is true with every other over-the-ear phone I tried and so not knocking the star for Sony.

After trying many other brands, so far my experience is Sony Headphones is top-notch. Will love it if I can find over the year one with same quality and affordability from Sony."
1499,2.0 out of 5 stars,One of the two I have used. And that one has a loose connection. I am always having to push the connector in the phone. I am scare to see if I wasted money on the other one. I am never negative and can find positives. This one I am still searching.
1500,3.0 out of 5 stars,They work. They sound fine. They're sturdy enough and can extend. They also make my ears uncomfortable after an hour. Not recommended if you want great headphones.
1501,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. Not too expensive, great noise cancelling, and are a great fit."
1502,1.0 out of 5 stars,One side stopped working just a few months after purchase
1503,4.0 out of 5 stars,they are great. After using them for a couple of hours they are not super comfy .
1504,4.0 out of 5 stars,"You are getting what you pay for. Dirt cheap headset for casual use. If you are looking to do some heavy gaming look somewhere else. It is sufficient for me, but it may not be for you. Worth the money to an extent."
1505,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony's MDR-ZX series is the gold standard of cheap headphones. Good build quality, with excellent sound for the price make this a prime choice for a budget-conscious consumer. The -110 series feels a bit flimsier then the -100, and lacks the coloring to distinguish the right cup at a glance, but the cups fold up to the headband for more compact storage."
1507,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for the price. Nice clean look and comfortable cushions. For someone with a smaller head it is a perfect fit but if you have a larger head it may be a little small or uncomfortable. Sound quality is average depending on the device. My phone does not pick up the sound quite as well as my mac desktop. But all in all great pair and can't beat the price.
1508,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for travel.
1509,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband loves these earphones. The cushions on ear pieces are nice when wearing for long periods & the band is flexible for adjusting to desired tightness on head.
1510,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My purchase was based on the many 4-5 star reviews and I was disappointed. I used these as soon as i received them and I was not satisfied. They do what their supposed to do but nothing special, they also feel cheaply made but for $20 they are alright."
1511,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was very excited to get these because of all the great reviews! I immediately plugged them into my phone, and no sound came out from the right speaker. Very disappointed. I checked my connections and song choices with no change. Had to return. I want to buy another pair but afraid to waste my time."
1512,2.0 out of 5 stars,"basic backup headset. the headset is really cheaply made and not ready cozy to have on head for long time, like watching movie. Sound is some what OK but not great. I would say you can do better with other brands for the price."
1513,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my son because he can't stand the earbud style. These are comfortable to wear, have great sound, and still pack easily in a small pocket of his book bag. He's used them nearly every day for 6 months and they are still in great condition."
1514,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight and compact so they're perfect for travel. I take them everywhere in my backpack. They add almost no weight and fold up nicely to stay out of the way.

They won't blow you away but the sound is sufficient for the average listener. Very clean, clear and crisp mid and highs. Bass response tends to flatten out at higher volumes, but tweaking the equalizer in my audio player overcomes that easily.

The cord is a little annoying as it is susceptible to tangling. I use a simple tie to keep the cable neat while packed away.

Overall I'm happy with the purchase. Great value for the price."
1515,1.0 out of 5 stars,Really hated it!
1516,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not working after 1 year!
1518,2.0 out of 5 stars,It was working alright for 3 months and suddenly one side stopped working. No idea of what happened. Something wrong with the product
1519,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are good headphones. They have survived my 8 year old son so far.
1520,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these to wear while working and they work great.
1521,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kids liked them
1522,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty darn good considering the price.
1523,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound seems really good on these headphones. I plan on using them mostly for an electronic keyboard we own, and the sound coming through the headphones sounds fantastic -- better than the sound that comes through the external speakers on the keyboard itself (which still sounds decent). The only thing I'd dock a star for is that they feel a little tight. I haven't worn them for very long yet, but it seems like the tightness might be a small issue, and I think there's nothing you can do to adjust them from side-to-side (i.e. width-wise instead of length-wise). Otherwise, they seem great."
1524,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, these are really spectacular headphones. They have good strong bass, clear sound, and decent noise-canceling ability. Like all over-the-ear phones they squeeze the head a bit, but you could pay a lot more and get a lot less than the quality of these headphones."
1525,5.0 out of 5 stars,My kiddo loves them - just as described.
1526,5.0 out of 5 stars,Big fan of Sony quality.
1527,2.0 out of 5 stars,"VERY uncomfortable to wear for more than 10-15 minutes at a time. The audio quality is on par with just about any other headset, but I'd forego these in favor of more expensive/more comfortable ones next time."
1529,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite ""library"" headphones. I use them to listen to CDs from iTunes on my MBPR. They don't muffle out all outside sounds (so what), but they do prevent others from being bothered with my musical choices.
Excellent quality, especially at the price point. I listen to lots of newer jazz (D. Holland, D. Douglas, B. Stenson. W. Leo-Smith, W. Parker, D.S. Ware, B. Frisell) - throw in some U2, Cowboy junkies, N.Young, B. Laswell etc - NO complaints.
You can wear these for hours without notice, even with reading glasses.
At the price they are easily replaceable if lost, broken, whereas having to replace. say, a pair of HD598 CS might get me pissed off."
1530,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones do indeed do their job as expected and I am generally happy with the result. There is one warning that prevents me from giving this product five stars. It makes a lot of static noises upon first usage. This problem did naturally go away over time as I used them more and more, but it does seem like an issue that could possibly cause a customer to demand a refund if he is not willing to wait out the sound. Other than that issue, the product is great. The cord is a reasonable distance and the sound comes out nicely. It is not extremely comfortable and sort of lacks smooth adjustment maneuvers for the head size, but it gets the job done perfectly, especially for the cheap price it sells for.

I'd recommend the head set coming with a small package of the restrainers that it comes with upon opening. I'm sure I'm not the only person who treats wrapping up his headphones nicely as a big deal, but often lose the restrainer. Doing this might send a hidden message to the customer that the seller expects this thing to last a good while as long as it is taken care of."
1531,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered these to replace a pair with the exact same model number.
The new ones are much more ""cheap"" looking and uncomfortable and the sound quality is definitely not near as good as the old pair.
Either the pair I got was a cheap knock off or Sony quality standards have went down"
1532,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because I wanted something more substantial than the ubiquitous white earbuds that came with my iPhone. They're not uncomfortable to wear and they fold up to a good size that isn't burdensome when travelling. The sound quality they deliver is great for the price, but for me what's really important is the clear signal they send to the chatty person sitting next to me on the airplane that I really don't want to hear about your grandkids for the next 3 hours."
1533,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed a good pair of headphones (as I can't use earbuds because they really hurt my ears because they do not fit properly due to the shape of them) so that I can listen to my instructors lectures on line and hear them clearly, and to listen to music while doing homework and my daughter even uses them to watch her DVD player in the car or her tablet in the home. They've been wonderful and have an excellent quality of sound that's very crisp. They're also incredibly comfortable! You won't go wrong, especially for the money! It's such an excellence deal for such a wonderful quality product."
1534,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the headphone/set, very good sound for the price.
Mic function works perfect.
It lacks other buttons such as music controls, mute, etc.
But for the price it is expected.
They are good of short to medium listening.

***Note: As other reviewers have stated,
The head band does feel tight and you feel discomfort after 1hr or so of continuous listening.
I recommend to use a hair drier to heat the plastic headband.
This will let the plastic get heated so you can stretch the headband a bit to make loose as you see fit."
1535,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed some headphones to listen to audio books during my next business trip. Maybe I'm getting old, but I was sick of the in-ear buds that my cell phone came with, and wanted some comfort in my life. I purchased these after reading the reviews that they're comparable to the Beats headphones. I don't have a magical ear, but these sound great to me, certainly better than I'd expect $20 headphone to sound. And if you're picky enough to want the sound of $250 headphones, then go buy some $250 headphones--simple, right? I did not want to spend more that $20, and I did not want something that looked ridiculous. These feel amazing on my ears, and don't look odd on my head. I wore them for 8 hours during my plan ride, and felt great. I also like that these can be pulled off my ear and sit on my neck. In-ear buds always got caught in my purse, or fell on the floor (yuck)."
1536,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had these a day now, but I can say WOW. The bass is amazing! Music on these is way richer than my MDRZX100. However, everything else seems to be drowned out on these vs the 100. TV shows feel like they have way too much bass. For music, I'd recommend the 110 to anyone but for all-around good sound, I'd have to fall back to the 100. Also, the 110's swivel is much more fragile than the 100's and I feel like it won't last long. My 100's have been dropped, kicked, stomped, and generally manhandled by my kids and they still work just as good as they did the day I bought them."
1537,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Sony MDRZX110 stereo headphones are often lauded for their amazing sound quality, elegant design, and, most of all, stellar price. I wanted to test out these headphones to see if they were worthy of that praise, and (maybe) snap up some cheap backup headphones in the process.

These headphones sport a clean, minimal design, which I honestly appreciate. Though Beats headphones may look classy to you, I prefer the subtle, understated look Sony accomplished here. There are two models, Black and White (I chose the Black, but I was also able to have some hands-on time with my brother's White model). Each one features a matte finish on most of the body, which looks great; there is also a nice glossy portion on the backs of each ""earphone"" that accentuates the matte well. In terms of ports, the 3.5mm headphone jack is especially convenient, allowing you to connect straight to your phone if you'd like to kick back and listen to podcasts, movies, and, of course, music. There is another variant with a microphone built in, but I did not purchase this model and thus, I will not offer my opinion on it. Overall, build quality and design is excellent, but the top portion that sits atop your head feels a little flimsy, and though I appreciate the fact that the ""earphones"" fold inwards to create a compact package, I feel as though I will break them every time I try. Additionally, they're not completely comfortable, but I found that, during hours-long jam sessions, I never noticed them or had a reason to take them off and stop listening.

In terms of sound quality, Sony absolutely nailed it here. I concur with the other reviewers on this point - it's a nice, balanced sound. You get solid bass and great quality across the spectrum. I honestly think that these headphones could replace your Beats or more expensive equivalent if necessary. Sure, you won't get the complete range in crystal-clear quality and you won't feel as though you're in the recording studio (which is OK because pretty much no modern pair of headphones can achieve that), but (and this is a common theme throughout my review) for a starting price of fifteen bucks, it is a little difficult to nitpick here.

For the price, it's absolutely one of the best products I've had the pleasure of using. These Sony ZX series headphones pack a serious, bass-filled punch. They sport a modern and minimal design and sound quality is remarkable. Sure, the latest pair of top-of-the-line headphones will probably sound quite a bit better than these, and the build quality is weak in some areas, but again - consider the price and you'll be in awe of their performance. Absolute joy to use."
1538,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a (similar) pair of these before, so I ordered these thinking it was the same pair. I was a little surprised when I opened them and saw how small they are. The ones I had before were over the ear, not on ear, so were slightly bigger. These are fine though. They're comfortable and fit well. I gave them 4 stars because they're not very loud. I can put my music on max volume and still afford to go louder. This is my personal preference, of course, so I'm sure anyone who prefers to listen to music at normal levels won't notice."
1540,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For budget headphones, they are fine.

I like that they are comfortable to wear, look streamlined and reasonably attractive, and anyone can purchase these without breaking the bank.

The downfall is that the quality of the audio will never be anything more than mediocre.
There is no sharpness, no depth, no fineness that comes through. The volume doesn't reach high levels.

All in all, these are fine if you don't care to catch detail in what you listen to, and you don't need to listen at a high volume."
1541,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have gifted 4 or 5 pair of these headphones to people. Great, quality sound in both the high end and low end range. Great cord with a good length and comfortable ear pieces. Hard to beat for the price."
1542,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the money you wouldn't expect much, but was very surprised on the sound. I read what other comments were made on them and they sounded good to me, so I decided to try them,and very glad I did. I also found them comfortable on my head. Nice find !!"
1543,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for my mother as her old headphones, older model of these, ear pads were peeling and leaving plastic white peelings on her ears and on her clothes after use. No pealing with these and the sound quality sounds better than the previous model."
1544,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price these headphones are incredible. Compared to my sons Beats, they are not far behind. They deliver a great sound quality, look fashionable, have nice quality of manufacture, and provide the right level of isolation from ambient noise."
1545,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this headphones for my 10 year old because he needed them for computer lab in school. He loves them.
1546,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought them for my 11 year old son to use on his cell phone. He enjoys them. The sound quality is good for the price! The microphone feature is great.
1547,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!
1548,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fit fine and sound good. I do wish the cord was a tiny bit longer.
1549,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ah, Sony. :) What else is there to say? I try not to buy any other brand for sound when I can help it. This one is a happy addition to the collection."
1551,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, while they lasted - which was about 6 months."
1552,4.0 out of 5 stars,good noise cancellation.
1553,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed!! Has a very tiney sound, and the bass response is pitiful. Cannot listen to it loudly, because instead of rich full body sound, it hurts your ears."
1554,1.0 out of 5 stars,I just got these today. They sound okay not as good as Colby brand. I gave them one star because they're very very uncomfortable they hurt within a few minutes or more. They sound just ok nothing big and not loud enough for me.
1555,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good audio quality, decent fit for my pumpkin head. I wish they had better range, but there's enough bass, not booming but acceptable."
1556,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality for a great price
1557,5.0 out of 5 stars,"VERY comfortable, light-weight, and convenient to pack since they fold flat."
1558,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite brand of $20 headphones.
1559,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I received these headphones, the audio quality was alright, though not as good as my last pair of similarly priced Sony headphones. But I was immediately concerned with how flimsy the headphones felt. After 6 months of light usage (3 times a week), the headphones did end up snapping, proving also not to be as reliable as my last similarly priced Sony headphones."
1560,5.0 out of 5 stars,good price and quality
1562,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only used this lnot even 20 times and the male aux plug is acting up, other than that it's a good product"
1563,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE THESE, THEY EVEN BLOCKED OUT THE NOISE FROM THE AIRPLANE"
1564,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my children for Christmas. Comfortable on the ears. My 18-year old daughter said the sound quality is great and that they are great alternatives to the Beats headphones.
1565,5.0 out of 5 stars,wonderful
1566,4.0 out of 5 stars,For the price this is a very good seth of phones. I would definitely purchase them again!
1567,2.0 out of 5 stars,I got these and there was a bad connection in the wire near the microphone. Returned and got my money back.
1568,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Mine came with one headphone dead. This was very disappointing. Also, these shouldn't be called ""over the ear"" headphones unless you have itsy bitsy baby ears. I have small ears and these just dug into them."
1569,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honestly they worth the money. I paid those headphone 7.99$ but they sound great. Of course they do not match a 100+ dollar headphone but they are not crap. It is very good. I recommend it
1570,4.0 out of 5 stars,"With affordable prices and good quality this is a great and comfortable pair of headphones that I throw in any travel bag.
Hope this helps"
1571,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphone is good for daily use and this is our second buy. First one is running for last two years.
1573,5.0 out of 5 stars,they work and sound great as long as you take care of them they will serve you well
1574,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought these headphones for our son's 7th birthday, and he loves them. We have tried all kinds of ""kids"" headphones, but they don't last very long. But these I recommend for any age as long as it's taken care of. The sound quality is very good."
1575,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I think that for the price, these headphones are a bargain."
1576,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are one of the best I own. It's really comfortable, sound is amazing. Might not be the best for rap or hip hop or any bass orientated music. But if you're like me who listen to rock and pop and everything out there, these headphones are a great steal. I bought I last year but unfortunately it broke due to carelessly mistreating it. But my love for these headphone made me purchase two of them this year. Thanks for a great product Sony."
1577,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones! Compact and portable, too, as they fold. They only fit one way on the ears, so no switching around to see which side/ way fits. Very comfy on the ears, and make for a great sound seal. Great purchase!"
1578,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap and simple but do the job, but look and sound great."
1579,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great. The in-line mic is awesome! However they also fell apart in a matter of weeks. The audio/mic quality was expected of Sony, the build quality was not. I was definitely disappointed in this purchase."
1580,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent product but I have to have the volume all the way up to hear anything and the bass is lacking. Also they right headphone went out in less than 3 months.
1581,1.0 out of 5 stars,A lot of bass and not much more. Not worth owning.
1582,2.0 out of 5 stars,"it worked very well at first, 3 month later, I found there's statics on the left ear when the bass is strong.
not recommend"
1584,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not a great product. This headphone is okay to the price it is available. One thing I liked it has got the Microphone hence you can use the same headphone for the call as well. Music sound is Sound is okay and as expected with 30mm driver.
1585,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent sound quality. The headphones are comfortable and block out a lot of noise. Perfect for listening to audio books.
1586,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones. Great sound and very comfortable. However, the shipping kinda sucked. Labeled as prime. I ordered on a monday and it still hadnt shipped by thursday... so I cancelled and reordered. Got em three days later."
1587,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not what I expected, but I should have known for just $20 !!"
1588,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good
1589,4.0 out of 5 stars,These weren't the highest quality headphones but they were perfect for my purpose of listening to TV thru a speaker cable and not disturbing my sleeping wife. Good value for the money.
1590,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Meh. I ended up giving these to my daughter to use at school, which is fine for her at school use. I wanted to use them at work and the quality was not up to par for that."
1591,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These were great, but then the cord frayed after 4 months of normal use and the seller has not responded to requests for a refund/exchange. If they are reading this, I would appreciate either a refund or exchange! I do not plan to order again unless I hear from the seller."
1592,3.0 out of 5 stars,The price is great and the sound is good enough. My only complaint is that it hurts my ears after prolong use. It could be that I have large ears that stick out a bit. So if you have large ears and will be using these headphones for longer than 20 to 40 min it could hurt.
1593,5.0 out of 5 stars,These things work great. Even worked perfectly fine when I use to play xbox one and would plug them into my controller. I was able to play without waking up the baby. Also great use for my laptop. Still use them to this day.
1595,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sound and love the microphone feature. They are very comfortable, even with quite a few piercings, and even keep my ears warm on cold walks to work. Would recommend for sure!"
1596,3.0 out of 5 stars,These sound suprisingly good for such inexpensive headphones but I don't use them much because they are uncomfortable to wear. I only busy them out for special listening sessions.
1597,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sure beat ear buds.
1598,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good headphones at a great price. The sound quality is very good for its value.

It does not cover the ears, however feel good. They are very comfortable.

Obviously no noise cancellation. Its design is really convenient.

Nothing to envy to other headphones that can be expensive and poor sound quality."
1599,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for the price, but a little too muddy sounding. Not as crisp as I would like. But then again, they are inexpensive and quality seems well built."
1600,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like these headphones! The sound is very good in them.
1601,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple headset that folds flat AND surprisingly gives great sound! Perfect for taking with you on-the-go.
1602,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price these are great! I thought they would be too good to be true at the price point, but I've been pleasantly surprised."
1603,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a set of MDR-V150's that I got 6 years ago (for $15) and used basically every day since. They can take a beating but I didn't want to keep dragging them back and forth to work, so I decided to pick up another similar pair, expecting similar robustness from Sony.

The sound quality is what I expect from $16 headphones, but the design is lacking, compared to the MDR-V150:
- The folding part does not have a strong detent so it is easy to collapse, even just picking them up off a desk.
- The made the ""left side indicator"" (for tactile-y recognizing left-right) very small on the band, instead of on the back of the driver,
- There are no labels for increments on the adjustable size band. The MDR-V150 has numbers for reading the size of the band, these do not, no lines or anything to check size before you put it on your head.

I'll tough this out and use them, but I have my doubts that these will last long, and i definitely will look further"
1604,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality was good, but they have already developed a short in the plug after only a month of light use. I can't say anything good about a product that is this delicate. It's really a shame because they are good headphones otherwise."
1606,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After buying a few off brands, I went to a brand I know. In the past few weeks, this has been a great headset. Sony has delivered on quality. I'll let you know if anything changes."
1607,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound - nice deep bass - very comfortable to wear - works with my Computer - S4 Galaxy and digital voice recorders. I can hear sounds with these I can not hear with my old head phones or my ear buds.
1608,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great sound good quality
lasted my kids over a year so that's saying something"
1609,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great for the money. for this price, these are by far the best headphones I have ever heard. they fit comfortably as well. the item came as ordered and was delivered promptly."
1610,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't write very many reviews, but these sound terrific. I originally purchased these simply to listen to some tunes while mowing the lawn, but I find myself plugging them in and zoning out with a favorite album like I used to when I was younger. I imagine more pitch perfect audiophiles might gripe about depth of sound, but these little cheapies really produce a nice crisp sound with a layered multichannel feel. They really do a great job at articulating each instrument in even fairly complex pieces of music. A great buy."
1611,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superb sound quality. While I am not an audiophile, I think these cheap headphones sound great and there is no distortion."
1612,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works as expected
1613,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphone is not same with Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX. One with the mic has low quality cable, plug and material. I had a same white headphone and I thought I am going to get the same black headphone with a mic, but disappointed!"
1614,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent quality and decent sound, nothing mind blowing. I am using this as a travel set and it has survived without issue in my back pack. Sounds OK in a casio px150 (bass is too strong), unsurprisingly sounds better when streaming music. Sound isolation is surprisingly good."
1615,2.0 out of 5 stars,"As basic headphones, these worked great at first. But after less than two months of use, I started getting scratchy sounds during audio playback. Now I'm lucky if I make it through one song or video file without picking up serious distortion. These are not 4.5/5 star headphones, contrary to what the Amazon rating implies. I'll be seeking a refund, given how quickly it took my headphones to malfunction."
1617,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I got these, I was using the ear buds from a 10 year old iPod, the sound was tinny and I had to hold the wire a certain way to hear it in both ears. These are way better. They have a very full, rich sound. I hear things in songs that I never knew were there before. My only complaint is that they make the tops of my ears hurt if I wear them for a long time, but I think I'll get used to that eventually. Maybe I am not the best person to review headphones."
1618,5.0 out of 5 stars,Father in law loves them.
1619,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are finally dying out after 2 years and hundreds if not thousands of hours of use and punishment they made it through a winter storm, getting soaking wet, and being dropped off a 5th story balcony before succumbing and they have great sound and fit comfortable as well. i would buy another pair anytime great value."
1620,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't expect high quality but it works fine.
1621,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight good sound
1622,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, good quality
Will buy again A+++"
1623,5.0 out of 5 stars,"BOY THESE SURE SOUND GREAT I KNOW I""LOVE THIS"
1624,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
1625,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are very comfortable and work very well. I had purchased a few for the family and they all work well.
1626,5.0 out of 5 stars,"awesome headphones bought them to replace the crappy earbuds for my mp3 player and they make the sound quality 1000% better they fit well and stay in place

I would recommend this product"
1628,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones. The sound is crystal clear and sounds like more expensive ones. I used the on a flight to New York and had them on the whole trip, they are very comfortable. I would definitely recommend."
1629,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got them fast and they work great. My mom loves them!
1630,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good. Could be tighter on the ears. Good sound.
1631,4.0 out of 5 stars,Loud and economic. they could be a bit more comfy.
1632,3.0 out of 5 stars,Too heavy on the bass for me. Extremely comfortable to wear.
1633,5.0 out of 5 stars,So much better than any other pair of headphones I've owned in this price range.
1634,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headset is just what I wanted. Sound is amazing (I've had Beats by Dre and I cannot tell one from the other) . I've had this product for almost a year now and I still get compliments on the street about how cool my headset looks.
Fits small heads and works amazing on my daily skype with my SO."
1635,5.0 out of 5 stars,Granddaughter loved these and says everything sounds great with them!! They were definitely a hit and for great price too! Would recommend!
1636,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great! I highly recommend, and I'm really surprised at how much I enjoy listening to music and audio books with them. It is like I'm in my own little world. At the price, it's an amazing value."
1637,5.0 out of 5 stars,love it. old head phones broke after 3 years.
1639,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Slow Shipping! Sound was Good. But Headphone had a Marred Finish in Several Places. Probably a Store Return Headphone. I did not Return the Headphones, to much Hassle.."
1640,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do video recording and need to check sound on location. I also do home recording with GarageBand, so I need a reliable set of headphones. These are great for the price. I recommend them. Can't go wrong with Sony."
1641,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound quality for a very reasonable price.
1642,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones -- I use them at work to play instrumental (Zen) music to drown out the co-worker talk and office noise. They have a very good sound, are flexible enough to fit my big head, and the price was excellent."
1643,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was just looking for some fairly simple headphones to drown out some of the noise at work... I didn't really need a microphone and wasn't really intending to use them with my phone, but the version with the mic was only about $5 more, and I figured it wouldn't hurt to keep my options open.

They work great for their intended purpose. I listen to an assortment of streaming music throughout the day and it sounds great. I'm no audiophile and I don't have the vocabulary to to properly express things like tone and range - but the music I'm listening to sounds good. At least as good as any other speakers or headphones I've used.

The addition of the mic is actually pretty nice, even when I'm not really using it. There's a button on the cord that (when plugged into a device that supports it) serves to mute and unmute the microphone when it's in-use... But it also serves to mute and unmute music when it's just playing music. That's additional functionality that I hadn't expected, and I'm quite happy with it.

The cable is a little bit on the short side - only about four feet long. That's more than long enough to reach my phone or computer, but both of those are sitting atop my desk. If I were trying to plug into something tucked away inside a cabinet or down on the floor I'd be having a hard time.

The headphones fold up for travel. They don't get especially compact... But simply rotating the earphones flat makes transportation much easier.

They're a little creaky. Nothing horrible... But if I move just right there's some creaking in my ears. It isn't a big issue since I'm typically using them at my desk, but I'm sure it'd be more noticeable if I were wearing them while doing something more active - running or something like that."
1644,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great pair of headphones for the price. I have had this headphones for years (it has lasted very long), and it has traveled all over the world with me. I loved it so much that i purchased it again."
1645,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect earphones at a reasonable price. I'm a drummer and these phones are perfect in filtering out unwanted noise. So good in fact, I bought a 2nd pair with a splitter so I and a partner can work together."
1646,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only reason I didn't give the headphones 5 stars was because they lack some bass. Other than that they are great. I am using the headphones with my Ps4 and the mic works great in chat. The sound quality is good it could be a bit better, but for the price these are great. I've owned these headphones for months now and I think they are great. My friend has a set of Bose headphones and I think my headphones are almost as good."
1647,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones, especially for the price. I love the folding design; makes it easy to carry in my backpack. The bass is nice, not too strong or overpowering. Overall, sound quality is great, seems pretty durable, and only for $20."
1648,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality product. Did exactly what I needed it to. Great product and a great price! Works as well as the high end models. Would recommend to a friend.
1650,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly amazing sound for the price. They shipped fast and arrived in two days thanks to Amazon Prime. The packaging is fairly plane, but adequate and doesn't really convey the quality of the sound in the headset. I have a big head (wear about a size 8 hat) and my wife has a small head (she wears an adult small helmet) and the headphones fit us both perfectly. I plugged it into our Android phones and listened to music for several hours, then into a computer and again listened to music for several hours. The sound, frequency response, and bass was impressive. I'm not usually one to listen to loud music or heavy base, but these sounded so good I couldn't take them off.

FYI, we purchased these in preparation for a long flight but I see them getting a lot of use. My son has already taken my pair, so I will be ordering more."
1651,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony MDRZX110 ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black) Seems like we never have enough sets of these headphones because everyone loves using them and I love the price!
These are inexpensive headphones with a great sound quality. The sound is very clear and detailed and the bass was surprisingly better than another brand we have.
Comfortable to wear with nice clear sound and mic that is easy to use.
We have a few pairs of these for the teens in the household to keep on hand for when they have friends over and and are playing their computer games together. One thing I like is the kids can actually hear me say something to them when they have these on.
I also like these for the kids when they travel then I do not have to worry if they break them or lose them compared to some higher end ones we have."
1652,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My grandson likes these headphones and sound good for the price. Most headphones are way overpriced and I have owned numerous ones and have had cheap units sound as good as the high priced ones. Sometimes I think at an expensive headphone influences a person to believe that it sounds much better that it really does. Not to say that some expensive sets can't sound great, just that some cheaper sets can also sound very good too. These are not bad sounding Sony headphones that are holding up well to be hauled around in a kids backpack."
1653,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great as a PS4 headset. They are light and actually a little more comfortable than some of the big expensive gaming headsets. My son unplugs them from the PS4 and straight into his iPhone for music and phone calls. The multifunction button on the cord controls phone functions and the microphone picks up well. Sound quality is very good for this price level. If you need a good sounding cheap worry-free pair of headphones and not a flashy status symbol, these are for you. You can buy 10 or 12 of these for the price of one set of those colorful popular headsets. Helps avoid that sick feeling one gets when expensive headsets go missing."
1654,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is a No-Mic option which is cool because I really prefer to have just the headphone. Initially, bought for the kids - the sound quality is decent and for the price, I could not complain. Sony is always a go-to brand name for good sound quality. You could probably find similar quality from competing options, but Sony doesn't typically let me down. (Meanwhile, other brands could leave some to be desired in quality, comfort-ability and value.)

After some time with the kids, they are still in-tact, so if you were worried about durability, these fit the bill. (Because you know the kids left them down for the baby to get a hold of, and they are still okay!)"
1655,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a pair of head phones to wear at the gym. I can't find a single pair of ear buds that will stay in my ear while running. I have tried the normal style and the sport ones that loop behind each ear. I was trying to avoid the style of these headphones due to how bulky I suspected they would be but to my surprise they aren't that bad. They do stay put on your head well even while running on the treadmill. The sound quality for a pair of headphones of this price is great. These aren't beats or bose headphones so dont expect that caliber of sound quality. But even so, I was happy with how my music sounded. Good buy."
1656,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always bought Sony headphones, my current set has had its last speaker pod superglued-taped back into place.. 10 years was a good run from them.. This set of MDRZX110 ZX sounds every bit as good as the set it replaced.. The Bass is great for a set of this size, punchy and great middle/high tone definition.. Maybe these will last until 2029"
1657,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good. They weren't comfortable when they arrived but now they are. When they arrived they were wide and flat across the top of my head, they dug into the top of my pointy head but they didn't hug my ears. In fact they slid off my head when I was hoping to listen lying down. I had to squeeze them together and put a couple of rubber bands on it to hold it together and to bend it so it would be more like the shape of my head. I kept the rubber bands on for an entire day. So if your head shape is more oval than round they may not fit you either, but they seem to be okay now! I've only had they a short time but now I'm enjoying them and I'm happy I got them, especially as the price fits my budget."
1658,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered these for my son, needed over ear headphones for 1st grade. They fit his head and didn't squeeze his ears! Sound was pretty good for the price! Thr only issue was the plug jack if touched or jiggled at all would static out. Pretty good unless you want to move around with them"
1659,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are terrible. I did not expect the sound quality to be so bad. I made a mistake in believing a Sony product would mean I would be getting a product of superior quality, I was wrong. I have seven dollar headphones that sound much better. They should not be charging more than five dollars for these, due to terrible sound quality. Shame on Sony, I no longer trust the brand."
1661,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had three pairs of these. I like them but the skinny cords are a problem as I have cats. The cats are somehow attracted to them, and one bite is all it takes."
1662,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these Sony headphones. They are very comfortable to wear and adjust easily for different sizes of heads. They are nicely padded to be comfortable to the ear and produce quality sound. They have a folding feature that allows them to fold flat for easy storage. The price is great and so is the product. We already have two of these in our household, and I sure we will purchase more in the future!"
1663,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought as a gift, they said the sound quality is very nice and loves the fold up feature."
1664,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good considering the price. Mediocre sound. The wires in phone of right ear's speaker crapped out after about a year's worth of semi-regular use.
1665,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good budget headphone for iPod or tablet...not really suited for hi-fi or movie watching but will do in a pinch. For less than 10.00 a pretty good bargain.
1666,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good sound for the price and way better than the Behringer cheap phones.
1667,1.0 out of 5 stars,They broke! I had the previous Sony headphones lasted for years. But these just came off after only a few months
1668,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good enough to replace ear buds. High impedance so don't expect a big sound.
1669,2.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Basics are better. I will just used these as back up....Dont bother....
1670,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is OK, however I sent back after I found the Amazon Basics headphones."
1672,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sound quality and pretty comfortable headphones I'm pretty happy with this purchase!
1673,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound,sturdier than most brands, nice has not too deep. Excellent buy."
1674,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for kids -- they are cheap, durable and have a long cord for car media players, etc...I go through a few each year."
1675,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality sound. Nice range. Sound isn't too low on my pair, but then again I don't blow my brains out like I used to. These fit on the ear, not over the ear. You'd need to have ears the size of a fifty cent piece for the headphones to fit over them."
1676,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Received an item that was damaged AUX cord was messed up. Item was refunded. Bought a second pair.

These headphones are your best bet for cheap headphones the sound is very good for the price and they are very comfortable on your ears."
1677,5.0 out of 5 stars,Item was purchased at an excellent price and were purchased as a gift for a 10 year old. Headphones sounded great for the price. Very satisfied.
1678,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these headphones for my kids and it works great. Kids are very rough on headphones and these are still in perfect condition after a lot of use. I also like the fact that its cheap and easy to replace if needed
1679,5.0 out of 5 stars,great
1680,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My order was dated June 9th, 2015. Product stopped working on July 29th, 2015. Past time for return. Now, if I can only get warranty info from SONY. Link to seller's warranty is useless."
1681,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones. Bought a pair for myself, then my wife took them... So this one if for me. Great sound. Was shocked at how good bass comes across. By far worth the price."
1683,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Either these are broken or they need better instructions. When I plug them in to tablet, laptop, or phone, nada. The packaging was so hard to open I have no idea how to even return them, but I will try. They're nice looking and comfortable. I expected better of a Sony product."
1684,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. Note that the mic does not have volume control that you might assume is standard on similar headphones.
1685,3.0 out of 5 stars,Squeezes my temple. The sounds is slightly better that what you would get from cheap earbuds. Thank about it. This is not a steal. It's adequate for the price.
1686,5.0 out of 5 stars,thanks
1687,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is fine, especially for the price. However, I was dismayed to find that the cord is incredibly short and that I will need to return these headphones if I cannot find an inexpensive extender. Which could introduce static. So count me dissatisfied. I should have just bought another pair of Sennheisers. You probably should too. I've had two pairs of Sennheisers, each lasted several years of almost daily use, and they are an excellent value."
1688,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a OK headphone, suitable for kid use in the school."
1689,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good pair.
1690,4.0 out of 5 stars,Working great. Sound is not impressive.
1691,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ordered a second pair because the first ones accidentally got stepped on. My daughter used these to practice piano benchmarks on a keyboard all last year. She is a music major.
1692,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to love these with all the great reviews. I have a small head so they are lose around my head, but squish my ears which is uncomfortable after awhile.. Maybe after some wear they will let up..."
1694,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it
1695,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable with noise cancellation, a good value for the money"
1696,1.0 out of 5 stars,This was great for my 6 year old at first but not even 2 months later it stopped working. My son mainly used this for the desktop computer and his tablet to watch movies. Sucks its wasted money. Save yourself the hassle and get something better quality than this
1697,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a good product for the price. They work well in my computer (I use skype a lot, and I'm always watching videos), in my ipad mini and even in my iphone 4s. They are really comfortable (but you need to pay attention in R and L signs and put in the right ears)."
1698,5.0 out of 5 stars,SONY Un beatable quality I love it
1699,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were given as a gift to an avid musician and at first I was a little concerned considering the price-point wasn't near the studio quality headphones. To my surprise they work great, are very comfortable, and the person prefers these over the bulky high-end phones for most recordings or everyday listening."
1700,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These worked great when I first bought them for my son. They lasted all of 5 months, sorry to say they don't work anymore. My son is very disappointed. What can you expect for $15 these days."
1701,5.0 out of 5 stars,Live them comfortable and happy
1702,4.0 out of 5 stars,"To be nitpicky, even after adjusting, they feel tight on my ears. But it's not such a big deal, as the sound quality can't be beat at the price."
1703,1.0 out of 5 stars,The worst headphones I ever bought! They're so fragile that they broke in a couple of days! I bought 4 of these headphones and all broke so fast.
1705,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received these headphones just three days after I ordered.I used them with my laptop and I was blown away.Great clear sound ,nice bass tone.I really love it!.Thank you guys very much!"
1706,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones. Great at noise cancellation and at last, a cord that stays tangle free! Highly recommend."
1707,1.0 out of 5 stars,The headphone broke within a week. The earpiece broke off. Bad design.
1708,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Good
1709,2.0 out of 5 stars,The cord is too short and this pair of headphones really needs an amplifier for any application.
1710,5.0 out of 5 stars,great
1711,3.0 out of 5 stars,Circumference of ear pads is small. Rests uncomfortably on your ears even if you have a small head and ears.
1712,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The cable was shorting out - it only worked if you held the cable still at the insertion point in the device you were using. We are returning them. They were comfortable, however and we liked that they folded."
1713,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for a friend but I tried them out before I gave them to him. They sounded great but could be a little louder with voice audio like podcasts and YouTube videos. They felt ok and a bit flimsy but he's been using them for over a week at the gym and they have held up so far.
1714,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are okay but not as loud as they should be compared to my previous headphones. They have a clear sound sound and are comfortable to wear. The ""extra bass"" is not there and what bass there is is slightly distorted."
1716,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the $!
1717,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only used these 2 times, and today was the first day using at the gym, and I am thoroughly dissappointed. The ""muffs will not stay tight to the head, so the sound is not strong."
1718,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of, let me say that for the price, these are fantastic!

The sound that comes out is good, and for the price I am impressed. The bass is good, and impressive for these headphones.

These headphones are also pretty comfortable, not great for long term use, but doable.

My only real complaint is that the cord is a little short for me, but that is just a personal thing and I just end up using an extension."
1719,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really really good headphones for the money.
1720,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I was a bit harsh on my first review because I did not feel they were a comfortable pair of headphones. However, any company that reads my review and responds to me personally definately gets a thumbs up for customer service. Honestly, these headphones are fine for the money. While I still feel the Sennheiser 202's are a more comfortable fit, they dont fold or have the track change like the sony's. So in the end, I bumped it up to 3 stars."
1721,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work well.
1722,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones with mic at this price range. I thought I would wear these while working out but they get uncomfortable when your ears start to sweat. Sound quality is good. Of course at this price point there is no noise reduction capability and if you have the volume up, the people around you can hear what you are listening too. Overall not a bad choice for some inexpensive over the ear headphones with mic to take calls on."
1723,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Even thought it didn't say they were noise cancelling, I thought they would be and they are not. I use them to listen to music on the bus and I can still hear all the bus noise unless I turn the volume way up on my music. They are much more comfortable than earbuds though!"
1724,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave it 5 stars just because of it's value. They're not going to knock your socks off, but I mean we paid like $20 for them. They work great, sound good and the mic works really well too."
1725,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a very good pair of headphones for the price. The bass is really good quality and gets really close to being like the more expensive Bose and Beats products in terms of sound quality. The downside is that they are not the must comfortable, especially if you wear glasses, and sit on the ear."
1727,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just as described and perfect for back to school shopping!
1728,5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is my second pair, I loved the first pair so much I bought my dad a pair"
1729,2.0 out of 5 stars,Product gets way to hot with usage. Even after only a few minutes.
1730,4.0 out of 5 stars,"great headphones! The kids use this all day long and toss it around, still durable!"
1731,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is where I would say ''music reproduction'' should be if
you want to begin to rate any headphone...so it is at the very
bottom of the scale....that is 1 thru 10.

Of course I have listened to other brands like Koss and
JVC which are even worse but i call those ''garbage''
since they do not even reproduce music at all that
could be considered music...just musical static....
And while knocking down is not my goal, JVC is of
course guilty of making pure junk. Shame on them.

So this Sony is at the bottom..barely able to be called
a headphone. The 199 dollar Sony's are nice. So they
do know how to do it right but choose to make inferior
quality headphones...again Shame on Sony.

Buy Sennheiser 202 for a ok budget minded sound.
Buy other Sennheiser's for an even better sound.
Buy Klipsch Image One for a great pure sound. Fair price.
Buy Beyer for a spatially awesome sound.
Buy Bose for a really nice but expensive as hell amazing sound.
Don't buy Beats because it's like a 2 pound boombox on your head.
Buy Polk if your a studio engineer.
Buy other super expensive models if your super rich."
1732,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for the price. Folds up nicely. I would buy again.
1733,3.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap.
1734,4.0 out of 5 stars,"good sound, comfortable and heavy duty wires which should last longer than the normal thin ones."
1735,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a stereo nut. These headphones are not a disappointment. Great bass I have no fatigue from wearing the headphones. The sound is excellent also on my ear buds. Enjoy
1736,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound!
1738,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the money, these are an excellent value. Very satisfied with sound quality and the bass sounds nice and deep.

I compared these to my brother's Beats Solo 2 headphones and I think the only difference is that the Solos create a better seal over your ear.

Sound quality is very close and these can't be beat in terms of value!"
1739,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought the cord would be longer. Length is as advertised, but it's not as long as you would think. Functional headphones"
1740,3.0 out of 5 stars,Already broke.
1741,4.0 out of 5 stars,Use daily
1742,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for over a month and I am by no means gentle with my headphones but they have not failed me. The sound is bass heavy like I wanted it to be. These go to the gym with me, get thrown in my backpack, thrown on futon or dropped quite often and they have held up just fine. So I have no questions about its durability."
1743,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the 2nd pair of Sony headphones we purchased for my 13 yr old who listen to music all the time. One side failed this time, first ones the connector wires broke. They didn't even last 1 year."
1744,5.0 out of 5 stars,great gift
1745,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great for the price. I have some high end Sennheisers that I keep downstairs with my stereo. I wanted a second pair to use in bed with my iPhone or Kindle and these are great. Comfortable, fold away nicely. No idea how they make something of this quality for the price."
1746,2.0 out of 5 stars,Both pairs that I ordered were broken after a few months.
1747,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound.. Great price and product. Sony never disappoints..
1749,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter loves these headphones and it helps me from being exposed to the boy bands of today, priceless!"
1750,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT
1751,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work really well. The extra bass can be a broblem with some music so I adjust the EQ on my phone but otherwise they do everything they are supposed to and they do it really well. They even have a mic and a button that work with my Iphone!
1752,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok.
1753,5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect!
1754,3.0 out of 5 stars,"doesn't match the volume level expected, SONY is usually so much better than this."
1755,3.0 out of 5 stars,Broke within three months.
1756,4.0 out of 5 stars,I am not highly technical or picky on headphones but these definetly are good headphones for someone who is not looking for expensive ones that are good. These are not noise cancelling but they have a good range of mids and the bass is not as the Beats Headphones but are distinctive and can still be felt as a thump; its like they took the speakers from an iPhone 5s and put it in these headphones...that is exactly what it sounds like
1757,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased the previous version about two years ago and these are much better. They're much louder and less bulky due to the folding feature.
1758,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the $$. Hope the headphones don't start flaking bits og black vinyl like my last pair.
1760,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These aren't bad headphones. The sound quality and range are actually very impressive considering the price. My problem with them is that they just don't get loud enough. For some people this might not be an issue. I however, tend to listen to heavy metal with a side of punk so it's obviously a huge issue for people like me. If you aren't hellbent on blowing your eardrums out then by all means buy them, but otherwise I'd suggest spending a few dollars more on something louder."
1761,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good.

1763,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great! Reasonably comfortable, quality sound, respectable volume, and a good price. I have used these before, and there is a reason they are so popular."
1764,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Came in the mail today, and was exactly what i expected. They are great earphones for the price, and pretty light. If you don't want any huge these headphones these are perfect for you. They're on-ear headphones and work great. Would definitely recommend to anyone who needs some cheap light headphones."
1765,5.0 out of 5 stars,My boys love them. No more complaining about sore ears from ear buds.
1766,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these. For the price I paid the sound is great. I use them on plane rides and at home casually. These are not noise cancelling, but they do seem to work well on the plane to drown out the engine noise."
1767,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very inferior to other headphone set. The sound is weak and the bass is mediocre. There are others out there that's built much better with better sound quality. One for example is the Intone I60 Lightweight Folding 3.5mm Stereo Over-ear Headphones Portable Stretch Headsets Earphones Leather Earpad with Build-in Microphone and Control Button for All Smartphones,laptops,tablets,pc,mp3/mp4,psp,ipod. It's only for a few dollars more but you'll see that the quality is there and the sound is much richer with better bass. My biggest problem I have with this Sony headphone is the built quality. It's very flimsy and just feel very cheap(well, granted it is inexpensive) but there are others out there that's better. I'm really let down by the brand Sony. The packaging is inadequate as well, a simple plastic cover over a thin cardboard and a plastic mold holding the headset. You'll see what I mean if you still decide to order one after reading this review. I really think a customer can do much better than this headphone. Don't buy it just because of brand loyalty because you'll only be disappointed. Sony is a great company with many great superior products but unfortunately this one is not one of them."
1768,1.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for. The jacks on these headphones are terrible. The first time my jack stopped delivering sound I attributed it to me being tough on them - but this was after six months of everyday use. But when the next pair crapped out after only two months I'm pretty sure the problem is the product - not me.
1769,5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW ... I'm blown away about how great these sound. Super comfortable and the mic also works well. My freinds say I sound better on the mic than I do talking directly on my iphone! haha ... I'm going to look into more sony headphones now. These are amazing.
1771,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to have the earlier version of these headphones where you couldn't speak into them, now I can do every thing. I wear them all the time. I can't wear earbuds and these fit just like the old one did. No problems.
I had a pair of other headphones like these but the fit gave me a headache. These were great."
1772,4.0 out of 5 stars,Inexpensive with good sound and material quality. They aren't the same quality as Beats but then again these headphones aren't over $100 either. If you want a decent set of headphones and don't want to spend a ton of money then these are a great bargain. You can wear them to the gym and if they grow legs or get damaged then you won't be too upset. They look good and are comfortable to wear. They have held up to normal use with no signs of wear. I'd definitely recommend these headphones.
1773,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great! I listen to music, class lectures, and netflix with this thing! I've read other reviews saying the quality isn't great, but the people writing those reviews are either musicians, singers, or were using these headphones in a professional setting. Those people have higher expectations and probably need to look for a more professional headphone, but if you just want to listen to youtube videos, spotify, pandora, netflix, this is the headphone for you."
1774,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work great. I use them to watch movies/video on my mac when the family is watching tv in the same room. I'm not an audiophile so I'm not looking for superior sound. I hear bass and treble clearly and thats good enough for me. The fit is comfortable even during long periods of use. The length is perfect for desktop use and I have enough slack to turn around or sitback when watching a movie. I've had these for over a year and a half and am still happy with my purchase. They work and look like they did when I first bought them.
1775,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Are you kidding me?! At this price, these are unbeatable. Folding design, distinct mellow base, and excellent sound. Compared to my daughter's Beats by Dre and the Beats have better clarity and treble and they block outside sound better, but at about 10x the cost, these are a far better value. Very enjoyable...buy a pair of these for low cost and then see how you like on ear headphones BEFORE you buy the Beats or Bose units. Undoubtedly the Beats/Bose are far superior, but these are really good and you will get a good idea of whether an upgrade is really the way you want to go. Awesome deal!"
1776,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best sub-$25 headphones you can possibly get. The sound is even and full.

Pros:
- Cheap (price)
- Good solid bass
- Easy to drive from a phone or iPod
- Look halfway decent

Cons:
- Cheap (construction), my son has gone through like 3 pairs in the past 2 years. The plugs always wear out.
- Mediocre soundstage (for $15-$20, what are you expecting, these aren't Sennheisers)

Honestly, if you need cheap headphones for a teenager or for your second set - just get them. You won't regret it."
1777,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable headphones that provide excellent sound quality. I like how the cord is long so you can use these even when you are on the treadmill. Music comes through very clearly, and your ears are not compressed to the point of discomfort.

Most of the time, when something is this inexpensive, the product probably sucks. But not this time-- I highly recommend these affordable, comfortable headphones from Sony."
1778,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great as far as headphones go. I just use them to watch Netflix on my computer, but they do the job perfectly. They even block out the sound of my husband yelling at his video games right near me."
1779,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great. Quality is high, sound is good, cord length is just right. They are not too heavy, nor do they get uncomfortable after wearing them for long periods. Second pair I have bought, after the first pair met an unfortunate demise. If my current pair befell a similar fate, I would purchase these immediately."
1780,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great fit on these very comfortable headphones! I can wear them for hours and have no problems with pressure on my ears or head. The sound is perfect! Strong bass and clear instrumentals and vocals. An added bonus is the built in microphone for when you are listening to music on your phone and you receive an incoming call. Its easy to press the button on the microphone and answer calls without digging your phone our of your pocket. It is also great for plugging into game console controllers to use as a microphone for gaming.

After purchasing a pair for myself I got my father a pair for Christmas as well and he loves them too!"
1782,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sony quality. Bought them for grandkids and they still not broken so i gave z 5 stars for their quality and decent sound.
1783,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for the low price. Good quality and very comfortable.
1784,5.0 out of 5 stars,very happy with this purchase
1785,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these as a gift, they were exactly what he wanted."
1786,4.0 out of 5 stars,Clip an earache
1787,4.0 out of 5 stars,good product
1788,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's works well for the price, durable. My son is using this in classroom."
1789,5.0 out of 5 stars,"good product, long lasting. I purchase this item some time Ago and it was not until today that I created the review"
1790,1.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loved her new headphones. I purchased a black and white pair at the end of May 2015. The left side of her black pair stopped working after just 2 months. It's a shame because she really loved them.
1791,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first pair of over-ear headphones, and upon reading other Amazon reviews, I was impressed when considering the price. After receiving the headphones and trying them, I too was very pleased. The quality of sound was great, although perhaps the praise of other reviews built up my expectations too much. Nonetheless, I am very happy with this purchase!"
1793,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound for the price.
1794,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked great until the cable pulled straight out of the jack casing and it couldn't be fixed...no complaints about the sound from the headphones, they worked well enough for casual use."
1795,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, for $20, these are great, but it specifically says, ""Extra Bass,"" when there is none. I mainly listen to Rap/Hip-Hop and Trap (has a lot of bass), and these headphones did not even move. My last pair of headphones (Skullcandy) cost $60 and they had the best bass out of all the past headphones I've had. I say only buy these if you're looking for cheap headphones."
1796,2.0 out of 5 stars,lasted about a year.
1797,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a white pair minus the mic and I just need to replace those because there is a short in the plug. Heck it 'beats' paying two hundred dollars at least! They do what they are supposed to do and that's delivery sound to my ears in private.
1798,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Satisfied, the head phones work great when connected to computer or phone. But when using the phone section it gets static. and the in line mic does not work well. Since I bought it mainly for the computer, I am happy with the purchase, excellent price and was delayers 8 days early. I highly recommend for purchase."
1799,3.0 out of 5 stars,"There is some sort of loose connection. I sometimes have to tap the earpiece to make the signal come through. Also, these earphone are not comfortable for long listening sessions."
1800,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it! Would recommend!
1801,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really nice inexpensive pair of headphones for monitoring my guitar playing. Replaced a pair of Audio Technica headphones where the ear covering material was shedding all over me.
1802,5.0 out of 5 stars,We got 2 of these for our kids and they have held up very well! They block out the sound quite well and fold up neatly. I would buy the again if needed.
1804,1.0 out of 5 stars,Right side earphone fell off after two weeks of use. I only use it at home and not very often.
1805,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound was really good for the price, I'd say worth it, also it was a gift as well"
1806,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is only mediocre. The band broke just days after receiving them in the mail. It broke as they were being folded.
Already taken by trash collectors."
1807,5.0 out of 5 stars,The product is as advertised. The service was excellent.
1808,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Returned because one of the earphones did not work. Amazon was quick with the refund which was good, but I'm still disappointed as it was a Christmas gift that had to go back."
1809,4.0 out of 5 stars,NICE
1810,4.0 out of 5 stars,"loud, does not fall off my head. Thus, a success. If my ""smart"" phone would just stop turning volume down to ""protect"" my ears. It is too late, now let me hear it!!!"
1811,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The overall quality is good, but I was expecting better outside noise insulation."
1812,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality hearing headphones!
1813,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Transaction, Recommend"
1815,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought these to use in the car with a portable DVD player so my husband and I could talk or listen to music, while the kids were occupied in the back. These are great, and the kids like them better than the earbuds that tend to become uncomfortable after a while. Cord is also long enough to sit comfortably while plugged in to the DVD player. I would definitely recommend these. Great price too!"
1816,2.0 out of 5 stars,Decent product for the price. Bass boost isn't very functional like advertise
1817,4.0 out of 5 stars,OK
1818,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had another version of these same headphones that lasted several years. This particular set lost audio in one ear within the week and totally stopped working within 2 weeks. Very poorly made. Spend a little more and but some that will last.
1819,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As always, great product, bought it used and it is still a great product"
1820,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work fine. Not the best Ive owned. Not the worst. For the price and my use no complaints
1821,4.0 out of 5 stars,"You could argue with the fit, but the sound is great."
1822,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought 6 pairs for wireless hearing assist system. They are holding up well and sound fine.
1823,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just right; not too gib, not too small."
1824,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good price! Kida love it and mom happy!
1826,1.0 out of 5 stars,can't wear these for more than 15/20 minutes because they are too tight on my ears and begin to hurt my head. sound quality is average for low end headphones. paid $20 for these to sit on my desk collecting dust
1827,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it, lightweight with great sound."
1828,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these mostly for use with skype-phone on my iPad. I'm hearing deficient. These have worked out well- crystal clear, priced right and arrived quickly. No issues"
1829,2.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is so flimsy I am almost afraid to wear it and break it. I find it so strange Sony of all people would sell such a peice of crap. It has no volume control and is a few octaves lower than it should be
1830,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Looking for a decent pair of headphones? Why spend more. These are comfortable and the price is right. Decent bass, and the the highs are crystal clear."
1831,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really liking these - great sound quality, easy to use, don't hurt the ears, cord long enough, but not too long for use at my work computer.... easy peasy."
1832,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous quality. These have last a year with no issues and lots of use.
1833,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great head phone!
1834,2.0 out of 5 stars,The wires feel cheap and stay bent.
1835,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This SONYstyle is so comfortable for my 9 and 12 yr olds. The price is favorable, too. We have tried others, and they just don't compare to the confort or durability....without breaking the bank."
1837,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality, great product, arrived on time"
1838,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Is a Good Value for one's money for a brand name product (Sony), which is known for its sound quality."
1839,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work great. Good fit. Great sound quality.
1840,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent !!!! Better than my more expensive headphones. Buy them!!
1841,5.0 out of 5 stars,As advertised. Good quality. Would recommend.
1842,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great buy for the money. Very clear, excellent sound, durable and comfortable. Not the bass that my Dr Dres had but I believe these to be the best value for the price."
1843,2.0 out of 5 stars,My husband bought these to take on a deployment. He’s been using them for 3 days and the one ear no longer works. Must buy and send a new pair which will take weeks 😞
1844,4.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and soft. The cups are not as big as my other headset but they do fit well. Well worth it for the price.
1845,2.0 out of 5 stars,the battery cover came off during my flight had no idea it was gone :( like the sound tho
1846,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The cord rolls up and become impossible to smooth out, Otherwise good product."
1848,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very high quality sound, especially considering the price. Very clear and crisp, not extremely bass heavy, but not weak in the bass either."
1849,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too quiet too quiet too quiet too quiet too quiet not loud enough! I need loud music when I work out come on now!
1850,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my purchase!
1851,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I know everyone wants the headphones with no cord, I do too. But this is a great pair and it's not large but a nice size for your ears. It's well worth the price. I love my set."
1852,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Does not have what I call good sound, kind of dull, but not expensive. You get what you pay for."
1853,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife is extremely hard on any headphones I buy her, not to mention that she is so picky about sound quality, but she loves the pair of these I purchased for her, the sound is rich and full and the cancellation of background noise is amazing!These were definitely worth every penny, she is happy and I am happier!"
1854,2.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted one month. Now the jack is loose and you have to jiggle it constantly to get sound in both ears.
1855,4.0 out of 5 stars,thus far it works well
1856,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Sony earphones! My music sounds wonderful through these earphones.
1857,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful headset, have purchased three so far. Two for home use and one to send to school."
1859,5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife gives it a thumbs up
1860,4.0 out of 5 stars,Quality head phones for an affordable price
1861,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome headphone!! Very loud with great bass response. I expected a lot less for the size and price!
1862,1.0 out of 5 stars,In a jam they work but pretty uncomfortable and didnt last long.
1863,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these headphones when recording a podcast. I like that they fold down to make them easier to store. I wish they were a little more comfortable, but they are good enough!"
1864,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very light, work just great!"
1865,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones arrived on time, and in good shape. For the price, it has a pretty good sound and is well made. The only problem is the fit. It is somewhat tight and can be uncomfortable (might just be this pair), which is the reason for the three star rating."
1866,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice sound, good bass. Light & comfortable. Good for the price."
1867,4.0 out of 5 stars,good for at home
1868,5.0 out of 5 stars,works well.
1870,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for my son and he is impressed on the comfort, light weight, and sound at the price point.
Don't fit to tight (good) and don't sweat (like over ear sets)."
1871,4.0 out of 5 stars,"for the price, these are great. We have our kids use them on long trip rides. They seem to fit our kids under 10 with no problems."
1872,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice sound, fit nicely to the head, fairly rugged cord - thicker than ear bud cords, no complaints."
1873,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredibly solidly built for the price. Great sound, and an unexpectedly heavy duty cord. Only wish it had a single cord instead of double, but that would up the price..."
1874,5.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't need nothing fancy and these turned out great.
1875,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these mid June and then over two months ago the right ear stopped working. Had been perfectly happy until that time. My wife has a pair as well that we bought in May and just today the left ear stopped working while she was wearing them. This has to be a flaw of this make. Maybe it has to do with the ear parts folding in? Anyways, seems to be too late to return and not sure about a manufacturer warranty. The sound was good and the fit was fine but to have two broken headphones after a few months of use is not acceptable."
1876,2.0 out of 5 stars,"There is a small, weak pin that holds the ear piece to the head band. This piece broke shortly after purchasing, leaving one ear hanging.

If you can guarantee that there won't be any slightly rough usage (laying on a pillow, getting shoved by your big sister, etc.) then these headphones sound good and feel comfortable. They meet expectations for the price. But don't expect your kids to borrow them and return them intact."
1877,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones by Sony. Clear sound and can last a long long time if taken care of.
1878,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very high quality for the price! I had beats before, and these are a great replacement."
1879,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very compact and lightweight ear phones. Extremely comfortable as a result and ideal for full days in ""cubicle-world"""
1881,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are terrific! Plugged them into my galaxy s4 phone and couldn't believe my ears. The sound was so good I thought I was listening to a quality sound system. I listen to pipe organ music which is sonically demanding; the sound was clear, defined, uncluttered, balanced. Haven't tried using multi function button or mic yet, nor have I installed the Smart Key app so don't know how they'll work. Doesn't matter. Headphones are great."
1882,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect size for kids, very sturdy, have lasted"
1883,4.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves these especially that they fold flat so he can easily store them in the car or his backpack. he says the sound is good.
1884,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap feeling but sounds ok, little uncomfortable on top of head like that it folds flat for travel"
1885,5.0 out of 5 stars,works great
1886,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it! Use it everyday and even works on my ps4! Awesome recommend to anyone!
1887,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works wonderful.. a great buy... thanks for having.
1888,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good until they broke shortly after having them :(
1889,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, fits smaller heads too. Kids say is comfortable to wear. Recommend Age 9/10 and up to adult."
1890,2.0 out of 5 stars,Recently bought and sound quality is already compromised. Disappointed.
1892,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are comfortable and pretty nice sound for a basic headset. They're light and easy enough to wear for music on your walk, and they're not so fussy and expensive that you;ll worry about whether you're abusing them (like when you toss them on the couch after using them on the computer, and then your husband sits on them. No problem.)"
1893,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They're comfortable, for the price they have great sound, and I love how they fold. Unfortunately after about a year the connections from the wire to the headphone jack started to fall apart and the sound started to get staticky. A few months later I can't wear them while I'm walking at all or the sound will go out of the left ear and then the right ear every time I take a step, even when I'm sitting unless I position the cable carefully there's a decent amount of static. I used them daily, but didn't treat them roughly and I had an older pair of headphones that looked like these that lasted for years without these problems. Still for the price, I don't know if you'd expect more!"
1894,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the previous version of these headphones (MDRZX100 ZX Series) for over two years, but unfortunately during one of my beast gym days I got a little cocky and the wire got stuck to one of the machines, which lead the wire to be yanked out of my phone and blow out the left speaker. I was going to order the same ones, but opted for these instead because of the mic option. My mom often calls me in the morning during my gym session, so having to take off my headphones to talk on the phone was an inconvenience and threw off my entire workout. The sound quality is excellent; once I turn my music loud, I can't hear or see anyone else. These are definitely worth the money. BEATS WHO????"
1895,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Needed a nice inexpensive set of headphones to listen to music while I am at my desk working. Earbuds weren't cutting it, since they would fall out too many times and did not have the sound that these have. Didn't need wireless, since I didn't want to be replacing batteries. Can't go wrong with Sony."
1896,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hats off to Sony....I have speaker products from Sony including portable iPod speaker which sound amazing, in earbud wired headphones which sound amazing for $23, and now I have these over ear headphones which sound great. Between the earbud and this over ear, i must admit the earbuds are much better sounding for music. But these $20 over ear headphones are a great balance of great music sound and phenomenal phone voice quality sound. A nice touch is the ample and not to much length of the cord. Its just the right length. Thats where these earphones edge out my $23 inearbud set. Both are a great buy worth your time and every penny."
1897,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is great for the price; well worth it unless you want fancy noise canceling headphones with a ""status"" brand label. The ear pads can get warm on your ears after awhile in a hot room, not because of any electrical issue but because of the padding. I've found this to be true for all headphones I've owned. I don't know if the expensive ones get around this problem somehow. Also, I bought these rather than earbuds because I don't like sticking loud music directly up against my ear drums. Somehow, headphones seem safer to me."
1898,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very good headphones for the price. I have many headphones. While I prefer having the noise cancelling feature, there are times when I don't want to have more expensive headphones with me.
These are well made, comfortable and the sound quality is very good.

I have bought these more than once for myself and to give as gifts.

I would buy them again."
1899,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these last year based on the good reviews. It is true that the sound is amazing and they do a great job at cancelling out sound. They also fold up really nicely. However, I have to give them a 3 star review because both pairs that I bought recently quit working after only one year of use. The sound connectors seem to have loosened up. If you wiggle them and hold them in tightly they work, but not once you let go. This is disappointing considering it's a Sony product. I didn't expect amazing sound for the price, but I definitely would have expected some longevity."
1900,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound + design + fit = PERFECT for me:) I have always loved Sony products. It spells quality for me and I knew I will be happy with this purchase. For the price I paid, the sound may be equaled to my husband's Bose headphones. That speaks for itself. Right? Anyway, the bass is amazing and it is not deafening when you turn up the volume. Simplicity works well for me. It is not bulky nor skinny to appear cheap, and fits really well on my head. Easily adjusts and the earpieces do not hurt me at all even worn at a long period of time. Love how you could easily fold it for storage and lastly, the mic is a plus with easy function. So happy!"
1901,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are good quality earphones. I use them in conjunction with a ReSound Lynx2 hearing aid. This permits me to have good quality sound and since the microphone for the hearing aid is outside the earphone capsule I can for safety reasons maintain awareness of what is going on in the gym.The speaker for the hearing aid does not completely close the ear canal so I can hear the music quite well with these earphones. The extra base helps compensate for my hearing deficiency. I amended my rating from four to five stars because this is the best resource I have found. Wireless bluetooth have short battery life. These are used in conjunction with a media player on an Android Samsumg S6. Product was delivered promptly by the Seller.
1903,1.0 out of 5 stars,"they look great but 1 side didn't work
what a piece of junk!"
1904,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money on more expensive headphones. These are great sound quality with name brand backing and daily use.
1905,1.0 out of 5 stars,One of My Daughter's Christmas presents she couldn't use because this product was DEFECTIVE!!!!!! AND will be RETURNING
1906,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have purchased these Sony headphones twice for my children. My husband and I have both tested them out. We were impressed. They have pretty good sound quality. For the low price they can't be beat.
1907,5.0 out of 5 stars,thank you for the great product and service
1908,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great little pair of headphones. They sound good even in a moderately noisy gym. They are comfortable and fit well. They are sturdy. They are well-designed to conveniently fold up to fit in my gym bag.
1909,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these to use with a Yamaha Silent Violin. They are not half loud enough, so I continue to very old, beat up one until finding a decent new set."
1910,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good for the price. The Bass is definitely amplified. However, overall sound quality is poor, and the sound level (volume level) is also quite ordinary. I expected better from Sony."
1911,1.0 out of 5 stars,I seldom use my headphone and the problem is that the right speaker stopped working after using it 10 times. I tried to repair it using ifixit guide but i don't see any problem with the wires inside.
1912,5.0 out of 5 stars,not as good as my $20 sony studio phones that i buy from kmart... but it comes close. 5 stars for being so close for the money.
1914,1.0 out of 5 stars,"1 month in, one ear stopped working. Although the price is such low, there's no point of sending them back I'm Generally unsatisfied with the purchase."
1915,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These head phones are so comfortable. I love that the ear parts fold down flat for storage, and the cord is pretty long. They also have a nice sound."
1916,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones. Can't complain for the price. They sound and look like they should have cost much more.
1917,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my smartphone. I use it to talk on the phone at home or while walking in the park or to listen to music at home or during a walk or in the gym. The sound is good. My child is always trying to pull on the cord. So it withstands abuse. LoL I likehow fflexible the ear pieces fold in so I can store them safely and easily in my purse or at home.
1918,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good bass and sound quality, great price
and wear is very comfortable."
1919,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable economy headphones that sound good. I bought them for my kids, who love them, and now I try to borrow them instead of earbuds. Earbuds will kill your hearing, these not as quickly."
1920,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones work well and have a great bass tone. Bought them for my ultra picky husband and he really likes them. Does the job and he is happy.
1921,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this based on a ""best headphones"" list...should have saved my money. Audio is leaky, headphones aren't comfortable, and have that flimsy, plasticky feeling. The folding option doesn't even get them folded down to be much smaller, so it's kind of useless. The only nice piece is the in-line mike for use with my home office. Otherwise, I'd pass."
1922,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the only inexpensive headphones that last a full year of school use for my kids.
1923,4.0 out of 5 stars,works good
1925,5.0 out of 5 stars,I highly recommend them
1926,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have never had a high dollar pair of headphones. These are good enough that I can't imagine why I would need a high dollar pair. I use them with my iPad for movies and occasionally with my phone for music.
1927,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great item for the price. Had to return the first pair because any time the wires jiggled near the plug-in, there was static. 2nd pair is fine though."
1928,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice accessory to my computer. Good sound reproduction
1929,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Package is cheap, and sound is not as great or loud to listen music as for example stock samsung hans free headsets, but i will give them a try for a while. Desings is good and fits great in the head."
1930,5.0 out of 5 stars,"works great, nice quality set and sound. my son hasn't broken them yet. very good sign that they are sturdy."
1931,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had one pair of these for over a year that I use at work. I got this second pair to use at home when I'm riding my bike on the stationary trainer. They have good sound quality and the soft cushions are good at muffling external noise. I recommend them.
1932,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, not great phones. Great price and pretty sturdy."
1933,3.0 out of 5 stars,OK FOR PRICE
1934,5.0 out of 5 stars,The price is right. The sound is good. The earphones are perfect for an extra set to take on a plane in my computer bag.
1936,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It meets all expectations, good sound and adjustment for head size is easy and can wear for hours. I would recommend this head phone for anyone."
1937,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones thinking that they were the more ""marshmellow"" feelnig ones that are always displayed at stores. They're not but I'm satisfied with the feel and sound quality for the price. The plastic feels a little cheap."
1938,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased tremendous quality, cheap Sony On-and-Over-Ear headphones in the past couple years. For the price, I thought I'd give these a try. My expectations were pretty reasonable, but I found the sound quality on these to be below-average. Sadly, the $5 Panasonic RPHJE120G In-Ear Headphones I purchased as add-ons sound significantly better."
1939,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable to the ears
1940,1.0 out of 5 stars,Peace of crap seems about appropriate....Sound level was terrible
1941,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For a budget, it's great. However it only includes a pause button on the in-line controls, no volume control."
1942,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy with this purchase. We have been going through cheap headphones like crazy for our kids, so we decided to invest in some Sony brand for a little more $$. Great sound, and they are still working after a 10 day road trip! A win in my book!"
1943,5.0 out of 5 stars,"2 months in and it still looks like it could last another couple months. 20$ is a pretty good price for these. If you want tips for balancing for game audio and friend party chats:
- Change the audio mix settings while in a party.
- I usually lower overall game volume(on each game, its quick)
- You can always change the overall volume by holding ps button(middle small one) then adjust devices."

1945,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good bass effects for a $16 headphone. I used to hear songs almost 5-6 hours a day while working in office. After 45 mins, you will feel uncomfortable wearing it, so I have to take out for a 5 minute rest.
But it is totally worth for the price.
Comparing to other head phones at the same price, it is definitely worth it."
1947,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones work very well and the sound quality is good.
1948,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent set of headphones, quality O would expect from Sony, would recommend to others!"
1949,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No problems. My grandson uses in school and he's quick to
tell me if there's a problem. Ear pads are comfortable."
1950,3.0 out of 5 stars,I should have purchased ear sets that muffled out other sounds.
1951,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Granted I could've bought these from any electronic shop, I still like those headphones. They haven't even given out on me yet."
1952,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible sound quality - low and poor. The right headphone broke off due to cheap construction. Absolute garbage. I have it duct-taped right now, and it is completely ridiculous. Save you money and buy something better....and hopefully not manufactured in China."
1953,2.0 out of 5 stars,The sound works but I have to move and hold the cable in a certain direction so that sound is produced on the left side of the headphones. If I make the slightest move I have to readjust the cable again
1954,5.0 out of 5 stars,So comfortable and compact with the big sound of Sony
1955,5.0 out of 5 stars,"these are very nice. I have a hearing problem, but have no problem using these with my laptop to look at movies. It's a good choice at a reasonable price."
1956,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, good quality, comfortable and excellent price ! Recommended"
1958,2.0 out of 5 stars,I'm deaf in one hear and have some impairment in the other. Thought this would give me loud sound but I'm VERY disappointed
1959,2.0 out of 5 stars,"not a good fit for my head, sound quality is not great. It's definitely worth the extra $20 bucks or so to get something a little bit nicer."
1960,5.0 out of 5 stars,Delivers great sound quality for the price.
1961,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Handy and good buy. Be careful about using them in the gym as they don't do well in sweaty environment... good price, good shipping, recommended!"
1962,5.0 out of 5 stars,good fit for my 4 year old
1963,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones aren't amazing, but they are good. Plus, they don't fall apart very easily. I'm sure they'll probably even last me a few more months, at the very least. Would recommend if you're looking for cheap headphones."
1964,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like them really well. They were exactly what I ordered
1965,5.0 out of 5 stars,"perfect, exactly what i was looking for"
1966,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product got damaged the day after return allowance
1967,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really nice for a 20 dollar pair of headphones. You could spend more on a pro pair- you could spend hundreds. For 20 bucks you won't be disappointed. If you're expectation of sonic perfection and an ""effortless blending of the hi and low frequency""- then plan on spending 150 plus."
1969,3.0 out of 5 stars,No bass
1970,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty decent headphones. They're not too special but they do their job. I will note however that if you're listening to your music a little on the louder side you CAN hear it, it's almost projected to the room you're in. People can hear EXACTLY what you're listening to."
1971,5.0 out of 5 stars,Second time I purchased this product. It works as expected without cheap tinny sound the other guys try to sneak by you. Headset is best for those with a slightly smaller cranium.
1972,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these after also purchasing the JVC HAS400W Carbon Nanotube On-Ear Headband Headphones, and for basically the same money, the JVC option has better sound, is more comfortable, and overall feels like a better quality product. So far, these have worked fine, but they were disappointing after getting the JVC headphones. Oh! they are also not as portable as the JVC option as they don't fold up as nicely."
1973,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are definitely the cheap headphones you think they will be. The noise quality is similar to apple in-ear headphones and they do not go very loud. These fill the purpose i needed, but definitely don't go beyond that. Would suggest shelling out a little more money to get better headphones."
1974,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They work just fine, but you can definitely tell why they're so cheap. Next time I purchase headphones, I'll definitely be spending $50 plus on a well reviewed product."
1975,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the headphones on a cold day it's not only clear, but keeps my ears warm as well"
1976,2.0 out of 5 stars,I got a couple good uses out of this. It started getting fuzzy and I had to keep twisting the cord for it to work
1977,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got sick of dealing with ear buds but I didn't want to fork out hundreds of dollars for expensive headphones, I also didn't want to waste money on some cheapos that'd fall apart in a week. These are some great ones for the price, not to mention they work wonderful with your cellphone, bonus."
1978,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent audio range, compares with more expensive earphones."
1980,3.0 out of 5 stars,For the price there fine.
1981,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good head phones but after long use it begins to get uncomfortable
1982,5.0 out of 5 stars,these work awesome and at a great price!
1983,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow. The sound is great ....I didn't expect them to be this good for fifteen bucks!
1984,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my kids to use with their ipads. They work well and have been holding up great & keep their activities quiet!!!
1985,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good headphones at a great price. The sound quality is very good for its value.

It does not cover the ears, however feel good. They are very comfortable.

Obviously no noise cancellation. Its design is really convenient.

Nothing to envy to other headphones that can be expensive and poor sound quality."
1986,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones look nice, feel good, and sound good. Surprising bass for the price. But not amazing."
1987,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's Sony! You buy them and everything is great. Sony. Thats why and the price is terrific
1988,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfy, but volume is awful. When watching a movie, I put the volume to max on my device, and still have trouble hearing."
1989,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not loud, not enough punch in the bass. No worth the money. Low end senhieser is a better buy."
1991,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it. This is second order of same product.
1992,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't use these that often; however, I do like them. They have a solid, medium-range quality to them (sound wise). They have a better quality sound than a different brand that actually I paid more for to use with my camera. Haven't tried them on the camera yet, but have listened to music using them. They sound good - better than you'd expect for $10!"
1993,2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones lasted less than 2 months with no out of the ordinary use. It was disappointing as I've had these before and they lasted closer to a year.
1994,4.0 out of 5 stars,"bought these for the office after several pairs of cheap ones were torn apart when they inevitably hang up on my chair. So far that has not destroyed these yet! comfort wise they are ok, not great, a little small and can hurt the outside of the ear after a while."
1995,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good clear tones (esp bass) for the price! It didn't feel as solid as I imagined though, was a little wobbly and flimsy."
1996,4.0 out of 5 stars,Got for my high-schooler. Fit in from back pack pocket. Wish had a case or carry bag to help with he cord.
1997,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these as a gift for my brother and he loves them
1998,5.0 out of 5 stars,Used these to replace my Old Gaming set of headphones(which were pro quality) They seem fine and have good sound.
1999,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for my fiance,. He stated they have really good sound quality. He suggested to not use them in really cold weather conditions, as the wire freezes."
2000,5.0 out of 5 stars,no comments went to my grandsons so haven't seen
2002,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones. Cheap and rugged. We're mostly using them for U-Tube training videos, but the sound quality matches much more expensive speakers."
2003,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now I cannot hear my husbands Ipad while I am trying to sleep!! They not only provide him with good, rich, loud sound but me with peace...ahhhh."
2004,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
2005,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is pretty good, but they're not very comfortable. I wear glasses and they press my ears against the glasses too much. Also they seem to retain moisture. So you can't wear straight for more than an hour without taking them off for a few minutes to give your ears a break."
2006,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased Sony MDRZX110AP ZX Series Extra Bass Smartphone Headset with Mic to listen to music from my phone at work. I've owned this for about a week now, and for my intents and purposes, I love this headset. However, for my personal audio preferences, not so much.

PROS:
1. Lightweight - This headset is very light comparing to other headsets that I owned.
2. Mic - Since I connect this headset to my phone, it is useful to have the mic to also be able to answer incoming phone calls without taking my headset off.
3. Compact - The earpieces folds really nicely into a flat shape (unlike the Sony MDR7506 or Audio-Technica ATH-M50 which are still bulky even when folded).
4. $20 - It is a very cheap headset. No argument there.

CONS:
1. Sound quality - Rather than ""extra bass"", it feels to me more like ""weak mid and high"". Everything feels mumbled.
2. Comfort - I use this headset at work (which means this thing sticks on my ear for a long period of time in a day, everyday), and on-ear headsets aren't the most comfortable headset.

All things considered, this is a very low price for a headset, but if audio quality and comfort is more important to you, I'd suggest putting in an extra $4.50 for something like the Sennheiser HD 202 II (I use these personally at home for music editing, and at time of writing this review it's sold for $24.50 at Amazon). For my use at the office, however, these MDRZX110AP ZX works perfectly."
2007,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the over the ear headphone and the padding is comfortable.
2008,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound. Easy to use. Great price. I own two and they work well and last.
2009,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Work as expected, a little bulky for my liking. I cannot complain about the quality. sony is great."
2010,1.0 out of 5 stars,Low quality product. The headphone jack broke off in iPad with a week.
2011,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband loves this! He said they are comfortable and very clear. Very fast delivery.
2013,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the design but my pair had a flaw -- almost no sound on the right side (sound seemed pretty good otherwise). Returned and decided to buy something else that might have better quality control. Still, I would recommend these if you're willing to risk having to return a bad pair."
2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price i paid for these headphones they are amazing! Well worth it so far. Hopefully they will last me a while and not stop working like some reviewers stated. They aren't the best for listening to music but watching movies and videos they are well worth it. Seriously though you can't eat the price.
2015,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Low cost and great reward. Set up to privately listen to TV and not disturb others. Sleeping or otherwise. May not be the best headphones on the market but more than adequate for TV sound. Not using them for high end Stereo but for keeping the peace so other can sleep. Well made, robust, inexpensive. Great buy."
2016,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to give these headphones a 4 or higher star rating. But the cord tangled has been such a disappointment. The sound quality is fine for the price paid for them. But the cord is tightly wound from the factory and doesn't seems to loosen or not re-tangle in a ball no matter what I try.

Again, I would give an higher rating if it wasn't for the fact the cord is prone to constantly tangle even with zip ties to try to keep it straight. The sound quality is fine and I use them regularly to listen to podcast on my Android phone."
2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, durable headphones. I got them for my daughter and I got other brands for my other daughters. These have held up the best. I've used them and have not noticed poor sound quality. I have not compared the sound to other ones, but I was not distracted from my movie and music experience by poor quality sound, which is honestly all you should expect at this price point. They fold up a bit so they aren't too bulky. I have nothing bad to say. Except maybe they should make a bunch of different colors so I could get some for my other daughters."
2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound really good. Finding R & L markings for proper on-head placement is not as ez as I thought it would be, so I placed a mark with sharpie so I can do that quickly.

As for comfort, they are comfortable, but my ears hurt after ~40min of on-head use, but I have always had this issue with on-head muff style phones.

Sound good and price was ok."
2019,2.0 out of 5 stars,Just okay. I bought these for my son and they lasted 13 months before the thin wires broke. At first it was just one of the earphones that stopped working and now the wires near the 3.5mm adapter have broken inside the rubber sheething and the headset doesn't work at all. I will be paying attention to the thickness of the wires for his next set. These should have last longer than 13 months.
2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I work in a cubicle farm and needed headphones to block out the noise and focus on work. I plug this into my computer and play whatever the work interwebs will allow us to stream and it works great. Added bonus that they are very visible so they often prevent people from trying to talk to me while i'm working (versus the in-ear buds that no one notices you are wearing). Also like that it has the mic, which allows me to participate in webinars/teleconference calls via my computer. For $20, this was a great purchase for my work productivity."
2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got tired of buying my irresponsible kid ear bud headphones. The cat chews up small wires left on the floor when we're all asleep. I don't blame the cat because it is just following instinct. Billions of years of cats chewing small wires in the wild is hard to overcome. Cat hasn't chewed the thicker wires on these phones. Kid still leaves them all over the floor. Kid's room still a desaster despite my constant nagging.
2022,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones came on the same day as it was estimated to come. So not bad in terms of delivery. Because it can be folded - the packaging was thinner as expected.
I had the Sony VDR Stereo-something headphones before this that was discontinued. I really loved those. With these headphones, I honestly don't know if there's much of a difference between them. Both are great and around the same price. As always, Sony makes great headphones and Beats by Dre are just expensive. Can't hate on Dre's hustly though - he's gotten lots of people to buy it so kudos to you sir. Reminds me of Nike shoes costing as much as a year's college tuition."
2024,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast shipping but when it arrived it had a small and barely noticeable buzzing in the left side that could only be heard when there was a lot of bass, which has gotten worse over time and is now constant. It also sounds low even on the highest volume setting other than that no complaints! Comfort and design are pretty good."
2025,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work ok.......was hoping for a tad bit more base but certainly functional my my use.
2026,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm happy with my Sony headphones, they have a good sound and cover very well their bandwidth

It's worth to get a good relation quality vs Price

I recommend 100%"
2027,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent quality for the price, loud enough, good fit, and good bass. Honestly best bang for your $$$"
2028,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality but they are not compatable with all of our smartphone devices
2029,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Just bought this. I gave three stars only for quality of materials. Does not clear sound, especially middle and upper frequencies. But bass is very good. Unfortunately, music - it's not bass sound only. I cannot return this headsets because already threw package."
2030,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very comfortable, and the microphone works well with the Chrome Books we have in my classroom. They are lightweight, and don't get tangled in long hair."
2031,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Less bass than the Sony MDRZX100, which is much cheaper. I would've returned them if I didn't get it as an Amazon Treasure Box purchase, so the price was hard to resist."
2032,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these in March 2015 (5 months ago) and they have already stopped working completely. The audio jack is clearly made with very poor craftsmanship; it's cheap and shoddy. The headphones themselves were really great while they worked, and the audio was excellent. I'm very disappointed that they broke so quickly (with very light usage), and I don't plan on re-buying this set."
2033,5.0 out of 5 stars,The quality you get for the money is just unbelievable to me!
2035,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I wanted
2036,2.0 out of 5 stars,Static-y sound. :(
2037,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can not complain about these headphones. For $20, it produces a fair amount of bass and treble - making the sound quality pretty Damn good!"
2038,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones are great , brand new / Now I can't bother the neighbors LOL / And I listen to books on line purchased from you . Customer service is quick and professional ! Thanks Again , Westside Jonny"
2039,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought as a Christmas Gift for my kids and they are awesome! We all love it. And the best part is now my house is quite from the kids... lol
2040,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality and long lasting! Perfect for my 8 year olds tablet.
2041,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Works OK for the price. Uncomfortable on ear after maybe 30 minutes, have to take a brake or readjust."
2042,2.0 out of 5 stars,"the headphone chords broke in a month, I can't believe this crap!!"
2043,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, love this product. Who are these people writing bad reviews."
2044,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are a great pair of headphones and well worth the price. I've seen them on sale at another retailer for $40. It's a bargain for good quality.
2046,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the lightning deal price of $8.47 I already expect an entry level headset. You won't get a punchy deep bass on this one but if you're into more on the mid to high frequency range this will do just fine.

Freq Range:
Low - needs improvement
Mid - decent
High - decent"
2047,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
2048,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not much of a headphones buff, but I like these. The sound quality is wonderful, I have very few songs where I can't hear every seperate track clearly, and I find them quite comfortable to wear. I do wish they could reach louder volumes, however. I'm normally used to using another cheaper pair, which is able to reach noticeably louder volumes."
2049,2.0 out of 5 stars,not very comfortable. Work though
2050,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 3 pairs of these for my children to use with their Samsung tablet. They report they are comfortable. Unfortunately, we have had on pair the ear piece detached from the headpiece as he was folding them back into place, it came apart. The pieces are not broken, it will clip back in the headband but it slips right out."
2051,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for both my kids in black and white. They love them. They also use them when they play on their iPads and FaceTime.
2052,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The quality of these headphones is fantastic. My only complaint is that, at least, compared to my older Sony studio headphones, the cord is relatively short. It's nothing a headphone extension cable can't fix, though. Overall, a wonderful product!"
2053,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, ok bass, not heavy. Not as loud as ear buds. I am happy with the purchase. Button works. works with the Motorola Turbo Phone. Android."
2054,5.0 out of 5 stars,"happy with my purchase, excellent quality and value"
2055,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They work great, and are very comfortable. Love how affordable they are."
2057,2.0 out of 5 stars,I use to have a pair of Sony Headphones and they lasted me a solid year but sadly my sister's cat destroyed them. So I decided to order another pair and they suck. The sound goes in and out. I have to move the cable around so I can get a better sound and I have only had them for 2 months! Idk if it's just this specific pair or they played me.
2058,2.0 out of 5 stars,headphone Jack cut in and out when touched. Obviously some sort of bad connection.
2059,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for a great price. I tend to be hard on headphones and could not see myself paying $199.00 for a good pair. Great product and not exactly noise canceling, but close enough."
2060,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. Arrived safely and in one piece. That is a bonus in itself!
2061,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE IT!!!
2062,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ran across these headphones while searching for a pair of over-the-ear style, I wanted something that I could use to listen to YouTube videos 44 movies because I have A3 year old child that monopolizes the TV and I wanted the over-the-ear style to cancel out all the Disney. I'm older so I'm not trying to make a fashion statement by having a pair of $300 Dre Beats or Bose I took a chance on these because I love Sony products and the reviews, not to mention that I knew if I had any problems Amazon would let me ship them back for free with a full refund and being a Prime member just makes this even easier. Now one with the review I'm a large adult so least you're cops don't fully in case my ears like my Tony wireless headset for my PlayStation 4 does but they do cover the circumference of my ear comfortably the padding which feels like a very soft vinyl material is very comfortable they don't make my ears hot and sweaty and they do cancel outside noises as long as you have the mic on the line muted if not you'll still here outside stuff because of the inline mic which depending on how you're using them can be an advantage IE your child getting into something they shouldn't. When I first got them I plug them into my tablet fire it up a movie and I was absolutely floored with the sound quality some people say they don't go up loud enough what they do and then you know there's some programs that have sound boost and even with movies and Surround Sound with full Boost the headsets never distorted nice bass crisp treble incredible stereo like sound almost better than a movie theater you just feel like you're immersed in the movie. I've used them for phone calls and they're absolutely amazing and I've asked the other person hey can you tell I'm using a headset to talk to you and they can't tell and they can't hear my TV in the background. I plugged them into my PS4 controller and use them to game and the sound is just as good and people I chat with say that the that is perfectly clear no humming no popping no dropping and can't hear other people in the room talking. Easy to adjust they're comfortable on my large head and they fold up small for travel and I think mine came with a little bag to slide them into. In my opinion this headshot is not a one-trick pony they work great plugged into your phone to listen to music they're great plugged into a laptop or a tablet to watch movies on YouTube and I was surprised how well they work on my PlayStation 4 they just do it all and do it all well. They feel light and flimsy but they haven't broke and my three-year-old has gotten ahold of him a couple times and stretch them out and he didn't break them either which was shocking they don't have that creaky cheap plastic sound that I've seen an older model sony PlayStation headsets that costed $100+. It's only like that I would have had these in stock I would have bought them from there had them match Amazon's price and then paid the couple bucks for the 2-year Geek Squad just in case my kids would have gotten ahold of him and broke up but I got them off Amazon for only $17 they came in less than 2 days and we're going on 2 years now and they still work like brand new and my kids never broke them. I haven't loved a pair of headphones like these since I was a teenager and I used to have a Sony Walkman back in the day. Bottom line if you're looking for a nice set of over-the-ear headphones that can do everything you need them to do for under $20 these are the ones for you. I've used my friends headphones that cost over $100 and they're not any better than these. one of my friends was so impressed by these headphones that he bought them just to use with his PlayStation 4 and saved over $100 by doing this and he games every night."
2063,5.0 out of 5 stars,good product
2064,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for use while flying. Helps, but doesn't block the noise completely."
2065,4.0 out of 5 stars,GOOD FOR THE PRICE
2066,3.0 out of 5 stars,Just underwhelmed at Sony claims
2068,4.0 out of 5 stars,for the price these things rock I use them a lot there not Beats but there not that far behind (other than in price)

2071,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For my purposes these are a fine pair of Headsets. But lets be clear, I do not use them looking for high quality stereo sound. I use them to connect
with my TV. The serve the purpose just fine. Their fit is acceptable but not great. to me they are an acceptable low cost headphones."
2072,4.0 out of 5 stars,"nice, decent sound...use for my tablet..no problems and arrived on time and good condition...reasonable price..will order again."

2075,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very clear sound. I can hear the person I'm speaking two very well. And they can also hear me very very well. When listening to music the sound is very clear. This was a great purchase.
2076,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the ZX100 headphones and lost them. I loved them for the sound and comfort. I did a search on Amazon and found the ZX10 with bass boot and a mic, so I had to get these. I love them. First thing I did was place them on my head and was just like my last set. Then I called someone to check the mic. All good"
2077,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome item! Came early and works great!
2079,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got a great deal on these and they are good quality...Sony is a good name

2082,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price.
2083,4.0 out of 5 stars,very good sound quality; stylish too
2084,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are soft on the ears, have a sturdy cable, and emit extraordinary sound. I'm not what they call an ""audiophile"", but I've tried many headphones that are much more expensive and sound very similar to these Sony headphones."
2085,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I HAVE HAD A SET OF THESE BEFORE THEY ARE PERFECT FOR MY NEEDS. THESE WERE A GIFT FOR SOMEONE BY MY CHOICE.
I COULD HAVE PURCHASED OTHERS BUT DUE TO PAST EXPERIENCE WITH THESE I AGAIN CHOOSE THIS PARTICULAR BRAND & MODEL."
2086,3.0 out of 5 stars,I expected more from sony... Not impressed..
2087,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved them
2088,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for the price
2090,1.0 out of 5 stars,Did not last
2091,1.0 out of 5 stars,I want a refund. The signal on both pairs only comes through on the left channel. There is no sound whatsoever coming through the right earphone. I have checked both pairs thoroughly. I also made sure it was not the transmitter by testing with my old headphone and sound comes through on both sides of them. These headphones I JUST RECEIVED are defective!
2092,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones, I bought these to replace a older pair for my kids. I bought a black one and a white one. My kids live them and they are great quality for the price."
2093,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones provide quality sound and the wires are thick enough that they don't get all tangled up in knots. They fold up nicely as well.
2094,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed a new headset after I broke my old Sony earphones from many years ago. I don't like earbuds, and I think these are as good as they get! I would recommend them highly and the price is great!"
2095,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
2096,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exactly what I had hoped for at a decent price. Nice fit over the ears that makes you promise to NEVER get those bug plugs again. And forget about being ""in style"" with the latest EXPENSIVE headphones--...These are all you need. GREAT PRODUCT!"
2097,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are a great deal! I bought Dr. Dre's Studios when they first came and I would compare these to those. They may not look as stylish, or have as much bass, but they are better balanced and I could never justify buying another pair of Studios, or any Beats by Dre type headphone knowing that theses are available."
2098,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these as a gift for my husband. He says they work great. They are comfortable and sound great. He bought the same pair from the store for more money but he accidently cut the cord. So I was happy when I found these cheaper on Amazon.
2099,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my step-daughter, the first set crackled so we sent it back for a 2nd pair and she loves them and uses them every day."

2108,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like headphones. I have pairs of both Beyerdymanics DT330 and DT990. But I have never gotten so much great sound for so little money as on these SONY phones. Well balanced, natural sounding, and quite efficient. Worth every penny and Highly Recommended. 5 stars. b."
2109,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good!!!
2110,3.0 out of 5 stars,The product is good. Just a little uncomfortable on my ears.
2112,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect :)
2113,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice for the price. They do not cover the ears though. I use them for voice only so can't report on music quality.
2114,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are quality headphones for the price! I have spent this much or more on far inferior headphones/earbuds. Extremely comfortable and nice quality sound. So reasonably priced that you aren't afraid to use them or drop them...which I have dropped them without any harm. Fold up nicely for travel.
2115,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality sound. Comfortable fit. Nice long cord. I didnt want wireless and was looking for good quality sound at reasonable price
2116,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good quality headphones. A bit small, and don't completely cup around my ears like my old ones. It doesn't affect the quality, but just in case it's a preference of yours. They're not all that loud, but has a good enough bass and whatnot. Worth the price."
2117,5.0 out of 5 stars,"pretty loud. wish it was kind of louder but what do you expect from the price? other than that, it's a good pair of headphones."
2118,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing headphones, very comfortable, great sound. And most importantly not to tight around my big head."
2119,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound and not too big for my not too big head. Add the great price and one happy camper here. :)

2129,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A Good deal for the money, but a tad uncomfortable. Buy them, but expect limitation on the comfort part."
2130,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son purchased these headphones and said that they are high quality for the price.
2131,4.0 out of 5 stars,They have great sound for the money.
2132,4.0 out of 5 stars,The cord is too long
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for wireless headphones for my work and seriously considered Sony 1000X vs. Bose QC 35. While I was watching so many reviews, I found Sony just updated the 1000X, so I jumped into WH 1000XM2! I tried on both 1000XM2 and Bose QC 35 and honestly think that both are great headphones. Sony 1000XM2 has more features and longer battery life so I am very content with my purchase.

#Features
The touchpad is not a new feature but it is worth mentioning since Bose does not have this feature. Swipe up or down to control the volume. Swipe right or left to change the music. It is very intuitive and easy. You can even press long to activate Siri. Double tap to stop music or take a phone call.
Also, you can cup the right ear and disable the noise canceling and listen to others.

You can check the battery level by the home screen of a smartphone. I have only seen even numbers such as 100%, 70%, and 50% (then I would charge so I have not seen low numbers because of the reason). Maybe the headphone cannot tell the battery level precisely.

#Bluetooth connection
Bluetooth connection is great. I can leave my phone and go to next room without breaking the connection. Switching the devices is not easy though. With Bose, you can connect two devices at the same time. However, with 1000XM2, you need to disconnect one device to use other device.

To switch the device (updated)
1. Go to setting. Bluetooth, then disconnect WH-1000XM2.
2. Go to the other device, hit setting, Bluetooth, then click to connect.

If you don't want to touch the device connected currently but wans to switch the device (for example, 1000XM2 is connected to iPad that is in your bag and you don't want to pull it out), you can
1. Turn off the 1000XM2
2. Turn on and keep pressing power button to activate bluetooth pairing.
3. Go to your device you want to connect. Hit setting, bluetooth, then connect to 1000XM2.

Honestly, I don't mind doing this but I wish we could connect two iOS devices at the same time.

#Noise canceling
Sony and Bose are both excellent noise cancelling (NC) headphones. While QC35 cannot turn off the NC, 1000XM2 can turn of NC. Previous 1000X had a problem with phone call where you cannot hear yourself (so you end up shouting). Sony has fixed this problem and now 1000XM2 let you hear your voice easily with voice focus mode. Making phone call is much easier now.

#Sony headphone connect app
This app allows you to change the setting of NC based on your activity. You can pre-set the level of NC + voice focus according to your activity (rest, walking, running, and transportation). For frequent fliers, it can adjust the pressure too. You can also change where the sound comes from. For example, you can set as if the sound comes from your back.

When I was using 1000XM2 in the office, I used voice focus mode. It was very interesting experience because I did not hear any noise from construction etc but I heard my coworkers voice. Voice is picked up from the mic so it is an interesting experience.

#Gorgeous look
It honestly looks fantastic. I usually pick the black color but I tried gold at this time. The case of headphone had two-tone color (gold in the middle). It looks great. Please look at attached pictures as it tells you more how nice it looks. The headphone has hinges so you can actually make it very small and put it into the case.

#Sound
I cannot speak too much about the sound because I am not a professional musician. However, in my opinion, it sounds absolutely nice. It sounds even better than Bose QC35 but it is just my opinion. With the connect app, you can also change the sound effect such as Arena, Club, Outdoor Stage, and Concert Hall. It is subjective so you might want to try it before you buy, but I am very much satisfied.

#Comfort
This is where BOSE QC35 (quiet comfort) comes into play. WH 1000XM2 is comfortable but I feel my ears are hot after using this for 1 hour. The pad is touching my ears with 1000XM2 whereas QC35 has deeper ear pad. QC35 is much more comfortable for me.

#Sturdy design
I know cracking was the problem with 1000X. So far, it has been OK but I will definitely give updates after using several months (hope nothing will happen). It looks very sturdy and does not make the clicking sound when I open the headphone.

So which one you should buy? I am very happy with 1000XM2 because it has many features and long battery life (30 hours!). However, you may want to try it on before you buy because BOSE is more comfortable."
1,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great noise cancelling now better than bose. The sound out of these headphones blows bose out of the water also. Good app for the headphones. You have to have them adjusted just right to be comfortable for long periods but once you find that sweet spot can wear for hours and hours and the sound is awesome out of the headphones. Hard to find replacement pads though.

I just want to add something for amazon it would be alot better to see reviews from people that pay not a bunch of reviews from people that receive the product for free. I have been noticing alot more vine reviews and they are always high because duh they are receiving a free product this is a shady practice in my opinion. I want a real review of someone that is willing to come off 400.00 of their hard earned money then give a review."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are one of my favourite things. They are so well built and are fully sound cancelling. I had the MDR1000x before this and decided to upgrade for the better battery life and app support. I’m going to list the pros and cons I’ve encountered so far and give some recommendations. FYI, I’ve never owned (but have tested) the QC35, beats solo and studio, and own the Senhiessers 550HD.

-Pros-
1) These are top notch in terms of noise cancelation and isolation. The mdr1000x were great and these are the same if not a step up. I could be mowing or trimming the lawn and if I close my eyes I’m in a totally different world. Can’t tell a machine is functioning in front of me.
2) Touchpad: this is such a cool feature. I’m an adoptee of new tech and have been loving it. Sometimes it doesn’t register my hand gestures but I mean it’s not the end of the world. Always registers the second time. The palm over to bring outside noise is super cool, but no one on the other end knows what’s going on. I’d be on a bus and talk to the driver and he’d think I’m on the phone and ignore me. But super cool nonetheless!
3) Battery life, 30-40 hours is Sony’s estimate I believe I’ve been getting very close to that as I go on walks and listen to music while studying overall super happy about it!
4) App is easy to use to pick between different general modes. Kinda cool. One con about this is I use tidal and the music centre only functions with Apple Music (I just use iOS and tidal. Dunno about Spotify or other platforms.
5) These headphones work great wirelessly and last long. But a great pro to them is when you connect the wires you get even better quality! Who knew that could be possible. Another pro is you could use the headphones when dead (without any of the extra bells and whistles) so having the wire on you is the equivalent to carrying another pair of headphones ;)

-Cons-
1) Potential chance of crack? I had the MDR 1000x for months and did not face the crack issues other have. But in my opinion, I totally agree with the video listed where the guy says the cracks are an easy con for the many pros and it’s something you should consider for yourself whether you care enough about that. Are there better speakers out there for the same price range? Yes. Do they have the same functions the Sony has? Not likely (touchpad particularly) is it worth its money? Yes!
2) The bag is the exact same and not very well made in my opinion. Nice that Sony puts it I but I mean you’ll likely want to get one yourself.
3) Connectivity not as (I’ve heard) easy as QC35 or others. Honestly, this isn’t a huge con but I listed it so you can have it in perspective. Do you want to connect to another device? Disconnect from the Bluetooth settings and connect to them on the other device. If the device is in your bag hold the power button to turn off, then continue to hold it after it turns on until it says pairing. I use 5 devices and this hasn’t been an issue for me.

This pair of headphones is well packaged and, in my humble opinion, well priced. You risk it having a small crack, I’ve never had, but for all the extras you get, it’s well worth it. Another thing is Sony did price it lower than the older model so it’s not like they’re charging extra for more functions. The pad sometimes doesn’t register stuff, but I think that’s more me getting used to it than it getting used to me. It's a give and take situation it does stuff for you but you have to learn to function with it and around its flaws.

A few things to improve on would be to have the headphones announce what they’re connected to rather than just staying connected. I believe this won’t be hard for Sony to add through the app, could be wrong, and then again it might not be something they want to do, to begin with. Would’ve loved to see USB type-C on this model. USB-C is the future would be great when small gadgets like this embrace that.

I’d recommend these to anyone who is looking to get a good quality headphone that is versatile with great sound cancelling and new technology. This is and will be for some time my daily driver for headphones.

Hope this helps some of you decide whether it’s a good fit for you — I’ll update this as time goes in regards to my experience with battery life, the infamous cracks and such."
3,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say the sound and noise cancelling of this is pretty awesome.

Unfortunatley that's moot because after a month and a half of regular use the side of the headband cracked. Rendering it useless. Looked online and saw there are MANY people with the same problem and concerns. Someone from Sony even left a comment under a review on Amazon saying the issue has been looked at and ""measures had been taken"".

Contacted Sony about a repair / replace and was told that wouldn't happen. Even though it's their defective product. They are the ones who chose to use cheap plastic on 400 dollar headphones, I'm the one paying for it.

I'm never buying Sony again."
4,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll keep it short. I read the reviews of the Sony WH1000XM2 and the Bose QuietComfort 35 II and could not decide which to choose, so I bought both. I will return the Sony and keep the Bose. Here are the pros and cons:

Sony:
+ Crisper highs and deeper bass (I can't see how anyone says the Bose model sounds better)
+ Better song navigation with the figure gestures on side of right headpiece
- When making phone calls, those on the other end hear more of your background noise than on the Bose (I tested by calling from a land line to a family member who used my Sonys)
- Heavy on the head and hurts to wear for long periods (this was a deal breaker for me)
- Finger navigation feature is too sensitive sometimes - easy to skip/rewind songs by accident.

Bose
+ Great noise cancellation, especially with no music (better than Sony's)
+ Light weight and definitely more comfortable for long periods
+ Best for phone calls (those on other end don't hear much background noise)
- Sound is missing crispness at high and low ends; overall sounds are a bit muffled (it would be great to get Sony's sound on these speakers). If music quality is your deal breaker, buy the Sonys for sure.

In the end, I couldn't get over the uncomfortable aspect of the Sonys. I really preferred the Sony sound, but didn't see myself wearing the Sonys for long periods of time. My primary reason for buying these was muffling office and plane engine noise for long periods of time, therefore comfort was a deal breaker. It also helps that I can take conference calls on these."
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones to replace my top-of-the-line Sony MDR-1RNC headphones, which have unbelievably great sound quality but they have been acting up lately (very frustrating). Let me first say that out of the box, the new 1000XM2 headphones had a little better noise cancelling than the MDR-1RNCs but the sound quality was not even close to what I was hoping for. The sound of these new headphones was really muddy with way to much mid-bass frequencies. But then I discovered the iPhone/iPad App for the WH1000XM2s which allows you to customize equalization settings (among other things). After reducing the level at 400 Hz (the muddy frequency range), increasing the levels for 1K, 2.5K, 6.3K, and 16K, and then increasing the level for clear bass (the lowest bass setting), I was able to get the nice V-shaped frequency response that make these headphones sound fantastic. No more mud, everything is crystal clear but not harsh, and the bass is really punchy without drowning out the mids and highs. It sounds great for all genres that I’ve tested (jazz, orchestral, pop, soundtrack, etc). I’ve attached an image of my equalization settings for anybody who wants to give what I did a try. Also, the Bluetooth connection works/sounds great with my iPad and iPhone and the battery seems to last a long time before needing to be recharged. So, these are now my go-to headphones for fun listening with unrivaled noise cancelling."
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these daily for a couple of months now so I could really provide a great review. I use these to block noise in loud data centers while on the phone and for listening to music. These replaced a set of Bose headphones that my wife claimed as her own. Overall I like these more than the Bose set and here's why.
Noise Cancelling - my Bose headset is an older set (it's 7 years old now) but the noise cancelling on these is every bit as good as these are for the noise in a data center. If you've never been in a data center, it's a constant cacophony of high speed fans with more 'background' noise than found in normal commercial aircraft. It's the ultimate test for noise cancelling. I put these on and the noise level was decreased dramatically just from the well padded ear cups. Then I turn it on. Blissful near silence. Sure, I can hear some of the ancillary noises, but for the first time I can hear the subtle beeping of computers doing their thing. Way cool.
Next, I fire up my music app of choice - Pandora. I have an eclectic taste in music - U2 to Beethoven, Collective Soul to Moby, and just about everything in between. Unlike the Bose, the overall sound response is crisp, clear, and balanced. The Bose kit seemed a little bass heavy to me. Music is reproduced without hiss, buzz, or other artifacts.
Excited by this, I head home and fire up my lossless music subscription and bring up a collection of Jazz greats. I can hear it all. Wood creaking as the artist shifts their seat. The soft 'clump' of valves. No hiss. And this is through the bluetooth connection, NOT through the included cable. Amazing.
Now, I'm not a crazy audiophile. I've been plagued with tinnitus since birth so much of the subtle points is lost on me simply because of the ringing BUT I've been able to hear things using this set of headphones from music that I've never heard before WHILE in a loud data center.
I've worn these constantly for 10+ hours and aside from a little warmth, they were extremely comfortable. Battery life is every bit of 20 hours with no need to recharge after two days of heavy use.
The app that you can use with these is pretty easy to use and has some unique features. It is able to detect your actions and adjust noise cancellations accordingly. If you are on the street perhaps you want to me more aware of your surroundings. If you are sitting in a chair perhaps you want to block out more noise. This system will detect and adapt automatically. It's pretty effective and actually detects things pretty well. Going for a walk reduced the cancellation levels while sitting in my office increased it. Using the other tools is likely more of a gimmick - different sound stages (arena, outdoors, etc) Meh - not much difference really. Being able to change the directionality of the sound is also fun to play with and is very effective, but I fail to see the real point of this. Other neat features are the ability to control the headset using 'gestures' - tap to pause, swipe to change volume or advance tracks, and cup to enhance conversation. These are all extremely effective and useful. The 'cupping' motion continues to block lower mhz sound (jet engines, etc) while enhancing the sound range of normal human voices. Short conversations are easy even without taking these off. Swiping quickly becomes second nature and is extremely effective.
Bottom line is this - after owning several of the Bose offerings and really linking them, this set does a better job of faithfully recreating the original intent of sound to your ears than the Bose set does. Bose headsets are WONDERFUL and some of the music I listen to does sound better coming from them (I'm looking at you, dubstep), much of the other music is cleaner coming from these. Noise cancelling is jaw droppingly effective. Battery life is phenomenal. Overall the sound quality and technical features built in to this edge out the Bose in an unofficial head to head comparison."
7,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just a great pair of headphones with a superb sound quality. Well done Sony.

Update: well yes great sound quality, but after 5 months, same problem as previous model, mine got broken as usual at the headband.According to Sony, this is ""physical damage"".. Now I took good care of them and put them always in the original case... Omg Sony... What a disaster. Exactly today I was considering to pre-order the new camera Sony A73.... Well I might think twice after this treatment."
8,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After hours of research on product reviews, I bought this pair of cans. When it arrived, I loved how it looked, felt and sounded. Then I noticed the ONLY ONE yet CRITICAL problem shortly. Whenever I move my head and there is little pressure on my left side of head, there is a squeaky sound and it is annoying. Especially, since you are isolated from noise from surrounding environment thanks to superb noise cancelling function, this squeaky noise from right inside your left cup sounds emphasized. I love the first impression of this product so I am returning back to get a replacement hoping that I have received a defective one.

I will definitely update this review after I receive the replacement product.

UPDATE 1 : I am still waiting for the replacement product to arrive. However, I found another issue meanwhile. When it is connected via its supplied audio cable, I only hear music via left cup only. It leads me to the conclusion that I have received a defective one. I just hope that next one will not have these issues.

UPDATE 2 : Thanks to the greatest Amazon return policy, I received the replacement within one day after filing a claim.

Firstly, this annoying squeaky sound inside the cup still exists. This replacement pair squeaks less than the first one to be honest, however, the problem still remains. If SONY reads this, I have a theory why this happens. I think the speaker cone works like a suction cup or plunger creating the crumbling sound from this flimsy speaker cone material whenever the cup is being pushed toward. Perhaps, few invisible tiny bits of vent holes can prevent this issue. I don't know how it will affect the noise isolation. Please, look into it.

Secondly, when it is connected via its audio cable, it works as advertised. Problem solved. Hooray~.

Lastly, I think this may be a mere software or phone specific (Samsung Galaxy S5) issue. Whenever I change the sound priority option, the headphone turns off and has to be reconnected. I hope this can be fixed by any future update.

I think this is a good pair of cans with great sound, superb noise cancelling and lots of useful functions. Yet, I think its craftsmanship falls a bit short as a premium headphone. Thus my initial 2 star rating remains the same. I am still thinking whether I should keep this or try something else such as Bose QC35. I guess I will find out within Amazon's return grace period."
9,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great great quality of sound! This unit comes with diverse product features that can be interpreted as good value from a consumer's perspective.
HOWEVER, no way to listen to music more than an hour because TOO heavy and the ear cups were somewhat smaller than mine (Don't think that my ears are far beyond average; mines are smaller than average). Too heavy, too tight mean very uncomfortable, although sound was the best one I've tried so far. It ended with returning it, thereby."
11,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Easily the best sounding bluetooth wireless in the price range. However, they just aren't as comfortable as Bose QuietComfort which is a huge bummer. My ears fatigue from the pressure and if headphones aren't comfortable, you don't wear them. It won't matter if they sound better than other headphones. I can wear my Bose all day. I can wear my Sony's for about two to three hours before my ears tire from the pressure and uncomfortable ear pads. You will have to decide what's more important to you: comfort or best sound."
12,3.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.

1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.

2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.

Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.

Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is a great product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's."
13,5.0 out of 5 stars,After spending a week with these headphones all i can is wow. There very comfortable with plus like leather. And the Noise cancelation with the Sony app is spot on either when I start walking out my apt or sitting on the bus the headphones with the app adjust noise canceling levels accordingly. Not sure about the headband cracking since I haven't had them that long but they seem fine. I'm very happy with my purchase
14,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These have great sound, but the build quality is very bad, and Sony's customer support is truly horrible. Don't buy these.
To preface this review, I purchased these for work, and they never left my office. When not on my head, they were on a headphone rack.
The first big bummer is that, unlike my Bose QC35's, the Sony cannot connect to multiple devices. So no listening to music through the computer but still being able to take calls. That's a huge downside.
Next, the power button ""sank"" into it's slot. Originally, there was a little feedback when you pressed the power button - a ""click"" so to speak. Then the button was really deep with no feedback. I have to jam my finer in and the only way I know I'm doing it right it to wait for the lights to blink.
I called Sony a few months after buying to see about getting the faulty button fixed. After over an hour on the phone they told me it was my fault and that I had abused them. As noted above, these never left my desk, and were either on my head or on a headphone rack. Sony was absolutely horrible.
A few weeks later, the ""ambient noise"" button above the power button did the same thing. It still works, but it's just annoying that something as common as a button doesn't work.
I've gone back to my almost three year old Bose QC35's for the office, and these are my ""iPad shows in bed"" headphones. That brings up the last annoying bit - there's a flashing blue light that you can't turn off, so when wearing these in the dark there's a constant distracting flash that's really bright, both peripherally and on the screen of the iPad.
Overall I'm really bummed, and am stuck with these mediocre defective cans that Sony won't fix. Buy the Bose - they're better."
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First and foremost I hope this review those who have been thinking about these headphones to make a good decision whether these headphones are really for you and not compulsively buy the Sony WH1000XM2. So this review will be pretty detailed concerning these headphones. To get it out of the way, yes, these are the best sounding headphones with the most potential on the average consumer flagship market right now. After reading many reviews, I find that not everyone is a tech enthusiast or know holistically about these. So I will address the problems then get into what I like.

Do these suffer from the same cracking issue as the mdr?: From my experience, they have not. The hinges are mostly a plastic finish with some metallic bands encircling the arch of the headphone and no these are not water resistant. This makes the headphones sturdy, however, with a sufficient enough stress, you can crack the hinges on the headphones. You can also hurt the overall durability but stretching the headphone to far constantly. Jimmy reviews did a stress test but that was mainly the outside arch and not the inside hinges, which are durable so far.

Why do these sound different across phones?: Sony really pushes advertising for LDAC, if you do not own a Sony phone or own an android phone with android oreo (any phone that came out before 2017 barring the google pixel). Do not worry, most 2016 flagships will be getting android oreo later this year which will come LDAC. If you do not own an LDAC compatible device then you will notice a DRASTIC change in sound quality. Not to say that phones without LDAC will not sound good but the older your phone, the less bit rates it can transfer to the headphones which affects the quality. Those who own android 8 (or those that are sony fans in general) are the ones touting how amazing these headphones are. I noticed that those with older phones were the ones complaining how they were not up to par, typically, there are some who talked about how they were great but not on Bose level with android oreo 8 phones and sony phones but it was very few.

Are these bass heavy?: These are bass heavy depending on your sound stage and your EQ settings. The Sony's have Arena, Club, Concert, Outside stage or off (neutral sound). Also depends on whether you have DSEE HX active on auto or not (mainly CD quality or not). By the way, in order to customize the sound you need to have an emphasis on stable connection. An emphasis on sound quality will mean that your headphones will optimize the song for you. You will need to use the Sony app (this is not compatible with the MDR as it is a software limnitation). There are two more aps such as the sony music app that you really do not need and another app called smart connect. Essentially controlling what your headphones do at a certain time. Such as noting that at 4:00 you can call a friend that time. Or playing a certain song at a time (which I assumed is where the music center comes into play)

Club: The most bass heavy soundstage of the four. It sounds as if you are right in front of the stereo that is playing. In short, this works with bass dominant EQ settings with high volumes. It can work with mellow songs but it is more geared towards bass.

Arena: Ever been at a music festival or hardstyle's Qlimax? It sounds like you are in the middle. So the music is farther away and this sound stage places an emphasis on vocals and bass (with a far away reverb effect) so you there are 3 drivers that work to create this. This is primarily good for mid bass emphasis and treble heavy songs. Vocals also go well with this but can go with another sound stage.

Concert: As the name implies, as if you at a music concert. Vocal heavy sounds are recommended moreso than bass heavy songs. There is a lot of reverb with this sound stage so prepare to hear a lot of echo which actually sounds wonderful. Bass heavy songs are hit or miss. Beethoven, thomas bergusen, mark petrie, other choir songs work. Treble is nice here too.

Outside stage. Combine club and arena. Good amount of bass and vocals, This can essentially work with any song, it is kind of like off but the best for average optimization as the music feels more ""alive"" so to speak. if you have a balance enough amount of bass and treble with a bit more emphasis on vocals in your EQ, then you will get the most out of this sound stage. The song still sounds less in your face as the club sound stage but still great nonetheless.

Off: How you would listen to any headphone really without any additives and just your EQ.

Are these better than the beats studio 3, Bose QC II, Senheiser px550: IT really depends on your taste.each produce their own sound, some people like the bose for the comfort, if you are comfortable while listing to music, your music naturally sounds better. They are definitely better than beats though, but between senheiser, bose, and these pair, you will not really be disappointed. The willikans are also amazing but their comfortably is abysmal in my opinion.

I mainly chose the Sony because it is not a one trick pony and actually offers a variety of options and features that makes these headphones great. What blows you away is really up to how you customize your headphones, how loud the volume is, your EQ, your sound stage. It never distorts which is nice.

You can control the direction of where the sound comes from as well. This is useful if you are in an area where you need to talk to someone but change the a hip-hop song to feel like it is coming from behind you so you can still hear the person talking. On that note, it is important to mention that using this option, automatically shuts off any sound stage you are using and reverts it back to off. Your EQ will be fine though and DSSE HX will be fine.

The best feature is probably how you can change your noise cancellation in 20 levels and whether you want a focus on voice, not only that, you can have it automatically adjust depending on what you are doing. These are not the first to do this, the nuhera earbuds did this but the technology was early and thus it was not really all that good. Dare I say that Sony has perfected it. At 0 you cannot hear anything while music is playing and you only really hear someone if they are shouting at the top of their lungs or if you get hit by a cup by one of your coworkers to get your attention. At 20, you can hear all your surrounding or you can place your hand over the right earcup to block out sound and lowers the volume (if the volume was high, you still hear the song but it is still faint). Best in ANC right now

You can also activate the assistent by long pressing the right earcup then just speak. It is a bit better than cheaper earphones as you need to wait for awhile. Not as good as bose though as that is near instant but nice enough.

The main bad thing is the comfortability, while these are decent to wear, not as comfortable as Bose but after awhile, your ears can feel pressured by the earcup. You have to adjust the earcup to your ears manually (It is kind of odd to explain) but it fits that way. Even then, you can feel uncomfortable after about an 1 or 3 hours if you're used to them.

Overall, these are wonderful headphones for the money right now. If you do not have a phone that has LDAC then these will still sound great but you may feel as if ""maybe these can do a bit more"". You will not be dsappointed, any additional feature is already in description and features. The atomospheric pressure just makes your song slow down as the altitude gets higher, it solves a problem nobody had but is nice none the less. You will not be disappointed by this pair but still surf around. If you okay with headphones with moderate comfortably but with amazing sound and a variety of features then these will do the job."
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"TLDR: Expensive but very high quality construction and sound, a must buy.

Pros:

- Sound is incredible. All highs, mids, and lows are clear and crisp.
- Feel and weight is on point. This headset feels good. I can wear it all day without discomfort.
- Battery length is what is being advertised. I could easily run the headset all day without issue.
- People complain about the touch controls but I personally love them once I understood how they worked. The Sony competitor doesn't have the ability to skip tracks and that is an important feature for me. The touch controls are well done and I haven't had a single problem with them.
- Noise cancelling is very good. The headset keeps out all of the ambient sound in my office, which is an incredible feat of engineering IMO.

Cons:

- Even after EQ adjustment, the bass isn't as deep as I'd like. I'd like a little more bass out of these headphones.
- The mic for calling isn't noise cancelling, which I thought that it was.
- Expensive! This headset is very pricey.
- Minor gripe but this thing should be USB C. I don't understand why Micro is still being used.
- The advertised ability to ""quickly disable noise cancelling"" to hear people talking around you is buggy and inconsistent. It is a good idea but poorly executed. Most of the time, I will tap and nothing will happen."
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these babies for the gym because I can’t stand earbuds. These Sony Headphones look freaking slick. The touch controls are a brilliant addition, sure my shoulder will rub against it and pause it once in a while but switching volume/songs/pausing without needing your phone is a huge plus. The build has been grea so far, I put them in my gym bag without the case a lot. I obviously don’t trash them because they’re $350 headphones but they have stood up through a lot of use. The battery is outstanding, and awesome having a battery indicator on your phone. The noise cancelling is so well done. These are better than Boss, plus the sound quality is pretty damn good. Bass is nice, clear crisp sound. I honestly am happy I spent the extra to get these headphones. Way better than Beats too. The ear cups are very comfortable, and Are not too hot for extended use."
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing. Buy the if they are in your budget.

Pros
They sound and noise canceling are great.
They can change NC mode when you walk around allowing you to hear ambient sound if you chose to.
Sound controls on the ear piece work very well. The app is very easy to use.
Covering the right ear piece with your hand you can hear ambient great for planes and coworkers. (Stretching your arms up can also trigger this if you touch them.rare scenario.)

Cons
Cost is high
They do feel hot to wear after a while. Not comfortable on hot days. Bose may be a better fit there.
Can become uncomfortable on long flights. After about 4-6 hours. Bose seem to have all day comfort.

Comfort is high on my list and I still chose these."
19,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the color, sound, noise-cancellation (on par with Bose) and tech features. I think the fit is slightly tight, but I could have lived with it.

I am returning the product, however, because it does not support true bluetooth multi-point connectivity. It does support connecting one device in ""headphone"" mode (no mic) and another device simultaneously in ""headset"" mode... however I need to connect to both a laptop and my phone and have the mic activated for both. It's too bad, I liked the product otherwise."
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really confused with bose quite comfort and Sony 1000x. I ended up buying both :)

Now that I have used both of them, Sony outranks Bose in every department. If you are a techie, Sony is what you want. The ambient sound enhancer is a feature to die for. Just place your hand on your right ear cuff and boom suddenly you can hear everything. The noise cancelling is simply Amazing, I tested both these headphones next to a vacuum cleaner, Sony has far outperformed Bose. You can hear absolutely nothing on Sony. Bose too does a good job but, Sony is far better.
Sound quality is comparable on both.

People say Sony is a bit heavier, I couldn’t find any notable difference."
22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great. I was between these and Bose but I felt the bose sounded too artificial. The Sony’s have a nice soundstage with accurate mids and highs, and a nice punchy bass. Comfort is top notch, with little fatigue after long listening sessions. Noise canceling is amazing, the world becomes silent and I think it’s better than bose. Well worth the money."
23,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I lov'em, plain and simple, they are comfortable (I have small ears tho), stylish and the active noise cancelling is top notch. Price is high, but imho is well deserved. The tactile interface on the right earpad works really well: it's not a gimmick (that was my initial fear), but a useful feature that wont make you miss the presence of physical buttons.
If you are really into customizations, the app can give you a good range of freedom about EQ, sound positioning and the threshold of the noise cancelling feats, however you can easily live with the out of the box defaults.

My only complaint is the quality of conversation when used to answer a phonecall: mics are distant and you may sound very distant to the other sid, most of the time you will find yourself screaming in the crowd (since sound proofing is so good you can't hear your own voice, but of course other people can)"
24,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic headphones. Was going to wait for Sony’s Bluetooth 5.0 headphones next year but couldn’t resist buying these. I’m glad I did though. They sound clean, crisp and precise. Very spacious sound. They look and feel great as well. They do get hot though after a while. More so than most headphones so I would like to see that improved in the next model. Lots of features and settings as well which is nice. Give em a try, I think you’ll enjoy them."
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In my opinion, these are the best headphones ever. I love the feature to turn noise cancelling feature off and ambient sound on. This helps me enjoy my music or a movie and still listen to my family around the house. Battery life is great. Noise cancelling feature is also great. I can barely hear the person standing next to me.
I found only two downsides to these which I can live with and I believe could be found in any over the ear head phones.
1) I can't not lay sideways which these on. It is very uncomfortable.
2) When I am not using these headphones, I usually wrap them around my neck. With my usual setting, these are bit tight. So I always end up stretching the straps all the way."
26,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable. I wear them on 15-20 hour overseas flights for listening (music/movies) and noise cancellation (sleeping). Excellent sound quality. Good battery life (25-30 hrs). Easy to use (right ear cup has a variety of touch controls). Be sure and download the app if you like to fine tune your listening experience and 'manage' your headphones.
27,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an audiophile but I own several closed headphones including a Master and Dynamics wireless headphones and a Bose with ambient Noise reduction. These are my preferred headphones. The sound is very clear, with great bass.
The noise canceling system works even too well ( sometimes I am afraid that somebody will take away the house around me and I will not be able to hear a thing). Anyway, overall I think these are the best sounding headphones I have."
28,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely my favorite purchase of the past several months. Quality product, excellent sound reproduction & comfortable to wear. And, most importantly, the noise cancelling is exceptional. These are a tad large for workout headphones but I like to listen to audio books when I exercise. And trying to hear a recitation when it's competing with a gaggle of treadmill walkers more focused on chatting than sweating was problematic at best. Turn on the NC feature and they disappear - perfect."
29,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best NC Wireless Headphones I have ever owned, even better than the Bose and Beats I used to own. Amazing sound, noise cancelling and battery life. The iPhone App is ok, and has room for improvement, but that has nothing to do with the quality and sound of the headphones. They are amazing!"
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have owned these for a few months now. I like them a lot. Noise cancelling is excellent. Very comfortable for extended listening. The battery life is amazing. The sound quality is not quite as great as some other cans I have owned over the years but all of the other features and the price make these a great buy.
31,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So after some research, this was the product I chose to spend my money on. I have had it for about a week and must say that I am impressed with both sound quality and noise canceling. The touch tech on the right earcup has been very reactive and have had zero issues with it. My hesitance was with the cracking issue reported by other users. I have yet to experience the cracking issue but did get the 4 year protection plan just in case. Note that you must buy it new for them to accept the insurance. I will update if I notice any defects but so far so good."
33,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality and noise cancelling is very good. Battery time is amazing. The only thing I do not like is that compared to my Bose QC15, the handsfree function is not very good. Particularly in noisy areas the sounds cuts in short intervals. The reason might be that the microphone is not on the cable. For listening to music these are great, but do not buy them as a handsfree set if you are going to talk a lot in noisy areas."
34,5.0 out of 5 stars,"very comfortable and easy to use. The noise cancelling function is very useful. In my opinion, if you want to buy a noise cancelling earphone, you should consider these aspects :
1. noise cancelling effect
2. comfortable or not for using long time
3. battery
4. appearace
Therefore, I choose to buy this one not Bose QC35."
35,5.0 out of 5 stars,"By far, the best headphones I have ever owned. The abundance of features combined with the clearest sound and pulsing bass, makes this a sound purchase ( no pun intended). I bought refurbished from Amazon and I can't tell it from new. Saved a bunch of money as well. The noise cancelling is phenomenal."
36,3.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are nice except for there is a crackle in the right ear cup when I am listening. I am not sure if that is a problem that other people have had.
37,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I freaking LOVE this headset!! It was a bit more pricey than most headphones I've purchased in the past but I am so happy that I did. The highs and lows are pleasant, the cup fits nicely over my ears, albeit it can get a bit warm after awhile. But they're still so comfortable that I fell asleep with them on. I have not yet flown with them but based on how light and comfortable they are, I imagine that I'll enjoy them more than my Klipsch headphone."
38,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used both the Bose QC35I and these, and decided to go with the 1000XM2s. Overall, the package of the Sonys feels more premium than the Bose, as far as finish and the technology. I can't speak on detailed comparison of the ANC, but Sony's definitely sounds at least as good as Bose's, and I think it's really cool how it has adaptive sensing as well as calibration for hairstyle/glasses and air pressure. I have no idea how much of a difference it makes compared to Bose, but just the fact that it's there gives it extra value for me. Additionally, the Sony app includes different sound stage adjustments to make it sound as if you're listening in a concert hall, outdoor stadium, etc, and has automatic and manual EQ adjustments. Bose has none of these features.

The Sony also has distinctly better sound quality than the Bose does. It's cleaner and richer, whereas the Bose has somewhat muddied mid-tones and highs. The touch controls on the Sony took a little bit to get used to, but in the end I think they give you much more control than the Bose, and the ability to place your palm against the control panel to allow ambient sound in through the microphones is a cool touch.

Comfort is where the Sony falls short, but just slightly. The ear muffs on the Sony get warm and a bit clammy after extended use and can cause some uncomfortable pressure on the earlobes, whereas I found the Bose stayed away from my ears due to the angled design of the inside mesh. Still, you can expect to wear the Sony's for hours and be comfortable.

Update: I had my first chance to use these on a 13 hour flight to Asia. I have to say that the noise canceling on these is far more comfortable than on the Bose QCs, which on a train ride created that odd, pressurized feeling in my ears. I'm not sure if my ears had just grown used to the noise canceling inverse waveform, but on my flight I felt no discomfort. It's amazing how more comfortable a long flight can be when you cut out that constant drone of engine noise, listen to music, and get slightly more restful sleep."
39,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well I liked many features of these headphones
Pros:
1.The sound quality is really good considering its bluetooth.
2.It looks really good and is very comfortable.
3.Long battery life of about 28 hours.
4.The noise cancellation is on par with bose qc 35.

Cons:
1.The earpads presses the ear a bit so it gets kinda fatigued after wearing a long time.
2.The sound quality and volume is bit lacking.

Overall it's a really nice pair of headphonesand I loved it.The problem of volume and quality can be easily solved using an amplifier(I used my FiiO A5 & it sounded really nice with the amp). I would recommend it to everyone who wishes to get a pair of good noise cancelling headphones."
40,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I travel a lot and have owned several pairs of Bose noise cancelling headphones over the years but have also been a big Sony fan so decided to try these headphones. Compared to my old Bose Quiet Comfort 15s, the Sony has better sound and better cancellation. Bluetooth isn't so important to me but it works well and I like the touch-control features where you can adjust volume or turn off cancellation with the swipe or tap of a finger. My one star deduction is for the weight of the unit - seems much more than Bose - and as some others have mentioned, my ears eventually get hot under the Sony's whereas they never seemed to under the Bose. Overall, this is a quality product that does what it's supposed to and I plan on enjoying them over many flights."
41,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great. I'm really impressed by the sound and noise-cancelling feature. It's a godsend at work—in an open office where people can't keep their voices down and distracting noise just carries everywhere. These headphones have made a huge difference in my mental health and wellbeing. My only criticism is that the they can sometimes be a bit heavy, and probably are not the best fit for my head shape. Otherwise, they're great."
42,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Uhhh! Marvelous, wonderful, that's what this headset is for me! I am so happy! It's perfect in all aspects. Friendly use without any disgusting unconfortable search for buttons to press. Oh what a great and soft and powerful sound, no distortions and hummmms; and the noise cancelling functions are a great engineering breakthrough. And ... NO WIRES! WoW! I hope this headphone endures and keeps working for many years."
44,5.0 out of 5 stars,The noise cancelling is so good. I like that some things are intuitive without fiddling with the settings like: Plugging in the audio cable automatically turns off bluetooth. Holding your hand over the right earpiece automatically pauses noise cancelling if it is on and turns the volume down so you can hear someone speaking to you.
45,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are fantastic. They're comfortable even after a couple of hours. The sound is excellent. I've been wearing them while mowing the lawn. Can barely hear the mower. They're crazy expensive. Personally, they're well over priced at $300+ but I knew that when I tried them on in the store. Fell in love with how they blocked out most of the sound in a very noisy store. Saw Amazon had them for a bit under $300 on Black Friday so I spoiled myself."
46,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work perfectly. Great noise cancelling. You hear your music or your book and nothing else. The pause function by placing your hand on the right headphone was the reason I purchased these and its awesome. The sound is great too. Download the app and it has an equalizer which is great for getting that right sound.
47,5.0 out of 5 stars,Whoa. Highly effective. As advertised. Great on airplane. Seem more effective than the Bose QC I lost. Sort of glad I did now...
48,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good noise cancelling abilities. There is a noise cancelling optimizer feature which is pretty useful since the noise cancelling can adjust to different environments.
The sound is very smooth and there's an equalizer in the app so you can set it as you want.
I find the touch features very convenient and use them often.
The headphones fit the head quite good and are pretty much comfortable.
I recommend these headphones."
49,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones, the active sound canceling I can't hear anything other than what is playing through the headphones, can't even hear myself talk. These are perfect for Fortnite, you can pin point where the enemy is in a building or where they are shooting from. Sound quality is great for BT 4.0 headphones. Would have given them 5 stars but if you do not seat them on your ears to where they slide in, the pressure they have on the ear after long periods of time will be uncomfortable."
50,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to replace my old wired Bose QC25 headphones. I love them. Some of the highlights for me:
- Long battery life and battery indicator when connected to my iPhone 8 so I know when to charge them
- Controls on right ear are fantastic. Ability to instantly stop/start/vol up & down/next song is incredibly convenient
- Range is awesome, on par with my Apple Airpods. Just now I left my phone in my seat (8C on a 737) and used the restroom at the rear of the plane. No disconnect or degradation whatsoever.
- Sound isolation as good or better than the QC25.

Very highly recommended."
51,3.0 out of 5 stars,They honestly are better than the Bose and the Beats studio 3 in terms of noise cancelling. They don't fit very well however. I'm a pretty average guy and they were constantly slipping forward and backward with any motion be it ever so slight. If you recline with them on they will slowly slip off your head onto the chair/couch/bed.
52,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had these on my wish list for about six months, but had been hesitant to purchase them because of the price. I impulsively bought them one night, and it was an excellent decision. I'm a writer working in a busy office, and it is so easy to get distracted by the chatter. The noise-canceling function on these is AMAZING. I can zone out and listen to my music in peace. The audio quality is also stellar. It was simple to pair with my iPhone, and the controls are easy to use. I especially like the feature in which you can touch the right earphone and hear ambient noise for a few moments. It's great for those occasional interruptions. This is an amazing piece of tech and well worth purchasing."
53,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are good but a little on the small side for a 6’ male with probably larger than normal ears. The Bose 35s are more comfortable to wear for hours. I have taken these on (2) 30 hour overseas trips and the battery lasted the entire trip which is no small feet. I picked these vs the Bose because I like the integrated controls better. Once you get the hang of the touch controls it is nice....not perfect but nice.
55,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are excellent in every way. They sound fantastic. The noise cancelling is outstanding. They have futuristic control and features (Cover right ear to hear the outside world? Too cool!). They look great (people always ask me what kind they are). The battery life is incredible. I think I charge it once every two weeks or so. Wired option is also great.

I'm a big advocate of spending big money on headphones that will give you the best experience and last you a long time over repeatedly buying cheaper headphones more frequently.

These are my favorite way to experience music to date. Worth every penny."
56,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable with excellent noise cancelling properties. Using the outer shell as a touchpad to control the volume is a bit annoying but not a deal-breaker.Sound quality is similar to the Bose NC headphones. Comfort and sound quality way better than Beats, Skull Candy, or practically any other popular brands. Cost is pretty steep but well worth it"
57,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never been a fan of Bose telling you what things should sound like. These sonys are solid, they shut off the outside world and the bluetooth works perfectly with my Android, IOS, and PC devices."
58,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's all about sound and these headphones provide the best sound I've heard in any headphones. It also has so many features, but it's not the features that make these headphones the best. Whether they all hold up over time is another story and the only thing I don't like is the internal battery can't be replaced. Still the sound is amazing."
59,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These cans put out the kind of enveloping sound that transports even an audiophile into a new realm. I hear brand new sounds even in old favorite tunes. There are more controls than you ever thought you needed in a pair of headphones. Controls are easy to master AND they make meaningful differences to your music. I compared them directly with the Bose 35. The Sonys matched or exceeded them in every category except comfort. (The Bose go around the ear while the Sonys are on-the-ear.) Still, I listen without a problem for hours at a time. One of the best audio purchases I've ever made."
60,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic for listening to music, making calls, and travelling. I'm slightly disappointed with the software though, I tried to use with my computer via bluetooth and there are two audio options, one for stereo sound and one for headset sound. In my experience I could only use one of these at a time, so you can't play games in stereo sound for hearing footsteps and also be on Skype or Discord at the same time. Tried some troubleshooting and tinkering but haven't yet been able to get around it. Other than that - these headphones are absolutely fantastic! Incredibly comfortable (more so than any other headset I've tried on), music quality is perfect, noise cancelling is great, and the ambient sound feature works great (albeit maybe more of a gimmick than something I'll use, but who cares!)."
61,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so glad I chose this over the Bose. This has good bass, great sound (more balanced than Bose, which seems to be treble-heavy). Like the phone app which gives you plenty of control. The finger and hand controls are easy to get used to. Battery life is spectacular! The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is it is a little heavy, so your head and neck need to adapt to the weight. You will feel some fatigue the first few days."
62,5.0 out of 5 stars,This has been one of the best head phone with noise cancelling I have ever owned.
63,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound very good. The noise canceling is very effective, capable of turning construction sounds (in the next room) into background noise. They are very comfortable. The gesture controls are easy to use and the listening feature is extremely convenient. I have had a pair for several months now and I only have positive comments. Great for music, videos, or gaming."
64,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to agree with the other reviews here that these are the best noise canceling headphones of 2017. Heck I'd say they are the best I've ever used!.
The quality is really high and the case it comes in is very good as well.
The sound is next level. You hear things in your music you just couldn't hear before.
I bought an extended warranty on these since there were alot of reviews saying the plastic is a bit fragile.
But all in all 5 stars."
66,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only two downsides to these are that you can't disable the beeps that play when you use the touch controls and you can't use the touch controls while wired. Takes a bit to get used to the location of play/pause buy once you do the headphones are great. Great sound, great noise isolation, great comfort for long term wear, great all around."
67,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loving it. I came from a dead Bose Quiet Comfort 3 and the noise canceling is much better. And it has bluetooth, works when off as long as it is plugged and feels awesome and comfort."
68,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely expensive, but they are the best, and better than the Bose I tried of the same type. Very comfortable and easy to use, and the noise cancelling doesn't pressurize ears much at all, far better than others. the sound quality is the best also, pretty transparent sound, no problems, but its still really expensive for wireless headphones, I hope the market drops it down to around 150 soon, 350 is ridiculous."
69,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought those 6 months ago in gold, a few weeks later they showed black discoloration on the outside of the Headphone and on the cable. I called Amazon suppprt who forwarded me to Sony Customer Service. Sony does not view the product design or accessories like the case (which most likely caused the discoloration) as part of the product to acknowledge it as a defect and refuses to replace them. Good job Sony, I'm going back to buying Bose and only Bose!"
70,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Stylish design and sound so good. Has a gooud noise cancenling that I can't even here airplane passing by to where I am staying. And best of all, one of the top bluetooth noise canceling headphones on battery. You can even use it in off mode with the aux cable"
71,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read the reviews on Amazon, and I also researched this product on Youtube reviews. I was surprised to read and hear that the Sony WH1000XM2s are supposed to be better than the Bose 35 II. I just received my order and have been using them to my satisfaction. They block out ambient noise far better than I expected. The SENSE engine makes a huge difference over its competitors. The optimizer adds another layer of quality to the noise cancellation feature. I highly recommend these."
72,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Performed unbelievably in the noise cancelation department. I had previously owed a Bose QC20 and the Sony is at least equal or better than the Bose. Plus, it has a much longer battery life. Given that it's at least $50 cheaper than the Bose, it's a no-brainer purchase."
73,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. Was in between the Bose quiet comfort 35 and this one. My main concern was if it was as comfortable since I couldn’t get to try it on. On the reviews the quality of sound and the newer technology it offers was clearly much more superior to Bose in my opinion. Since I started using it in terms of comfort I am very happy. It is quiet light and can be used for very long hours. So in my opinion this is the best wireless noise canceling headphone you can get.
74,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased both this and the Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II to compare the two. I liked that the Sony has an interactive app that shows me how it's calculating the noise cancelling (and it is noticeably improved after the calculation). The app also lets you choose different equalizer settings, including custom settings, which I like because I have hearing loss and I could customize it to my exact hearing needs. The controls are pretty slick, just swiping on the side of the earcup instead of hunting for a button. The sound quality of the music is excellent.

However, here is why I ultimately chose the Bose, and it comes down to two things. Noise cancelling, and advanced sound processing. Re Noise cancellation, I recorded myself in the voice memo app on my phone using the both sets of headphones as the recording device. This simulates what someone would hear when I called them on the phone using the headphones. The noise cancelling in the Bose was excellent, and I only heard my voice. With the Sony, I could hear background noise. The Bose playback sounded like I was talking using a handset, and the Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone.

The Bose iPhone app does not let you calculate anything, and it does not have an equalizer. At first this annoyed me, and then I realized that the Bose was calculating the levels for each song to produce the best sound, so I didn't have to use an equalizer.

Also, when you're wearing the Sony, they are bulky and look geeky on. The Bose is more streamlined to the head. I personally find the Bose more comfortable on over glasses. The Sony seems to have some clamping to shut out the sound, and this is not comfortable over glasses. The Bose has very soft earcups and relies on the noise cancellation instead of physically clamping down on your ears."
75,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphone is great, noise canceling works very well. The sound quality is perfect!"
77,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first time for using noise cancelling headphones, no more comparison ,as every function includes the quality of music, ease of operation, interface looking,time of battery and so on, is amazing for me. If you want it just to focus on working at any noisy places, like me, it will definitely be the priority tool for you after you play music on it. It provides you a new world.
However, my mac cannot be connected with it, which actually is not easy to us since I need to handle the wire. Maybe there is something wrong with my setting.
Since I live in Australia, no more judgement about the shipping. I just get a perfect product as the first time I use amazon. What a great experience!"
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To begin with, this review is for the XM2 model. You may see two of these Sony Premium Noise Cancelling Headphones listed on Amazon and wonder what the difference is. The XM2 is the newest model for this year and is built with newer materials. Sony may have addressed the headband cracking issue of the previous model in this release. That is not certain, but complaint(s) seem to be very limited on that issue.

I have been wearing noise cancelling headphones for a very long time. Have tried many other brands including Bose and Audio-Technica. The Audio-Technica noise-cancelling headphones are quite good, but outdated technology wise. As for Bose -- some of you may know this already -- but they are generally not a good brand. Most of their innovation costs go into advertising how great their speakers and headphones are rather than into the product itself. The current QC35 headphones are pretty darn good, but I ended up returning them once I heard these Sony headphones.

By far, these are the most advanced and best sounding noise cancelling headphones for the price.

Setup is extremely easy. For my iPhone and iPad, I simply downloaded Sony's companion app which walked me through the setup process. To fully explain how painless it is to start using these headphones out of the box, let me say that I didn't even bother to open the instruction book and instead relied on the app. Even if I didn't use the app, you can pair these headphones with mostly any device by long-pressing the power button.

What I found rather neat is that the headphones have voice prompts which tell you when they are powered on or off, or when connected or disconnected.

The noise-cancelling is as good or better than the Bose or Audio-Technica where it eliminates approximately 95% of ambient noise. You will never obtain complete silence while just wearing the headphones, but once you start playing music, the ambient noise is completely eliminated, thus immersing you completely into the listening experience.

Two terrific features as far as gestures are concerned....

While using the headphones, you can temporarily turn off the noise canceling while cupping your hand over one of the headphones. This allows you to carry on a conversation with someone. Remove your hand and the noise-canceling resumes.

For iOS users, take your finger and press it against one of the headphone cups and Siri automatically activates so you can issue a command.

By the way, the Sony headphones easily paired with my Macbook Pro and iMac.

Music sounds spectacular. The highs are present without being overblown. The bass is present while not being too exaggerated. You don't get that ""muddy"" sound that cheaper headphones provide.

The headphones arrive in a nice oval case along with a USB charging and separate headphone connecting cord.

I realize that some may be concerned about the reports of headphone band cracking that was reported on the previous model. This was a concern of mine as well. Looking at this new model, the complaints of cracking seem to be very rare and if you look further into them via an Internet search, perhaps limited to a specific individual who is repeating the complaints on many sites. I don't want to fully make that accusation as I am not completely certain, but I was just not able to get a substantial amount of evidence to back up the claims of this model having headband issues. Sony has stated that this new model is made of newer materials and I am assuming it was done to address the problems of the prior model.

Let's just say that I have seen no cracking issues with my headphones.

THESE are the ultimate noise-cancelling headphones. Do not hesitate to pick these over other brands. You will be amazed by their performance."
79,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Noise cancellation is great, they are comfy and sound quality is good when connected via cable.
There is a strange issue with volume being a bit too low when connected to bluetooth."
80,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Noise cancellation - which is the reason i bought these- turns itself off every 15 min. Allegedly, a ‘feature’ by design. Returning them - and buying Bose."
81,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To start with, I am not fans of this type of headphones, because most of them are big and not so handy, plus my ears would hurt after wearing for more than 15 minutes. However, when I saw this product in a store, and tried it on, I knew that this is the headphone I am looking for. The headband is not as tight I think, and super comfortable to wear. The noise cancellation functions well and on-point. The only thing I will complain is the pairing problem with my Macbook pro, though it works perfectly well with my Iphone. My laptop can't recognize the bluebooth of the headphone. Does anybody have a similar problem?"
82,2.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones had a constant static sound when the noise cancelling was turned on. The static could be heard over the music. Very annoying when no music was playing. Called Sony customer support and they had me do some trouble shooting and resetting the headphones. Nothing helped Sony advised returning for an exchange or refund.
83,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These pairs completely met my expectations, they are just amazing!
I'm Using them more than a month and no issues with them, yet. The only thing that is missing here is connecting to more than one device at a time, in order I do not have to connect every time when I switch from my laptop to phone. But the pros are so much that I can close my eyes on that. Worth the many. Definitely 5 stars."
84,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise concealing works very good, and is better, in my opinion, than Bose QC35 that my friend has. The sound quality is not as good as the wired Hi-res headphones made by sony at the same price, but it's the best you can expect for a wireless headphones, especially with ldac turned on (which is now supported by all the phones with Android 8). And there's no cracking issues that the old version used to have any more. And the app is also pretty good."
85,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These were so close to being great, but... First, although advertised as multipoint (able to maintain 2 Bluetooth connections simultaneously), they don't. They can make an audio connection with one device and simultaneously a phone connection with another, but they cannot make two audio connections at the same time. If, like me, you want to connect with a tablet (for, say, YouTube videos) and a phone (for, say, music and phone calls), you're out of luck. For a device at this price point, that's just too big a flub to tolerate. Second, the Android headphones app seems to choke on these (at least when connecting to a Sony smartphone). Products from the same company that don't play well together? Really? Anyway, the audio quality is very good (though not stellar) and the controls on the ear are nifty. But, in my book, that's not nearly enough to make up for the botched multipoint functionality."
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had two choices, the WH1000XM2 and the Bose QC35II. I chose Sony because of the suite of features that it had over Bose. Additionally, other reviewers said the bass was strong (they were right), which became the main selling point for me.

Having listened to these headphones for myself, I can say with full confidence that I made the correct decision."
88,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first review I've ever left and listen..to say these headphones changed my life is an understatement..Years later I will look to this moment as the defining breaking point in my life and I will say to myself ""I would have paid any amount of money for those dang things"""
89,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an old time audiophile, with over 20k lossless tracks — but I also travel a lot, so I need NC (noise canceling).
Using a carefully selected range of FLAC tracks, through a decent DAC, I tried all the top-ranked over-ear and in-year NC systems, of every brand I could get my hands on — but below $400, that's just my psychological limit for headphones.
My head and ears are normal size.

Pros:
These cans had the best balance between noise canceling and audio quality, hands down. There's just no comparison. Especially the active calibration is very useful in planes with ""particular"" engine sounds. I fly overseas (long flights) and use them for 7-8 hours without problems. I much prefer these to the Boses available in Executive/First class.

Cons:
The over-ear Boses (only comparable NC) feel smaller and lighter, and somewhat more comfortable. And of course, there are a bunch of great, more neutral, more audiophile cans out there.

Overall, strongly recommended."
90,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very expensive headphone but the noise cancellation works perfectly, We compare the headphone with Bose QuiteComfort 35, which is in the same price range, Sony works much better. If you are in a noisy environment, this is the headphone for you."
91,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A bit pricey, but worth every penny. Beautiful sound, great construction, flexible controls, great battery life...very satisfied!!"
92,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounding headphones with excellent noise cancelling. Like them better than the Boses. But the experience of making and answering phone calls is not great, with the person on the other side often reporting poor sound quality."
93,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing headphones. I tried the Bose QC35 initially, and they were good...but I just love the sound quality on these much more."
94,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good. I'm still trying to get it to work seamlessly with phone calls (operator error, no doubt.) Noise cancellation seems pretty good. I was torn between this unit and the comparable Bose. I have no complaints at this juncture."
95,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After all the Utube and amazon reviews I decided to buy these instead of the Bose CQ35II. I liked the features of the headphones over the other brand. I've use the older version of the bose and loved them so much I wanted some bluetooth ones. I did a lot of research and read/watched reviews. Now only a few days later and I need to return them.

Pros-
1) Very good noise cancelling when listening to music or watching videos.
2) Great features like mute, ANC sensitivity, app, and gesture controls.
3) Battery life.

Cons-
1) White noise. I got white noise when not listening to anything. I got even more white noise when not listening to anything and plugged in with the cable.
2) Ears got warm. Couldn't keep these on longer then a couple of hours before becoming uncomfortable. I've used bose for 15-18 hours without problems.
3) Besides my ears getting warm, the headphones are a little tight on my head. Could tell if that's why I got headaches or the white noise.
4) My ears also touched the inside of the cups. There isn't a lot of room inside the cups for your ears.

Conclusion-
I want $350 headphones to be comfortable and not get hot. The features are great but I want comfort too. I guess bose had the correct name for their product . . . it's in the name.

Hope this helps someone and thank you for reading."
96,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound and noise cancelling capabilities. Right side earphone functionality on these headphones is great!! Swipe your finger in different directions to achieve different results. My coworker has Bose and I think these are better.
97,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been eyeing the 1000x for a while now, having only ever used (on a daily basis) IEMs due to having thick hair and glasses. I finally decided to try it out, even though the in-store units I tried on were quite frankly terrible. I was very surprised, pleasantly so. The adaptive sound or sense engine works extremely well, exceeding my experience with the Bose QC35 and Bose QC20. For the QC35, I primarily could just not get a good seal and had sound leaking in as a result. I am very pleased with the sound quality, comfort, and noise cancellation ability of the WH-1000XM2. It doesn't blow anything out of the water if you have previously owned any Bose ANC unit, but it is an improvement in every way but one (including the touch-interface, which far outstrips the Bose units in ease of use).

The microphone quality is absolutely horrendous. The moment I attempted to
call someone, they muted me and told me I sounded like an incarnation of death and white noise. I thought it might just be an exaggeration, but after recording myself using the unit and the phone microphone, I can safely say that the WH-1000XM2's outbound voice quality is on par with an extremely cheap knockoff one could find at a dollar store. I am not sure if it is a defect or what, but I was definitely disappointed that one of the marketable features was not remotely serviceable in a completely silent room. Still, I didn't buy it for the microphone, and the rest of the features that this headphone comes with is well worth the price."
99,3.0 out of 5 stars,They’re alright. Not worth 300 or 350. Uncomfortable and not that loud. Noise cancelling is good. I believe Bose is better like everyone is sayin. I wanted to go against whatever was saying and purchase these because I don’t like Bose as a company. Let down. Oh well.
100,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best headphones I've ever owned. Noise canceling is great and has lots of different features. The Bluetooth functionality is equally impressive. Finally, the 30-hour battery life is ridiculous. 10/10 would go deaf again."
101,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous! I tried both and I'm glad I got Sony. You decide for yourself
102,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything I expected from wireless headphones and more. To be fair, I've never had any before now, but it's a really good quality of life addition. I use them every day at my open office job and I can't recommend them enough"
103,5.0 out of 5 stars,Had the Sennheiser and they served me well for years - started flying more and began to notice the need for better noise cancelling - the isolation and clarity are excellent - just hope I don't break them trying to fold them up!
104,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great noice cancelling headphones. Changed my flights completely - now I get way less tired during the flights. The internal microphone has some quirks when using the headphones in a loud place (cafe, airport). Also the headphones keep switching to ambient sound after some time from noice cancelling mode (maybe it's a feature, which I don't know how to turn off)."
105,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Changed my life! with noise cancelling on, I can barely hear the keyboard sound as I'm typing now. Not mentioning that I can't head the sound of the loud fan on my server. Very high quality product and top notch technology as you'll expect from Sony!"
106,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound and comfort are next level... spend the money and you won't regret it. I am a die hard JBL sound guy and it pains me to say that Sony has everyone far far far behind
107,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have purchased many head phones over the years. These have to be one of my favorite pairs. The sound quality is great both with Bluetooth or with the cable. I travel a lot so my favorite feature is defiantly the optimizer function. This makes a major deference when flying and it seems to help with change in pressure. Also having the gesture sensor on the ear makes turning up the music or changing the song very convenient.
108,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent noise cancelling. Cancels the humming noise in Airplane and makes life a bit easy on long duration flights. Cancels background noise while on phone call. Bose won't do that. Comfortable on my ears even for 9+ hours.
110,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would have given these headphones 4 stars (since the quality is pretty decent), except the customer service is absolutely horrendous! We have had a problem with the audio cord right out of the gate. It looks perfect, but whatever we plug it into the sounds was very muffled and crackly. Very annoying. We were just looking for a simple replacement of the defective cord from Sony since they are still under warranty, but have been trying to no avail for months! They will put you on hold for more than an hour, and when/if they answer, they pretend they can't help. It is obvious Sony has outsourced their support overseas., and these people haven't a clue or a care to help customers. This will be my last Sony product."
111,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cant get over how much i love these headphones. So comfortable and stylish. Great for working in a noisy office, especially with the feature that allows you to listen to your surroundings"
112,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical about buying this headphone because of the reviews I've read that' it's uncomfortable and hot compared to Bose QC 35. But I needed a new headphone that I could take on my two 14 hrs flight and two 8 hrs flight this December. According to reviews, Bose's noise cancelling is not that good and can give you headache. I have Bose soundlink on ear wireless headphone but I don't want it anymore because that one really makes my ears hot. I received this headphone yesterday and I wore it straight 5 hrs. I was blown away! So comfortable, it did not make my ears hot, the sound is crisp and the built-in touch control is so convenient. And I like it that I can control the equalizer and surround sound on my iPhone. I still have to try the other features. But for now I'm very happy with my purchase. Highly recommended."
113,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones work very well (hence, the 4 stars), but the ""gold"" is in no way gold. The cups are dark beige (matte, not even metallic) and the band is more of a metallic copper. I am extremely disappointed with the color of the ""gold"" headphones. Stick to black.

The photo shows the gold-tipped cord next to the headphones. They're clearly not gold."
114,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was able to compare the noise cancelling directly to the Bose QC35 ii because my office has a noisy lab and bought one of the Bose headsets for every workstation basically. The noise cancelling itself, at least after adaptation, is as good as the Bose. It's probably not better, but it still has a leg-up on the Bose due to the better passive noise cancelling. Just wearing these block out more of the high frequencies (passed the ANC range), so these end up being noticeably better.

They're very comfortable, priced $50 less than the Bose, stylish, lightweight, lots of features. I would definitely recommend these over the Bose assuming it doesn't have the headband cracking issue that the MDR-1000x had. So far I haven't seen nearly as many reports of headband cracking on these.

One thing I wish they'd done something about was the ability to avoid pressing the touch controls when moving the headset on and off your head. That can get annoying if you're not careful. Now that I'm aware of the flaw it's pretty easy to avoid though.

Be aware that these headphones don't support simultaneous bluetooth devices. You'll have to manually disconnect from one before connecting with the other. That's not a big deal for me since I'll only want to use these with my phone, and god forbid I'd have to hold the bluetooth icon in the notification shade to bring up the bluetooth settings (NFC is overrated for the same reason).

The last thing to mention is the difference in Bluetooth codec between the Bose and Sony. Bose supports only AAC as a high-def codec, whereas Sony supports LDAC (of course) and AptX (thank god). Check the hi-def codecs your device supports before choosing a headset."
115,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Some of the best headphones on the market. Great sound,and amazing when playing on suround sound mode."
116,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, they are better than advertised, easy to setup and use the hand jesters are awesome! They connect up to my iPhone 8+ and iPad with out any issues and they work perfectly. Highly recommend these the NC is amazing and sound quality is work every penny."
117,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tested these and the Bose QC35 2 in store and there is a sound difference. Sony has definitely dethroned Bose. Base is sharp and and vivid with no distortion. The neat little touch sensitive controls are awesome and super intuitive, especially the cupping to hear exterior noise. Definitely glad I got these over the Bose. Also Google assistant works beautifully on it, so not losing out anything by not getting the QCs"
118,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Advantages:
- Great sound Quality
- awesome noise cancellation (Better than BOSE)
- Comfort
- casing
- no cabin pressure feeling ""after 2 days"".

Disadvantages:
- Can't connect to more than 1 device at the same time.
- BOSE QC35 II is more comfortable while wearing it."
119,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These. Are. Awesome.

Amazing sound, amazing battery life, great noise canceling. Some of the features are a bit questionable, and I don't like the lag/pause when they switch modes ... plus the app eats too much battery life on my phone. So ... I just don't use it much and I'm back to what's great about these. Also, quite comfortable, if a bit bulky.

HIGHLY recommended."
121,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At least once an hour, my heart swells with joy when a really great song hits a particular high point and these puppies just absolutely NAIL delivering it to me. At least once a day, I fight the urge to burst into song and/or dance in the middle of a grocery store or other public place. I am now immersed in music 10 hours a day, and the battery life means I never run out of juice so long as I throw them on the charger before bed every couple of days. Also the noise cancelling is unreal, and the touch controls are awesome, but the real ""we live in future times"" moment comes when you flip to ambient mode and have a conversation with them on while it kills every sound in the room EXCEPT for the person's voice who you're talking to. Jeezy Petes! What wizardry is that!?

Buy these headphones. They're future wizards you wear on your ears basically."
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything everyone says about them are true.

They're amazing.

I got them for $300 (when they're usually $350) so I'm ecstatic."
123,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best headphones money can buy! NC is our of this world.. The customization app is really cool.

Only downside is the High Res Audio is currently only supported on iOS and Oreo devices..."
124,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this headphone..much better in noise reduction than their previous headset. It’s so good that when I’m wearing it in the train..I keep missing my stop..haha.
125,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, they are amazing. The controls are incredible. If you can afford it, get them."
126,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these because I have a small yappy dog, a preschooler, a snoring spouse and a long day of work that involves people talking to me. So, the thought of coming home and putting these bad boys on was like a dream. They arrived and I was so excited. While at first aprehensive of the color (Gold), I totally fell in love with them. I immediately took them out of the package and noticed they had some charge. Awesome! Put them on and all I could hear was the equivalent of the winds of a mountain top, the gentle breeze of being on a beach, or the tranquil silence of camping under the desert stars. Then it happend, I started getting nauseated. The feeling of dizziness and sickness came over me. That's right folks, I'm one of those people who apparently can't handle the loss of external neural input when wearing these. I basically felt ""sea sick"" each time I put them on. Over and over, I tried them on and off because my denial was fierce. Eventually, I had to give in and choose to accept my defeat. I cannot own a pair of noise cancelling earphones. Instead, I'm doing well with the Skull Candy noise isolating (not cancelling) headphones. Not as awesome, but a good runner up to getting some peace and quiet."
127,5.0 out of 5 stars,Noise cancelling is superb with minimal effect on the awesome sound quality. The clarity & soundstage is excellent. Long time comfort wonderful also. Battery life v good. Buttons take a little time to master but nothing major. Sony has really got it right with these gems. Recommend 100%!
128,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones. Easy to use, pair, and connect to Samsung TV. (Bose would not connect consistently) Noice-cancelling works well. Appreciable stereo sound"
129,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm starting to hear the cracking sounds from the left side of the head band (from the point where the previous models have been cracking). Also, sometimes, the headphones start producing ticking sounds in the audio. It then needs to be turned off and restarted to get this fixed for a while."
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Sound and Options. It Keeps me Dancing :D
132,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Switched from the Bose QC35 II to these. These are hands down the better headphones.

I will say that the Bose QC35 is more comfortable. The ear cups are softer and seem to provide a little more space. That being said, these are by no means uncomfortable and I wear them 6+ hours per day.

The touch controls are great, the battery life is awesome, the bluetooth range is at LEAST 3X that of the Bose. They support higher quality protocols, the noise cancelling is better in my opinion. All good stuff. Definitely worth the few extra dollars.

To Sony: I really wish the LEDs could be optionally disabled via the app."
133,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing—and expensive. After much research and debate, I decided, if I were going to get a pair of noise cancelling, I would get a pair that was the best at it. My choice came down to the WH1000, MDR1000 or QC35. Through my research, most reviews seem to favor both Sonys over the QC35 for noise cancelling. And, noise cancelling is most important to me. Again, through my research online, not hands-on, the Sony’s and QC35 are fairly comparable with only a slight edge to Sony. With my choice narrowed to either the WH1000 or the MDR1000, I ultimately chose the WH1000 because of what I read about potential creaking with the MDR1000. I could not get a sense of how wide spread the issue was so I decided to just go with the newer version and hope for the best.

The noise-cancelling is outstanding. I initially put them on in my office with no audio and someone taking a call just outside my office. I put them on my ears, turned on the NC feature, and all outside noise ceased. Im fortunate enough to have an office directly by a door that frequently opens and closes, people walk by quite often, the office AC is fairly loud and drones, and people often take calls at their desk. With no audio and NC active, I hear almost nothing. By “almost” I mean, I hear only voices occasionally but they sound like a barely audible mumble. With audio playing at roughly 40% to 50%, I hear absolutely nothing. I had someone talk normally just beside me—I couldn’t hear them. I snapped my fingers directly beside my ear—I couldn’t hear it at all.

I wear these off and on throughout my work day for a total of about 6 hours in the office. With my attention on work and listening to audio, I forgot all about them being on. They are comfortable and I had no problem wearing them for long periods of time. The ear pads are soft and my ears didn’t get hot.

I will end by saying, if noise cancelling is what you are looking for, these are excellent. I'm not a big audiophile. To me, the audio either sounds good enough or bad. These sound just fine to me."
134,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound amazing, and the noise cancelling is top notch. However, the tops of my ears start hurting after only 30 minutes to 1 hour of use. It's because the cups are shallow enough that my ears touch the foam protecting the driver. It gets bad enough that I have to take them off for a while. Re-adjusting them doesn't help. I really wanted to like these headphones, but I want something that I can wear for many hours without having discomfort."
135,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphones are the most expensive I have bought but still I think it was a good purchase, the Sound is great (Even better when you use the Bluetooth and the Sony App) and are confortable. The noise cancelling is great I haven't compared to other headphones like Bose but I have read a lot of reviews were they say the noise cancelling technology is better.

The apps let's you customize your headphones, disable, enable and optimize the noise cancelling, change the equalizer and change the sound quality.

The touch control on the right side of the headphones are quite confusing at first, but they work great once you get use to them. The battery life is great and you can use the headphones with the jack and you don't need to turn them on in order to hear music(unless you want to use the noise cancelling).

The only CONS I found for this product was the price."
136,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I guess I'd give these 4.5 stars if I could, because there are a couple of annoying issues with them. But having played them a lot over the last few days since receiving them, here are my thoughts in the hope that this may be helpful for someone like me, who is not an expert in anything. But I do enjoy music quite a lot.

Sound - 5 stars. This is what matters most, and this is what is the most subjective. That being said, I've owned quite a few headphones and earbuds over the years, and I am really enjoying these. To me, Bose products are somewhat overrated, and these sound better than the QuietComforts to my ears anyway. Of course the sound can't match high-end wired headphones connected to expensive output equipment, but considering that these are going without the wires, it's very hard for me to find fault with them. Warm overall sound, very good clarity, nice even bass without distortion. Excellent.

Build quality - 5 stars. They look and feel very solid. I got the gold ones, which are really more of a tan color, but really nice. Kept in the hard case that comes with them, I believe they will last a long time.

Comfort - 3 stars. After about an hour, they start to hurt my ears somewhat. That's been my experience to some extent with every pair I've owned, but hopefully I will get used to them over time. I find myself adjusting them quite a bit to get more comfortable. The ear cups are pretty tight, which obviously helps with:

Sound Isolation - 5 stars. My gym has a lot of noise, but these block out about 90% of it. I haven't been on a plane with them yet, but I think they will be just fine.

Features - 4.5 stars. I like being able to control everything by touching the sides of the headphones. But the right side volume, pausing, and skip ahead functions are very sensitive and take some getting used to. The two buttons on the left ear cup are small and hard to find by touching them, frequently causing me to hit the wrong one. The app (at least for the iPhone) has a lot of functionality, and I really like the customizable equalizer. That really makes a big difference for me. There are lots of other things (everything pretty much) that you can do from the app. Pretty cool. Other reviewers have mentioned problems with the app, but not me. There are lots of other features that are of questionable value to me personally (sound position, atmospheric pressure, virtual sound, etc.), but may be useful to others. As far as technology goes, these seem to be way up there.

Bluetooth/Pairing 4.5 stars. It pairs very easily to up to eight devices. The range is very good also. I live in a pretty decent size single level house, and I can go anywhere with no signal degradation. Even outside, I can wander pretty far, no problem on the porch or outside deck for example. However, switching from one device to another is an unnecessary pain. You should be able to connect to two devices at a time. Minus a half star for that.

Battery - 5 stars. So far, so good. After 10 to 15 hours, battery level is still ""medium"".

For a long time I put off getting wireless headphones, fearing that I would have to sacrifice sound quality for convenience. Now you can have the best of both worlds."
137,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are researching which noise cancelling headphones, let me save you the time because I've already done it for you. I was first sold on the Bose Quiet Comfort QC35 II's. In fact, I wasn't really aware there was a solid competitor, nevertheless a superior product. But like any of my other tech/gadget purchases I spend hours reading reviews, watching YouTube reviews, etc. It wasn't until I started my research that I even knew Sony had a direct competitor for the Bose QC's. In fact about 9 out of every 10 reviews rated the Sony's either just a step above if not dead even with the Bose. Most all of the reviews stated that the only area they found the Bose to be superior was in comfort (they are a bit lighter and the design of the ear cups don't tend to make your ears as warm,) FULL DISCLOSURE: I have tried the Bose on in the store but not side by side with the Sony. So while I may not be qualified to do a true head to head comparison in my personal opinion (I have used both, just not at the same time), the research I have done all points to the Sony.

Now, on to what I can tell you about them after using them. #1 - the touch function on the ear cup is pretty cool. I plan to primarily use these in the yard while mowing/edging/etc and being able to reach up quickly and up the volume or change to the next track with a quick swipe is pretty nice. The fewer times I have to reach in my pocket to find my phone and change things the better. Yes... Bose has buttons that do this... but having the touchpad to me is a bit easier without having to learn/know where the specific buttons are at all times. #2 - the ""pause and listen"" function is outstanding. When using them, if you cup your hand over the right ear cup, the noise cancelling ends and the mic turns on to allow you to hear outside noise. This is great if I'm working in the yard and stop to talk to a neighbor or the wife for something brief. Obviously for an entire conversation I'd just pause them and take them off, but just being able to hear something quickly and let go and go back to action to me is an awesome feature. #3 - the ambient noise settings/adjustments are great. The headphones can sense your activity (idle, walking, running, etc) and will adjust for ambient noise accordingly. You can also have the headphones focus on speech and drown out other ambient noise. I tested this feature out while the wife was watching TV. Its strange to not hear the sounds of cars and other usual noises but hear them talking well. I found that I could no longer hear the dishwasher running or background noise on the TV, but as soon as my wife said something or a character on TV spoke, I could hear it perfectly. I don't wear headphones at work, but I imagine in an office setting this would be really nice.

I'm really looking forward to a day in the yard with mowers running and edgers and trimmers and just being able to listen to my favorite music instead. I'm used to having in earbuds that pull out of my ears if I turn my head too quickly. I'm excited to use these moving forward!"
138,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for noise cancelling for 2 main reasons(among other reasons) 1. Travel to my work deployment assignments, 2. Use them as a work tool/protection for my ears.
I do contracting work for the military so wherever they go i have to go. Having said this... Military planes are not built for comfort(or quietness)and if you've been inside of a C17 or C5 aircraft then you know that cabin noise is huge (they're not quiet at all), you literally have to yell to the person next to you if you want to converse. Also working in aviation field with jets coming in and out every couple of hours will hurt your ears. Add to this that you're trying to relax or sleep in your tent and now you have noisy neighbors..etc..
I also have an above normal loud car (custom exhaust) so this is where I tested my Sony WH1000XM2.
While driving my car to work (loud exhaust,floor sound deadening removed, no a/c so widows slightly down and air noise also coming in) I decided to test these headphones with the Noise Cancelling on and OH MY!! What a sweet difference! I could comfortably drive and listen to music and it felt like I was in a quiet room. I could only feel the vibration of the car and the road feedback as I drove but absolutely no noise. Even with the loud exhaust I could even use Google assist thru the headphones to activate apps such as IHeart radio or even just say an address to navigate and it did it with no problem and without me having to take my hands off the steering wheel. I have also made phone calls thru the headphones while driving and also while just walking around and the quality, detail of voice in the calls is impressive.
I used the Sony phone app to adjust the ambient sound levels I want to let in just so that I can listen to music but still want to be able to hear outside voices. Just as I am typing this review I am sitting at the car dealer(with my headphone on and listening to music) servicing my wife's car and the service advisor has come twice to speak to me and I have been able to hear him with no problem and with the headphones on. It's truly amazing! I really love these headphones!

In terms of comfort I honestly don't have any complaints. I guess I must have smaller ears because they absolutely feel very comfortable even after an hour of use I don't feel any discomfort to where I feel like taking a break from them. My ears dont feel weird because of the NC. I've heard mixed reviews about this and how people change the ear pads to make them better but in my case I feel they're excellent.
The headband part is also cushioned and does not brothers me at all even after an hour or two of wearing them.

Sound quality. I think these headphones are very well balanced. Voices and guitars sound so clean, crisp and defined(I listen to all types of music). Bass levels and drum punch is just right from factory settings. I did play with the different EQ adjustments (Arena, Club, Concert Hall.. etc) on the Sony app and I think factory settings are on point. I think i just added 1 or 2 notches on the Bass and thats it. I have been able to really hear/distinguish more detail in my everyday music (same songs) that i didnt know it was there. It's like ...where did those Instruments or where did those riffs came on? I had never heard that in that song.. it's really satisfying.

So far I've used these headphones for about 7 days and I am still on my initial charge. Use has been aprox 2 hrs each day and when i press on the battery level check it still says battery level high. I haven't used them 100% on noise cancelling though, maybe that has to do with how long the battery lasts."
139,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones partly because I wanted a new pair of nice headphones, and partly because I had a 17 hour international flight coming up. They do not disappoint on either front.

The sound quality is wonderful. I would encourage you to go to a physical store to compare these to the competition. Compared to the Bose Quiet Comfort 35 and Bowers and Wilkins PX, this was the pair that I fell in love with.

They are also remarkably comfortable. I don't think I have ever had a pair of headphones fit so well. Even after wearing them almost non-stop for the entire flight, I felt virtually no strain on my head.

Speaking of that flight? I had a small child sitting behind me, which is usually a recipe for disaster. I didn't hear him once, and it wasn't because he was well behaved (I knew when he was throwing tantrums because I would feel him kicking my seat, not because I could hear him.) So on top of the excellent audio quality, the noise cancelling is also top notch.

I am stopping short of 5 stars because of the weird Bluetooth pairing. You can only pair with one device at a time, which means if you want to switch between devices you have to go into your Bluetooth settings and manually disconnect, or shut the headphones off and restart them in pairing mode. Compared to every other pair of Bluetooth headphones I have owned, this is draconian. In addition, if you plug the headphones in to charge, they shut off and you cannot pair them with anything until you stop charging them. I don't know if the analog cable still works while charging, but it's kind of an annoying drawback.

However, once you are connected there are 0 issues. The connection is very strong; I can comfortably walk into another room 40 or 50 feet away from my iPhone and not have any drops. The battery is excellent, even with wireless and noise cancelling on. They lasted the entire flight + layovers without any problem, with some breaks in between (probably at least 20 hours of use.) They seem to charge quickly as well.

The carrying case is a nice touch, it's very sturdy and I never worried about the safety of the headphones while they were getting backpacked around Thailand. All in all I'd say do your homework, but if you buy these headphones you won't be disappointed."
140,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I spend a lot of time traveling and wanted a good pair of ANC headphones. I’ve used the Bose QC 35’s in the past, and although those were quite good, positive reviews from friends led me to want to try the 1000XM2s.

For long-haul flights, these are a godsend. As I write this, I just out of a 23 hour travel experience, and I wore these headphones for the majority of my 3 flights. The battery lasted the entire time (and ANC was on), and I still show 20% battery (though, I imagine it’s a bit closer to 10%), and I was playing music or video for the vast majority of the trip.

At first I thought the “cup the right ear to pause/turn off ANC” would be a gimmick, but when trying to listen for announcements on the plane or in the airport, it was really useful.

I’m also a big fan of the control gestures on the right side. I have AirPods that I use for my general wireless usage (walking around/commuting to work), and the double-tap to pause/play action is identical. I also appreciate there being an easy way to skip/reverse tracks and to raise and lower volumes.

I typically don’t bother with third-party apps for EQ stuff, but out of boredom I was messing with it this trip and found that tuning the settings can give off great results. That said, I was very satisfied with the audio quality as-is.

The feature that allows the ANC to balance based on air pressure/altitude seemed to be really good, but that could just be placebo.

Speaking of ANC, it’s jusf fantastic. I know there are some complaints about it turning off when not in use (you have to plug something into the line-out to keep it active), but since I prefer my own traveling playlist over white noise, this hasn’t been an issue for me. Needless to say, the crying baby sitting two rows behind me in my 10-hour return flight from São Paulo to the United States didn’t bother me, which was nothing shirt of a miracle.

The included carrying case is great. Just don’t do what I did and leave it someplace in an airport in Brazil. Song does sell replacement parts, but they are expensive, relatively speaking ($60 for a case, $35 for a color-marched headphone cable). That’s my fault for leaving them, not Sony’s, but I thought I’d mention it.

Connectivity with my iPhone X and iPad Pro was great. It also works perfectly with my Apple Watch (if you want to use that to control playback). Pairing isn’t as instaneous as using W1-chip headphones (AirPods, Beats Solo 3 Wireless and the new Beats Studio 3), but it’s fast nonetheless. You do have to disconnect from one device before pairing to another (simply pairing won’t work, you need to disconnect the other device first), which is a mild annoyance. I would love more flawless device switching or support for multiple BT connections.

I’ve also used them with a mid-2017 MacBook Pro, a mid-2017 iMac 5K, and a late-2016 Surface Book with great success. I usually don’t use noise canceling headphones at work because too many people yell at me (wired Song MDR-7506s have been my default pick for years now), but these are excellent and especially convenient when trying to do work or even a quiet conference call from the airport lounge or the speaking room at a conference.

I can’t speak to long term durability yet, but so far these have more than met my expectations.

As far as comfort, I haven’t done a direct comparison with the Bose (the last time I used the Bose was close to a year ago), but these didn’t bother me, even after 10+ hours of continuous use.

From a pure sound quality point of of view, there are probably equally good or better options for less money on the market, but the battery life and excellent ANC makes these ideal for travel."
141,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones mostly because my new phone doesn't have a headphone jack. I commute via the subway every day, and it's nice to be able to listen to music on occasion without having to worry about wires. These headphones have been great so far and I can't really think of any substantial downsides. Others have done the in-depth sound and NC comparisons against Bose and Sennheiser, so I won't do that here.

For commuting on trains and buses, these are fantastic. The noise cancelling is excellent, to the point where I've almost missed my stop because I couldn't hear the announcement. I've had a couple times where I've been in a cramped compartment with people talking and it becomes instant silence when I turn these on. The sound quality is also great. The low notes are very full without overwhelming everything else. I'm also hearing subtleties in my music that I haven't noticed before. I listen to a lot of rock, some electronic, and some lo-fi stuff, and these have been great with everything. Build quality is solid; I haven't once been concerned about cracking in the headband, but I treat these very well. I've had these for a couple months and I've only had to charge them twice.

The only annoying thing I can think of with these is the earcup controls. It usually works well for volume, pausing, and switching tracks, but not 100%. There are times I'll swipe to turn up the volume, but it pauses instead. Or I try to forward a track and it pauses. Very minor thing that's not a dealbreaker by any means, but still annoying.

Overall, these are solid headphones that I would recommend."
143,5.0 out of 5 stars,It really cuts out a LOT of the outside noise. also like the covering of the right ear piece to hear any conversation also the ability to control the sound .
144,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
By far the best active noise cancelling headphones. Comfortable to wear for long duration like commute or at work. Build quality is superior. Decent battery life (last a whole week with average use 5-6 hrs daily). Good case for storage and comes with good quality accessories.

Cons:
Not much except price is a bit high and ear cup pads could have been a bit more soft (qc35 I think has the best ear cup pads)."
145,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphones really surprised me.
I bought them for both office use & public transportation.
I ended up using them all day long, the sound just made the outside world without the headphones seem really, really loud.
battery always seems to have a charge, can be used around the two days straight.
In terms of sound quality - I can't compline - did not found any issue with them.
They are addictive, probably my best purchase so far."
146,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great noise canceling! feels like you're alone in the world.
I am so very happy with them and although they are expensive I feel they worth the money
but do take those downsides under consideration:
- there's no warning before charging is needed, headphones just die. (really annoying, this should be fixed!)
- poor phone call quality, I switch to my cheap HP for that :)
- this color is many things, but it's not GOLD :)))"
147,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best headphones I've used. They are a real treat and the noise canceling is high end, probably the best ever."
148,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are very comfortable and have awesome sound quality. Also battery life is absolutely great.
I haven't tried other noise cancelling headphones but I can say that they do not completely block all sounds.
For example, with noise cancelling on, you can still hear people talking around you. Sure, you would hear them less but you still hear the voice well enough to understand words."
149,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter said that they aren't as loud as beats and don't sound much better.
For the price, I would not buy them again.
Bought them for Christmas 2017 so, hopefully they will last. It is March 2018 as of this writing."
150,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best pair of headphones I've ever owned. I've come a long way from the rattling Skullcandy Skullcrushers of middle school, or the weird ass Sony behind the ear looping ones with the orange ear foam. These are so comfortable I wear them to sleep, so sweet in their sound that I find my body gyrating and head bopping in places where it is surely seen as inappropriate but I just can't help it - the sound is too good. I love the controls and sometimes just flick to skip or cup it to hear around me and giggle with how intuitive it is, although yes the responsiveness of tapping to play and pause can be fickle at times.

Battery is incredible, and I haven't had anyone say that they couldn't hear me when I take a call on them. The days of me crooking my neck in order to mush the phone to my shoulder are over. I can't tell if the app truly works that takes into account atmospheric pressure or personalization of sound to you, but the placebo effect of the slick presentation does put a bougie ass smile on my face.

Build quality is cool, though I do wish they felt a little tougher.

I've never paid such a grand amount for a piece of audio tech, but this feels well worth it. Like two little pudgy cherub hands caressing my ears and projecting heavenly sounds straight to my auditory cortices.

Sleep in 'em, block out your roomates with 'em, or let in the world as the music moves with you."
151,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound and noise cancellation are great, lots of options but they put pressure on your head and get uncomfortable"
152,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are awesome! They are my first pair of over the ear bluetooth headphones as I have just switched to a Google Pixel 2. I was worried about the hassle of bluetooth but it is not a big deal at all. The only real drawback I have to offer is that the full palm cupping to lower the level of music can be a touch sensitive at time even when I am just trying to adjust the fit.
154,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, even better noise cancelling. I love some of the touch sensitivity features, particularly being able to put my hand on the right cup to let outside sound into the headphones. Battery life lasts 16+ hours, so they're great for long trips."
155,5.0 out of 5 stars,THE best noise cancelling headphone in 2017! Not even one of!
156,4.0 out of 5 stars,What I expwcted but it is very hard to pause music or audio using you headphones only.
157,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can’t speak highly enough about these headphones. Amazing sound and cancels all outside noise, even kiddos haha"
158,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good. Amazing battery life, I have been using it for a week at work(4-5 hours a day) without charing."
159,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice noise cancellation for user on an aircraft. The case allows them to be packed up in a very small space.
160,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Value and far exceeds Bose 20 and 35 series noise canceling...Bose does not stand by their product. Argumentative and not staffed with appropriate customer service mindset..... Sony is top rate!! A+++
161,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product and the latest version. Some of the previous versions of this product had a material flaw which caused the headband to break. Sony will replace those if they fall into the serial number range (which is quite large). I use these every night and they are great for flying. Noise suppression is very good. Waiting is very good and the phones will let you know how the charge is doing (recorded female voice) when you press the power on button while in use. Comfortable and they come with a cable and adaptor for use on a plane. Lasted 16 hours of flying time easily.
162,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a fairly serious music listener. I have had many different kinds of Bluetooth, Noise Cancelling, Sports, over ear, in ear -- way too many to count.
Buy these.
It took me a couple of days to get used to all of the various options and features, but these are hands-down the best on the market today. Virtually every feature is customizable from the NC feature to equalization of music. The app also is great so that one does not have to remove the headphones to manually use the features located on the left and right earphones. My only problem was with the initial pairing. I simply went to my Amazon order and followed the ""need help"" instructions and within 4 or 5 minutes the Amazon rep told me how to factory reset. Immediately it paired to my iPhone. Finally, although the instructions do not mention compatibility with iPhone X, they are... Both products are simply so new that the manual was not quite up to date with the latest iPhone."
163,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An amazing pair of headphones, just they start to feel tight around your ears after a while."
165,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing! I use them at the office and if it can block my coworkers out then it can block out your problem at work too! Finally I can concentrate but still hear with a quick hand gesture that enhances the ambient sounds.
166,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my wife and she loves them, great at reducing noise and listening to favorite music."
167,4.0 out of 5 stars,"only problem i have is that tiny sound delay from the souce like 0.2s sound delay from the play souce
it wont hurt u if u just listen to mp3
but it will hurt u a bit when u watch moive
and alot on play games
was hoping sony fix that problem in mark-2
but sony didnt"
168,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to wait till enough time have passed, and after almost 8 months with these headphones I can honestly say they deserve all the hype surrounding them.
They are amazing, innovative, and really cancel surrounding noise!!
Hadn't experienced any fracture that I've heard about from the mdr-1000x users.

Cheers :)"
169,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best headphone I ever had 😊 the king of noise cancelation
170,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
1) Supports a wide variety of wireless audio codecs making it a versatile device compared to others in the same range (Bose QC35 ii wink wink)
2) The sound quality is amazing and to an untrained ear, it is indistinguishable when compared to most dedicated headphones in the same price range.
3) Comes with a supporting Application, which lets it control the atmospheric pressure inside the cans.
4) On a full charge lasts about 20 to 25 hours depending on the usage.
5) Noise cancellation is indistinguishable when compared to the market leader Bose QC35 ii.

Cons:
1) App needs an update. It is glitchy and more often than not unresponsive.
2) The build quality could be better.
3) Bluetooth pairing experience and switching between paired devices needs work.

Overall:
Value for money. Can't go wrong with these are 299$ price tag. At 349$ it is 50$ too much."
171,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and great noise cancelling. Nothing bad to say about them. Worth the cost.
172,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones exceeded my expectations. Between the comfort, the excellent battery life, the rich audio, and the app with equalized, I’m impressed. The optional automatic switching from noise canceling to ambient etc based on your movements that’s advertised in the Sony promo video isn’t as smooth as they advertise but it works. This is better than anything I’ve tried in the price range"
173,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best NC headphones in the market, hinges are quite good and the best part is the battery coming to the sound quality, bass is awesome
but i found the highs to be stressful. It can get uncomfortable if used for more than 4hrs continuously. Overall I highly recommend to everyone who are struck between this and Bose. Cost is quite high but it's worth every penny I recommend u to buy on the sale"
174,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for the gym by mistake. Honestly really not gym friendly. They are big and really made for people who travel or use other than gym. Sound quality and functionality of these guys are awesome, not quite enough bass for me but great quality and top of the line."
176,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like many of you, I was torn between the Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. The decision is going to come down to your priorities. Sony's headphones overall sound better, especially with dance or bass-heavy music. If you have FLAC or ALAC tracks, you'll notice the Sony sounding better since they support the LDAC Bluetooth codec, which is more advanced and uses higher bandwidth than Bose,

However, if you're heavily invested in the Android ecosystem and need the headphones to travel, the Bose are more comfortable and have better controls as the touch controls on the Sony are hit and miss. The built-in Google Assistant on the Bose is actually very helpful once you learn it's capabilities.

So overall I give 4/5 stars since they are less comfortable than the Bose (hot on ears), have finicky touch controls, have no Google Assistant integration, but sound better than the Bose. Returned these and kept the Bose."
177,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love these! Great sound, amazing noise canceling, terrific battery. Really great headphones."
178,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pair of headphones. The noise-cancelling feature works really well; I almost at all can't hear when it's raining outside or the tumbler is running. Unfortunately because they are Bluetooth, there is a delay in playing out music. I also wish you could select different mixing profiles for playback on PC."
179,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical at first, but with my first flight the difference was astounding plus the sound in gesture is a thing of magic, was fun respond to the flight attendant when they assumed you would ignore them with the headset on."
180,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is a great product from my loved brand Sony. the only flaw with this product is that it is not supporting multiple bluetooth connection simultaneously. If I am connected to my phone and want to switch to my laptop first I need to turn my phone bluetooth off then switch to my laptop's bluetooth! I hope there would be any software patches to resolve it.
181,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pro: Excellent noise canceling, great comfort, long battery life, great sound quality
Con: The controls on the headset are SSSSSOOOOO sensitive.
Other: Still 5 star product for me because of all of the upside even with my disappointment in the control sensitivity."
182,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband weighed a lot of options before choosing Sony. He is not sorry.
183,5.0 out of 5 stars,It looks great. The sound quality is great. Noise canceling works great. But the thing I like most is its touch interaction. It is way more convenient and intuitive than competitor's button click interaction. I like it!

Really light.
Premium materials.
Very large range of frecuencies.
Adaptable noise with the application.

Incredible smooth sound.
Hi-Res audio."
185,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My goal in buying over the ear headphones was mainly to control the noise level at work.

I work in a small office with several other folks, one of which in particular has a tendency to talk at length about random stuff at times when I really need to concentrate on work.

Loud sighs, sliding down in my chair behind my monitors, mumbled oaths and other unsubtle hints fell on deaf ears, and so to maintain an otherwise good relationship with this valued colleague I started looking for a solution, which lead me to a comparison of noise cancelling headphones.

As others have noted, these are fantastic at making the outside world go away.

On testing with my wife, I at first suspected she was having fun with me and just moving her lips - hand over the right headphone suspends the noise cancellation and I could hear her deliberately loud and goofy shrilling. Visualize Xena Warrior Princess battle cry.

At work, with or without low level music, my problem is solved and I can cheerfully donate a couple of minutes being a good listener here and there, knowing I can raise my shields at will.

Others more qualified to speak on sound quality may find fault with these, but to me they sound fine, particularly after adjusting various settings in the Sony Connect app for my phone.

At home, I've enjoyed using these with my Roku - I use the ""private listening"" feature on the Roku phone app to accomplish that.

I've worn them for hours at a time with no discomfort, and find the ear and headband padding adequate.

I like the gesture control and find it easy to remember and use. The ""grab the right headphone to listen"" thing is especially useful, and I make use of it frequently."

According to these reviews the headphones weren't so comfortable but for me they are very comfortable, It is true that can make your ears sweat a little bit if it is hot, but for using inside a place, like an office are amazing. I totally recomend these headphones, they are trully amazing."

215,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's an amazing pair of headphones! Recommend to anyone who cares about the quality of music they listen to
216,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are quite remarkable. The noise cancelling is effective and it can adapt to whether you’re sitting or walking. I rally like the feature of putting the hand over the right ear to dim the music if someone is trying to talk to you. It’s really cool.

As for the sound, it is fantastic. I listen to Howard Stern mostly when doing chores and the NC was great with just slight background engine noise. Voices sound great. If you mow while listening to music just about all background noise is eliminated. I hope they last because I really do love them."

225,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is great. Good bass. Bluetooth SUCKS. Drops constantly, even sitting next to the computer. If you're going to make WIRELESS headphones, better make damn sure the wireless part is flawless."
226,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I work in a very noisy environment - over 200 computers pushing 70 dB of white fan noise. It becomes intolerable over time, and after trying several cheap noise cancelling headphones, I took a chance and coined up these Sony's. I'm quite pleased. These are comfy enough to wear for several hours of the day, even when wearing reading glasses. They offer some modicum of a physical barrier to noise, so they help quite a bit even when Off. This is important for any noise cancelling headphone, and these Sony's have a reasonably good shell structure for blocking some sound passively. When the Noise Cancellation is On, I get to enjoy near total quiet where I normally sit, and I get plenty of protection when I go in and among the computers to do work up close to the whirring and buzzing cooling fans, which can be quite loud - up to 90 dB up close. I also used then while being driven around they do a great job at reducing regular car / freeway noise. They are robust but a tad fragile. I treat them like the sensitive electronic instruments that they are, and so should you. Protect them and they will serve you well. Sound quality is quite adequate for my needs - but this is not the true strength of this device. It is of course waaayyy better than any of the cheaper ones I have tried."
227,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great. Incredibly comfy. Excellent sound. Solid battery life. Little details like touching the right ear to temporarily disable noise-cancelling is brilliant and makes it a better buy than Bose or Beats.
228,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Replaced my Bose QC35 with this pair. Never looking back since.
Better noise reduction, better Bluetooth reception and better sound customization."
229,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great head phones, I enjoyed them for about 2 months then while I was working out I noticed the right side cracked. I called amazon for a refund and they said I had to pay a restocking fee. If you're going to buy these headphones please, please buy the 4 year square trade warranty"
231,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, Easy to set up and tons of features.
The noise cancelling is absolutely amazing. Get a pair of these you will not be sorry."
232,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Went through a few headphones before I stuck with these. Amazing sound, crazy noise cancelling and marvelous battery life of 30hrs and will work wired when it dies. The techs feature of cupping the right ear cup with your hand to turn off noise cancelling so you can hear someone is awesome."
233,5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite headphones ever. Period.
234,1.0 out of 5 stars,noise is great bluetooth good but i bought these for the sole purpose of noise cancelling and i can hear talking from my brother in the same room do i have to put them in full blast so i can block out the simplest of talking regret buying expected to much i guess but for 300 i shouldn't be
235,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome headphones. Sound quality is amazing - I listen to bass heavy music and was really surprised at the quality of the bass at high volumes. The NC is really awesome. The true test is yet to be completed - I'm about to travel for +28 hours. Let's hope these live up to the expectation.
236,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sound quality more function
237,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy with this purchase. The sound quality is awesome!
238,1.0 out of 5 stars,worked 2 days and then no link
239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clear quality, comfortable, and drown out the noise well - love the feature where you can hold your right hand up to hear what's going on around you. Nice feature I've not seen on any other NCH."
240,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best purchases I've ever made. I wear headphones for 40+ hours per week and these make that an enjoyable experience.
242,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny specially with the ambient sound feature
243,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was looking for something to replace my 10 year old noise canceling headphones. These are top of the line. Very comfortable and noise canceling is very impressive. Happy customer here.
244,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely the best noise canceling and sounding pair of head phones in its price rang and I tried many. Completely satisfied.
245,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With these,riding the bus becomes sitting in the library listening to your favorite song"
246,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones I have ever used. First time on flight with a seat just forward of the wing and engines. Could not hear any engine noise at all. Features abound with these. I seriously recommend these for anyone that wishes to enjoy music while eliminating outside noise.

248,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If there is a god, he or she made these."
249,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the Bose QC35 headphones for about a year and really like them. However, I've seen such generally very positive reviews for the Sony MDR-1000X phones that, when this new model came out, I had to give them a shot. Since I was already very satisfied with the Bose, I knew that the Sonys had to be something special for me to keep both headphones.
When I received the Sonys and unpacked them, I was really excited to try them. The first thing I noticed was that the comfort level was several steps below the Bose. They felt heavier (which they are), tighter on my head, did not completely envelop my ears, and immediately felt too warm on my ears. Comfort is a very important factor to me, so I knew that the Sonys would have to be outstanding compared to the Bose on other factors.
So, let's go down the checklist:
1. Build Quality - As anyone who reads Amazon customer reviews of the MDR-1000X will see, cracking of the headband was a substantial issue, with associated poor customer service responses from Sony. I can find no mention that the issue was resolved on the new phones, although time will tell.
2. Noise Cancelling - Bose has been at the forefront of this for many years, but Sony has clearly caught up. However, for me, I needed the noise cancelling to be substantially better on the Sonys for me to keep them over the Bose. Although the Sonys have more noise cancelling options, I could not detect a marked improvement over the Bose.
3. Sound Quality - This is probably the most subjective factor under consideration. After a few hours of A/B comparison of the two headphones, it turned out that I prefer the Bose. To me, they have a cleaner sound with better instrument separation.
4. Features - Sony clearly outperforms Bose on this factor. From the many options on the Sony app, to the touch controls, to the Quick Attention Mode feature, it is obvious that Bose has a lot of catching up to do.

So, for me, the Sony advanced features are just not enough for me to use them over the Bose. Many thanks to Amazon for making the return process so easy."
250,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony vs Bose:
I had a long battle on which to choose and for my uses, I think the Bose suit me better.
The Bose are more comfortable to me, I like physical buttons and dont need gimmicky features that the Sonys have. I can pair the Bose more easily and can pair up to 2 Bluetooth devices (not just 1) to the headphones.
The Sonys would be a better choice if I wanted slightly more bass/punch as I listen to a lot of Hip-Hop/Electronic music but even then the difference to my ears wasnt light years ahead of the Bose.
It comes to personal taste on the look, comfort and sound really. The Sonys do have better battery life from what Ive heard (20v30 hours) so that is definitley a plus. All in all, If I had only 1 pair of headphones to use, I might like these better...but If I want bluetooth and great noise cancelling that is easy to use and straightforward, Ill take the Bose . I also own Audio Technica ATH50s and Sony MDR-1s that are amazing for listening through media with Aux jacks which is still the way to go if you want the best quality sound."
251,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best headphone i ever had
253,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have a nice design, the sound is awesome, the app is also pretty cool. I researched these headphones as much as I could before buying. In all, most reviews are pretty spot on. However, one thing that I really didn't find mentioned at all was how bad the noise cancelation is on a bus. I ride a city bus and we hit some rough roads sometimes, the noise cancelation cannot adjust to all these bumps. I thought at first the headphones I had were defective, so I contacted Sony and they sent me a new pair. Again, on the bus ride to work and home the headphones sound like crap.

Because I really do like the sound of these headphones I am deciding to keep them. These are still top notch sounding headphones and the app does help with customizing to your likes. But, I cannot give it 5 stars because of the noise cancelation issue on the bus. I also don't want to give it less than 4 because I do really like them. My bus ride isn't that long so I just decided that I would turn off the noise cancelation during my commute. So just beware if you commute on a bus and the ride is long these headphones will disappoint you and you will have to go through this 2 week process with Sony to get a new pair sent to you.

@Sony - please test these on bumpy roads and make adjustments to any future pair."
254,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Our upstairs neighbors are heavy steppers/walkers to the point it was really stressing me out. To drown out the stomper-clompers I tried turning up the stereo or TV, but that’s stressful too if you’re looking for peace and quiet instead, or maybe some low key classical music. Enter my recent purchase of the Sony WH1000XM2 headphones which I can’t emphasize enough have been life changing. Slip these babies on and I can have near total quiet with the NC selected, or total immersive music bliss. If you’re looking for an escape from a noisy situation I can’t recommend these enough! Love the easy to use controls and the cupping feature so you can carry on a conversation without taking them off."
255,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Sony headphones and the Bose QuietComfort 35 (Series II) set because the reviews were so close and I wasn't sure which ones I would like better. While the Bose were definitely more comfortable and the case was large enough to fit the charging cord and headphone jack, the sound did not quite measure up. I did like the on/off switch of the Bose headphones better and the Bose app, but I love the Sony headphones for the following reasons. The sound is phenomenal...it's transforming. I took them on a recent flight and it was like being in another world...no noisy discussions or engine noise, just a beautiful series of sounds that volleyed from one ear to the next. It's easy to change tracks, adjust volume, or stop play by simply swiping or tapping the outside of the right earpiece. The Sony app is fairly easy to use, too, including a way to adjust if your connection cuts in and out. I didn't experience that with the Sony, but did with the Bose. If I could have chosen the comfort of the Bose with the sound of the Sony (and the convenient swipe feature) I would never take them off!"
256,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good. I tend to have a slightly low expectation for headphones since I'm not a fan of the band playing in the center of my head effect. I was surprised that these headphones actually have a great spatial sound. The noise canceling is on point. I had a chance to use them twice on flights over the weekend and they performed as marketed.

It has an adaptive noise canceling feature that's good, but it audibly alerts you when it changes. Not a big fan that, so I might turn it off. I have to admire the app and the headphones for actually guessing what I'm doing and where I am. It's a bit spooky, to be honest. Haha

I have a fairly large head, so I was a bit worried that they might cause a squeezed feeling, but they didn't. I've been able to wear them for several hours at a time without strain."
257,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I care about my music quality and silence while working. These are awesome, high-end headphones for daily use to keep your in a cocoon of sound. They've helped ease air travel and train rides. Though because they're over-ear (which is my preference) they don't play well with neck pillows.

The tap to play/pause/next/back feature is amazing, but only works in bluetooth mode (not auxiliary plug in). The volume swipe uses rather small increments so you might have to swipe up quite a few times to increase by 50% or more.

The noise cancelling calibration does really work. I can hear the difference after it runs in a new environment. This is the product main differentiator from other similar models. I never use the app, but you can press to calibrate which I do all the time."
258,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic headphones. The sound is clear and balanced. Using the app allows you to tweak the sound profile to your precise preference. Sony delivers awesome active noise cancelling as well. These are perfect for when I want to tune out everything else around me. The gesture based controls are very intuitive and I really like being able to allow ambient sound in by simply cupping the right side. I was torn between these and the Bose QC35s. Bose's offering are more comfortable, but these Sonys just offer more features as well as a much more fleshed out app. I've worn them for 4 hours without feeling discomofort on the crown of my head or around my ears. Battery life is great. I usually only have to charge them once a week. I have no regrets with my purchase and would recommend these to anyone."
259,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow. Just...wow. My company moved to open plan recently. The noise cancelling feature has literally saved lives (of my coworkers).

Phones fit great (I'm a big dude) are light and comfortable and come with an awesome carrying case and adapters for airplane seats. Amazing design and function. The atmospheric pressure adjustment is a huge plus for air travel, as is the ability to change the level of noise cancelling."
260,5.0 out of 5 stars,"PROS
- I didn't realize just how noisy my office was until I wore these for 8 hours, looked over, saw a couple gaggles of people behind me, took the headphones off, and then got blown away by how loud my coworkers are... I mean damn, it's like a music concert filled with chickens.
- There is background noise from environmental sounds (e.g. talking), but 2 people talking versus 10 people talking will barely change that background noise level. Even a slight background style music going will drown out those environmental sounds.
- Battery life

CONS
Ear cushions are rather narrow. If you're of the northeast European variety, then your ears will touch the inside of the cushion. For me that happens but it isn't uncomfortable, and my ears are on the large side."
261,2.0 out of 5 stars,I actually returned this product. The fit was uncomfortable (flight was about 3 hrs.) and the Noise cancelling feature would shut itself off automatically when I wore them to cancel the noise only. When listening to music or watching a movie there was no issue. Sound quality was pretty good but you have no control if you want to listen at a louder level.
262,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a longtime, satisfied Bose headphones user (QC15's), I anxiously awaited Black Friday to see if they were going to discount the QC35 II's for the holidays. When they did not budge from their std. list rate, coupled with high reviews both online and from a co-worker on the Sony's, I opted to purchase the latest model Sony WH1000XM2's.

I recently traveled internationally and had an opportunity to use the Sony's during multiple flights and am grateful to no longer have to be concerned about the QC15 cord and am very satisfied with the audio quality and noise cancellation. I like the ability to adjust volume and change songs by swiping on the right earpiece and the ability to briefly suppress noise cancellation by placing your right hand over the right ear cup.

Bose's unwillingness to reduce their std. list rate cost them a sale and potentially a longtime customer."

265,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones. Comfortable, don't hurt my head while wearing for any length of time. Great sound quality and noise cancellation. Also, the touch pad, compactness, and battery life make this a worthwhile purchase. Worth every penny. Would buy again."

269,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Sony Noise Cancelling Headphone was a Christmas present for my husband. The delivery to our son's address worked out well. It seems my husband is enjoying the headphones because he is wearing them a lot while listening to music and is probably enjoying the lack of external noise in general :)
270,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise canceling is the best I've heard. I haven't been able to pair my headphones with the app yet, it hasn't worked so far, so that's the only negative. The sound quality and battery life are great. And the controls on the headphones themselves work great."
271,3.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first got the headphone, it was flawless. Every functionalities work. One of the feature that I love the most was the quick attention mode where you can cup the right ear and the music will pause to let you momentarily hear the person you're talking to. I have come to love this feature so much that I would use it everytime I use the headphone.

Unfortunately, a few days ago, the feature no longer work. The quick attention mode stop registering my hand. I've tried factory resetting the headphone multiple times and the problem persists.

It’s only go downhill from here. I started having Bluetooth connection problem. The dang headphone just doesn't wanna connect to my iPad for some reasons, but I can connect to my iPhone. Furthermore, the noise canceling functionality, for some reasons, got pretty inconsistent thereafter.

I've decided to return this headphone. Such a disappointment. The headphone didn't even last for 2 months."

273,5.0 out of 5 stars,"some of them said it is uncomfortable, but in my case i got a really big head, cant really fit in a XL hat size. But i use this headphone in 14hour flight without any uncomfortable and so quiet and barely hear the engine noise"

280,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great all round headphones.
I chose these in particular because they were so much better than all the others I’d tried for cancelling voices (open plan office!).
I use the ambient sound option often when I’m out and about NC when I’m sitting or in the office and don’t want to be disturbed."
281,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Truly stunning noise cancelling. I was seriously impressed. I could tap my fingernails on the table I was sitting at and not be able to hear the sound. Wow!

Unfortunately I sent them back for a few reasons.
1. They're heavy. I couldn't wear them long without pain in the crown of my head.
2. The deal breaker is that they can't be used strictly for noise cancelling (the whole reason I purchased them) without 'hacks'. The power save feature shuts them down after 5 minutes unless they are physically connected to a 3.5mm cable or via bluetooth. Both hacks are easy enough, but for $350 turning off power save should be a feature in the Sony app.

I got the Bose QC35 after these. The Bose are significantly lighter on my head, though still heavy. The difference in noise cancelling is obvious - Sony definitely wins here. The QC35s allow for noise cancellation only with no hacks and no power save."
282,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are really incredible, astonishing!!!!! One of mybest purchases."
283,5.0 out of 5 stars,The noise cancelling is incredible and the sounds are very precise. Can't recommend these enough.

300,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best thing I’ve ever buy in a long time. Worth the price believe me.
301,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Another serious contender. These headphones provide serious noise cancellation and wonderful music reproduction. They are a bit on the snug side and having large ears I find the fit just about makes it inside the cups. Nonetheless the app that's free and included with the Headphones is very cleverly done and provides a significant amount of user input. The case needs a little work as positioning the phones within the case is a bit cumbersome and there isn't a dedicated pocket for the charging cable. You must rely on an outside the case netting which allows items to fall out. That aside I'd still purchase them as a solution for a full coverage wireless solution. BTW, pairing with my iPhone 7plus was seamless but as of yet have not been able to pair with my iPad's. I may have to unpaire with the phone in order to make that happen. Haven't tried that as of yetis primary usage is with my phone."

303,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros - Sound is amazing, NC is unbelievable!
Cons - hard to use the controls with hand gestures"
304,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Can't believe how good the noise cancelling is and how many features these headphones have. At first u will find the sound flat and a bid ""muddy"" but you just simply need to adjust the equalizer to your personal preferences and enjoy them👌👌"
305,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Product fits well, connects well, sounds great, and effectively blocks ambient noise. Audiophiles will prefer the sound of these over the Bose Q35's, and if you're a fan of deep bass (like me), again, you'll prefer these. The downloadable app for the headphones includes a customizable equalizer (not just a list of available presets like in Apple's music settings), and includes the option to increase bass specifically. This is important to me because by increasing the bass through the headphones themselves, rather than through the equalizer in my spotify app, I get the increased bass while bypassing the degradation in audio that characterizes bluetooth streaming. The LDAC system/High-Res Audio is great. The sound is noticeably better than the Q35's. If you purchase the Q35's you might notice that they sound great (bass included, it's very impressive) over a WIRED connection. But when transitioning to a bluetooth connection (e.g. from my Mac to my iPhone) the bass completely falls apart. It actually sounds like they're broken. This won't be an issue if you don't artificially increase the bass like I do (with the EQ in the spotify app), but if you like bass you will be disappointed. Not with the Sony pair though. The bass is great, the streaming quality is certainly superior, and the battery is phenomenal. Though for $350 I recommend getting the warranty. I've not experienced any ""cracking"" referenced in some other reviews (I've also had them for less than a month), but it was enough to scare me into getting the warranty. Which, considering the price of the investment, is really not a bad idea anyways.

Overall, highly recommend."
306,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Phenomenal sound, very high quality, durable, and worth every dollar."
308,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are heavier than the Bose and got better base. The power life is also better, which is awesome for long journeys."
309,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are amazing. The auto-changing ambient mode (turns on ambient mode while walking and turns ambient mode off when stationary) is perhaps the best feature.
310,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands down best headphones that I’ve used. Sound quality is top of the line. Controls are seamless and easy to use.
311,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's probably too early to write a review, after all I've only had this headphone set for less than 24 hours as I write this. But so far this Sony WH-1000XM2--an impersonal, heartless name if there ever was one--has been an impressive kit, at least after I actually figured out how the controls worked on this unit. So far I like the sonic qualities well enough for a closed design. I also like the comfort as I spent time with these on my day off, listening to a multitude of streamed music off of Amazon's Unlimited service, as well as my own digital files stored on my tablet and my phone.

It's lightweight enough to be comfortable throughout longer listening sessions. Even with my large ears the earpads envelope them and confirm that the design is truly an over-ear headphone set. The battery life is as promised and is still going strong well into its first charge. Its noise cancellation skill seems to be credible enough; though I'll need a noisier environment than my washing machine and vacuum cleaner to be certain (it may be my day off but chores are chores). The swipe controls (on the right earpiece housing) aren't the most intuitive to me at first and do seem quite sensitive, but I'm getting used to how it works. Fit and finish, as well as the build quality and materials are still too soon to judge, but so far they seem decent enough for something that costs $300 less tax(bought on sale here on Amazon). Comparing them to the QuietComfort 35 that I also was considering, this one hasn't left me wanting...so far.

This 'review' is for now more of a placeholder than a comprehensive go-over of the Sony, but at least for a day this Bluetooth headphone set has my attention. 4+ stars, for now.

Day 2: I've discovered that the XM2's noise cancelling ability is truly impressive. I've also discovered that wearing this headset to bed has its downfalls; rolling over onto my right side (a natural tendency I have), the right earcup ended up putting a fair amount of pressure on my head just above my ear. About four hours in I awoke with the headset still in place (something of a surprise since with other headphones I have a habit of losing or removing them off of my head during sleep), I had a pronounced sore spot at that area above my right ear, no doubt caused by the XM2 pressing against my skull for a good amount of that time. Hours later I still feel the irritation from wearing the Sony set during that sleep period. Disappointing but truthfully not totally unexpected.

I also have begun to garner a growing dislike for the touch controls on this headphone set. It's awfully easy for me to unintentionally or inadvertently sweep across that touch control surface and ""do something"" that didn't need to be done with the settings. That's an annoyance that I'll need to adjust myself to. Frankly having dedicated hardware controls would've mitigated this, but probably in Sony's design staff's view would've compromised the unit's exterior aesthetics, which I must admit is nicely clean and without clutter. But sometimes sacrifices need to be made and in this case of overly sensitive touch controls, this is one of those instances that clean, sparse aesthetics should have taken a back seat to functional parameters.

Battery life is indeed tremendous, but it's a downer that the headset can't be used wirelessly when the battery is charging. In fact when the unit is charging it's not particularly usable even when the included mini patch chord is used. There's a lot of electrical noise leakage when the XM2 is being charged, and it's enough to my ears to quell any desire to use the headset when the micro USB power chord is plugged in. I've also discovered some irritating sonic qualities to the Sony's sound signature and imaging soundstage. Some music really comes off as being rather murky sounding, muddled in the lack of detail and presence, while other types or specific songs are considerably less noticeable as such. It doesn't have me tossing aside the XM2 and reaching for one of my open-back headphones just yet, but it's still disappointing nonetheless.

Still calling it 4+ stars, but inching slowly downward.

Day 14: Yeah, I do LIKE this set of headphones. The noise cancelling is still excellent and better than I imagined it would ever be. The sound quality is very good given its closed dynamics. The SQ will never approach my preferred preference for open-back headphones and (to me) their superior, more 'natural' spatial qualities, but for what it is this XM2's sound continues to please me. I've figured out where to adjust the headband to in able to relieve most of the pressure this design places on the top of my ear, so even from a comfort standpoint it's becoming a non-event. The touch controls remain the only annoyance, but I AM adapting. I just think that it shouldn't have to be such a pain, especially since fingering and swiping the side of one's head is not exactly a natural thing for humans (well, most of us anyway).

Definitely 4+ stars."
312,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent noise cancellation and sound quality
313,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really, really love these headphones. I've had two sets of Bose noise-cancelling headphones, which were definitely good, but the Sony WH1000XM2 are noticeably superior. This is all the more impressive given that they are Bluetooth. They actually look better in real life than they do in photos, and feel more substantial than a lot of other headphone (while still not feeling heavy).

330,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update- After 2 weeks of use:-
Goosebumps continues...;) Throw some 24bits FLAC. Oh my.... The base. Middle. Highs. Fellas, mp3s won't do any justice to these cans. It all depends on your music. 24 bits have so much details. The base is another level. I've S8 with Exynos. So no aptX HD. But just put the Sony app and change mode to connection priority. Then fiddle with the EQ and see the difference. But put mode to quality priority if you want the best details. Unless you've latest snapdragon devices which natively support aptX HD, it doesn't matter. So I'd take the customization instead of aptX ( not 'aptx HD'). But if you've aptx HD capable device go ahead by all means. Again only for HQ audio. If your library is mp3 put it on connection priority and get the EQ adjustments. Enjoy fellas. Mind blowing. But for the ULTIMATE QUALITY you've to plug in the cable. Even LDAC can't equal wired quality. These cans + cable + S8 + 24bits FLAC = musical paradise. But who cares, we buy Bluetooth headphones for wireless freedom.
------------------
It's worth every penny. I used Bose QC25 before. Noise cancellation was very good. But audio quality was very unpleasant for me. Tried QC35 and Sony 1000x in a shop. Also tried Beoplay H9. With the Sony I got goosebumps!! It's night and day. Sony is way ahead on technology and quality.(Build quality of H9 is good. But sound was too artificial) Now this bad boy mark 2 is even better. Got a better deal in Amazon. Full software customization. Super comfortable. Feels absolutely premium. Aptx HD and LDAC. That's some serious tech. I was not a fan of Sony before. But this thing changed it. For audio quality, Bose is not even close. Don't this twice. The best noise cancelling headphones on the planet!!! Period. The Amazon box was little tampered. But product inside was intact. Unopened. So I'm Ok"
331,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, it's a pretty nice headphone with noise cancelling.but I can't find my connecting cable plug adaptor which should be in the package! I was disappointed that seller omit my plug adaptor"

337,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these headphones so much they've replaced my usual AKG 700 with iFi BL setup. Aptx HD is for real.
338,3.0 out of 5 stars,"as compared to the original MX1000 i feel that the noise canceling is not as good. the sound is very good and working with the app gives it much control over the sound quality, however the ambient AI is very frustrating, like if i am walking down the noisy city of new york it automatically turns on ambient letting all the noise in (walking mode) the same as sitting on the subway it will turn on ambient once in motion so i have to adjust via app or button to turn noise canceling back on. in tech its revolutionary or evolutionary this is nether. it just the MX1000 with less buttons an app to control it but is seems to have lost some of the noise canceling power. I only listen to podcast and watch movies on my phone this is more for the music loving person. dont get me wrong this is a very very nice set, but the MX 1000 are cheaper and just as good if not better overall"
339,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best pair of headphones I have ever owned. The ANC is almost magical. The sound quality is truly immersive with ANC on.

349,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These have a feature that is supposed to determine if you are walking and allow outside noise to come in so you are aware of your surroundings. Mine kept deciding that I was walking while I was sitting at my desk or in crowded areas and would allow all of the outside noise into the headphones so I had trouble hearing calls or music. The people on the other end of the calls also had trouble understanding me because the background noise was transmitted to them as well. They were actually worse than an average, cheap office-issued headset. I expected a lot more out of a $350 pair of headphones, these are definitely not worth the price. I returned them."

372,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked how far the range is, the level of noise cancellation, and how it feels over my ears"
374,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually got these on sale so it didn't hurt the wallet as much as it did yo most people. Great buy and truly worth every penny. I sat on a flight from Qatar to Chicago, 14.5 hours and they lasted the whole flight and a few more days after that...like a week of listening to loud music with bass and noise cancelling, all battery drainers and they worked like a champ. The noise cancelling works great, auto adjusts and it not only shut out the noise of a plane engine but at least 2 crying children, which we all know is much louder than an engine. only cons are they controls sometimes don't respond well if you have big fingers the touch pad may sense where you don't want it to but it's a swipe motion so easily adjusted to. And that during the auto adjust moments the music stops for like a second."
375,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing noise cancelling. I could enjoy using these, but I prefer the Bose QC35. With these Sony’s, my ears get hot and there is too much clamping pressure. Plus I don’t like the white noise at low volume. That being said - the noise cancelling at anything above low volume blows Bose out of the water. If you really need to tune out, these could be a great choice. These are significantly better than the Beats Studio 3 wireless headphones. I’ll stick with the Bose for now though."
376,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from my favorite Sony MDR-7506, needed noise-cancelling for travel. Rich balanced sound - not bass-heavy like some other sets I've tried, much more balanced and comfortable sound levels. Very little difference overall from the MDR-7506 using mobile phone as source. Noise cancelling is superb. The NC Optimizer can be triggered with a press of a button and adjusts noise cancelling to your environment. Touch sensor on the right side is brilliant - easy control of music and phone calls. Love the Quick Attention feature, placing your hand over the touch panel quiets the music and pipes in ambient sound so you can quickly hear what's going on around you. Much more comfortable than my MDR-7506 - I can wear these for hours with no issues - very soft pads. Impressive build quality. Great that they can be used sans-power when connecting the cable. No complaints whatsoever."
377,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used Bose noise canceling for at least 10 years and I am very glad Sony came out with these headphones. The noise canceling might be slightly less efficient but the overall experience is much, much better. The app allows to equalize the sound to your taste, which is great; you can tap on the side of the set to pause, skip songs, hear the flight attendant without taking off the set. The battery charge is enough to fly to far, very far destinations and the construction feels robust. Comfort is good too. I am looking forward to see how long the foam pads will last. All my Bose sets started to fall apart in a very annoying way after a few years and I can’t believe they never fixed the problem choosing better materials."
378,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent 348 dollars for this Sony wh1000-xm2 noise canceling headphone last month. The right side earbud has been producing some weird sound since last week. It's an expensive headphone for me and I have been using it carefully and it has been only one month after purchase. Therefore I immediately contacted Sony customer service via phone. After spending one hour telling two representatives all my information and what had been going on with the headphone, they arbitrarily, rudely concluded that it was broken artificially and refused to give any solutions. I asked that if they could check the headphone first before making conclusions because I was confident that it was defective. They just refused and insisted they would not offer any solutions. What's even more astounding is that they expired my warranty without any confirmation or evidence. They just made conjecture based on my words on the telephone, in which I repeated many times that I took good care of the headphone. I tried to contact SONY via their website. Their representatives just asked me to call the same number over and over again. I called many times. There were either no response or same answer and rejection of any detection. I just emailed them but I am so disappointed that I don't think they would make any instrumental effort to solve my problem. It has really been an awful experience and I plan to turn to law afterward. The headphone is not really a big deal but what SONY has done simply indicated that they don't respect their customer. And I will not be treated this way and just let go. They are just irresponsible and try everything to blame a customer to get away from the poor quality of their products. Never buy their products again!! Seriously!"
379,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are just amazing. The sound quality is definetly worth the price, and the ANC functuality definetly lives up to its name. Not to mention the touch controls on the right earcup, these are almost too good to be true. The only small issues I have are that there is slight overheating on my ears, and sadly another postponement for USB type C, but it’s not a big problem at all. The best part is the app, I have so much control over my music and how it sounds that I played around with it for hours until I was absolutely satisfied with the tone. Oh and for you sensitive ear people, these things pack a punch in bass, so u might want to turn it down in the settings. Although I payed $350 for mine, these very frequently go on sale for $300, so please wait until that happens and don’t rush into it like me lol. These headphones are really great for everyone and to all who are getting second choices about it, trust me when I say the price seems too fair for what you get; after all 30 hours of battery life seems like the money was well spent"
380,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are nothing short of incredible.

They block out all types of noises while also providing rich sounding audio. I've used these on the train and the amount of sound the noise canceling reduces is remarkable. One time on the train there was a woman playing the guitar literally across from me and I could just very faintly hear her with the noise canceling on and no music playing. Even my bus rides have been made so much more enjoyable just by wearing these headphones and being able to tune out the traffic just beyond my window.

In addition to the noise canceling, I like the fact that it can be turned off so you can let ambient sound in. Why you may ask? So when you're walking on a busy street or an intersection, you can still hear oncoming cars for safety purposes.

The fit is comfy and I like the foldable flat design. The touch controls are effective and I like being able to cup my hand over the right earcup if I need to speak to someone and don't want to take off my headphones. The battery life is excellent and they do well with all types of music from Jazz, to hip-hop, blues, vocals, you name it.

My only con is they can make my ears sweat after a prolonged period of time, so unfortunately I won't be wearing these during the summer. But I have earbuds for that, so I'm good. These ain't cheap but they're well worth the money."
381,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMG These headphones are spectacular. For a while now I've been a ""no wire, no fun"" headphone kind of guy, but I decided to try these. I've heard great things about Sony so I figured why not. And I'm never going back. The sound quality is excellent, I'd say better than alot of ""premium"" wired headphones and they are definitely leading the wireless headphones scene. Not only do they sound amazing, but they manage to retain this quality with VERY powerful noise cancelling AND Bluetooth. Also it comes with some very cool features like a touch sensitive ear cup. Just cool.

So what separates these from other headphones? Well in my experience they sound better, have insane noise cancelling magic, and are actually really comfy to wear. I recently went on about a 6 hour car ride and they were super comfy throughout the trip. Also, this battery lasts forever. I've never got the headphones to ""battery level: medium"" let alone the headphones dying.

Now of course nothing is perfect. The bass could be the tiniest bit punchier, but some eq settings fixed that quickly. More importantly though, the case is just silly. There is no room inside for anything than the headphones. The wires you might want to bring have a pocket on the outside of the case. Cmooonnnn. It's funny really that the worst part of the headphones are the cases. But again I won't detract from the headphones, they are spectacular, and if you need a different case, you can choose from a variety of third party options.

Overall: buy these things. I almost never give reviews on Amazon stuff, but these deserve one."
382,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a bose quite comfort user. After I started using sony WH1000XH2 there is no going back.

Improvements over Quite Comforted Wired 35:
Better Noise Cancellation
Build Material Feels Solid (Yet not more comfortable, probably a little less)
Charges battery through USB
Better battery utilization (More hours of usage per charge)
iPhone app to control features
Hand guestures are very useful and responsive (I have a problem with volume control though)"
383,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are probably the best headphones I've everhad, wireless, non-wireless, over-ear or in-ear. The sound is spectacular. The battery life is amazing, and I never really have to charge it, the app is nice, though the surround and eq are not good or really necessary particulary because of the built DSEE(Digital Sound Enhancement Engine) which really does improve the quality, in the way a good dac would by upscaling the files to a higher bit and sample rate, depending on the abilities of your computer or phone/tablet. The noise cancelling is spectacular, and I like the ability to control it, by having an ambient sound control, and allowing some noise, (focus on voice) when necessary. I'm still getting use to the touch controls. That is the one thing I don't like, also unable to pair with a mac computer, I previously had the bose quietcomfort 35 which had buttons and the ability to pair, however, I didn't like that I couldn't control the level of noise cancelling, it didn't feel as durable and the sound was nowhere near as good as these. It's not even close as some reviews would lead you to believe. But I'm the son of a classical musician, so I have better idea of what things are actually supposed to sound like than most other people. So long as the continue to be cheaper the bose, I would get these instead."

390,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very heavy and the ones I ordered were dead on arrival. I previously researched the sound quality and was looking forward to these, but after having them on my head for awhile, I decided to order a different model when I return these. They weigh almost 10 ounces, very heavy on your head for any long time."
391,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, finally some bass from a Sony. It still isn't as crisp and tight as the Beats Pro 2, sadly. The bass is there but muddy. The gimmicks in the app are fun (for about 15 minutes).

Why give this 5-stars when this reads like a 4-star review? The noise cancellation is uncanny good; the Quietcomforts can't compare to a fresh-calibrated 1000XM2 (you can update the NC anytime you like, its kinda fast and whoa, effective - scary effective).

My comments for Sony:
1. Cmon drop this incredible inept headphone naming algorithm - the WH1000XM2, seriously??
2. Fix the sometimes-wonky song advance bug. No swiping, Swiper! It doesn't always work (why is this?). How about a real button for the fake swiping.
3. Keep the awesome NC but really, really fix the faccid sound. Do this. Compare the Beats to the M2's. Somehow the Beats lets you hear sounds and tones that the M2 cannot.
4. Make the two buttons a little more pronounced - hard to find them at times. Too close together as well. Copy the great QC35 button arrangement. Go ahead, they won't mind."
392,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually sold back the previous model (MDR1000X) to get this updated model since I frequently travel on airplanes and the altitude compensation and 30 hr battery life were the biggest improvements. If you travel on flights, these are the best you can get. Much better sound than the ubiquitous Bose QC35 and finally, just as good or slightly better nose canceling. Current state of the art."

422,5.0 out of 5 stars,amazing sound and amazing noise canceling
423,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great noise cancelling headphones with a few wrinkles. Consider saving yourself $100+ and buy the refurbished MDR-1000X/B which are last year's version and almost identical. I've taken both the 1000XM2 and the 1000X/B on a flight and compared the them by swapping back and forth repeatedly; both using only noice cancellation, and while listening to music and movies while also using noise cancellation. The noise cancelling between them is almost identical, but not quite. XM2 seem to have the slightest edge over the old X/B, but I suspect it is because of the earpieces, not the technology. If you look at the photo I've included with this review, you'll see the XM2 headphones have smaller openings for your ears. If you have a large head or ears, this is definitely noticeable when you're wearing them. I suspect this smaller opening contributes to the ever so slightly better noise cancellation on the XM2. And it is really slight. However, because of this tighter opening for the ears, the XM2 will make your ears hotter than the X/B if you're wearing them for hours at a time (e.g. on long flights).

As for the sound quality, both the XM2 and the X/B sound good, not great. If sound quality is top priority over noise cancelling, then go with the B&W PX or any number of other wired passive headphones. Here again, the XM2's tighter earpieces were a downside for me. They cause the soundstage move further toward the back of head, instead of out front where you really want it to be. The X/B put the soundstage right in between my ears, which still isn't awesome, but it's SLIGHTLY better than the XM2. Neither model can compete with a pair of good open cup headphones like the Sennheiser HD650. But then you get absolutely no noise isolation, so pick your priority.

Other oddities...the XM2 has textured faux leather on the ear cups, the X/B has smooth. I prefer the smooth. The touch controls on the XM2 seem more prone to error (skipping tracks when you just meant to change the volume) than the X/B.

TL;DR Apparently I'm turning in a grumpy old man who doesn't like change. The MDR1000X/B were great--why, Sony, did you change them for this? And get off my lawn!

EDIT: The above review was written before I tired the companion app. The app has a soundstage control (""Sound Position Control"") that appears to be a crossfeed function. It fixes the ""back of your head"" soundstage problem I mentioned above. If you're reading this, Sony, please ditch the graphic EQ and adopt a parametric version where the user can just adjust the frequency response curve to their desired target. So much more useful than a graphic EQ.

Some other reviews mentioned the cracking issues on the MDR-1000X/B that I professed a fondness for. I haven't had any issues with mine, but others certainly have. Definitely take that into consideration. I also haven't had any issues with either headphones responding to pillows, seat cushions, hoods, or stocking caps. Capacitive controls shouldn't respond to pressure from everyday objects. That sounds like a defective headphone."
424,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just hands down the best set of headphones I've owned, admittedly, I don't own very many. Others have written more thorough and thoughtful reviews and I agree with nearly all aspects. They looks great and sound even better, even with ANC turned on. I commute by subway through NYC and with these cans on nearly all background noises dissolve away, quite amazing. They are on the pricier side for me, but it's an audio investment for years to come. Get the warranty, you can't beat a $17, 4 year warranty through square trade.

For anyone doing comparison shopping between these and the Bose QC35 II. You can't go wrong with either, however, i'm very happy with my decision to go with Sony. Just don't buy beats studio 3, they're garbage for the price range."

437,3.0 out of 5 stars,This was the second item I ordered from Amazon and unfortunately the Sony headphones had a similar but more problematic issue than the first Sonys. This headphone would completely terminate the noise reduction after about 3 to 5 minutes after turning them on. I would have given them a solid 5 because they are a great sounding headphone but could only muster up a 3.

441,5.0 out of 5 stars,"to get best performance, I went ahead and got the Sony NWA45 to take advantage of all the features... totally worth it... Best sound can be achieved by turning off the NC options if you just want to enjoy music... it opens up the sound stage a bunch and improves the ""feel"" of live music. And yes, take advantage of DSD file options, it really makes a difference."
442,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is awesome for noise canceling headphones. Sound better than Bose. The noise cancellation works great. Love the user interface controls on the right side. Hold your hand over the right side and the volume lowers, noise cancellation turns off, and the external mic activates so you can hear the outside wold. Swipe and control volume or advance to the next song. A very good and well thought out design. I finally got to fly with these. The noise cancellation worked great. It was like sitting in the ""Cone of Silence"" the whole flight. If an announcement came over the loadspeaker, you could hear in in the background. So you then know to put your hand up to your right ear to turn off the noise canceling and listen to the announcement . They worked way better than expected."
443,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Up until a couple days ago, these headphones were absolutely wonderful for me. Great sound, comfortable, and the noise cancelling was almost too good. However, unfolding them one day, they snapped on me. The plastic screw housing that holds the back of the connectors to the cups (L and R shown in pics) cracked, and are now being held together with tape. Be careful, they're more delicate than they look."
444,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The touch feature is good but can be annoying as it can stop the sounds if it inadvertently touch anything. I think it is better if Sony will put a off/on switch to activate the touch feature. I have the comparable Bose and the sounds are comparable but I, personally, prefer the Bose sounds. I really do not know as maybe I am just used to Bose headphones. They are the same price if I can only buy one, I would prefer the Bose. As far as noise cancelling in airplanes, I have not tested them yet."
445,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones to replace a pair of Sennheiser RS160 for the ANR feature as I use them for watching TV simultaneously with my wife who listens through my surround sound system. I have hearing loss such that we can't find a volume that doesn't blast her out in order for me to hear. Even then, I struggle with speech clarity. I have then connected to two unused channels from my Denon 3300 AVR through an Avantree Priva III bluetooth adapter with APTX LL. I was concerned that the Sony WH1000 that although they have APTX they don't support low latency, but when I tried this combination dialog matching between picture and sound is very close and not a hindrance at all.

When I tested these haedphones at Best Buy I was standing next to a young mother with two toddlers that were anything but quiet at the time. Shut them out completely. At home, exterior noises are just about non-existant so this ANR is fantastic. The controls are easy and the headphones paired with the adapter right away on first try. They reconnect easily when I turn them on.

I have experienced a desire for a little more volume as many others reviews have pointed out but not enough to lower my rating. I am also concerned with the reports of cracking and so I am extra careful when handling the headphones The carrying case is not built very strong but I don't use them in that way.

For ANR, these headphones even the playing field with Bose if not exceeds the pricier headphones."
446,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works as advertised. Very comfortable. The app that you can sync it to is a little gimmicky though. Only two or three of the presets sound decent but if you really mess around with a custom option you can improve the listening experience a little bit.

The bluetooth range is fantastic. I went down three flights of stairs, through three doors, out of my garage and still picked up clear signal. Bluetooth range should never be a worry.

The noise cancelling is really good but after owning it for a few months it seems to be working with a little less quality. It may be because I mostly sync it to my laptop now instead of my phone. The app makes everything sound better and that is perhaps the reason why."
447,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Far better build than the MDR 1000x. Only issue I have with it is that it still cannot pair via bluetooth to a Windows 10 Pro or other Windows OS laptop/desktop. It states it is connected but the device shows up and wrong driver, non-functioning driver or just doesn't pair/work. I use the supplied audio cable for laptop purposes."
448,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great. The price is a little steap but the quality you are getting is well worth it. Better than any Apple product I’ve used as well. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because I do not like the touch feature to adjust the volume or to skip. It’s just a preference but I find it really annoying because you have to continuously swipe to get to the volume level you desire. I prefer how you can just choose the level once. These are very comfortable and the option to cover your ear to mut the music is very useful.
449,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oversea user. Cheaper than in China, I researched months, comparing each models of different brands, primarily between BOSE QC35 and this baby. Finally choosed Sony. Over 3 months using it, so far so good, It won’t cancel all the noise, but it will reduce enought amount of them to help me concentrate, only major one downside is switching paired bluetoothdevices is not so easy. And it’s expensive you decide"
451,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Good:
noise cancelling is great, adaptive settings seem to really help different environments
comfortable ear cups, easily fit over ear, I can wear for hours. Easy to put on without missing ear lobes or hair.
touch controls are great after a bit of getting used to. Pass through audio is super effective.

The Ok:
GSM interference whilst connected via bluetooth is a bit ""retro"" If phone is near face, it's quiet loud
Microphone seems to pick up a lot of ambient noise when making calls. Other end can hear me, but also traffic noises.

The Bad:
Case, albeit tidy, cannot store USB or 3.5mm jack cable, but does have storage for flight adapter?!?! which is, of course, useless without jack cable.

Really like these headphones, though! I'd recommend them, but the GSM noise just knocks some of the shine away.
(I don't know if this is a common problem on BT/NC headphones, but its the first time I've heard on a bluetooth set, last time I heard/suffered was with cabled Bose QC2 about 10 years ago before I moved to bluetooth headphones)"
452,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, excellent audio quality! My music that I stream through Google Play Music sounds amazing!

Has a feature where if I place my palm on the right headphone it will mute the music so I can hear what my wife is saying. Otherwise I can't hear her. I made my wife try these on and talked to her, and she said the only thing she could hear from me was when I made a ""sssss"" sound."
453,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just love these headphones. The noise cancellation is insane, and they sound amazing. You can tell each sound appart and they all sound in great harmony.

Best case scenario, my wife is having a ""not-so-great"" time with our kids, 2 and 4 years old, and I just fire them up listening to spotify, or even a movie on Netflix, and my peace and calm are back in an instant."
454,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After thorough research, I have concluded these are the best headphones for my personal preferences in the $350 price point. These will give you the best combination of sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation. The main qualities that helped me choose these over the bose 35 series were the follow:

Sound Quality: Based on reviews these were shown to have slightly better sound quality than the bose 35. Also, when the sony headphones are completely out of battery you can still use them as headphones without a distortion of sound quality while the bose 35 headphone sound deteriorates.

Battery Life: Sony's headphones have ~30 hours of battery life per charge while the bose 35 only last for 20 hours.

Features: The Sony headphones have more features. I particularly like the Sony headphones ability to pause sound in the headphones by cupping the right ear so you can speak to someone normally without needing to take off the headphones.

Hope my review was helpful! Please like my review if it assisted you."
455,5.0 out of 5 stars,"excellent product !!!, I love listening to music, while I go or leave my work, I love not listening to anyone while I'm with my favorite music.I bought bc qc35, compared to sony and both are excellent! Noise reduction in both, the sound a little better in the Sony. only criticism, is the touch panel of the Sony, which is sometimes confused when you turn down the volume or change the song, there strange manual control of the bose. excellent product if you like to listen to music with your cell phone and use headphones that accompany, recommended!"
456,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great and I love the touch panel that can turn up/down the volume and change sounds. However, I wore this for 2 hours and my neck began to sour because how heavy it is. Have to return it because it is not a headphone I can wear all day.
Overall it is a nice headphone if you don't mind the weight of it."
457,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the Bose QC15s and other headphones. These sound *amazing*. The noise cancelling is better than the Bose and the sound richer. As a long-time Bose user, I almost hate to say it but get these over the Bose QC15s. The Bose are a tiny bit more comfortable to me, but these are great."
458,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really excellent product. Could have a higher maximum volume. Not that I use it that high but it’s a nice feeling knowing that I’m not more than half way to the limit. I know Sony just wants to save want heating.
459,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great as long as you're listening to an audio source. But if you'd like to use them simply to block ambient noise, don't buy these as they automatically shut off after five minutes without a wired input or Bluetooth pairing."
460,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Do a very good job cutting noise in workplace or on bus.
Sound quality is decent, not amazing. Fit is a bit loose and the adjustment in the band a bit too light so it needs to be reset every time I put them on. Provided case is nice and battery life quite good."
462,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great, however in Bluetooth mode you can still tell sometimes that you are listening to Bluetooth headphones. There is still the typical Bluetooth sound signature. Don't get me wrong though, they sound excellent for Bluetooth headphones. Vocal bass is a bit weak, but instrumental bass is great. Mid-tones are good and have enough detail. Treble frequencies are very good. I find that to get the best sound, I have to put my iPhone equalizer on the treble boost setting, and as well, I have to put the Sony Connect app on it's treble boost setting also. Otherwise without these settings, the headphones sound muffled.

I find that I can have long listening sessions with these headphones without any temporary hearing loss or ear fatigue. I can not say this for all headphone I have used, so this is a positive.

The Sony mobile app has several features including a manual equalizer that works pretty well. The app has a surround feature to change the position of vocals. I don't know why anyone would want to use this feature, since it distorts already good sounding audio. The ambient sound auto-adjust feature can be turned on and off in the app. It is disabled by default.

The product is nicely manufactured and the headband does have enough pleather coated padding. I have not felt any discomfort wearing the headphones. I did not find the touchpad difficult to use; it works great. Noise cancelation is unusually good and I think this is the headphones strength. I feel that I made a good purchase. These do not sound as good as the Bowers and Wilkins P7wireless, but the ability to have very good active noise cancelation makes them a good buy. My only complaint about the headphones is that there is audible hissing during noise cancelation mode. Hopefully this will be corrected in the next model."
463,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Noise canceling works good but fit very loosely on head, you cannot move abruptly when wearing or they fall off, wish they fit tighter,also sound quality is not so great for a large headset like these, wish they were louder,don’t recommend."
464,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome headphones.....so far none of this cracking business that I keep hearing about.
Battery life really is long lasting and the NC is perfect for flights and noisy offices. It does not block out sound 100% but it is definitely good enough and if you play music then you will not hear anything else guaranteed. I have had this now for a few months and I do not regret buying it at all."
465,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are amazing. ANC is the best when compared to other headphones in the range and they look extremely stylish. I used them regularly on commutes and I was pretty satisfied with them.

The mic in the headphones are so terrible that I thought I got a defective piece and exchanged it for another one and found out that the new product also had the same problem. The person on the other end of the call cant even hear my voice over the noise in a bus/train. The same problem persisted on a not so noisy office environment. Sony should seriously consider working on fixing this issue."
466,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worked fine but the touch controls were very sensitive. Had to return.
467,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Stopped working after just a single day! The headphones would no longer turn on, and it turns out that this is an incredibly common problem that Sony doesn't like to admit to or properly deal with. In addition, I also came across countless reviews that mentioned that the old problem of the hinges and band breaking after just a few months of normal use has not been fixed. Sony has never been very good about dealing with defective products. They are very difficult to get ahold of to begin with, and they try to deny your warranty claim any chance they get. If you do manage to get the claim approved, then it takes months and months to do so.

Beyond the many problems with the headphones, the sound leaves a lot to be desired. They have good highs and half decent lows, but the mids are absolutely non-existent. My cheap $15 headphones sound better even with their tin-like highs. I will say that on the plus side they are very comfortable, and even without the noise cancellation they do a great job of blocking out outside sounds. I would much rather either go a slight step up with something like the Sennheiser HD-1 or something cheaper like the under $100 Plantronics or some other brand."
468,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best headphones I've ever owned. They sound fantastic, they feel premium, they ARE premium. It's a lot of money to drop on headphones, but if you want the best, here it is."
469,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With 30+ hrs battery on bluetooth and 40+ hrs on wire, these super comfy headphones deliver the best sound quality, with market leading noise cancellation technology by Sony. I used them in the streets of Cairo (one of the loudest cities on the globe), and it just kept all the noise out! It was magical to me as I've never experienced such thing as long with that much of comfort these headphones deliver.
I strongly recommend these headphones; They might be a bit expensive, but they are totally worth the money."
470,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, I've only had these for a few days so these are my initial impressions. (I keep updating this review as I continue to use the headphones)

I've also bought the Sennheiser PXC 550 Wireless. The Sony ANC is *much* better than the PXC.

I found the PXC earmuffs got my ears very hot even in a room less than 70º F. I can't possibly imagine using them in the summer. The room I'm is 69º F. The headphones, and my ears, are 90º F. My ears are red.

ANC: I turned on a battery driven vacuum cleaner which is *extremely* loud. I normally wear commercial grade hearing protection when working with loud equipment. I tried on the Sony ANC and the noise dropped massively. The commercial grade hearing protection let in a lot more noise. But make no mistake, no ANC is going to magically remove all noise.

Switching between the Mac and iPhone is a massive pain. I don't think Sony could have made switching more difficult. Probably easier to have two sets of headphones because if you're using the headphones on the Mac and the iPhone rings, you will never, ever be able to switch before the calling party hangs up.

I find the Sony headset controls to be confusing. The PXC were easier to use.

Connecting to Siri on my iPhone X is completely hit-or-miss. The directions are all over the place. Double tap for 0.4 seconds (seriously?) and other directions state to press and hold. I would like to make a phone call from the Sony without having to get the iPhone out but I haven't found the magical press or tap or double tap to invoke Siri and say ""Hey Siri, call Pizza"". Update: Reading a different portion of the manual, I found that tapping the headphone will activate Siri.

I found this portion of the manual confusing:

""Make a request to Siri through the headset’s microphone.
When the iPhone is in standby or playing music, hold your finger to the touch sensor control panel to activate Siri.
Siri is activated and you will hear the start-up sound.""

....then several lines down....

""Siri cannot be activated when you say “Hey Siri” through the headset’s microphone even when the iPhone’s [Allow “Hey Siri”] setting is on.""

Can someone explain the apparent contradiction in instructions above or am I really dense?

Contrary to what the negative comments regarding the microphone, I found the Sony microphone to be clear (at least according to the person I was speaking to).

I'm not an audiophile but I found the sound quality to be very, very good in Bluetooth mode.

The Sony app annoys me. Why does Sony need to know my exact location at all times (even when running in the background) to work properly. How does it matter if I'm 5th or 6th avenue? The 'Privacy' EULA is over the top.

I have had the headphones on for about 30 minutes and my ears are very, very warm. There's not a chance I could use the Sony over the ears headphones in a warm (let alone hot) environment. These would be great for keeping your ears warm in the winter.

While I'm not thrilled with Bose, I'm going to a store to compare the Sony against the QC35 II for ANC and far more importantly, ear comfort.
If the headphones are very uncomfortable (hot and sweaty), I'm not going to use the headphone regardless of how great they sound.

Ugghh. My ears are burning up in the time I've written this review -- I've got to take them off.

If you're the type of person who tends to have cold ears, then these may be perfect you (if you can figure out the controls).

I'm probably going to keep these for a niche use: I spend a lot of time in waiting rooms where the TV is blaring putting a hole through my head. Yes, I could use high-quality noise ear plugs to virtually eliminate the noise but I want to listen to something. So for the 30-90 minutes I have to wait, I can tune out the mindless screeching from the TV and calmly listen to music from my phone."
471,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great features
Supports multiple modes including ambient noise enablement when required
Excellent sound quality

Cons
LDAC only supported in Android Oreo so most Android phones will have to wait
Does not pair with TaoTronics BT transmitter so I'm unable to connect to my TV."
473,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the comfort of these headphones, but if you use them to talk on the phone, the noise can be very loud for the person you’re talking to."
474,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Liking the sound.

Update : Sound is awesome but had to return them because they were loose from side. Disappointed because I actually loved the headphones"
475,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded from a Bohm 66 to this headset. No regrets here. The sound quality build and noise cancellation are vastly superior to the Bohm 66, but its not a fair comparison is it?

Found this to be as good if not better than the QC35. At less than 300 USD on black Friday, these just beat the QC 35 hands down as my choice of a premium noise cancelling wireless headset for long trans pacific flights."
476,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and functionality, but they don’t like to always connect which is a pain to deal with."
477,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise-canceling is amazing. It can shut his voice off without me telling him to shut up. Or if u want to use the headphone just for noise canceling, it’s still good. Just mute the music and enjoy the world of silence.
By the way, just to not mislead anyone, it doesn’t completely silence the voice, if you hear some noise leaking in, it’s normal. Nothing is wrong with that."
478,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective and unreliable. Even the audio jack does not work properly!
479,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The confort and weight they offer is amazing. The sound is very good, but, coming from the MDR 950BT, the volume and bass didn't feel as loud as I'd like to. That could've been a deal breaker for some people."
480,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I own a pair of bose QC35's and got these for my wife. As they are at the same price point, I expected this to be the same or better. It's not:
1) They are not nearly as comfortable. They fit quite tightly whereas the bose fits like a pillow. My wife has to take her earrings off every time she uses these, while she can keep them on with the Bose QC35. I can wear the Bose for 4-5 hours straight - have to take the sony's off after a while.
2) Pairing multiple devices is a breeze with the bose, it's a pain in the rear with the Sony.
3) Sound quality is not on par. Sound is flatter than the Bose. Yes there is an app and an EQ for your phone, but see #4.
4) For $50 I'd like to toy with headphones. At almost $400, I want the damn things to be studio quality. I don't want an app with 5 different customisation settings. It's almost as if all the ""features"" are there to make up for lack of sound fullness.

Yes there are more features than the Bose, but this headset fails as premium headphones and that's its primary purpose.
The good:
1) Noise Cancellation is great.
2) Gesture control is nice.
3) They can play significantly louder than the Bose."
481,2.0 out of 5 stars,hard to get the headphones to work. much more difficult to use than the bose models
482,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely Comfortable, after upgrading from a pair of High-end SkullCandy Headphones, I am blown away.
If you are looking for the best features and amazing Noise Cancelling, the Sony 1000xm2's are the way to go!"
484,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi,
I am founder indexoid.com. The headphones are all right for me, I would recommend making a case made of carbon fiber, it would be better."
485,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love these !!!! They sound amazing! They Shipped very fast they smell very fresh when I opened them. Had a tiny bit of charge to test the sounds. Downloaded the Sony connect app. Extremely satisfied with this purchase. I upgraded to these from the bose QC 25. Not as comfortable as the QC25 or 35 but has more features. They came with everything that they should come with. Looks very nice wearing them. Over all love them.
486,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well the item itself is good. Noise-canceling tech is really something amazing.Once connected to my walkmanA35,the LDAC is awesome ,making the quality of the music fantastic.And its comfortable to wear on my head. However, the touch control is not so sensitive. Anyway,it's okay for me to enjoy listening to music with this product."
487,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them. Noice cancellation is amazing without that weird pressure feeling from Bose. Sound is great even though I still like my old Harman/Kardon BT more :)
488,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great noise cancelling. I wore them at the Vikings game and was able to listen to the radio broadcast. They probably saved my hearing as the crowd noise at the stadium was really loud. I've also worn them on airplanes and they work VERY well.
489,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's good
490,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best noise cancelling cans today. Unboxing experience was great. Can't ask for more accessories. Delivers great sound and noise cancellation as promised.
491,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So this was my third attempt at finding a pair of wireless over-ear headphones. My previous two were a cheaper set of Sonys and the Bowers & Wilkins PX. For various reasons, those did not work out, which led me to these. This will be the quickest I've ever returned a set of headphones. I had 4 main issues with these:

1. They did not fit on my head. Even on the tightest setting, they were too loose on my head. If I look up, they'd slide off backwards. If I look down, they'd slide off forwards. If I look left and right they slowly slide down my ears. Funny enough, I always thought I had a slightly larger than average head size, but apparently my head is not big enough to keep these headphones on them, even on the snuggest setting. This was massively disappointing as I did not see any other reviewers mention this.

2. The ear cup size is actually too small for my ears. These headphones are making me paranoid: am I a small headed, big eared freak? Seriously, the opening in each ear cup is too small to fit my ears, regardless of how much I shift them around. This made them ultimately feel like they're somewhere between on ear headphones and over ear headphones. Maybe they should brand them as Mostly Over Ear? It's uncomfortable not having your ears fit inside the cups.

3. Sound leakage. Good god these are awful in this category. It's embarrassing trying to ride the train and knowing that everyone around you can hear exactly what you're listening to. If you like to listen to music loudly, you may as well carry a boom box around because your neighbors within about 12 feet will hear everything you're listening to.

4. Swipe controls. This is the smallest complaint, and the only one that wouldn't be a deal breaker for me if it were the only issue I had with these. They're way too sensitive and I couldn't find a way to turn them off. The slightest adjustment I was trying to make to the ear cups, which happened often since they wouldn't stay on my head, would accidentally trigger the volume lowering or the song skipping or something. I'm sure with enough time I would perfect the art of tip-toe-ing around accidentally triggering the controls when adjusting the fit, but I will not own them long enough for that to happen.

So I guess I'll mention what these headphones do good: sound quality and noise cancellation. They are great at both of these things. So I guess if you're a big headed, small eared person who doesn't care that your neighbors can hear everything you're listening to, or maybe you just listen at home when no one else is around, or maybe you're just inconsiderate and don't care that everyone can hear your music, then feel free to buy these headphones. As for me, the quest to find a solid pair of wireless headphones continues."
492,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really helps me commuting to work. They truly are noise cancelling. My only grievance is the sound - wish it was better.
493,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good, but it's not comfortable to wear long period of time at least for me."
495,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best noise cancelling wireless head set available right now !! My thoughts after using it for a month.
Pros:
- It really has close to 30 hours battery life
- Very good noise isolation and cancellation. Even better than Bose QC35 II.
- Customization's for ambient noise
- Touch screen controls will need some getting to know, but when you do you will love it
- Useful companion app on Mobile device
- Wired sounds even better. Comes with a very nice and sturdy 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm aux
- Two tone color
Cons:
- These cans do tend to get hot and are not quite as comfortable as Bose for longer duration's
- MDR 1000X (it's predecessor) headbands used to crack a lot
- The case could be made better to stow the aux and usb cables

Got it during the sale for $50 off !!"
496,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Will update this review when I receive the replacement. I have had this product in my wish list for weeks, and have been visiting Target to try them on and test them - just to make sure I was making the right buying decision. You know, $299+ is a lot of money! So anyway, I bit the bullet yesterday and purchased them with same-day shipping. After I charged them up, I turned them on...paired my bluetooth...put them on...and what do you know, the left ear doesn't work at all. :(
Thankfully Amazon is sending a replacement today, so fingers crossed the new set works as expected."
497,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since other people write pro audio tech reviews, let me write something else.

the gold color is not like shining color so its easy to match any of your clothing, and its not too casual, giving even formal feeling from the smooth surface. Also its imortant to note that Im male who doesn’t look girly at all by wearing this.

In addition, its 12 degree here today, definitely good investment to walk in the NYC safely by enabling ambient mode on. I enabled voice focus mode on, and I was able to chat with my partner without taking out this headset under this cold weather.

Perfect modern urban gear."
498,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an audio engineer of many decades who has mixed music and film, I am absolutely bowled over by these headphones. They absolutely destroy my old SONY Bt-60's for audio quality. And the noise cancellation function is astonishing. Now, I will confess I have never owned a set of noise-cancelling headphones before, but as I work in a wood shop for hours each day, these things are a godsend and well worth the top dollar to me personally. The noise of my table saw which I have suffered with for years is radically diminished. And low level ambient sounds such as fans, traffic, driving in your automobile, even your shopping cart, completely disappear!

The touch-sensitive controls -- no more buttons or dials -- to adjust the phones appear very functional and superb. Now, as yet this review is not very long because I have just tested this set, but I will add to this review later as I can elaborate with more detail and experience. For the moment, it must be obvious I am in a state of euphoria."
499,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was like most people, struggling to decide to pick this or the qc35 ii. I tried both at Bestbuy and decided to go with this. The sound is much better. The media playback functions are much easier to use. Just swipe or tap on the right earcup. Mich more natural than the multi function button in Bose. This is also very comfortable enough for my 2 hour gym session. Not to mention I bought this when it was on sale. So $50 cheaper than Bose."
500,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded to noise cancelling from a pair of AKG Y50BT which came with my Samsung S8+.

Extremely impressive cans. The app is also very well done. I often work from a well known coffee chain for a few hours at a time, and it's amazing how much of the ambient noise these reduce. I really like the color, although it's not gold but more of a light bronze. Unlike some reviewers, I have no discomfort wearing for 8 hours a day, they fit nicely over my ears -- I have no hair, and don't extend the band, so maybe that's why they fit well.

One tip is that unless you use the app, you may be disappointed by the default EQ settings. I listen to mostly chillout, minimal, progressive, and other electronic instrumental music, and out of the box the bass was weaker than expected. BUT the app lets you create custom EQ settings, which allowed me to perfectly EQ for what I prefer. I'm really picky and the app satisfied my needs.

If you have the cash, I strongly recommend these!"
501,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In all honesty, this review may not give justice to how good these headphones sound. The ANC on these is so good that I can't even hear my friend talking next to me in the car while I write this review. The sounds from cars are almost completely diminished, and classroom chatter is significantly reduced. When you start playing music, you can hear only louder noises, like car horns, generators, and PA announcements. Even these sounds are dull and reduced a lot.The sound quality in these is stellar. There is no focus on either bass or treble; they are generally more balanced. You can control this in the app that you should definitely download and then get tinkering with the equalizer. The headphones are great for the flier since they can help reduce or increase the pressure, controlled through the app. The battery life is so good. I haven't even used the entire thing in an entire week, but I guess that depends on how much you use this. The only con with these is that they are pretty expensive and that if you lose them or get them stolen, that's a big loss of an investment.I could go on about the items great features, but the only way you can definitely know about it is if you buy it, which you should."
502,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wanted an upgrade from my previous ANC headphones, Beats Studio 2.0. Headphones considered: Bowers and Wilkins PX and Sennheiser PXC 550. No...I didn't even consider the Bose QC 35 2. Demoed it in the store and thought the bass was way too heavy and too similar sounding to the Beats Studio 2.0. I loved my Beats and they served their purpose well but technology changes rapidly and I wanted something with BT capabilities.

Sound is phenomenal! Crisp highs and mids without boomy, over exaggerated bass. I like my share of bass but not to a point where it takes over. I truly enjoy listening to my music in the 1000XM2! Sound is different when wireless, using a cable and with ANC on. Although different, the sound is still great in any mode. Personally, I prefer wireless with ANC on. I haven't found a need to mess with any of the setting in the app much but will explore those settings as well.

ANC is MUCH better than my previous travel and work headphones. Outside sound is muted and I feel like I'm in my own world. With my previous headphones I could still hear outside noises just not clearly. Music sounds great with ANC on or off but I do find it to be a bit different.

Comfort is EXCELLENT! Very lightweight, soft ear pads and not tight on my head/ears. I have not noticed any heat issues but have only worn them for 2 hours at a time so far. The absolute most comfortable of any of the headphones that I was able to try on or any that I currently own (V-Moda LP2 with XL ear pads, Beats Studio 2.0, JBL Synchros S700, and Logitech UE 6000)

Features are far beyond what I as using. Very easy to lear and use. The touch controls are a game changer in the headphone market! The form factor when folded and in the case is small and compact.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase. I ordered and demoed the Bowers and Wilkins PX also but they are going back. GREAT sound but the Sony WH1000XM2 is far more comfortable and I prefer the touch controls.

Update 2/19:
I finally started messing around with the Sony Headphones Connect App. This puts this product even further ahead of all others that I tried and considered. The ability fine tune Ambient Sound and ANC truly is a game changer!!! The Equalizer is another option that is included and is very helpful. Adaptive Sound Control works well but I prefer to set my own ambient and ANC settings. YES...I LOVE these headphones!"
503,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are every bit as advertised. They sound great, the base noise cancellation is incredible, the bluetooth connectivity and sound processing work over a very long range, and they are exceptionally comfortable. The one drawback from these headphones is not the device itself but rather the optional software you can download for them to your mobile device. The base noise cancellation works incredibly well. When you get into the software fine tuning it lessens the noise cancellation effect to a noticeable degree. If I could change one thing about the software I would lessen the fine tuning of the noise cancellation and add other functionality such as a pedometer. Wait, I almost forgot to mention the touch controls on the unit. They all work exceptionally well axcept the pause/play function. If you don't hit the spot exactly you might end up skipping a song. Volume and next/previous song work fine since it is a swiping action."
504,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Frequent Traveler who bought these primarily for flights.

Have Beats wired Studio noise canceling head phones, bought the Bose Q35 and compared to the Sony WH1000XM2. Also have Bose Wireless Sport headphones, Seinser wired ear buds, Bose wired sport buds, AKG buds I got with my S8 and I-Phone buds I got with my IPhone 6.

Sound Quality is subjective and very personal, my preference is the Sony's over all the headphones I currently have, non noise canceling and noise canceling.

Direct comparison to the Beats, Bose, the sound quality is preferred on the Sony as mentioned above, noise canceling very, very slight edge to the Sony, Bose and Sony are both well ahead of the Beats I own (4 year old model). Features, hands down the Sony absolutely blows away anything I've seen on the market. The App allows you to customize the noise canceling in useful, meaningful ways, has a customizable equalizer that allows you to personalize the sound in a meaningful way. The app also has surround sound settings that are gimmicky, didn't seem to do anything but take away from the sound quality. Being able to cup the right ear to turn off the head phones and hear someone is really great feature, being able to customize the noise canceling to filter out or allow voices and if you like automatically adjust based on your movement pretty cool.

On calls - I've read professional and personal reviews that all say phone calls are better on the Bose, I tested both, the Sony performed better for me, I was able to hear myself more clearly, others heard me more clearly on the Sony. The Sony's did pick up more ambient noise that was passed on to the caller on the other line.

Bluetooth connectivity is better than any Bluetooth headphones I have owned prior in regards to sound quality. Having no wires while traveling, getting on and off planes, wow, never realized what I was missing.

Comfort - Bose win out here - they are more comfortable, they cover the entire hear, create less heat around your ears and less pressure on your head, ears, face and jaw. Sony's aren't bad from a comfort standpoint but Bose is a level above any other over the ear headphones I've tried.

Overall I would say you have to try the various headphones on the market as so much of what you will or won't like about a particular pair is subjective. For me, the sound quality, the features and noise canceling won the day for me. Bose fell flat on a sound quality and feature standpoint, I actually preferred my Beats to the Bose on sound quality. The sacrifice is on the comfort front, no one beats Bose. If you are looking for noise canceling and that's a key feature, as other reviews have said, Sony and Bose are the best. If overall sound quality trumps all else, there are a couple headphones on the market that perform better on sound quality but aren't in the same ballpark from a noise canceling standpoint. Generally wired and non noise canceling sound better. The Sony's seem to strike the best compromise for me on delivering everything I want in my noise canceling headphones that are primarily for travel."
506,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far I'm pretty happy with these headphone but i'm running into an issue where the volume while playing music on wireless suddenly drops around 20% and even though my phone is playing at 100%. The battery is fully charged so I'm not sure what the issue is.

First of all I want to say that the shipping method was the best I’ve ever tried.
I’ve bought the headphones on Tuesday in the US and I’ve received the next Thursday in Sicily (IT)!
This is unbelievable and amazing!

First impression

The packaging is so beautiful, in particular the inside box.
The headphones have a simple appearance, I mean not so flashy, I like it! You can use them also to go at work and if you are not so young you don’t look like a freak!
The material are very good looking and I think also resistant. The pads are very soft and able to deaden the noise also when the headphone are turned off.
The sound is very clean and can be very loud. The control on the right pad is very précising and the “ambient trick” is very helpful and intuitive to use it.
The app gives you some features very interesting.

524,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was upgrading my Bose QC15 and here are my thoughts after 5 weeks of nearly daily use (3-8 hours per day).

Noise cancellation: Sony WH1000XM2 wins. The difference is subtle at first, until you get to use Sony for at a few hours.

Comfort: QC15 wins hands down. I can tolerate Sony headset, but it is pretty uncomfortable (and hot). QC15 is pleasure to wear.

Sound quality: QC15 wins here. Sony has a bit better bass, but anything above else just sucks, plus that hiss... Which is very unfortunate.

(nitpick) Naming: I understand ""QC15"" ""QC25""... etc, but wtf is ""WH1000XM2"", sony?

Summary: I am keeping my Sony for when I need the best noise cancellation. But will stick with QC15 for daily use."

528,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good features. Sound quality is eh.The volume is pretty low and not much bass which was a deal breaker for me. I ended up returning them, and purchased the skull candy crushers, for almost half the price.
For the price, I hate to say it, but for what u get, it's prob not worth more then half the price.
However, as of pros... They are comfortable, good weight, biuld quality, nice features with the microphone on the touch pad, noise cancelling is ok, and the pairing is prob the best thing about these headphones. The voice u hear when u turn it on is dope AF, sounds futuristic, and the Bluetooth connection is flawless and instantaneous.

This is my initial impression.
These 1000XM2 got hot within an hour.

535,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I narrowed down my hunt to upgrade my exercise music experience to three higher end headphones and couldn't narrow it further so decided to get all three to find out in side by side comparisons which would be the best for me.

[1] Bose QuietComfort 35 (Series II) Wireless Headphones, Noise Cancelling ($349.00)

[2] Beats Studio3 Wireless Headphones ($298.99)

[3] Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless Bluetooth ($348.00)

I put on the Beats and the heaviness and fit gave me the sense of an impending headache the instant I put them on. That, and the sound was empty and flat compared with either Sony or Bose. What was most surprising to me was they didn't have strong bass, which I had thought they were known for.

I put on the Sony and they were bigger but somewhat better fitting, not a lot lighter, but with more of a clear and full range from high to low.

I put on the Bose and it was surprisingly and significantly lighter and better fitting than either of the others and the sound was basically perfect. Good bass, full range of highs and lows. I have to admit that I had to switch back and forth between the Sony and the Bose about 10 times to determine if I *really* preferred the Bose to the Sony, and they were actually pretty darn close. The final point that won out for Bose was they were so much lighter and better fitting.

In addition to all of the above, as I've continued to use the Bose for 'everything' - I was most surprised when on a whim I decided to see if I could place a call with them; and my two initial callers both exlaimed that this was the BEST and clearest sound talking to me they had yet experienced (For years I've tried their patience through testing calls with 10-15 different best rated wired and wireless headpeices, ear buds et al). The rave reviews of the recipients of my calls carried from inside to outside walking the streets of NYC with all the usual sirens and traffic noise.

But most important of all, I can listen to my music in full head-filling gorgeous energizing glory when I'm exercising."
536,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound Quality: Pretty good but not great. The WH1000XM2’s have quite a lot of coloration especially in the low to mid frequency range. At first it sounds punchy and full, but over time my ears became fatigued. The Bose QC35’s have a flatter frequency response that is very similar to my AKG K240’s. In fact the EQ settings I normally use for K240’s work with just some very slight tweeking for the QC35’s, but for the WH1000XM2’s I had to use completely different settings. But in the end the Sony’s just didn’t have good clarity and stereo seperation compared with the Bose.

Comfort: At first, the Sony’s seemed on par with the Bose, but after a while the headband started to hurt me on top of my head, and I found myself constantly adjusting them, and everytime I touched them I inadvertently caused the music to pause or rewind. I can wear the bose for hours on end and hardly feel them at all.

Battery Life: I haven’t had them long enough to comment on this, but others claim they can go days without being charged, and this is believable because the Bose can do that too.

Touch Controls: I hate it. Needs dedicated buttons so you don’t inadvertently pause or skip to the next song, but all you really wanted was to adjust them on your head.

Bluetooth (pairing): Out of four different devices, I only successfully paired them to one. They paired to my Galaxy S7 but would not pair to my ipad pro. I also failed to pair them with another galaxy phone and an Amazon Fire tablet. None of the devices could see the headphones on a normal bluetooth scan. The galaxy S7 was only able to pair when I switched on the near field (NFC) function. The Bose QC-35’s have a manual pairing function that makes pairing painless.

Bluetooth Range: Very good.

Noise Canceling: Very good. Just as good as the Bose as far as I can tell.

With a little work these phones could be as good (or better) than the Bose, but right now it’s just hype. I’m sending these back btw because of the pairing issue."
537,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this headphone, however I returned it for two of the reasons below:
1. This device will shut down after 5 minutes of unused. Meaning that if you do not connect to any bluetooth device, this headphone will automatically shut down after 5 minutes. Why on earth would a Noise Canceling device have this feature without an option to turn it off? Who thinks it's a good idea to have this feature from the beginning? Even if you are connected to a device, it'll shut down if it's inactive for 5 minutes. So unless you are planning on listening to music 14 hours straight for your flight, then don't get this headphone. Why am I force to listen to music 14 hours straight just to use the ANC feature? Why can't I have quiet time? This is the reason why I bought this from the beginning.

2. The touch feature is nice on the right ear, however, anything can and will trigger this touch function. Let say you're laying down on the side, the pillow or chair will touch the right ear cup and will let ambient noises in. Seriously? we can unlock our phone using fingerprint and faces, yet Sony's Engineers can't create a touch function that will only register touch from fingers only?"
539,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, aesthetics, battery life, etc. but a couple issues in execution that prevent 4 or 5 stars.

USB Micro? Come on gang. Every time you release a product using legacy standards you have a chilling effect on adopting newer hotness. Used to not think the USB-C thing was a significant improvement, but its very nice not having to flip and fumble for that connection. Provide a cable for both USB-C to USB-C as well as a USB-A to USB-C; Since we're just using them for charging at standard USB rates, it doesn't have to be anything more than USB 2 or what-not. Literally no downside to USB-C for this kind of implementation. Or, better yet, QI maybe? Mmmmm... wireless charging... it's almost like someone willing to pay a couple hundred for premium wireless cans might be interested in wireless charging too... But for the love of all that is holy, don't use a proprietary connector (or inductive charging) like jaybird.

While we're talking about wireless and connectivity, what’s the deal with pushing the whole NFC connect? I love the forward-thinking interface, but the use-case is so small, and implementation so trouble ridden, it seems like it’s not adding any value. Yeah, conceptually it would be nice to use this instead of opening the Bluetooth connection options, but I'm usually switching between work-laptop, phone, and personal-laptop; while my phone has NFC, neither of the laptops have it, so that's kind of useless for 2/3s of my gear. Also, most people I know don't understand NFC, let alone bother enabling it on the devices that support it (my android stuff seems to default to NFC off; security risk maybe?). I suppose if they hardened the spec and everyone started using NFC for tap-to-pay then acceptance would pick up and more devices would have it, but considering Sony spun off their computers and their tablets don't even list NFC on their specs, it feels like a misguided feature that should have had the kids in marketing spend their UX thought elsewhere, like on the buttonless touch controls…

The capacitive stroking for volume and track changing is a neat trick and probably the right choice with regards to tech for physical control of the unit, but its unreliability and telegraphing make it a nuisance rather than an asset. Gotta reach up, place my hand around the can to reliably stroke the correct motion; it can take several strokes to get the motion right. Maybe put tactile guides for the finger to follow to increase reliability/consistency in motions, or, you know, maybe just a capacitive contact plate that I can feel and hold my finger on to send the same sort of signal. Less telegraphing of the finger and more consistency in sending the command (also looks less goofy than gently petting your headphones constantly).

Use similar contact plates for power-on and noise-cancel on/off settings. The current traditional buttons are too small to find easily and feel jankey when you push. Contact plates instead of a large stroke field seems like a win-win.

Finally! Connecting or powering-on the headphones causes the noise-cancelling (NC) to turn on. Considering that noise is usually not an issue and I value battery life over the NC, this is a genuine nuisance. I've already talked about the capacitive controls on the headphones increasing the complexity of interacting with the device, but continually reversing a setting I've enabled and turning on the NC every time I power-on or connect is NOT a value-add. I'm hoping there is a setting in the phone app that will allow me to disable NC on-at-connect or something (not going to hold my breath though).

Bottom line: My MDR-1RBTMK2's are more comfortable and have a more youthful aesthetic while these WH1000XM2's have a better sound stage, stay cooler on my head after hours of listening.

I think my MDR-1RBTMRK2's are still the cans to beat for wireless fidelity, battery-life and comfort but the WH1000XM2's are not bad by any means. Will keep one pair at home and one pair at work.

How they stack up against my other headphones:
- Grado 325 (best sound; literally painful to wear for long sessions; wired)

- Sony MDR-1RBTMRK2 (great sound; great battery; comfort; wireless convenience is awesome)
- Sony WH1000XM2 (great+ sound; great battery; comfort+; wireless convenience is awesome; good noise cancelling; user interface struggles.)
- Audio-Technica ATH-A900X (great sound; heavy; poor aesthetics; wired)
- Jaybird x-3 (fair sound; good battery; super portable; fit can be tricky; proprietary charger is schwag)
- Jaybird x-2 (fair+ sound; fair battery; super portable; fit can be tricky; unreliable; break frequently; great while they last)
- Sony MDRV6 (good sound; sturdy; crazy-good value)
- Various other Jaybird products (freedom, bluebuds, JB-200) (passable sound, fragile, poor range, etc., use the x lineup)
- Sennheiser MM 400-X (passable sound, pathetic battery; worthless noise canceling; fragile; expensive; uncomfortable; The only headphones besides Apple's old ipod earbuds I've ever had an antagonistic relationship with; Only positive attribute is the built-in audio pass-through; I keep them just to remind me of why I love everything else)"
540,2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones work very well at noise isolation. I used them at 2 flights and I was surprised how quiet.However i am very disappointed with blue tooth connectivity. It connects fine with my Amazon fire he but my brand new Samsung phone cannot discover it. Also my Windows 10 pc cannot discover it also.
541,3.0 out of 5 stars,"one of my first reviews ever, so: Look it's a decent bit of kit but it does definitely have some drawbacks, i'll try and stick to pro's and cons. For reference I traded in my PXC 550's for this, I don't mind my PXC 550's but they where just a bit too quiet.

Pros:
- Noise cancelling and the hand over the headphone to hear others is great, I wish it would respond just a tiny bit faster, but otherwise good
- The sound signature/profile is pretty good, i have my doubts if they have any more clarity than say the PXC 550's, but the sound signature is way more my style (think more bass, flatter dynamics I would say but in this day and age of ultra compressed music it's not too noticeable, no high-pitched tinnyness)
- WAY more comfortable than the pxc 550's, especially for those of you like me with dumbo ears.
- excellent battery life, lasts forever, but...

Cons:
- The worst by far is this: Wifi is turned off when you plug it in for charging, COME ON SONY! How hard can it be to fix that? This is why i removed two stars, this is just unacceptable in this day and age, how bloody hard could it possibly be???
- When you turn up the volume or indeed do any sort of action, the noises to indicate for example you have reached max volume are way too long, there is no need for it to take up that much space to just tell me ive hit max volume, shorten this down.
- i occasionally get odd ear pains that I think have something to do with the noise cancellation, i didn't ever get this with the PXC 550's (to be fair, this may be due to the pxc 550's never forming a true seal around my ears since the pads on the pxc 550 where too small for my envy-of-elephants ears)"

552,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I spend months researching premium headphones I watched every review/comparison on YouTube and I decided on the Sony 1000xm2 and the reason being the only difference I could find between these and the bose qc35 and that's the features.
Features: the swipe motions are amazing seemed kinda like a gimmick but fell in immediately after using them.
Sound Quality: is amazing, I'm no audiophile but I have pretty high standards for $350 and these do not disappoint. I love the sound profile of these plenty of bass, beautiful mids and most importantly the highs didn't give me listening fatigue, which I get very easily. These are actually the first headphone that sound so good I don't want to sing with the music because I want to hear the sound in all its glory.
Noise cancelling: the true negative of these headphones. The noise cancelling is underwhelming to say the least. Maybe there is no thing as headphone that completely cancel noise but for noise cancelling to be in the title, they don't cancel really anything. At best they muffle sound which is more annoying because it still distracts me.
Overall: great headphones with bad noise cancelling(muffeling) if noise cancelling is what you really want I'd get the bose qc35, which is what I might do."
553,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Shipping box and product box arrived unscathed and in great condition. Headphones themselves looked brand new, except for some potentially shoddy adhesive work near the joint where the headphones themselves can fold in on themselves (the glue work looked like something you'd expect from a child during arts and crafts). Despite the hefty price tag of these headphones, this aesthetic 'whoops' could have been overlooked if the product performed as expected. Unfortunately, the box did not include the airplane adapter and the audio input cord said to be included with the product. Most importantly, the item failed to pair with multiple Bluetooth devices. It is as if I was shipped a poorly refurbished and/or returned item cataloged as brand new. I was going back and forth on whether to purchases these versus the Bose equivalents, and I now am kicking myself for ever straying away from Bose to begin with. Luckily Amazon's and SquareTrade's customer support were both supportive in processing my full refund."
554,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that I made a mistake in purchasing these. Yes they sound good. That's not a matter of question. Maybe if you're an audiophile, they won't be up to snuff for you.

What I really purchased these for was the noise cancelling. And let me say that they are barely any better than my Cowin E7s in that regard. I was hoping these could take voices down to a whisper, remove highway noise, and keep my coworkers from driving me insane with their lack of basic understanding of inside voices. Guess I'll be going insane.

Noise cancelling tech needs work. Until then, these are noise slightly reducing at best."
555,1.0 out of 5 stars,There are so many reasons not to buy these headphones that i actually returned them recenently for a refund. First the sound quality is low to average at best i have a pair of in ear headphones that blows these away. Second they are so uncomftable that it hurt my ears to wear them after a few hours. Third they are know to have issues and eventually break. Last but by no means least the noise canceling dosnt work as it should. There is even a feature to make things louder around you and it refuses to block out voices listing it as a feature and improvement.
556,5.0 out of 5 stars,"... It's the right choice. (Insert Mic Drop Here). 1 month in, it is the best of the best."
557,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing anc! Built in microphone is great. Sound was not the best I heard. It has a good base but not that accurate
558,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have waited for some time to post a review to see if there was a solution to a problem with these headphones. The noise cancellation function is excellent. Unfortunately, it only works if the headphones are connected to a device. If not, they switch the noise cancellation off after about ten minutes.So, they cannot be used to just block out noise on aircraft trains or on the road. This makes them much less useful for me , since I bought them primarily for peace and quiet on the road.Perhaps Sony can find a way to fix this. Until then, three stars."
559,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The good:
-Great app that accompanies these headphones. --Can adjust noise cancelling sensitivity and the equalizer easily.
-Very comfortable
-Good sound quality

The bad:
-headphones crackle on takeoff in airplane
-headphones pickup noise from air vents above you on an airplane
-microphone has no noise cancelling for phone calls
-leaning up against the window on an airplane will activate 'voice control' which is not possible to turn off on iPhones. Terrible disruption while trying to sleep with the headphones on.

I have been flying with the headphones for the past month and will be returning these headphones and trying a different brand due to the bad outweighing the good. Overall, have not been very happy with the quality of the noise cancelling on these headphones."
561,3.0 out of 5 stars,There is noise when I go to the subway.
562,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a headphone ever!
563,4.0 out of 5 stars,good
564,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to like these headphones.
I also own bose QC 25 and the 30
But considering that these the most expensive ANC BT option at the moment, they really aren’t worth the cost. Here is the problems:

- Touch control on the earcups are a gimmick and they are not practical. If you wear a hoodie or a coat with a hood you will have trouble using the earphones.

- most of the features of the app ar gimmicky - like the one that never works that should keep track of your position with the gps and change settings, it’s neevr accurate and just a mess. Or the altitude detection, what is that supposed to do? Or the silly haadx which is supposed to add frequencies to an mp3 to make it sound like a wave file... silly gimmicks.

- noise isolation is not as good as the bose QC. Part of the reason is that the earcups cannot seal at all if you have glasses

- when anc is on and you are not listening to anything, there is constant hiss. Bose don’t have this. It’s unacceptable!!

- there is a cracking noise coming randomly during playback, I had to make sure this was indeed from the headphones. I’m not sure if it’s because the headband is vibrating when the volume is high, as this headset is very prone to amplify physical vibrations and create artifact sounds out of it with the ANC chip

- sound is not very balanced, lack in the definition of bass and the bass is overall too present for acoustic music. I could live with that if the rest was on point, but those are not an audiophile earphones by any extent.

My bose broke twice in a row, their quality is not great either, so I wanted to find an alternative but Sony is not it. About to return them after 15 days of extended testing. Will get the bose again with a warranty since the QC35 break very easily but overall they have better reliability and sound."
565,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best headphone ever purchased. Nice sound quality, impressive noise cancelling, and the headband seems been improved. This is a little heavier than the Bose QC35 but i find the weight & comfort just fine.
Cons: No Bluetooth 4.2 or 5.0."
566,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to like these soo bad, but ultimately they are grossly overrated. They have great sound quality and feel good to wear but they have one critical flaw which forced me to return two units.Noise canceling is decent but the major issue I encountered on both units I received is that when Noise canceling is enabled and the volume is turned up past about 70% there is major distortion. I have sensitive hearing and the distortion makes it unenjoyable to use in instances in which I have to turn the volume up high like when I am mowing the lawn. Also, LDAC connectivity is also spotty at times. Overall they are great Headphones, with an awesome companion app but headphones at this price range should not distort at high volumes."

574,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Big disappointment. I bought these to replace my Sennheiser headphones, because my new phone requires Bluetooth headphones. Compared with the Sennheisers, the construction feels cheap, and the sound is thin and hollow."
575,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphone is making ""white noise""/static sounds on the Left channel while ANC is on. Heavy emphasis on the Right channel as the main vocal and mid bass contributor. There is a clear imbalance in the sound distribution.

Did I get a dud?"
576,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile, and currently have one good headphones (AKG K701) that are not really portable and I use them mostly when working from home (sound leakage, open design). I am looking for polyvalent wireless headphones, mostly to listen while working 8h / day. Tried the Skullcandy Hesh 3 Wireless Headphone, Black (S6HTW-K033), the Sennheiser HD 4.40 Around Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphones (HD 4.40 BT), the Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Case - Gold and the Bose QC35II. Did compare them on various musics, rock, pop, classic, ... .

Bottom line: The only one I kept are the Hesh 3! Not for myself as I felt the comfort was not great (too tight / clamping pressure, burning ears after 1h listening), but for commute / smaller listening periods (i.e not full workday), they are great. Bluetooth is stable, sound quality is good. I'll keep looking for a comfy work-polyvalent headphones, probably give up the bluetooth criteria as I'm disappointed by the sound quality of the Sony & the Bose, and I'm not ready to put 350$ for 100$ audio quality level.

Sound quality:
Sony and the Bose are OK, but that's it, just OK, not great and not what I expect from 350$ headphones.
Hesh3 have well defined bass (not too boomy, just what's needed to make it a fun headphones to listen to). Very good spatialization. Grabbed them at 80$ on black friday, and for my uneducated ears, they compare more to the Sony & the Bose than with my AKG K701 (not in the same category :-)). TBH, the sony & bose are a bit more clear than the Hesh3, but ... I feel the Hesh3 are more ""fun"" and would be my choice here.
The clear looser here are the Sennheiser. They are disqualified from this review. Stay away from them, my 10y-old 15$ Koss are better. No spatialization, bad for rock, for pop, for classic... Might do for techno / podcasts.

Build / comfort:
Hesh 3 feels a bit plastic like at opening, but you quickly forget it. Comfort is so-so, you definitely feel them more than Sony & Bose. More clamping pressure, lower quality ear pads.
Sony feels good and are probably the winner, I'm just a bit worried about the touch control thingy, what happens after the warranty expires ? Do you pay 200$ for repair if this stop working or bug ?
Bose earpads feel less durable, BUT, they are the comfort winner. If you have money and want to buy a light, comfy headphones, go for it. Sony are the 2nd best in these models.

Bluetooth:
Hesh3: all good.
Sony: I sent them back because... they kept jumping on my macbook. If I looked left or right, the sound will jump. If I walk 2 meter away from the laptop, it will jump. Worked good with my iPhone, but ... it's the only BT headphones I tried that was disqualified because of this. Not acceptable for this price range.
Bose: did try them only 30min, but they seemed good.

Sound leakage / isolation:
Hesh3: no active noise cancellation, but cost 5 time less than the competition. I don't need that much noise cancellation and what they provide is enough to work in a open space, very little sound leakage.
Sony / Bose: amazing. You put them on, and feel isolated from a lot of background noise. If you're looking for peaceful commute, they are worth it. The mic from the Sony did seems to pick less background noise in the few calls I tried."
577,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have pained over the reviews to look for clues to see which unit I should purchase. I compared these to the Bose in a big box store with the same ambient noise and they were better than the Bose for noise cancellation. I use the headphones on airplanes for noise cancellation, with and --here is the key -- often without music playing. These phones turn off after five minutes if they are not connected to a device. That is a spectacular feature [I am trying to be positive this year]. The engineers at SONY need to take a course in reality. I also had trouble with one of the speakers on phone. I have returned the device. Back to the drawing board."
578,1.0 out of 5 stars,"turns off after 5 min if there is no Bluetooth. according to sony it is for power saving, and that's it. can't use it just as noise canceling, unless you drain your phone power, or have a wire connected to it. Sony refuses to acknowledge or offer a solution.
the noise canceling and sound quality are very good,but since I bought it, I mainly use my old headphones because the foam is tight on my ears. If I had small ears and (I think they are average), and there was a way just to use the noise canceling, I would had given a better score. If I want to sleep in a noisy place, I have to stick in a headphone cord to prevent the automated shutdown. Pretty lame for a $350 set."
579,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality Is not what they said at all.
Just so you can have an idea, AirPods sound better!
Only positive thing I can’t denie Is isolation."
580,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These shut off automatically unless they are connected to a device by bluetooth or have a cord plugged in. This is the most idiotic design imaginable. Can't connect to your phone or computer during taxiing, takeoff, landing, etc.? Hahahaha, every five minutes it says ""powering off"" and shuts down. Then it's loud time for you until you turn them back on. THEY SHUT OFF EVERY FIVE MINUTES. Whose idea was that??? Flying and just want noise canceling and don't want bluetooth on or put a plug in? Too bad. THEY SHUT OFF EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

Apparently the work around is to stick a plug in the plug hole but I have a better idea -- Don't have idiots who never fly design your noise canceling headphones that are idealized for flying. Outrageous.

I'm not sure whether I'll return them or just get a little plug and resent the designers every time I fly. No bueno.

That said, the sound is good."
581,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I changed the review from 1 to 4 stars
Despite the very annoying bug below, where headphones shut off every 5 minutes (unless you have an active connection)
the noise cancellation is amazing. Much better than Bose qc35. I tested both, and Sony has much better
You have to experience the noise cancellation on these to really understand how good it is. Go from a noisy background to tranquility when you put them on. The best on the market, but let down by the bug (see below), and poor quality app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Headphones automatically shut off every 5 minutes. So can’t easily be used just for noise cancelling

There are 2 work arounds for this
1) Have it connected via blue tooth to a cell. (not practical as you need to dedicate a cell phone , with a blue tooth connection to each head set)
2) Plug in a dummy wireless jack and have a dangling cord (this is not practical when you are using the headphones in bed, to help you sleep)

This is such a stupid feature, that could so easily have been fixed
It is a deal breaker, if you just want a pair of headphones for noise cancelling.

So, I am going to give it 1 out of 5 as a protest.
Sorry Sony, but these headphones are sold as ""the best noise cancelling headphones on the market""
But turn themselves off every 5 minutes"""

585,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I ended up returning these immediately. They smell like formaldehyde and would need some serious time to offgas (gross), but worse, they just didn't sound good. Maybe I was naive in thinking that super pricey bluetooth headphones would sound as good as my corded Sennheiser noise cancelling ones, but they don't. The noise cancelling function makes the audio sound thin and weak, and the ""ambient"" function just adds some weird noise on top of that. Unimaginable for the cost."
586,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Well good sound.

I Just Expected A Lot Better In The Main Departments Of Bluetooth Headphones With The Features That They Have."
589,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the worst designed and most buggy products I've bought in a long time. The noise cancellation was great--for 2-3 minutes at a time. After that, it would cheefully inform me that ""noise cancellation is off"", and then act like a pair of regular, dumb headphones. I should say ""exceptionally uncomfortable headphones"". No matter how I adjusted the tensioning, the top of the band pressed paiinfully into my head. I had to put a folded washcloth between me and the headphones to make them (barely) comfortable. After an hour of repeated rebootings, I gave up and put the headphones back in their nice case, ready to return for a refund. The woman next to me on the plane had some Bose headphones, which she let me try. They were much more comfortable. My advice: skip the Sony, and go directly to Bose."
590,1.0 out of 5 stars,for the price very dissapointed

597,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LITERALLY got here in less than 24 hours with free Prime shipping, though I have no idea how, as I live WAY out in the boondocks! Either way, I was stoked to see them arrive, as they have amazing noice-cancellation features! Not nearly as comfortable as my old Bose QuietComfort 15s, but the noice-canceling is way better and the sound is almost comparable. I think I need to deepen the bass a little on my app settings, but so far I love these headphones, and am looking forward to using them on some long distance flights coming up soon. Loving the touch pad controls as well!"
598,5.0 out of 5 stars,Some said this one didn't beat the Bose QC35 and the fancy features were gimmicks. They were soooo wrong. I love the navigation and volume control gestures on the right ear cup. Brilliant design! Noise cancelling is stellar and sound quality is terrific. I am very satisfied. Pairing to my HP laptop and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is a breeze. Havn't figured out the NFC pairing thing yet.
599,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These ROCK, good everything...Better than QC35, Bass is solid, almost as good as Bose, but I love everything else...as well as Longer battery life, Vol Controls are awesome gesture driven by swiping on Right Earcup surface. Lots of refinements, voice prompts a bit obnoxious. and once you get to know the button placement... As there is different modes of Sound Cancelling that are overkill, but I can see their point. You know Sony tries so hard...and these are Solid and Better than their predecessors by a long shot. Comfortable, as the earcups are a bit bigger for Big Elephant Ears...."
600,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am obsessed with these. They cancel so much noise, sound beautiful, and look very cool. They are pretty heavy and relatively large though. Not really an outfit addition, but that didn't matter to me. I use them to commute and block out people talking at work. They make commuting bearable and they work great. I love the feature that temporarily dims your music and boosts ambient noise. It makes it so easy to talk to people without pausing and taking off my headphones. I tried the newest Beats and Bose and other popular leading headphones, and they didn't match the noise cancelling and sound quality of the new Sonys."
601,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been looking for a good headphones for long-term use. I am not a sound engineer but I used many headphones, from cheap ones to premium ones I have experience with headphones. First of all this headphone is definitely awesome, noise canceling works like a magic and sound quality is very good, I love the Headphones app as it gives you chance to have more control over it (I like changing the VPT so much!). Many people choose Bose because they say this headphones makes their ears sweat afterwhile, bro when I read that I said okay I am buying this, IT IS A FEATURE IN CANADA, Thanks to this headphone I do not even use ear muffs outside ( Even at home, it does not disturb me until I use it for 2 hours)

Noise cancelling

602,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered these headphone sometime in December. Best headphones ive ever had. I purchased these because i had a pair of the beat Solos and was sorely dissapointed, heart broken actually, that the Cushions started coming off, and the Bluetooth connection stopped working all within 6 months, they also stopped accepting a charge. I could only use them with an AUX cord. For the ""Beat Solos"" to be as expensive as they were they should not have had that problem. So i chose to spend my money and put my trust in these Sony headphones instead. definitely glad i did. ill never go back to ""beats"". So far havent had any problems with the band cracking on these but if i do i will update this review. and i use them almost everyday."
603,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so undecided as to which headphones to buy. So I bought both. The reviews were so good on both of them.

I listened both, side-to-side, for eight hours. This is what I found.

Sound quality:
Sony: Very bassey, almost too much on some songs. I believe this is because of the Hifi setting in the app for high definition songs. The nicest thing as far as musically, the music sounds more lyrical. Now keep in mind, I’m coming from regular Apple headphones. However, being a musician — there was a certain musicality to the Sonys.

Bose: The Bose was very balanced, unfortunately too much where everything sounded generic. It was well kept within a neutral line, and never dipped below or above it. It kind ruined the music of some pieces.

Comfort. Both legitimately were comfortable. They fit both of my ears fine.

The biggest thing beside the sound being better, I actually like the “gimmicks”, of the app and the head piece. It made the headphones a little bit more tech, and less just a headphones.

So if you’re on the fence, pick these up.

Unless you’re more attuned to higher trebles in singing, and neutral sounds, then get the Bose. However if you want the headphones to have lyrical sounds, then the Sony.

You’ll enjoy them."
604,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the unit. It has great sound in my opinion and I never have had an issues so far (1 month). I enjoy the app and the features. They're very intuitive. I use it for making phone calls and no one has had a problem with hearing me. If I did it all over again I'd get this unit. I'm very pleased and impressed.
605,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m very impressed by these headphones. I’m a novice audiophile coming from using open air Grados for years. Noise reduction in flight is remarkable - even without music, cabin racket turns into a faint, white noise. More quiet than even wearing ear plugs - it’s kind of surreal. I always used buds for music on planes, which got me by, to a point I could hear the music. But with these it is possible to appreciate subtleties of what’s playing. Even in a quiet office setting, it’s amazing how much background drone these can cut out, which really brings the music out. Battery life is great as well. Sony claims 20ish hours - I have surpassed that by a few hours on every charge so far. In a very quiet setting, I’ll still give the sound quality to any set of Grados. But if you’re looking for serious noise cancellation and great fidelity, I can’t imagine you can do better at this price point."
606,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best headphone I've ever bought and even better noise canceling than my Bose QC 25. I have compared this cans and Bose QC 35 at BestBuy and fell in love at first try. Sound wise Sony is better than Bose, not too mention it has adaptive noise canceling. I know $300+ is not cheap but you get premium quality and one of the best around. The battery can power up to 25 hours and no need to charge more than a week.
I have several cans range from AT, Bose, Phillips, AKG and Beats and this Sony is the best I have."
608,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't fully utilize all the features because the application for Android never detects that the headphones are connected via Bluetooth. Tried both NFC and manual connections.

In terms of sound, I can't tell much difference between this and the Bose. Unless the app is updated soon these are likely going back."
609,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these mainly for use in an very large office space where it can get quite loud, and the low frequency droning noise of the aircon buzzing in my ears annoys me to no end.

Coming in knowing it won’t get rid of a lot of the voices, I was rather surprised it drowned it out quite well, to be degree of voices of people talking loudly a desk away from me sounds distant. It amazed me how putting the headphones on, the noise of the aircon literally disappeared, couldn’t help but whisper “wow...” under my breath.

With noise cancelling on, I have music gently pumping away to just further get rid of whatever higher frequency noises the headphones forgivabley let slip by, and it’s blissful.

Fast charging is ridiculously fast on this thing and it typically lasts me up to a week of use at work for a 9-5 job where I will probably use it for 2-3 hours total throughout the work day, and another hour or two at home, music playing from my iPhone.

Clarity of audio is decent, don’t expect pumping heavy, brassy audio from these, as they’re not meant for audiophiles, however, they still manage to pack a punch, and the EQ settings from the official app allows for some finer tuning to your liking (I sometimes use the extra bass preset, works well).

Comfort wise, after an hour of use, I do find it a bit uncomfortable on my ears, mainly because my ears stick out very slightly, but it’s not as bad as other headphones I’ve tried. No pressure find on top of my head.

Bluetooth is strong and works at quite a decent distance.

5/5, surprised at effectiveness. Recommended to my colleague who bought his the week I got mine."
610,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have above average sound, amazing noise canceling, and are super comfortable... except for the fact that they warm up my ears very quickly. After about 30 minutes, my ears would be burning and bright red. It would take several hours for the sensation to go away. I think this is because the earpads don't provide for much breathing room, or maybe the material just didn't agree with my skin. If it weren't for this issue, these headphones would be 5 stars. Ultimately, I had to return them because it just wasnt possible to wear them for longer periods, my ears would get too warm."
611,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely a fantastic pair of headphones. The noise cancelling is ridiculous as I remember back in the 90's when noise cancelling had a buzz in the background. With these there's just a beep and suddenly everything goes quiet. It's pretty unnerving the first few times you do it, but having the option for ambient sound is amazing when walking through the city. The quick attention mode is great too to catch announcements on intercoms and such.

There are some annoying things about the headphone, but they are definitely not Sony's fault and more Android's fault. Android 8.0 / 8.1 have some bluetooth issues where using any codec other than SBC completely borks the mic making the headphones useless for taking calls or using assistant. I'm going to pretend I can tell the difference between SBC and LDAC so I would recommend you use that on any Android 8.0+ devices. That being said for me those were minor cases because the mic is not great as it picks up everything and the point of these are for listening to music anyways."
612,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise headphones works pretty much as expected. Is easy to pair, the app communicated with the headphones flawlessly. The noise-cancelling aspect works well with certain kind of noises (e.g. wind noise, fan noise, AC noise etc) but not so well with human talking. When wearing headphone, it does look fatter than say Bose QC 35, which might make you look ridiculous in public places. Battery life is really excellent and when use somewhat sparingly, simply refuses to die. However, I do notice that the top of the headphone has some paint chipped off from day 1 even though I did not mishandle it (picture attached). It doesn't affect the performance of the headphone though but just looks annoying."
613,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these after checking out an older pair at Costco and reading the reviews. I have several headphones now (I think I’m turning into a collector). These sound pretty good and love the ability of using the EQ in the app to customize what I’m listening to. So far so good!

Noise cancelling is excellent... wish they got a bit louder, but will suffice.

Update 4/1/18: Well, apparently the thing about ""breaking in"" headphones is true, the sound on these things have really opened up a bit.. and they are incredible sounding... I have tried many different genres of music as my taste is eclectic. Color me impressed.. the sound separation in musical instruments is amazing."
614,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very expensive, but you get what you pay for. These are incredible headphones. As a college student it is often that I pull these out of my backpack and enter into beautiful silent study. They cut out a very large amount of outside noise. They excel at blocking out ambient noises like fans, and other background noise, but they also reduce other sounds significantly like talking. These have been priceless for me. I can focus literally anywhere by putting these on. They work very well even when I'm not listening to music, and just using them to block outside noise. But when I turn on some soft classical music and zone in on my homework, I feel completely isolated and can't hear a thing around me. It hurt me to spend so much on these headphones ( I paid full price, $400), but I would buy them again and again. They have been an extraordinary investment."
615,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a previous pare of Sony noise cancelling headphones and these by far are superior. On an airplane these can cancel almost 100% of the ambient noise. They are also comfortable enough to sleep in during the flight. Unlike my other Bluetooth headphones these never lose the signal, stays strong any distance in my house. I highly recommend these!"
616,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a user of high end Sony in-ear headphones for the better part of a decade, and held off on noise canceling because I suffered from that weird feeling when it was on. Bose were also the choice for the longest time, and I never really liked the sound of them compared to non-bass boost Sony products. So that's where I'm coming from.

Recently I got some Apple AirPods for running, though, and just loved the freedom from wires. After catching my headphone cords on something I asked why I wasn't going bluetooth for my ""nice"" headphones.

I ended up going with these because they'd received great reviews from audio experts and it seemed like noise canceling had come a long way.

In actual experience...
- Sound quality is great. Way better than my in-ear Sonys. I didn't expect that.
- Noise canceling still bugged me at first, but I got used to it, and on balance I now really like it. I knocks down so much ambient garbage. I would kid myself on airplanes that the earbuds did a good enough job, but they don't. Not even close. These are great.
- Bluetooth is very strong. I sometimes forget my iPhone X on the desk and can walk across the house without a problem.
- Touch controls are actually great. I was a little worried about them, but they are easy to use once you get it.
- Battery life is great. Occasionally I'll think to charge them and have never run out.
- Case is really nice.
- Included cable works well if you end up needing it.

One complaint... The ear pads are a little too small, so my ear ends up touching the foam covering the driver. This makes them uncomfortable for long periods. I've seen online that you can actually use replacement Bose ear pads to bump them off your ears, and have taken them apart with a collar stay to see how to do it, which is very easy. So it's possible I'll make that upgrade, though I'm reluctant, because the replacement pads are kinda ugly. Oh well.

But overall, I'm really happy with these, despite the fact that they're so stinkin' expensive."
617,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Premium headphones in look and build quality. When I put these on, the outside world is silent. Different listening modes means you will enjoy all of your music like new again. The headphones feel comfortable. The touch controls are intuitive and an added bonus for tech junkies. Wow, get these. Life is short, listen to music."
619,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Most comfortable thing I have ever put on my head. Turn it on and it connects quickly, the noise cancelling immediately cutting in and transferring you to another world. Sound quality is stellar. These headphones are so good that it makes it hard to put anything else of lesser quality, basically every other product in existence, on you head or in your ears. After using these, you do get kind of spoiled. The touch features for pausing, calls, volume, and next and previous are easy to use, definitely a plus to not have to pull your phone out to make these kinds of adjustments. The rose gold color also looks amazing, far better than any other headphones around the office."
620,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a pair of amazing headphones.
- I absolutely love the sound and noise cancellation. Helps to listen to what I like isolating myself from noisy surroundings.
- Long lasting battery charge, which is very important when you have wireless headphones.
- Very stylish and elegant.
- Super comfortable.
- Not the best for calls, though. But I don’t care. These headphones are for listening, not for talking!"
621,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My ear is a little pain, and this get harder to bear after 2-3hours. So pain. I wear glasses and I feel headache after like 2-3 hours. Noice cancelling function is great, but this cannot connect to my mbp. The gesture controlling is not good on my phone...."
622,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pair of headsets, but I have bumped an arm or hand (and one point someone tapped on my right headphone) which pretty much skipped my audio book ahead a few chapters. I really wish the app would allow you to disable some of the control points on the headphone. I truly only need to pause and play. Vol up/down and skip fwd/back is not a necessity I need to have.

Love the EQ options and available when the headset is connected to a phone, but when you connect it to the kindle fire.. there is no sony headphone app equivalent in the kindle app store. Which brings up that one kick-in-the-nuts that the Bose competing headset has over this one, in which it can connect to two devices at the same time.

On the plus, I'm loving the option of ambient sound. I believe this is exclusive to only Sony compared to Bose as their equivalent only has an option of high/low/off for noise control. All and All, I think this comparison would be split upon personal preferences and use environments.

I have yet to see if the hands free options for noise control when standing, walking, in motion, and running {running is not an option for this headset} works when you're connected to a device without GPS, but I'm sure you will lose this feature on a device without GPS (like my kindle fire). So without the dual device connection, the app is pretty much useless when connected to devices without the app support.

Without owning the equivalent headset, this is my review thus far. I think Sony has taken a big swing at a lot of options, but the smaller issues are starting to annoy me to a point in which one day I may not be ok with saying this is acceptable for a $300 pair of headphones while the bigger advantages go unused because my preferred listening device is not a GPS enabled phone and is not a device that has the sony headphone app to support it.

Without the highs, I'm left with normal and irritating lows in which I might look to either buy a lower priced version with the same options I do use, or look for something that fits a bit tighter to my lifestyle right now at or near the same quality. For now, it feels like I bought a Ferrari, but all the streets in my city has random pot holes with a max speed limit of 55 mph."

624,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect design&Perfect noise cancelling technology&Very good sound with perfect base. It may not make you feel as comfortable as QC35 but the hand gestures and the base part will pay you back. Just a little bit complain about the app design. Other than that, perfect!"
625,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these for several hours now and so far i am very satisfied with my purchase. I did a lot of research and decided on these over the Bose QC35 and i believe i made the right choice. My co-worker has the Bose and i wasn't all that impressed with the sound, their volume seemed really low even when it was all the way up, but they are lighter and it could be argued, more comfortable than these.

These headphones offer great noise cancellation and amazing sound. I listen mainly to instrumental music like original scores and even my previous audiotechnica headphones which i thought were very good (for the price anyway, no comparison here) fell short in reproducing clear sound in certain notes. These so far have mastered every single note. The sound is loud and clear always.

My previous headphones weren't wireless or noise cancelling, so these are an upgrade for me and while they are not as lightweight as the Bose i have no complaints in regards to comfort; they certainly feel very comfortable to me. I think the app that comes with them could be improved and the software all together could be made easier to manage, but i do use it and it works fine for me, it just seems a bit more complicated than it probably should be.

The headphones also seem very sturdy and i haven't heard any cracking sound or any sound coming from them when i move as some people were reporting. They feel so well built that i seriously doubt i will have any problems with any cracking, but we'll see."
626,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these from Amazon.com and have am thrilled with the sound quality, active noise cancellation, and comfort. The battery life is excellent.

Things you should know: Your phone or digital device must support AptX HD or LDAC in order for you to experience the sound quality that these are capable of while in Bluetooth mode. SBC is a lossy connection standard and the sound quality is noticeably poorer in this mode. This will be true for any high-end Bluetooth headphone. So you're wasting your money if your music source can't support better codecs. LDAC is built into Android Oreo (8.1.0). Related to this issue, some features in the application are only available when the phones are connected using SBC, which means if you want the equalizer, sound stage, or sound location features, you need to sacrifice the overall quality. Fortunately these are mostly useless features, so I just leave the connection in LDAC.

You can't disable the gesture feature on the right can, which can be irritating. You will unintentionally lower or raise volume, skip songs, etc. if you play with your headphones at all. There should be a button on the device to disable or enable gestures. For an expensive set of headphones, I would expect this feature to be there. That being said, the gestures are very convenient while traveling.

The charging cable is micro-USB and isn't very fast. Instead of a charge full indicator (e.g., a green light), the red light simply turns off. I would expect a better system for this given the quality of this device. I would expect a type-C connector with much faster charging.

All that said, I recommend these headphones. With LDAC support, the sound quality is outstanding for a wireless pair of phones. I took these on multiple train rides and flights and these phones blocked out most of the ambient noise. I also worked in a coffee shop for hours on end and these phones blocked out groups of teenagers and kids playing around. I've heard the ANC isn't as good as the Bose QC 35 II, but I find the level of noise cancellation more than sufficient."
627,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's nice comfortable noise cancelling headphone and I love it. It's a little heavy as it has an incredible battery life. But after I spend 3 days to get used to it, I can enjoy my music for like 20 hours and rarely feel it now.
I have to say it still have a little flaw that most reviews I read didn't mention. That's it's gonna be a little like electrical noise sound after I've listen for about 20 hours. It did bother me for a few minutes, but it disappeared after I charged it. I will update this review if I find more problems."
628,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon likes to fiddle with the price on these. I gave $348 and then soon after they dropped them to $298. Looks like they're back up to $348 now. They're pretty nice headphones and the noise canceling works very well. The office can be really loud with several conversations going on and I can put these on and put on some gentle music and all of their troubles disappear.

The sound quality is really nice, and I love the touch interface. It works very well.

I'm still a little concerned about the possible breakage but so far they've held up for four months of regular use. They are a little slippery and could probably stand to be a little tighter fitting, but adjusting them back to where they belong is easy enough. I will also mention I have a relatively narrow shaped head, so people with a larger head probably won't have a problem."
630,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I belive this headfone should be ine of the best in the market. The sound quality is impressive, the features really works well and do what they promise. The active noise canceling does an amazing job without giving you any kind of headaches or any sizzles. Of course is an expensive toy but for those who are looking for the newest in technology's this is the option. The case and the finish are premium quality. Now, I expect sony could do this awesome job in a wateresistance device. I don't know if this is possible due to the mics which must capture the noises to cancel those but if could, woulb be amazing to wear it in rainy days."
631,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a great head phone. It is comparable to the other brand with well recognized for noise cancelling head phone. I like the case and the wire jack more than the other brand. The case a soft separator between ear cups to prevent scratch. The head phone use standard 3.5mm for wire input while the other brand use 2.5mm.
I subtract one star because of the touch control. I do like the cover the right ear cup to temporary stop noise cancelling function. I have problem with Volume up and forward track. The head phone mis-interpret a few times."
632,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Comparing to the Bose QC Series I have, this is OK. The plus on this is the iOS app having the ability to adjust the noise cancellation and calibrate it. It can be used both as a wireless or wired headphone. Listening to normal music was good, such as adult contemporary. However, when listening to classical music, piano music, or instrumental music, there is a variation of static sound when it hit a particular pitch. It is quite annoying when you are trying to listen to calm music. But if the purchase is to listen to current modern rock or hip-hop, this does an ok job."
633,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I tested out the bose 35i and the beats and the Sony headphones are so much better. Though these are a bit heavier than the bose, they are just as comfortable and superior to the beats in comfort. I wear glasses and they still give me a great fit even after hours.

The app is great too. It adjusts the noise canceling features based my movement."
634,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are some great headphones!

I don't travel all that often, so I mainly use these at work and in coffee shops. It completely blocks out the sound and I often forget people are around. The only time I can hear some sounds is when the I'm in between tracks. When listening to podcasts it feels like you're out in the audience listening. i often close my eyes to complete the experience.

These are very comfortable for me. I have small ears that fit perfectly inside the cups. I read in reviews that it can get uncomfortable for people with bigger ears. Will definitely use these on my airplane ride back home!"
635,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is amazing for Bluetooth. The app. allows for further customization of the sound. Bose still has the edge for clarity, but Sony is better balanced and reproduces a more accurate sound. It also handles some genres (pop, rap, rock) better than Bose. Hands off to Sony for a great product."
636,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I listen to a lot of classical music and found the sound quality of these headphones much superior to Bose, which is just not crisp enough. But after a transatlantic flight, even though the sound cancellation was great, my ears felt sore, so I gave them to my daughter, who has smaller ears. The headpiece also felt uncomfortable. It could use some padding. I'll probably buy them again because the sound was that good, but I'll have to limit how long I wear them."
637,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not going to go into any detail, but these headphones are awesome. It is a whole new world with them on. Recent trip back to Ohio and it was quiet and peaceful. On one leg of the flight apparently the plane was having some major scary difficulties and I didn't even know it because I'm in my own little world with these babies on. Plane lands and everyone is clapping and I'm like what happened...Bottom line, you are going to love these. Read all the technical reviews you want, but these are just excellent."

639,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Really, Really Good

I've never owned such an expensive pair of headphones before, so understand that my opinion may be not fully credible. However here is what I have found. The audio quality is on another level compared to what I am used to. It's like not only is everything so clear and vivid. But (assuming the audio file isn't a bad one) I can also tell where the individual instruments would be playing if I were standing in the recording room. To experience this, listen to Give It One by Maynard Ferguson that track blew my socks off. The noise canceling is also pretty impressive, although I don't have much comparison as I've never owned a pair of active noise canceling headphones. It seems to me that it'll block out most noises below a certain volume threshold. So like I can still hear this ridiculously loud vacuum we have (you have no idea how loud this vacuum is though), or the blender when standing right next to it. Even then, those things weren't more noticeable than the music I was listening to, so it seems to do its job almost perfectly.

The Bad

There actually aren't any huge complaints, but the reason it doesn't get a perfect score is because it does have some flaws that I think really do need to be improved upon (only 2 to be exact though). The first one is that my ears get really hot after wearing them for a bit over an hour or two. So much so that I feel compelled to take them off for a minute or two just because the heat is pretty unbearable. The second is that it creaks every now and then when you stretch out the headband even a little. The second isn't even really a huge complaint I guess, because I don't think (and really hope) that Sony would make sure that the headband doesn't end up breaking.

Summary

Audio quality is next level compared to what I am used to and the noise canceling executes its job to the best of its ability. In future generations, I would obviously like to see even better audio quality and noise canceling (as hard as that may be) as well as an environment where it feels like my ears aren't being dipped in molten lava after just an hour or two (exaggeration, but they do get really hot for real). I highly recommend these, and honestly still can't decide if I am being too harsh in giving this a 4-star review. Most people either give this a 4 or 5-star review I assume and those that don't either had a really bad experience for some external factor or are out of their mind."
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earbuds that I have been using now for 5-6 years. This is my 4th or 5th pair of these headphones. I constantly lose or break my headphones from daily use and bringing them to the gym. I have found that these are a great cheap pair of headphones that sound good for most daily listening. They do not block out any noise, but they play music very clearly and without any distortion. They do not fall out of my ears at all while running.

The different color styles are a nice added bonus."
1,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Prior to this, I purchased the Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds for use with a small mp3 player I use while weightlifting. They were cheap and had good enough sound that I purchased them on numerous occasions over the years as each pair eventually became destroyed by sweat. I was disappointed to find that they were discontinued and purchased these ear buds with the expectation that they would be ""pretty much the same"". They're not, they have no discernable base sound. That may be fine if your using these to watch TV through a device or prefer ""the transistor radio sound"" but for my needs they are useless. Now I suppose I'll have to dredge through many pages and reviews to find something that suits my requirements (cheap, decent volume, reasonable sound).

EDIT: Based upon another review of these earbuds with a similar perspective to mine, I purchased the Edifier H180 earbuds. A little more expensive but much better sound IMO."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these 2 years ago after my first pair from purchased from Walmart probably 5+ years ago now bit the dust. I hate the headphones that go in the ear and I dislike the look of headphones that go over the ear. These are the only headphones I'll tolerate but stores no longer sell them. Thank you amazon! These have a 90 degree angle at the headphone jack which means I don't end up with exposed wires or sound in just one ear quite so fast. The first pair lasted me all of high school although I wasn't using them daily. The next pair has lasted me 2 years of daily use in college and now are in my pocket all day everyday at work. Which is how they ended up going through the washer and dryer. Twice. 2 years later, these still work great, no exposed wires and the only reason i'm replacing them is because I was careless and after the second wash and dry cycle, the sound on the right side occasionally goes out. My bad. Today I'll be purchasing my 3rd and 4th pairs and I will continue to purchase as long as these continue to be made."
3,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very person specific, they fit me perfectly fine and the sound quality was pretty good. My girlfriend however was a different story. After attempting to use the headphones multiple times I was repeatedly told that they were falling out of her ears and the bass quality isn't very good. They are also shorter than the previous Sony design which makes them ride ""strangely"" in your ear canal and make them more difficult to take out of your ear quickly without losing your grasp on them.

Coming from someone who doesn't deal with super heavy bass music I thought the headphones performed quite well for the price. However if you're looking for headphones with supreme audio and very heavy bass you might want to look elsewhere. For the price however they are well constructed and would be a good fit to any ipod, mp3 player, or even cell phone because they are compact and can go anywhere. The overall cable design is well done, and it easily provides enough length to run up your shirt or hoodie if you desire your headphones to be discreet. Are they going to be for listening to music for hours on end with supreme quality? No, probably not, but will they get the job done? Sure. If you're looking for cheap head phones with a custom color then these will probably suit you."
4,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are definitely a hit or miss type of earbuds. I had a pair of these for about 4 years until I dropped them while on a run and the buds fell off entirely. They fit my ears so well that I just bought another pair. Although, a lot of my friends who have used these have often told me they don't fit their ears very well. My ears tend to not fit the general earbud size, so these fit mine very nicely. But if your ears often fit the stick-in earbuds (like the ones SkullCandy sells), these probably will not fit as well. If your ears are like mine and can't keep those earbuds in generally, these will fit nicely."
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My love for these ear buds is a true love. I have been buying these exact ear buds for years now. The first time, I bought them because the ear buds that came with my iPod Classic died and I wanted something affordable but good quality. I bought them for about $10 at some local store and fell in love. They have a great length to them and are long lasting. Honestly, the reason why I've bought so many of these over the years isn't that they break - it's because I end up losing them on public transportation or among my collection of things. This style of headphones has lasted with me over the years and I know that the moment I lose (not break) the ones I currentlly have, I'll buy another pair.

Pros:
- Long cord that makes it easy for you to comfortably place your phone in your front or back pocket while listening to music. Also - great length for when you want to rest your phone on the treadmill stand while running.
- Durable - can handle more abuse than any product should be able to withstand.
- Decent sound quality. I'm no audiophile - I just want to be able to hear my music. It plays classical well enough to hear the flutes and it's decent for when you have a lot of bass.
- Price - for 10 bucks or less you can't go wrong.
- Portable - small headphones that are easy to keep with you everywhere.

Overall, I definitely recommend these headphones if you're looking for some decent headphones for a great price. Perfect for the person who takes public transit, runs, or just lives an active lifestyle."
6,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After listening to a bunch of different earbuds I have, I can put them into 2 categories: Ones that sound like music, and ones that sound like music is coming out of a tin can. These, unfortunately, do not sound like music. They are ""right at the lip"" of the tin can, but, yes, still ""in"" the tin can. I bought the Sennheiser MX365's at the same time as these, and there is no comparison as to the sound quality. I have another pair of Sennheiser buds, the MX271, and both are exceptional in sound. I have a couple pairs of old walkman buds that also have a very similar sound to these Sony's. I have a cheap pair of JBL's (no model #) that sound better than the Sony's, but tonally not very well balanced and well below the quality of the Sennheisers. Do yourself a favor, and spend just a few dollars more for a whole lot better experience and buy some Sennheisers."
7,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A super easy and cheap replacement for my last pair. I'm not an audiophile and I' didn't want to pay a ton for watching movies on my phone. I'm also not someone that buys into name brands like Beats just because they're trendy. I needed something simple that wasn't made by a no-name company that may or may not exist in a year and these fit the bill. A great cheap alternative to more expensive options from a company you can at least immediately recognize so you don't have to worry about what corners were cut.

That being said, the sound quality is fine and even bordering on ""good"". The sound is about 4 stars for the price you pay. They look just like the pictures and the blue that I got are nice and subtle but bold at the same time. I hear a weird ""click"" sound every once in a while when I move around which I believe is coming from the headphones... or I'm going crazy only while wearing the earpieces. I'm waiting for them to tell me which it is. Until then, a perfect 4 star product that I'd gladly pay again to save a fortune."
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my phone almost exclusively via earphone, so anytime I'm around others I at least have phones with me. I use these other than a headphone as I only read the phone rather than call, etc.. In other words I don't need the ""call, dial, etc"" features typically.. only listening.
Due to low vision, my phone has a text-to-voice app which most wouldn't use, but it makes the phone accessible for me. I also follow podcasts and audio books a fair amount and don't like bothering others.

I find that these phones have the following advantages:
1. Inexpensive, so if I lose it or it breaks or whatever, it's a minor issue
2. Rugged.. I don't baby them and them. Once the part holding the pads snapped out of the hole and had to be pushed back on
3 .I LOVE the ""handing"" rather than the ""in ear"" type.. Much more comfortable over longer periods, adequately loud, yet don't block outside sound.. I don't like to ""sound bubble"" myself
4. Cord is long enough for me to comfortably put my phone in my pants and run the line up my shirt to my ears.
5. Sound is decent for an earphone of this price. At higher prices, I'd have to make a decision
I am not saying this is a perfect item, but darn good for the price. I keep a spare in case I lose or break it. I definitely would buy it again."
9,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This will be a first impression review of 3 Sony earbuds bought at the same time:
*** MDRE9LP (the Ipod type that only sits inside the outer part of the ear)
**** MDR-EX37B (black body insertion type)
***** MDR-EX25LP (tiny unit that goes entirely into the ear)

All arrived in the typical over-engineered packaging that you can see that the designer is the only one that knows how to open without destroying the packaging. I've yet to figure out why.

Background:
My wife uses earbuds all day, home or work. Connecting to her BLU Selfie phone, her HP Laptop, her Toshiba Chromebook and her various Samsung tablets. She goes through them quickly, but we've had bad results from buying cheap buds, especially the Panasonic RPHJE120 line, which we bought 5 different colors and are all in a drawer because they don't align easily in the ear and have low output volume and very low bass... unacceptable even though they are Amazon's #1 Best Seller. She prefered to tape together some of her other broken earbuds and limp along with those instead. Her favorites to date have been the nice earbuds that came with her BLU phone and some very old ones that came with an Ipod she seldom uses anymore, but both of those are held together with scotch tape and come apart easily.

Soooo, I decided to buy one each of some Sony units to see which she liked. We both tested each using the same song at the same volume out of the phone.

She likes the EX37B ones the best (first quick use). These were priced at $13.99 and are the standard kind of L configuration. I like that they have a rugged appearance and a very good stress relief so the wires are not so likely to get damaged when she yanks them out or they get snagged on something as she rushes around while using them. To me (refined pitch perfect audiophile ears), they are a little distorted and loud, but have tremendous bass response.

Second she liked the tiny EX25LP. THEY WERE MY FAVORITE BY FAR! These were priced $14.99 and are little egg-like things that fall completely in the ear with only the thin wire coming out. My concern with these was that there is no stress relief for the wires at all, but upon trying them, we both remarked how easily they slide exactly into the right place in our ears, no alignment needed and they come out VERY easy... but do not FALL out on their own. They fit perfectly and have a very good sound, but not a huge bass note like the EX37B and our BLU phone buds.

Lastly she didn't like the MDRE9LP units that just are like little speakers that do not go into the ear canal, like so many you see and exactly like the Ipod buds she likes so much. These are hard to place properly in the ear and don't have the volume or bass quality of the other two. They are the cheaper of the trio at $8.99 and I don't see these being used unless it's a choice between those and the Panasonics.

I will UPDATE this review as problems or wonders happen. Stay tuned."

If you want ear buds that you can take on 0 degree runs, accidentally send through the washer and dryer, travel with, crumple in your pocket, use to catch a falling phone, and generally misuse, buy these. Sound quality is still the same as the day I opened the package, and I've put these puppies through the wringer.

I buy a new pair every 2 years or so, and these are earbuds that I carry with me every single day. I've since been able to get other friends to use these in place of more expensive headphones, since the jewel tone plastic makes it easy to spot, and there's no need to baby these buds."
13,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I needed new earbuds I bought three sets to compare: Sony MDRE9LP, JVC HAF160, and Panasonic RP-HV41. All three are around $8.

In my opinion the Sony's were the worst, mostly due to the terrible bass response. Both the JVC and Panasonic buds had decent bass. In the end I liked the JVC set the best due to that and the fact they fit the best - the Panasonic ones are awkward and fall out easily.

For the record, I dislike buds that enter the ear canal. While they would probably give even better bass, I just can't do it."
14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my fave earbuds. Most earbuds, even the Apple ones that came with my phone, feel horrible in my ears after about 20 minutes. These are great. I can even sleep in these without discomfort. I've purchased a back-up pair for later. The audio quality is not the best out there, but for me, it doesn't matter if they sound amazing if my ear canal is in pain the whole time. They'd be perfect if they had a mic to use for phone calls"
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile. I do like my music to sound good. I also HATE the new ear buds that are dominating the market that have a piece that goes into your ear canal. What IS that?! It feels like a rectal exam for my ear. This is one of the few brands that still makes the kind that just sit in the outer part of your ear. They sound great. I have two pairs, one for two years and the other for a year. They still work great. I do not treat them gently but I haven't noticed any damage or crackling, and I use them almost every day. I wish they would give you extras of those foam covers, but oh well. I bought some separately here on Amazon and I switch thm out every so often."
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"for the price they work well and sound well. I bought these and one pair from another brand as a backup as the last few sets have not lasted long at all. So far these have worked well for months. They still sound good and have not frayed or split yet even though I have snagged them a bunch of times. Might buy a backup set while these are still made. They are not audiophile quality, but they are not terrible or full of noise either. Since I go through them often I try to buy the $5-$15 pairs because after that it starts to hurt too much to keep replacing."
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've purchased a bunch of these headphones in different colors in the past and I always come back for more. They are not the greatest sounding headphones out there, nor the most durable, but for headphones that cost less than $10, they are great. Also, they are not the headphones that go in ear (bullet looking headphones) which are now everywhere and I just can't keep those in my ears while exercising, they always come out. So I come back for these.

I wear these to the gym every day to listen to podcasts/music and each time they last between six and eight months. Pretty good overall based on cost."
18,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The quality of these earbuds is terrible. I had a pair of these a few years ago (that were actually good) and when my current pair of earbuds died; I thought I'd save some money and try these out again. They've obviously changed something because these are AWFUL.

The sound quality is horrible. It sounds like the audio is coming from inside a tunnel. That's underwater. And 50 miles away. Very tinny and high with lots of static. The earbuds themselves feel too big as well, they don't fit in my ear quite right. I should have read more of the recent reviews before I wasted money on these."
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Earbuds these days are like shirts. Everyone has them, you can get them for $1 and up. But these particular earbuds are the best quality you can buy for under $10. If you could do a sound comparison on these and the $10+ ones you will find subtle differences, but compared to any that cost $1, major differences, and these were only around $7! I like the depth of these, not tinny or compacted, there are definite deeps and lows in these compared to more treble as many others have. For a true audiophile, for the price and size they perform really well and are long enough to work while listening to your tunes. I use them on the subway train and don't really HAVE to turn them up all the way to get a rich sound with an ipod. I have two pairs because I like them so much. If you can afford these, get them. They will be your best sounding micros for the price!"
20,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was disappointed because these were not what I thought I was buying. I had the exact same experience as previous reviewer AYG from July 10th:

""I ordered MDRE9LP/BLK Earbuds. Instead of the normal Sony packaging they came in a weird little ziplock bag kind of thing with the text ""Original high quality best accessories"".On the back is the text ""Accessories There is no best only better products. Enjoy the best quality Made in China"". No mention of Sony on the packaging they came in anywhere. There is a label stuck on the back that says Sony black MADE IN CHINA. I opened them up and there are white earbuds inside, not black. They actually look more like MDRE9LP/GRAY. However, the printing on the side is so faint you can barely even see it and the parts don't seem to have a good fit. I actually had to put reading glasses on to read the logo. Sony is usually pretty good about making sure you can see their logo on their products and I don't think they usually ship them in a bag that says Best Accessories, Original High quality.""

Like AYG, I got white headphones instead of black, they came in strange packaging, and the sound quality is poor. I'm not even super picky about having perfect sound--but these crackle when I listen through them. Disappointing for sure."
22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would buy any brand of cheap earbuds, but they would fray before I'd finish using them.
Then I would exclusively buy Gummy brand because the sound quality was no different, but the rubber sheath covering the cord would last much longer.

Then the last Gummy gave out after a year or so and someone somewhere on the internet suggested these Sony earbuds.
The difference in sound quality is amazing! I didn't realize I'd been listening to poor quality sound for years until I bought this last month. They are a couple dollars more than the Gummy and they are worth it."
23,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had used Sony ear buds before but they're different ear buds,but these pairs of earbuds work fine and I use them when I'm doing exercise.The only thing that really makes me like them a lot are the sponges that I put on each one of the earbud,and they stay in place I don't have to move them all the time to put them in place because the sponge keeps them in place."
24,5.0 out of 5 stars,"BEST HEAD PHONE I EVER USEDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!! Honestly I brought these because I need 8 more dollars for free shipping on Amazon. I didn't expect these to last too long, Its a year and half later and it still works like new. I mainly used Skull Candy head phones before for 2-3x the price and they would last me like 3 months to 1 year(RARELY). I use them a lot on the train, walking outside, and on my computer. Very good unexpected value."
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am really happy with these Sony Ear Buds. I am enjoying using them to listen to audible books while walking my dog, music while writing, podcasts and for meditations before bed and the sound is crisp and clear. What has been wonderful is the ear buds have been very comfortable. I have petite ears so normally ear buds can either not fit well and cause discomfort but even when I am exercising, they remain in place and are comfortable the entire time! I have paid a lot more for ear buds in the past and they haven't worked as well or been as nice as these."
26,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought pair of these in three different colors. My absolute favorite ear buds. Previous pair I had lasted for three years. I only tossed them out because I thought they went bad, but it turns out my phone's headphone jack went bad. So, who knows how long that pair could have lasted.

If you're looking for a lot of bass in your ear buds or headphones, this isn't the pair for you."
27,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE LOVE LOVE these. I know a lot of people prefer silicone buds these days but those never stay in my ear. These are the perfect for my ears and they never fall out. Sound quality isn't complete trash too. If they came with a mic they're be perfect.
28,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the fact that these don't have to be plugged in the earhole(, and scraping parts of it). The sound quality is sufficiently clear and comforable to wear and light. I have 2 sets of these at any one time. 1 set will become defective in 12 months; either one side starts to give off no sound. I just replacement it again and again.

But for the price, it can't be beat and a good replacement."
29,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for earbuds at the price/quality of my trusty old sony mdr818. Unfortunately, sony stopped making them so I thought I would try these mdre9lp. Sadly, there is no comparing the two. Maybe I got defective ones, but the build quality of the ones I received are so bad compared to the 818s. The wires and their connections are thin and flimsy - maybe lightly better than what you'd get for free on an airplane. The sound quality is also poor, like tin cans compared to the 818s. Even without the foam tips, the 818s have more base and full sound than these. So disappointed."
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, these little guys are excellent. I've been using them since the summer with both my laptop and my cell phone and they're still clear as a bell. For those music nerds out there, the stereo quality and bass does leave something to be desired, but what do you want for under $10 ??? I use them for watching tv shows, movies, videos and you tube as well as music at pretty high volumes and they're pretty sensitive. I just love them and am buying a pair for my mom right now. :)"
31,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got as replacement for previous model of these ear buds that I've had forever. (I accidentally damaged them) That replaced tiny Panasonic ear buds that i could not find again.

I wish they could make them even smaller so more comfortable to nap with.

This Sony model seems to be pretty much it if you need very small ear buds that are not the in ear kind. I'm seriously considering buying half a dozen in case they discontinue regular earbuds for in ear kind. Don't understand why they are out of fashion. I personally cant stand the in ear kind."
33,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this when another similar SONY earphones failed and those lasted me about 1 year. Good quality, basic headphones. Obviously you get what you pay for, so don't expect much, but I do think these exceed other headphones in the same price range. I will definitely buy again."
34,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice
35,3.0 out of 5 stars,The earbuds were too big for my ears so they kept falling out and didn't sound good. I tried to return them but was informed by Amazon that they were not eligible for return. Gave them to some friends who seem to be happy with them.
36,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good earbuds, comfortable, great sound for a great price!"
37,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are amazingly sturdy. I'm still using them but ymmv. I'm very happy with this purchase.
38,4.0 out of 5 stars,My son is very picky when it comes to earbuds. He says the sound quality is good and they don't bother his ears when he works out.
39,3.0 out of 5 stars,good !
40,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's not been a month since I bought these and my right earbud is not working
41,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are a little hard in the ears but no problems
With them other than that. Great product. I've been buying these ear buds for this vendor for quite some time and have never had a problem with so far"
42,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this item because Amazon's metadata said that it was a newer version of my MDRE10LP headphones that are finally wearing out after 3 years.

If this is the new one, they need to scrap the design and start over. The audio quality is crap. By comparison it is like listening to mono vs stereo. No base, mid is too high, and the treble sounds like it's coming through a can."
44,5.0 out of 5 stars,work and sound fine. only problem is the foam pads always fall off and the ear piece does not stay in the ears without them.
45,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality sucks, put these in your pockets routinely and you'll have to spend minutes untangling them ( which is really annoying)
Don't waste your money on these they suck"
46,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and great product for such a low price, highly recommend!"
47,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality
48,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are my favorite headphones. It fits and I've been buying them for years. Plus it last me for months. The longest time I've had a pair of these were about a year.
49,2.0 out of 5 stars,Broke
50,5.0 out of 5 stars,The new design is cool looking. My wife uses them when she goes jogging. Good sound for the price. I would buy them again.
51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these instead of the Panasonic brand which stopped working in one ear after a while, and then in both ears. This was the second time I had bought Panasonic. I hope this brand does not give me trouble as well but I already appreciate the superior sound that it has!"
52,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earbuds about a week and a half ago, and they performed well in those few days. Afterwards, as I was holding an earbud in my hand, I dropped the earbuds on my glass table (not a very big drop to begin with, barely a foot) and the cover broke off the left one.

Guess that's how well a 7 dollar set of earbuds are made..."
53,5.0 out of 5 stars,good quality. As expected
55,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for a while now and I've had no problems. They are the best cheaper headphones I've ever purchased, definitely worth the money."
56,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound for the price and if you are our basing for a younger hold these actually sty in their ears. I went though 6 sets of headphones for my 6 yr old daughter because they would all fall out of her ears. This is he only pair we have ever used that we didn't have an issue with falling out.
57,5.0 out of 5 stars,This seems has better quality than the e10lp model. My first e9lp lasted me for more than 3.5 years and I just purchased another pair for replacement. They sound nice for its price and they are comfortable for long hours as well.
58,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were awesome, I had the older versions and these work just as good, don't need those expensive ones!"
59,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality.
60,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This earphone is very cheap but it has a good sound quality (at its price range). I don't think it does a very good job at high frequncies but ok job. If you just want a pair of inexpensive earbud that you can carry to everywhere without worrying about it, this is a good choice. I bought the gray ones and it looks good too."
61,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just as good as my Ipod original ear buds, which these replaced. I think my grandson ran off with my originals."
62,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these
63,4.0 out of 5 stars,"breaks easily, but i'm also someone who loses things like crazy, so these being completely disposable is worth it"
64,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. I use them all the time.
66,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality earphones.
67,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones are good for the price, but sound quality isn't amazing. There is some static-sound when you jostle the wires. Very comfortable to wear."
68,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very bad quality. have to return it.
69,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear buds are not the new, weird-shaped ear buds Apple has come out with. They are the normal, in-your-ear ear buds that fit comfortably and last a long time. I love all of Sony's electronics, including these ear buds. Would definitely recommend and will re-purchase.."
70,2.0 out of 5 stars,Reeks of cheapness. The sound is tinny and there is no base. I have no idea why this is getting so many positive reviews.
71,1.0 out of 5 stars,super cheap
72,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Though they are not earbuds, the quality of the sound is not sharp. They slip out of my ears sometimes. This is basically just a backup pair incase my other ones are not working."
73,5.0 out of 5 stars,very good sound and last very long time
74,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable good quality and cheap
75,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gave them to my boyfriend and he uses them everyday.
77,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was for my son...he love it...sound bass good..with clarity...
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,AAA product. highly recommended.
79,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are pretty. I remember there being an older model where they were slightly longer. However, these have pretty much no bass at all. I like my bass, and these don't seem to have any. It's a pretty poor sound quality."
80,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work very well and have good sound quality for being so cheap
81,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its cheap headphones that fits my ear so I like it
82,5.0 out of 5 stars,"if it's Sony, it;s GOOD"
83,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The shipping was fast and the earphones are pretty good. Came in two days(standard shipping) so i was satisfied with the shipping. The earphones overall are pretty good as well. The bass isn't really that good, but the sound quality over is really good(I say better than your standard Apple earbuds) and the comfortablity is pretty good. Overall, good for the price they're offering."
84,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing has better sound than the bad reviews say it has. It's not the best sounding device, but its good enough. It broke after 5 months, so its fragile."
85,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wear earphones all day as I am a landscaper who cuts lawns all day. These fit underneath my earphones well.
86,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is fair as you'd expect from this price range, but I docked a star because they don't even try to stay in my ears."
88,2.0 out of 5 stars,Cheaply made and they fall out of my ears alot
89,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using these things like crazy for 2 years now and have not had any problems. Must buy.
90,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really enjoy the headphones, I got these because I needed to replace an old pair of Sony earbuds that they stopped making sadly, these aren't as great, but they're still very good quality! Also love the fast shipping and packaging!"
91,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent - works great!
92,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shipped on time and product is as promised. Would purchase again.
93,5.0 out of 5 stars,As expected and received items
94,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphone. These stay in my small ears when most don't.
95,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound
96,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these, and always re-buy them when they fall prey to the wild accidents or over/misuse."
97,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones!
99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the sound of this headphones. I love the color and for its price, i am quite satisfied with the surround sound."
100,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There is some static when I use these headphones, but only sometimes. Other than that, great product."
101,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't know if this was because of the way they were delivered or anything but the right piece was chipped and the left one looks like it wasn't glued right or something, but they still sound good."
102,2.0 out of 5 stars,It could use some better bass
103,3.0 out of 5 stars,The very first day I was wearing them and the speakers fell apart. I think it was just a faulty pair as I have purchased these headphones before in pink. I haven't had any real problems with them. They normally work really well. I just ordered a replacement for these in purple. We'll see how well they hold up.
104,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived in great time - sound quality is so, so however. Expected better of Sony earbuds."
105,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
106,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfy in my ears, these are my ideal earbuds! I bought two pairs so I have a backup just in case."
107,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice sound / great price
108,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound quality. The fresh, clean, and white look makes it look fashionable and great to used everyday :D I've been trying to find headphones that are simple and not to flashy. And this headphones definitely suits the criteria of what i have been finding for a while. Definitely fast shipping and worth your money. It's just what I wanted :D !"
110,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple and without any bells and whistles. Perfect for the gym.
111,2.0 out of 5 stars,I thought I had used the same model previously but when this one arrived I was very disappointed in the sound. I could use it for just voice recordings but not for music. Amazon asked me by email if I liked my purchase and I responded honestly. They immediately resolved the issue VERY satisfactorily. THANK YOU AMAZON.
112,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great item
113,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price! They arrived on time and in perfect condition. I will order again.
114,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these types of earbuds, rather than the ones you have to jam into your eardrum. They sit nicely just inside the ear and are a great replacement for those that use the IPod ones, which have a lot of cheap unknown brand replacements that seem to break easy. Bought two pairs and would recommend these."
115,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best cheap headphones
116,4.0 out of 5 stars,it is good in quality but line is quite long and old style (plastic material) good sound quality though
117,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had SONY earbuds for ages and keep going back.
118,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good price, decent sound!"
119,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones, they are almost perfect for my ears. The seller was absolutely perfect:)"
121,3.0 out of 5 stars,the bump hurts my ears.
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I buy these all the time because I keep losing it. At such a small price, they can't be beat. They are the only earbuds I've tried that fit in my small ears without hurting them. The sound quality is okay, but much can't be expected for $9."
123,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice
124,4.0 out of 5 stars,good product recommended.
125,4.0 out of 5 stars,good!
126,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought it yesterday and got the delivery today. That is an amazing speed! After testing, I am sure that this earbud can be used for Samgsung Galaxy S4 and Ipad Air. So it is really useful for me! In addition, it is in a good quality."
127,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent!
128,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased at Christmas, broken by Valentine's Day....2 days after the return window. Very disappointed."
129,4.0 out of 5 stars,these guys always last me almost a year. sounds is slammin for 10 bucks
130,3.0 out of 5 stars,Algo deviles.
132,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A good cheap way to get sound into my ears while I'm working. Since they are cheap, I don't worry much about breaking them or getting them wet."
133,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They aren't Beats earbuds, but they are good. Like anything else, you pay more you get more. If you want Beats quality, you pay the $120+. These are great for quality for $10. I'm not incredibly picky when it comes to earphones. As long as there isn't rattling or static and the quality is good--I'm happy. These are great for the price!"
134,4.0 out of 5 stars,Have hard time keeping in ears
135,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound.
136,5.0 out of 5 stars,i just love my headphones. They 're are crystal clear and loud. I'm very happy with my purchased!!
137,1.0 out of 5 stars,I used it the first day and the ear piece fell off. I was not able to put it back together.
138,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good earbuds, good price. I've found that you can pay more for fancy earbuds but they generally sound the same. These fit nicely and don't fall out easily, all you can really ask for in earbuds. You want real top-shelf fidelity? Buy over the ear headphones."
139,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality. It fits comfortable in my ears and is very durable.
140,5.0 out of 5 stars,I needed new ear buds for my Sony Walkman. I figured these Sony ear buds would be compatible with a Sony Walkman. They've been working fine for a few weeks now with every day use. The clarity and bass are fine. I don't know how they'd work with a non Sony product.
141,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love these earplugs..The only con is they sometimes fall out my ear when I dance..
143,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Item arrived on time. Packaging was perfect but I don't know where the positive review regarding the sound were coming from. As soon as it arrived, I plugged it to my Apple iPod...the sound was like coming from a tin can! Tried it on my iPad and it was the same. No comparison with my old Apple earbuds! Bought it for ""the just in case"", but for the price, not worth the hassle of returning. I'll just give it away."
144,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best of classic earbuds available today and they sound very good despite the low price. I like Sony’s simple design and the wire runs long enough for me to put my phone in a back pocket while listening music. I love that with these earbuds I don’t have to “screw” the earbuds into my ear what is so uncomfortable.
145,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had purchased some Panasonic RP-HV096 just recently only to be completely disappointed with the terrible quality of those earphones. These manage to feel better but sound worse, I could not believe my ears. I thought I had made a mistake going with Panasonic instead of Sony but apparently they are all equally trash. Still nothing to officially replace my old MDR-E818LP earphones.

I'm not sure what the deal is, maybe I got counterfeits. If that is the case, then the cheap reproduction Sony/iPod headphones directly from China sound better and are a quarter of the price. These are a waste of your money."
146,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using the excellent MDRe10 earbuds for years (which are now out of production) and wanted to replace them with the newer Sony MDRe9. BIG MISTAKE. The quality is terrible, instant and undeniable. I've decided to steer clear of Sony headphones in future because of this (yes, these ear buds are THAT BAD - we're talking 99 cent store quality). Why is there barely any bass?"
147,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is just like any other ear phone. It is a bit clearer than average though. Yet, the bass quality of these earphones are low to nothing. I can barely hear any bass, yet I can't expect much for this price because it isn't one of those high performance quality headsets or something. Overall, it has a long enough cord. I'm not into the L shaped aux tip though. I guess it helps with angle and how much you turn your body. I believe it also prevents the cord from ripping and getting damaged from the end. Fits my ear pretty well without falling out. I have always liked Sony brand products. Yet, they are sometimes expensive. I'm cool with these though."
148,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Earbuds are frustrating. I like the way these Sony earbuds fit (flat on the side and easy to wear when falling asleep). I get very frustrated with Sony because they don't work well for very long. Quickly one side or the other quits. I bought these because reviews of most earbuds are that they don't fit or they fall out so I decided to go with these - they fit me and their price is low. I'm making do, hoping this industry can come up with something that works!"
149,1.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the main problems with headphones (especially smaller or cheaper ones), is that the cord ends up getting bent (mostly in the area near the plug), resulting in poor sound, a breaking connection, or just no function at all.

It generally takes headphones a few months to a few years to get to this point. Not the case with these headphones! Right out of the box, the cord needed to be placed in a perfect position in order to have any sound output. Any slight movement caused it to cut out.

Not an issue with shipping, as they were well packed in their plastic bubble. Just a very poorly made product."
150,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a pair of these that I've been using for 2 or 3 years. They sound quite good and are very compact. The stem/body (where the wires enter) is smaller than most ear buds. This has proven very useful for times when I put on hearing protection (when mowing grass for example) or when wearing a snug fitting hat. The low price makes the purchase a no-brainer.

Edited to add 1) the plug is a right-angle design, and 2) the left ear plug has a small bump on it so that you don't have to read the printed ""L"". This info was not provided in the product description."
151,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, cheap price. Took a while for me to get used to its shape. Great for casual use, especially in public places when people might want to talk to you while you're using earphones, cause it hangs loosely in your ears. Not suitable for exercise because it comes off easily with rigorous movement (I use an in-ear pair of earphones for that)."
152,1.0 out of 5 stars,"SONY: I was expecting a set of earbuds that would exceed the one I see locally at $5-15
I was woefully mistaken. Not only do these NOT fit comfortably into my ears , they have horrid bass response.
I would not buy another even if they were selling at a buck a pair."
154,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad for $8
155,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The suction earphones don't fit in my ear (or don't stay in my ear) because I have a piercing, so these ""old style"" headphones are the best. I've had about 4 pairs of Sony earbud headphones now and will continue to buy them"
156,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had one pair of these for about 3 years now and they're still my favorite!
157,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm hard on headsets and have been having them break or fall apart on me. This one is lasting and fits well. I think this is because the part that goes into the ear is firmly attached. Sound quality seems decent but not outstanding.
158,1.0 out of 5 stars,Mine broke on Day 4.
159,4.0 out of 5 stars,Solid product
160,5.0 out of 5 stars,love it.
161,5.0 out of 5 stars,Have been useing for a month and I'm absolutely delighted. Good sound.
162,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ive been through so many pair of cheapo walmart headphones that break/have a cut out in sound quality .. bought these 8 months ago and still sounds perfect. With heavy use and...still Going Strong!...
163,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The quality of the sound isn't very high (in terms of music), especially when I compare it to my larger Turtle Headphones. Of course, the price of these is really cheap. They work just fine and I'm not knocking the quality of the materials. Typical cheap ear buds that get the job done."
165,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product and the sounds were awesome and great also the product came in time for me to use them.
166,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved the bass it put out, but it stopped working after 7 months."

169,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound works fine, but I have a problem with keeping them in my ears. They aren't snug and fall out a lot."
170,3.0 out of 5 stars,was hoping for a better sound and a better fit. will try others. was disappointed in this product. thought Sony would be okay.
171,1.0 out of 5 stars,Be careful with the sound!!!!
172,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So... these are the only headphones that fit my ears without falling out, so I really like them. They do still fall out from time to time, but its not like I cannot hold them in my ear at all like others."
173,5.0 out of 5 stars,Always the best with respect to quality!!
174,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these ear buds for my nephews birthday. He really likes them.

184,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I accidentally threw mine on tile floor and one earbud's plastic cover broke and is now loose, so I bought another one. Im not sure why, but i bought another for $8."
185,3.0 out of 5 stars,Serves their purpose. Somewhat pricey for a simple set of earbuds. Paying for Sony brand.
187,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
188,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality pretty good. Left earbud broke after only a month but Sony is sending a replacement. Just a pain having to take it to the post office to ship it back.
189,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good feel for the ears. The never fall out like many other ear buds. Despite them only lasting about 6 months before one bud dies, I continue to buy them."
190,3.0 out of 5 stars,good
191,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great earbuds for the price.
192,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only ones I like. Hope they don't quit making them.
193,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It works fine. The sound quality is eh. The wires feel really stiff and cheap to boot. It will be fine with me, but not the best earbuds ever."
194,2.0 out of 5 stars,These don't fit the ears well and keep falling off even while walking.
195,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loving these new headphones. They're not super fancy but for the price they are so worth it. I would recommend it for the average person who just wants to listen to music on their commute or while at work.
196,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really good, the headphones just need to be more durable."
198,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice.
199,5.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfied with my purchase ! :)

202,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good
203,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most durable headphones I've owned.
204,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this product for a week, it is working just fine. After I received confirmation with estimated shipping date, it arrived earlier than expected."
205,4.0 out of 5 stars,"the deliver nice sound,
they are very open, but build quality is good, and for $8~$10 this is about as good as they get.
At this price there are some JVC that sound good as well, but I don't think either is better."
206,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I put these stupid things in my computer for the FIRST TIME and I hear nothing but static, save yourself some money and just by headphones because these things are garbage"
207,4.0 out of 5 stars,works well.
209,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reasonable proceso,good quality"
210,2.0 out of 5 stars,Should have read more reviews. No base.
211,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound but pops out of the ear too easily
212,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second order of these ear phones. They are a good product.
213,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality headphones at an unbeatable price. This is my third pair (for my girlfriend. Lost original pair) and if sony keeps producing them, i will keep buying them."
214,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this headphones the sound is amazing
215,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound. Affordable.
216,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is terrible!!! Absolutely no bass, doesn't even sound as good as stereo. About like listening to an old transistor radio."
217,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are very nice earbuds. They sound great at any volume and do not muffle out. These are just as good as your standard Ipod earbuds! Great buy!
218,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke soon after I got it.
220,5.0 out of 5 stars,My sister and I alway get these! We're really bad with taking care of our headphones. We can yank and throw them around all the time. But these guys are so durable!
221,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were definitely a reasonable price, and they get the job done. Sound quality is okay, but not as good as another set of Sony earbuds I bought these to replace. If you're price sensitive and just need a new set of earbuds, I would definitely recommend these. If you are looking for superior sound quality, I would move up to a more expensive model."
222,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered it and it came on the earliest day I was supposed to get it. It was in the original packaging, and It's pretty loud and okay, fits in my ear alright. Theres definitely better headphones but this is still a good product and Isn't bad for the price."
223,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best earbuds for the price.
224,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are cheap and they sound good!
225,5.0 out of 5 stars,awesome

227,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is bad, and the left piece broke off after 2 weeks. Not worth it."
228,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clear sound.
229,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 stars!
231,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are great. I usually use over the ear but these are perfect. Gave them 4 stars as they are a challenge to keep in. Would buy them again.
232,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hate that these are discontinued, these shipped fast and are perfect for casual use and working out. No microphone piece but useful!"
233,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Snug fit, came with the foam to put on if needed"
234,1.0 out of 5 stars,bad quality
235,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The earbuds are priced right, delivered quickly and intact. I listen to audio books and I find the sound to be a little hollow, not as full as other Sony earbuds I have owned in the past. I will probably pay the extra $1.50 next time and get the ones I had before."
236,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only reason I give four stars instead of five is becuase they tangle badly. It is not a real proplem, just anoying.

Red is really cool"
237,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very cheap and flimsy. Not well built. I am not happy.
238,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Super LOUD, sharp sound, devoid of bass, hurts the ears and the senses. I owned the old timer version (SONY MDR-E808LP) of these earphones from the 90's into mid 2000's. Recently bought these updated ones to replace those and got an earful #@$! These are awful. Those older Sony headphones were the best ever. Some dude is selling them on eBay for $49...I don't think so. I've attached photos of the beloved model for nostalgia's sake."
239,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Completely disappointed by this product. After 2 months of below average use, there is no sound coming from the right ear bud. I know this is a cheap ear bud but I still expect it to last longer than that! It lasted just long enough to bypass the return policy!"
240,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my 13 year old daughter who broke the last ones because she accidently sat on them, she uses them for what every other 13 year old uses headphones for which is music. We got them yesterday they got here pretty fast it took 3 days. she put them on the minute she got them and she LOVES them! The quality is great and she says she can hear everything perfectly."
242,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST HEADPHONES EVER
243,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap, decent quality for the price, great durability. Last alot longer than most other earbuds in this price range"
244,3.0 out of 5 stars,Foam cover were flimsy but ear buds work as expected.
245,5.0 out of 5 stars,this product is excellent my friend had a Sony but was to old and replace whit this one and he love the ear bunds
246,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad for the price!
247,5.0 out of 5 stars,These come with foam covers. My ear buds lead a rough life so the covers slipped off ( one got lost) a couple of weeks in. Doesn't affect performance. Works well for me-- I used these to watch shows on my iPad.
248,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earbuds are fantastic!! Can have them in ears for a long time without hurting or irritating.
249,4.0 out of 5 stars,Quality of sound very good. So far product have been very good.
250,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these to replace my stock Apple earbuds; thoroughly disappointed in the sound quality. There is almost no perceptible bass, and the higher end sounds raspy. I threw them out before I had finished my tea."
251,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing headphones I got these blue ones for my cousin and I got green for me. Came packaged in a box well packed, nothing was broken and that is major plus. Love the colors and the way they sound. Great prince I have to recommend these headphones to everyone!!!!"
253,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
254,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are my favorite style of headphones. My last pair quit working properly - I am a little hard on them - so it was time to order a new pair. I can't function without my headphones.
255,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are great for just a little cheap pair. My mom wanted something different from the stock iPod ones, and she loves purple, so I got her these. With some earbuds, if you are within 15 feet of the person, you can hear what they are listening to. With these, you cannot."
256,4.0 out of 5 stars,Earbuds are reliable
257,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice set of inexpensive ear-phones. Sound is good.
258,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Daughter loves them, green is her favorite color, she said ""these ones don't fall out of my ears and have good sound quality""."
259,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I found the sound to be heavily mid-range with muted bass, and the unusual shape made it impossible to use of my ear bud adapters (Yurbuds). However, my daughter, who isn't that interested in bass and doesn't need to use ear bud adapters finds them acceptable. I don't recommend these ear buds, but clearly that's a matter of taste."
260,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the most durable ear buds I have owned. Worth every penny!
261,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for my teens, even without the mic. They lose before they break. I have had mine for over a year."
262,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are amazing!!!
264,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm amazed by the number of positive reviews here, because I could not be more disappointed with these earbuds. Like several others, I owned and used the previous model of this product (E10LP) for years because they were both very cheap and had surprisingly good sound quality. Which is why I bought these. But I guess I should have paid more attention to the reviews beforehand, because the sound quality of these things is abysmal. Have you ever accidentally pulled your headphones partially out of the jack, and you get that really hollow sound quality, usually only coming out of one earbud? That's what these sound like. It is the most insubstantial sound I have ever gotten from a pair of headphones. As someone who usually hates the high amount of bass found in many cheap earbuds, I'm yearning for more bass here the way Oliver Twist yearns for a second helping of gruel. I can't even say ""well, I guess at least I have a backup pair"" because listening to music on these is physically discomforting. You might as well just hire a bum to shout songs through a tin can tied to a string.

Two stars for these only because they are functional, in the loosest sense of the word. Maybe you could get some use out of them listening to talk radio or something similar, but do yourself a favor, and buy a pair of E10LP's (which is what I just did before writing this review). There are plenty of people still selling them on Amazon."
265,1.0 out of 5 stars,"HORRIBLE sound quality, do not fit in my ears well, and the cord seems to already have some damage after just opening it less than 3 minutes ago-if I move it the slightest bit, the [poor quality] sound gets staticky and stops working. Went to try to return it and says ""not eligible for return."" I am furious!"
266,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older iteration of these that worked well even after I dunked them in my morning tea. The ear bud was comfortable and small. I figured I'd upgrade and ended up being just so-so. The ear piece is pretty bulky and the sound wasn't that great. I used to take walks with these and it was okay that sounds penetrated because then I could hear what was going on around me.

One fateful afternoon, not three weeks after I purchased them, I bent over to tie my shoe and when I stood up the wire wrapped around my knee, and the bud was yanked from my ear and rather dramatically whipped around and smashed onto the floor. :("
267,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a spectacular set of earphones, and not an average set either. I like these for the adequate resonance in sound since I do listen to varied forms of music. I would advise to adjust your player's (phone, mp3 player, etc.) equalizer to your liking; they will be dynamic enough to adjust! Overall, if you take care of them they will make your music enjoyable till you find that other earphones (with a bigger bass response and fuller range) are appropriate to your listening experience. Sony brand knows their tech :)"
268,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to have these exact same headphones, except they were blue! These are great headphones for a sweaty workout. I am a runner and a fitness freak. Whenever I worked out, the buds never fell out of my ears and they stayed in place.

Somehow, my blue headphones got misplaced either I threw them away by accident, they were stolen or I must have dropped it by accident somewhere. So I re-ordered new ones, and I am glad they have green ones, too. Green is my favorite color so yep! For anyone who is looking to buy headphones for a workout session to listen to your music as your run, buy these. They have a good cord length and like I said, stay in your ears.

The ones I have now, ""Gummy"" Sony black ones. The ear buds always fall out of my ears. As I am running, I have to reach out to the ear bud, as it falling out of my ears, and put it back in there. The cord length to my current ones are very short and they bother me because I like to run the cord underneath my shirt so it's a problem for me. I would not recommend the ""Gummy"" Sony earphones. Just these!

However, the sound quality for both headphones are excellent! I can't wait to get my green ones in the mail. I brought the blue ones at a K-Mart and they lasted me for two years!!"
269,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing fancy but they certainly do that job. I'm not an audiophile so I hardly notice the quality of a headphone unless it is truly terrible, these are not terrible and seem pretty sturdy."
270,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these to replace the ones that were originally supplied with my Walkman. I didn't need anything fancy and these are very basic, but they are comfortable and the sound is good. They are comfy enough as is, but there are also some little spongy covers included, if you prefer not to have the hard plastic right up against your skin. The cord is longer than the original ones, which has turned out to be a big help, as I tend to catch it on things. (It's nice not to have them yanked out of my ears!) Finally, the plug is L-shaped, which helps keep the plug plugged in, even when jogging, etc. I would recommend these to anyone wanting basic buds at a great price."
271,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed with these headphones. I've purchased several Sony MDRE10LP earbuds, and while they ended up breaking after about a year they were comfortable and reliable until then, and while some people might not like the sound quality I couldn't tell the difference. The MDRE9LP sound is noticeably tinnier, although my ears get used to that after a while and the wires for the two earbuds separate about 18"" from the earbud, significantly longer & more prone to tangling than the MDRE10LP and it doesn't have a slider to shorten it. But the reason I will not buy this model again is that the plug seems ridiculously sensitive. If the plug shifts a bit while the device it's connected to is in my pocket I get bursts of static & lower volume, which eventually turns into no volume if I don't twist or press it back. I've tried unplugging & replugging to see if it was just how I put it in, but the problem keeps recurring. I'll keep these as emergency backup headphones, but they won't be the ones I regularly use."
272,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the only ear buds I buy because they are the only ones that stay in my ears. They also last a long time and let me tell you they are in my ears All day.....Every Day... Except that one time I accidentally cut the wire to one ear with a pair of scissors.
273,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are not as good as the ones that Sony makes which have soft material that fits into the ear. These sit just inside the ear and I don't find them as comfortable as the others, nor do they have the same sound."
275,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Left speaker stopped working March 14th, 33 days after I purchased...

Not good..."
276,3.0 out of 5 stars,I just bought these a awhile ago and i was listening to music and pulled them out of my pocket and the ear pierce broke. They were good the whole time i had them til they went and broke.
277,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are by far my favorite earbuds. They sit in the ear well, sound is good."
278,3.0 out of 5 stars,I'm not to happy with these ear phones. The year are as loud as the ones I buy at Kmart
279,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are terrible sounding, no bass no highs"
280,4.0 out of 5 stars,not bad for price
281,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The first two days, they worked so well but then the next day it had static sounds. Really disappointed, I thought it would have lasted more than a month at least."
282,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them!
283,1.0 out of 5 stars,Product came broken! Only 1 ear phone worked.
284,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm on my second pair of these. I got my first pair two years ago and they still work perfectly. Thought it would be a good idea to have a spare pair on hand. All other earbuds I have owned have eventually stopped working, especially on one side. I have dropped these like crazy and they still hold up. Happy I found some that are long lasting. I even accidentally submerged the right earbud in water and it still works. The protective covers that come with it really help and if they get dirty just wash with soap and water. The only thing I don't really like is how long the cord is. It's way longer than any I've ever seen and it's really easy to drop them on the floor. In my case they fell to the floor and right into the mop bucket."
286,5.0 out of 5 stars,works great and the sound is good
287,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best headphones ever! I had the apple ones before these and you can really hear the difference, they also put up with a lot of swat if you use them to workout in"
288,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Works fine in general, but when I try to use it on my smart phone, it will constantly start and stop playing music at random as well as change volume."
289,4.0 out of 5 stars,I wish there was some padding on these bath and that they're great
290,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the only headphones that I was able to lose before they broke. Usually headphones break far before I'm able to lose them. :)
291,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thanks a lot !!
292,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for for smaller ears, and inexpensive. They're actually pretty fragile and th ear piece can break if dropped on the ground even once. Also i"

302,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great so far.
303,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bought 4 for my 4 children. One stopped functioning almost immediately. My daughter just threw it in the garbage. She said it was not even worth returning it. I suggest spending a bit more for better quality.
304,5.0 out of 5 stars,great!
305,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Typically good Sony product. It's not marketed to audiophiles, but it's rxcllent for everyday use."
306,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really great! A perfect replacement to the iPhone earbuds that always tend to stop working after a few months...
308,3.0 out of 5 stars,I have had these for maybe 3 weeks then I accidentally pulled them out of my ears and one side dropped to the floor and broke. I've had 4 pairs of these and this is the only one that broke.
309,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It is not a perfect to my ears. The sound quality is okay. For its price, this is a good product."
310,3.0 out of 5 stars,I got what i paid for. Sound isn't all that great.
311,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got them originally for me, but son goes through earbuds like Candy... this is works well enough considering the price. :-)"
312,3.0 out of 5 stars,ok but not as good as my old ones

319,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice- good- strongly recommend seller -Thanks
320,1.0 out of 5 stars,It did not last as expected. A month after purchase of of the ear piece had stooped working.
321,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only small earbuds that really fit me comfortably. I buy these same ones periodically.

326,1.0 out of 5 stars,No good
327,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thanks
328,2.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these to replace my Sony MDR-E10LP that were broken. The sound is not as good as the E10LPs. It is not as crisp and sometimes sounds like it is coming from the other end of a long hallway. They are the exact same shape and size as teh E10LPs but they just don't have the same sound quality.
330,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad sound I wouldn't raccomend buying. The minute I try them I throw them in the garbage!
331,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cute and durable headphones
332,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great sound for the low price, i have it in my office and sound perfect, its a sony! buy it."
333,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound - Well, it's nothing for an audiophile, but it's great for just about anyone else! Sound quality is crisp, smooth, no static or anything, just overall perfect. The bass isn't anything compared to iBeats but it's much better compared to Apple iPod earphones, and it's pretty good for $10.

Comparisons/Durability - 4.5 - I put these through a lot of abuse, wearing them pretty much 9-12 hours a day. This includes constant yanking out of the laptop, (they are so well-fitted in my ear, that its nearly impossible for them to yank out of my ear, thank god.), bending the wire, listening to music on-the-go (while running/walking), stepping on them, and so much more. The longest pair I had lasted about 5 months, until I accidentally dropped them in a bucket of water for hours. When I took them out, only the right side worked. The next pair I had lasted for 4 months, until my foot got caught on the wire and the left wire was disconnected from the earphone, so only the right side worked. Alongside that 2nd pair, I had purchased Skullcandy Ink'd Earbuds, which cost considerably more than these. I am not a fan of earbuds like those, and the fit was terrible regardless of which earbud size I used. The sound quality was also very poor. And alongside the Ink'd and my broken 2nd pair of Sony's, I had some JVC earphones. The sound quality was much better than Ink'd, although not as good as Sony's. Alas, the fit was rather uncomfortable. Which led me to buy yet another pair of Sony MDRE9LP Ear buds. My 3rd pair, the one I am now, is about a week old and I love them Another thing I likeabout them is how simple they look, and the colors/design of them. I've had blue, purple and now black. They are great earphones and I recommend them to anyone.

Comfortable - 5/5 - They fit great on my ears, with or without the earpads they supply.(In general, I tend to rip the earpads after a few days, but regardless of that, they are still comfy.) They have never come out so far. Regardless of how many times they've been yanked, they've always managed to stay in. It's a lightweight design and it's enough that if I don't have music playing, I'll even forget that I'm wearing them. They're not a bother and I can wear them for very long stretches at a time, the longest I've worn them being about 8-10 hours.

I recommend these to pretty much everyone, from the lightweight music listener to the diehard teenager."
334,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is ok, but the connection for the left side started to go bad after about a month"
335,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Well first off, they at least came on time and the product is decent but the product i ordered was green and i received orange. For six dollars it didnnt seem worth it to send them back but still? At least send the right color."
336,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the only style my daughter would wear. The Grove fits comfortably in her ear. I like that they have a covering and there is no where for wax to go into the holes.
337,4.0 out of 5 stars,great sound for the $$$ nice Bass
338,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these headphones about a year ago in a Sony outlet and thought they were a great, low-cost pair of headphones...as opposed to paying $30+ for a pair of Apple headphones. Lost the first pair and needed new ones so bought two more pairs and they are great!"
339,5.0 out of 5 stars,"love it, thanks"
341,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for the price! Had them for a while now, and they are used everyday in the gym. Excellent quality for the price."
342,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work great :)
343,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate things that go in my ears and these just sort of hang on the notch in my ears. They don't some out when I take my morning walk either. However, if you don't have a ""notch"" above your ear lobe you might have trouble keeping these on. They work great for me."
344,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pop out sometimes, but otherwise they're really good. Good sound."
345,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They sounds great, cheap, and last a long time. It's exactly what I wanted and more. I buy three pairs and be done with it. My one problem is that they are a little uncomfortable to wear. They have cushions you could put on to make it better, but they are slightly annoying. Other then that, love them!"
346,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works and sounds great
347,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Build quaility is decent and it looks very stylish. However, the sound quality is really terrible( flat sound, hardly any bass). Had to switch back to my old mdr e808 earphones which sounds way better. Bought this on impulse because I needed a replacement and regretted doing so."
348,5.0 out of 5 stars,They hurt if you let them in your ears a long time but you are only suposte to leave them in for short amounts of time any way.
349,3.0 out of 5 stars,Its ok for the price.
350,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is worth the price, it's extremely cheap and the quality is amazing.

These ear buds last me forever and are perfect for anything.

5 out of 5 stars.

If you were thinking about buying these, BUY THEM!"
352,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent earbuds for the price.
353,5.0 out of 5 stars,They came in one day and they are a great pair of headphones. They are the only headphones that fit in my ear comfortably and allow me to hear. I love this headphones
354,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good, but if your picky on sound they can be a little crackly. It doesn't bother me though."
355,5.0 out of 5 stars,exactly what I wanted.
356,4.0 out of 5 stars,Unlike my prevous pair these earphones fit perfectly in my ears and don't fall out even when Jogging. The sound quality is also very good for the price. A great buy
357,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Acceptable but not great sound quality - even on voice only listening material.
Comfortable.
As always the disposable foam covers are pretty useless, impossible to install without ripping. I don't know why companies persist in even including them in the package."
358,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless sound. Gave them to my 4 year-old
359,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sony ear buds are very, very good. The stay in my ears very nicely and have lasted very well. It's only been 'bout 2 weeks of daily use and hopefully they will last much longer."
360,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them. I don't spend 10 minutes untaggling them and the sound is great.
361,5.0 out of 5 stars,want more
363,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works to my liking. No complaints.
364,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great comfortable headphones...I like black because they don't get dirty..
365,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality isn't the best, but they work. I got them just to have at work, so they will do fine for that, but I have definitely found myself having to raise the volume higher than I have with previous headphones."
366,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice sound, I like it"
367,5.0 out of 5 stars,My teen loved them. Just what was needed.
368,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These were a gift for my son, he has only said that he likes them. He's been taking care of this set, so he must. Normaly headphones in my house last a week or two & they are lost, or the cords ripped."
369,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best for the price!
370,1.0 out of 5 stars,i just bought these headphones already and they shorted out already dont waste your time
371,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap, and they sound it. The quality of playback on these is notably poor, and the first thing I did after my first listen was come back and buy a different set of buds. Would not recommend, even at this price."
372,5.0 out of 5 stars,I tried several different pairs for Teen Grandkids and these held up and they love the color choices. Great sound.
374,5.0 out of 5 stars,"excellent sound, high treble and rich bass"
375,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice product, works great"
376,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought one of those one time because I was on rush and I didn't want to spend time comparing stuff and I trust on Sony. I'm really glad for that. I bought 3 more of those since, and it's just because I like to have different colors and/or I lost my earphones frequently..."
377,5.0 out of 5 stars,Meet my expectations
378,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple yet very loud.
379,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great pair of headphones! The pink color is really cute too. If you need a pair of headphones these work fantastic! The shipping was super fast and these have lasted about a year with much damage done to it.
380,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing headphones. Very comfortable and the sound is awesome.
381,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Small, weightless and new. Like it"
382,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for a cheap pair of headphones.
383,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these. They are inexpensive, they fit well in my ears and I have bought a few of them so I can just have them where I need them."
385,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are super straightforward and just what I need. They're not too quiet, they have great balance built in, and they're always readily available. My latest shipment was no different.
It's the best quality at this kind of price. Typically, they last for months-- I've been buying this exact kind for years and if they last less than three months, it's probably because I broke them myself!
They also happen to be as comfortable as in-ear headphones get. I can usually wear for hours with no bother.
I'm a longtime customer and definitely will return."
386,3.0 out of 5 stars,These got dropped on the floor and both sides cracked open. ;( They probably would have lasted longer if they had not been dropped. I have bought these for years and they have always been good unless dropped.
387,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not great. Was looking for a decent pair to replace my apple earbuds. These work but don't have the bass or clarity of the apple ones. Reviews were misleading. Apple ones are $10 at Walmart
388,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These suck. A few years ago, I bought the Sony MDRE10LP (note the slight difference in model number) and they were the best! Now, it seems like Sony doesn't make those anymore, and this is their replacement.

This new iteration is so much worse. I'm using the former model as my basis for comparison, since both were around the same price. What I did was to listen to a song with the old ones, and then play exactly the same song but using the new pair. In comparison, the bass is non-existent and the treble is weak. Sound quality is low and lacks depth. With the switch, the music sounds like the bit rate was halved.

If someone knows of a good pair of affordable ear buds that are equivalent in quality to the former MDRE10LP, please let me know."
389,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Let's be real, these are inexpensive earbuds that do not have an in-ear design. If you want a pair of buds to take to the gym, go running or biking in, then these are great. When you are running or biking out in the city or outside of a gym in general, for safety reasons, you don't want earbuds that go inside your ear canal to create that ""soundproof seal"" that blocks all outside noise. If I am sitting on a subway or at home or on a treadmill then the situation is different and in-ear buds that create that seal are what I prefer over these ones. I use these mostly for listening to music and podcasts during exercise. They sound decent and if they get sweaty they are cheap so no big deal so they fit my needs perfectly."
390,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap, and they sound like it. Comfortable in the ear, but a tinny, thin, baseless sound that disappoints even the best music. Comparably priced Panasonic earbuds have much better sound. Steer clear of this Sony product."
391,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would.
These earbuds sound worse than a standard pair you'd buy with electronics from a dollar store. I'm really shocked at how terrible the quality is, coming from Sony. It wouldn't surprise me if these are knockoffs since many reviewers say they've had this model of earbuds in the past and that those pair did not sound as bad as a pair they bought from here on Amazon. If you need ultra cheap knockoffs just go to eBay and order them for $3."
392,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones for a really good price! I use these to run and they stay in my ears fine. The sound quality is pretty decent for these cheap earbud kind of headphones. Also, they've lasted me for a long time - got them probably 6 months ago and they're still working really well despite all the abuse they take from me (accidentally closed the cardoor on them more than once already...)"
393,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are pretty low quality, but that's what you have to expect for this price. They work well and seem to hold up decently as well, but if you plan to use these often its worth it to get some higher quality ear buds for a slightly greater price."
394,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just don't buy. They sound tiny, with absolutely no reproduction in the hi or low ranges, even mid-low sound like crap. Get Panasonic RP-HV096 and save Amazon from the costs of return shipping."
396,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They have already quit working on one side and have had them less than a month. As for the other pair, I still have not received! Thanks, this was our first experience of shopping on line and I would say it has not been a good one. Probably our last."
397,3.0 out of 5 stars,They didn't last very long.
398,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound
399,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
400,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Although they don't have the greatest sound quality, they are great for the price'! Been two months, so far so good."
401,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Item arrived on time or I should say earlier than I expected! The quality for this ear phones are pretty much moderate, I can't say it's very good. But it's pretty decent."
402,3.0 out of 5 stars,okay ear buds for price. Not the best bass
403,5.0 out of 5 stars,A+++++!!!!!
404,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They didn't work for very long, but were good while they lasted."
405,4.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE 4/14/17: These headphones are still going strong! Still have good sound even though I use them for hours every day. The occasional crackling still happens, but it goes away if wiggle them around in the jack a bit.

There are two things I really like about these headphones: 1) the type of wire casing they use. On a lot of headphones (*cough*Apple*cough*) the rubber casing disconnects/rips exposing the wires, which I HATE. These headphones are a bit more old school in that the wires are fully encased in the tight, flexible plastic-y rubber, the kind that lasts forever. 2) the type of bud. I hate the elongated rubbery buds you have to shove deep into your ear canal. They don't fit my ears well, and are uncomfortable to use if you're laying on your side. Since I usually fall asleep with my headphones in, that's a major issue for me. These ones fit a little looser and fall out occasionally, but they're much more comfortable for me.
This is my second pair of this brand of headphones. The old ones lasted almost a year-and-a-half (wearing them daily for a majority of the day), which I found very impressive. The sound in the buds grew slowly fainter until finally one of the buds gave out. If this pair lasts as long, I will be satisfied.
The only annoying thing about these is that occasionally they crackle. That's not a deal breaker for me, though."
407,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product.
408,3.0 out of 5 stars,Broke in less than a year. Loved the color and quality was nice
409,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome they loud asf and arrived early
410,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value. When they break it's my fault usually and I just keep buying the same pair again
411,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave these to a friend as part of their birthday present. They liked the sound quality and the color, but they only lasted her for a few months."
412,2.0 out of 5 stars,"May i start by saying I love Samsung products but this is horrendous. Straight out the package and there's a short, they fall out very easily. Overall, I should have spent a little more for better quality."
413,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones
414,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gift for my daughter..she loves them
415,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Work fairly well. Definitely worth the price. What I didn't realize was that these did not have a button on them to skip songs, but that is not a huge issue."
416,5.0 out of 5 stars,These ear buds are the best I found. I have tried several and Sony pleases me more than the rest. Since i use them daily I buy in bulk and I like free shipping so it is a win win for me.
418,3.0 out of 5 stars,They work and don't sound entirely terrible. Good to keep in your bag for traveling when you forget to take your preferred set.
419,5.0 out of 5 stars,Haven't had a problem with these headphones. Mine have been through the washer and dryer and STILL work perfectly. Love them.
420,3.0 out of 5 stars,ok
421,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE THESE EARBUDS!!! Best quality ever! Recommend this for every buyers!
422,5.0 out of 5 stars,great
423,5.0 out of 5 stars,great
424,1.0 out of 5 stars,Well I just received my new headphones and got to the gym and to right eat doesn't even work. The left ear is heard to hear from too. Wouldn't recommend them..
425,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
426,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a repeat purchase. My daughter reports the buds have the most comfortable fit in her ears.
427,5.0 out of 5 stars,"yes, i expected quality form Sony and received it."
429,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have always loved these and are very sad that SONY does not make them anymore!
430,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is tinny. Sending them back as only one earbud actually worked. Highly disappointed.
431,1.0 out of 5 stars,Trash
432,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap and affordable you cant go wrong with these headphones. They sound just like the larger versions of these Sony ear buds. I recommend these to those who frequently replace ear buds.
433,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty decent ear buds, especially for their low price tag."
434,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
435,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These arrived quickly, and unlike some places, they actually sent exactly what they picture in the original packaging. I'm using these for my iPod, my phone, and my laptop. They're comfortable IMHO, have good sound quality...just a great buy."

442,4.0 out of 5 stars,it is good for the price. It worked for 2 months :(
443,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good set of ear buds.
444,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelente!
445,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The cheap price I paid for these was not even worth it. Going from Apple brand ear buds to these were a huge disappointment. No base or quality at all in the sound. I have to put my volume to half+ even just to hear my music at all. In addition to the poor sound quality, within two days of using them, the ear piece broke and is dangling by the cord. I was not expecting these earbuds to be the best in the market, but I did not expect them to break in the first 48 hours of using them. I only purchased because of the positive reviews on here, and hoped that the negative reviews that I read were just over done, however the positive reviews about these honestly must have been from the buyer or Sony employees because these are really awful. Do not waste your time or money"
446,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do. Not. Buy. Bad - sounds like music from a tin can. I can't find decent $10 ear buds. Sony used to have some.

Still shopping, just $10 poorer for the effort."

454,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality of these ear buds are average at best, but it's great for the price. It is both durable and comfortable. It may also be used as a dog leash."
455,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to listen to my electronics (laptop, ipod, tablet etc). They are a good price for the quality and they do not easily break.
If you need a cheap replacement for headphones this a pretty good buy."
456,3.0 out of 5 stars,These are not soft cushioned ear buds but it will do the trick for temp ear buds.

I use it daily for many hours and it's good on high and low level of sounds, no distortions."
470,2.0 out of 5 stars,Had these for about a month or two and right earbud started to cut in and out a week ago. Mediocre!
471,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gets the job done.
Not very expensive stays in the ears, but doesn't totally block out ambient sounds in the environment. Sometimes you need to hear things around you."
473,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The big question for me is ""How long will they last?"" These earbuds are comfortable and have great sound. I hope they hold up for at least 3 months. Most don't."

485,4.0 out of 5 stars,"they're great for the price; last a long time if you take care of them. i've noticed that for me, only one earbud stops working so i always get new ones, but like i said, for the price, you can't go wrong."
486,4.0 out of 5 stars,very good
487,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using this for about a year.
It's Ok.

497,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my favorite type of headphones. They fit my ears (unlike the ones that come with Apple products), and they're purple."
498,5.0 out of 5 stars,best fitting buds I have found that replace the ipod headphones. More durable too.
499,2.0 out of 5 stars,Broke after a few months... I purchased the same headphones from another seller and it lasted me a year.
500,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfy and great sound reproduction for a great price.
501,5.0 out of 5 stars,Earbuds came in a bubble wrap envelope which was great! I think this shows just how much this seller really cares for the customer's satisfaction. It came exactly as the review stated which was also another bonus. Definitely happy with my product.
502,5.0 out of 5 stars,i use these with my little Sony radio and it all fits in my shirt pocket. i enjoy sitting outside with it.
503,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent sound quality
504,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I did not expect such quality for my money. Handy, comfortable and excellent sound quality. I was impressed with the clarity and volume for the low price I paid for this."
506,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In the less than $15 headphones arena, this is the winner! I've used Gummy, Philips, and all of the headphones in the price range, even the newest Apple headphones and a few of the pricier ones. This one maintains its quality for the longest amount of time. The others in this price range either break in a much shorter amount of time or do not live up to the quality of these."
507,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe it's just the way my ears are shaped, but these are the most comfortable earbuds I've ever owned. I've easily had them in my ears for eight to ten hours at a time without any pain whatsoever. They are so comfortable, I frequently forget that I am wearing them.

While most other earbuds come with silicon padding, these don't, and that's why I love them. I absolutely despise earbud padding; I frequently eat while watching videos with my earbuds in. Earbuds with padding amplify the sounds in my head so the sounds of chewing are louder than whatever I'm listening to. Not with these. With these, you can eat whatever you want with these in and you'll never hear yourself chew.

These are definitely the best earbuds you can buy for less than $10.

Other things that are just personal preference: these don't come with a volume control and some would say that the bass isn't very strong. Both of these things make me very happy. A volume control is unnecessary, as everything I plug these earbuds into has its own volume control, and I prefer low bass so that I can actually hear what I'm listening to.

My only complaint is that the cord could stand to be a bit longer, but that's almost never an issue for me."
508,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great price. They work well. Nice and long for you tall folks.

I wanted to write an update. I've now had these earbuds almost two years and I want to change
my review to 5 stars! They still work GREAT! These earbuds have far outlasted any I've had before
and I use them almost every single day for hours at a time. I highly recommend them!"
509,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have bought Sony earbuds for years for my iPod because of the quality of sound.This is my last time. They have already fallen apart and lasted a very short time. I don't expect them to last forever but 6 months to a year I think is reasonable. The sound is fine but the wires are thin and flimsy.. It comes apart at the earbud and it can't be put back together. I am now going to try another brand.
510,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, seeing the decent reviews of this product—and trusting the Sony brand—I thought I'd give them a shot. Mistake. I thought I was plugging them in incorrectly or something. Nope: the problem is that there is no bass response in these earbuds. I switched them back and forth between the Apple EarPods and there is NO comparison. The EarPods blow them away.

I can't wear the ""in ear"" type earphones that plug the canal (too dangerous for me to block out all external sound), so I guess I'll spend the thirty bucks for the real Apple deal. Maybe there's a similarly performing non-Apple product around the fifteen or twenty range? Anyway, do yourself a favor and skip these if you care at all about hearing the lower half of your music. If you only listen to lectures and don't care about natural sound, maybe you'll be fine."
511,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are durable and will last for years if well taken care of .The sound is sharp. I have had 3 pairs not because they broke but rather because I lost them . Great but for the money. I got them for $8 bucks via Amazon . I even spent $10 which is still a good buy
512,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality that can be expected of a brand like SONY. They are really great top notch cheapos. Dont spend less than about $10 for a pair of buds and dont trust other no-name companies. These wont beat say a $30 pair of SONY's but they do work the sound is good and so is the base. Good for the everyday car ride/train/ commute. But obviously if you need better quality spend more money. But for me, these are just right. Cant blast them all the way up to max or you'll get a perma static and they will start to die. So as I said, top notch cheapos but if you need real high quality .. still go for SONY (I like them) or other brand and just spend more money. But my headphones take a bit of punishment over time. Yanking by mistake or taking them off when Im on pc and dropping them to the ground, not tossing carelessly but I dont really bother to set them down with the utmost care. So these are good for runners and people who work out and they might last a few months, maybe I'll update when they go dead but I dont think itll be soon as SONY does make good quality stuff. Buy them! For $10 its good bang for the buck. I will be buying again or I might move up to buying $20 SONY's, $20 SONY's are a real safe bet in terms of bang and buck."
513,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work well for the price. I inevitably have one headphone die at a time for me and keep going through $10 pairs every year. I like this design and can't stand the in ear type.
514,5.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed I couldn't find these in the store when Sony changed the design. I have difficulty wearing ear buds due to sensitivity with the material they're made of. Glad I can still get them here.
515,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones. I use them with my phone and tablet. I used my previous set for two years. I really wasn't exceptionally careful with them and they held up great. They went through the laundry a couple of times and still kept working. I really like the quality of sound too. It is very good for headphones in this price range. I will buy these again, if they are available when I need another set."
517,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is great. My daughter loves them.
518,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works good
519,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great
520,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds sound absolutely terrible. No bass at all, and if you try and increase it through an iPod it sounds muffled and not crisp at all."
521,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had these same earbuds previously and loved them so much so when the left side of my older ones died out I knew I wanted to get the same ones. Quick shipping and no problems with payment or anything else. Love the earbuds and love how easy it was to get them.
522,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use it all the time.
523,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
524,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the perfect earbuds for someone who doesnt like the in-ear buds like myself. theyre comfortable and come in different colors!
525,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really love thse headphones. They're stylish and the sound quality is pretty good as well. They are hard to find in stores so I had to come here to get them. I was a bit skeptical at first but I'm glad I decided to purchase them.
526,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked only for 1 week
528,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These do sound very good .
For the money , you can't go wrong and the portability as well.

I would recommend them. Especially, if you are looking to use them for outdoor activities."
529,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is great. Love the color. They fit well. Very reliable product. Thanks. Priced good too. Still working after months and months.
530,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thanks for the fast delivery and excellent quality headphones :D
531,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's really good and it came on the expected day.
532,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these head buds
533,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome product! Quick delivery
534,1.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones have very poor bass and sound like what you'd expect from a transistor radio. The only thing they're really good for is listening to talk radio where sound quality isn't all that important.
535,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice product
536,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have some earbuds I bought at the ABC STORE in HAWAII that were better than these sony earbuds these earbuds are just not good IF you like earbuds that cling to your ear for better quality music. Even my M&M candy earbuds are better
537,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work well and I May order more of them in case I lose these.
539,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got here the day they were supposed to and they sound great! I would recommend them!
540,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst sound quality ! Avoid like the plauge!
541,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap quality, sounds like listening to a radio."
542,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sorry to say, these are pretty to look at, but very uncomfortable to use. They do produce nice sound. Very disappointed."
543,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fine
544,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love them!
545,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I rarely write reviews on here, however, for a Sony product, these headphones are terrible. The Sound quality is poor, muffled, and unlistenable even for a product in this price range,"
546,3.0 out of 5 stars,pure sh****t
547,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the shape of the earbuds but unfortunately, they are very fuzzy, lots of static, very poor sound quality."
548,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice audio essential. Nothing fancy, but works well. Worth it for the price."
550,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality for the price you pay.
551,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best earbuds out there but for ~$10 they're about the best you'll get. Pretty reliable product that I'll likely rebuy if they break down in a few months.
552,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I think I'm going to end up breaking these at some point, but that happens to all of my headphones after about 2 months. They look cool and fit well though, and work pretty well."
553,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product and shipped very fast. I placed my order on Saturday and got it Monday.
554,4.0 out of 5 stars,"good transaction, item was as described."
555,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best ear buds I've tried. Comfortable, decent sound."
556,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really surprised at the sound quality and the comfort of it being in my ear! When I bought these, I didn't expect the sound to be this great. If anybody is looking for a great sound of earbuds that are just simple and comfortable, you should buy these!"
557,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, it's hard to complain. These sound good, but they fall out of my ears quite easily; the cords are thin and they seem to tangle more than others I've had. Again, hard to complain for the price."
558,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I expected. Durable ear buds with a soft foam cover. Nice long cord. Use at work with my iPod and works great.
559,4.0 out of 5 stars,They static but they work well!!!!
561,5.0 out of 5 stars,In regards to people saying they cut back on the volume; you might be going deaf. I regularly go to concerts and maxing out the sound with these will surely be an ear-sore.
562,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I like to have an alternative to my large expensive headphones, especially when curled up in bed watching something on a device. The Sony buds life was snuffed out even quicker than some cheap $3 buds bought in the check out line at Walmart. Though the quality of the audio was far supreme. That does not matter if the buds are dead tho. I am quite careful with earbuds, as I know they are delicate as
snowflakes. Inexplicable really."
563,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's okay. Not thing extraordinary
564,3.0 out of 5 stars,just okay
565,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good ear phones, really needed them, came in at about the right time :)"
566,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very rugged and excellent audio fidelity for shortwave listning!
567,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
568,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought my first pair of these for 9 dollars after buying several other more common ones and it was the first time I occasionally had to ask myself if my speakers were still on.
569,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I only rated this 3 stars, because they did not fit in my ears. Not because it was the earphones issue but because I have tiny ears. It was shipped quickly, the product is awesome looking."
570,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product
572,3.0 out of 5 stars,"the ear phones were pretty average i thought. as far as the sound goes i wasn't impressed, i have heard better . but they do look nice, and did arrive very quickly, they were a great low price. i wish the was better tho."
573,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, these headphones are incredibly comfortable and provide good sound. I bought these because I owned the previous model and they held up for a couple years and are just a solid if unspectacular headphone."
574,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap and simple, but there is a catch. I bought two pairs of these Sony earbuds and after using the first pair for only 1 minute, I can tell you that music sounds flatter than flat. With the equalizer all set and the bass turned up, making sure that the trebel is low and... Flat. Aside from tone loss, there was an immediately noticible static sound every time the cord moved. Seems like the right angle of the 3.5 mm plug is working against this pair of ear buds. I should've only purchased one pair, but I'll hold out hope that my second pair isn't the same as the first. What a waste."
575,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was concerned that the quality would be bad due to the price. I thought I would need to spend $30+ for a decent earbuds. But it's a great product. I don't have to worry about losing it because it's cheap enough to buy another one.
576,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is fine, they're honestly just uncomfortable in the ear."
577,4.0 out of 5 stars,"sound quality is not that good but is ok for the price 6/10 , confort is 8/10"
578,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lost my Sony ear buds and found these for under $7.00. Very nice and like the sound
579,2.0 out of 5 stars,Broke easily
580,1.0 out of 5 stars,They broke after my first use.
581,1.0 out of 5 stars,NO wonder Sony Fell from grace. This is the suckiest. Full of static. Not even worth my time to return it.
583,5.0 out of 5 stars,Earphones work like a charm! Great price for the amount of money I spent on them! I highly consider to purchase!
584,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've bought several pairs of the Sony earbuds and have found all of them to be of great quality and durability. I don't mess with the few other brands that I'd gotten before since they went bad every time.
585,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound. Cord is a little longer than my old one, which I like, but the earpieces are a little larger and not as comfortable. Overall I'm happy with them."
586,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best ear buds ever
587,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome and worth every penny spent on them. These are above and beyond what I expected when I ordered. I would order them again without hesitation.
588,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for the gym but there is too much ambient noise in a typical gym to really hear music clearly with these.
589,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Right out the package one earbud didn't work. So I have to return them. I am very pissed, was really looking forward to these headphones."
590,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair of these that lasted me 2+ years, which is a really long time for earbuds. When they finally broke, I bought another pair off amazon. They have been great so far."
591,4.0 out of 5 stars,"it is easy to port and beautiful to look, when you have it working out, it doesn't drop from your ears, which is surprising me, since it is more tiny than I was expected. wish it can live a long life~~"
592,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelente
594,2.0 out of 5 stars,"its sound quality is not bad, but it's flat and big, keeps falling out from my ear. kind of silly to hold it to my ears with both hands while walking on the street"
595,3.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are not the best ok for the price. The fell on the floor once and they broke. They were only a couple of bucks so you get what you pay for
596,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like these headphones a lot it's the only brand I use.
597,5.0 out of 5 stars,me encantan
598,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Upon its arrival one of the earbuds didn't work. I have had a pair of these last a year before but this one came broken.
Will not buy again. EVER. From this seller or earbuds online."
599,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great.
600,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prefect
601,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just as expected and at a cheaper price that local stores,I love these headphones there cheap but decent quality my last pair lasted me 2 years"
602,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
603,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works perfectly, lasts longer than most earbuds."
605,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There really good, I use them for when I go skate and they don't fall out when you have the little foam ear covers on them. they sound good, and are really cheap."
606,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the excellent price it meets all my expectations
607,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear buds sound spectacularly bad. Imagine listening to music with your head inside a toilet bowl. That is what these ear buds will sound like. Since I am only using them for spoken word audio I'll just suck it up and keep them. On the bright side, they fit pretty well for me and are light weight. But if you are buying these for music I'd strongly suggest throwing a few extra bucks towards something even halfway decent."
608,5.0 out of 5 stars,an exact replacement for what I originally had. Perfect replacement.
609,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best value for the money! Great sound, good price, arrived on time!"
610,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had it for 8 months now, to replace my iPhone headphone. It is still working great, considering being used at least 2-3 hours a day for 8 months!"
611,4.0 out of 5 stars,Could be better but it's good enough for the price.
612,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good bass sound. Good price and quality.
613,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad, as expected."
614,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Its ok, not as good as the s5 active earbudds but much more comfortable."
616,5.0 out of 5 stars,Such a small item to look for yet it id essential to heating your music personally. Amazon had it. Thanx
617,4.0 out of 5 stars,good earphones for its price; sits nicely in my ears and I can use them to work out. sounds is very clear especially when I use it on the train; you don't have to put the volume too up. I will bought another pair
618,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Does not have bass, but it's worth it!"
619,5.0 out of 5 stars,excelente
620,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible quality.
621,5.0 out of 5 stars,"these are the 2nd pair of these guys I have ordered. My son keeps
borrowing mine (hence why I bought them pink to deter him... needless
to say... he does not care lol)"
622,5.0 out of 5 stars,"sorry I clicked on the wrong amount of stars. they are great. for a back up pair. good , awesome fun"
623,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Ear Buds. The ones I had before these kept falling out of my ears. These never fall out and sound a lot better. I would highly recommend these!
624,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ive had these headphones for a while. For the price, they are actually great. Thank for a great buy."
625,2.0 out of 5 stars,There sorter good
627,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I expected better from Sony and made the mistake on not checking out the sound quality on these specific earbuds, etc. I used to love the Sony earbuds that I bought years ago, which lasted me a whole lot, while these earbuds sounded terrible as if they won't even last me a day. These are way over-priced if you have to pay for the shipping fee!!"
628,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered two pairs of the Sony Earbuds. The one pair did not work, it constantly stopped working after a period of time, get it to work again and after a while it would stop again. I tried my second pair and so far I have had no problem. So the first set of earbuds must have been defected. I guess it happens periodically but for the price I can not complain."
629,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I find these more comfortable than the jam in your ears buds. They are cheap; so I can buy a few pairs for when I lose them. Then I don't lose them, they seem to last a long time. My last pair broke because I shut it in the car door...opps. Even then the other ear worked until I could replace it"
630,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Dear Sony:

PLEASE continue to make earphones that are this shape. The newer shapes either hurt my ears (the Apple ones are torture) or won't stay in! This is the only brand I've been able to find that is still in this shape..."
631,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my first pair in 8th grade. I had to buy a new pair in 10th grade. I lost that pair for almost a year but once I found them I was able to use them until I got to college. So now I need to buy another pair.
THESE EARPHONES ARE DURABLE (this version isn't as great as the previous one) and they sound great.
Forreal, my 10th grade pair went through multiple washer/dryer cycles, tugs/pulls/drops, and survived through intense weather conditions.
These earphones are THE GREATEST."
632,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for a specific purpose, to put in my case with my 3DS and use when I didn't want speaker audio. For that they work great, they are light, clear and comfy. The bass response is pretty terrible (as is to be expected on cheap, small ear buds) and the wire is very thin and will probably break at some point. The big selling point for me is that they don't have any kind, type, form or fashion of rubber thing that I have to jam into my ear canal.
They aren't amazing but they are what I expected."
633,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the worst ever headset I've ever heard, the sound is horrible, the quality of the cord is very cheep and it looks like one wrong fold, the wires would bend and break. I was very disappointed in this, knowing that the brand is Sony and they seem to have pretty great stuff, just not this earbud."
634,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best cheap earbuds out there. However, the foam pads are very very thin, so I recommend getting some foam pads somewhere else (they're very cheap)."
635,1.0 out of 5 stars,"There was no sound in the right earbud. This is disappointing since I paid 2X the retail price in order to get purple earbuds in this style.

I have never had this issue with a pair of Sony earbuds before. I have bought at least 30 pairs of these from both Amazon and Target within the past few years with no issues.

The other three pairs that I purchased this time (pink and 2 pairs of black) work fine."
636,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sound quality I've ever heard in a pair of earbuds and the color is exactly as pictured. I order multiples of these at a time just in case I lose a pair.
638,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for my kindle. Color is great!
639,5.0 out of 5 stars,these ear phone are perfect and the volume is clear. they are potable and easy to hold it is a great color
640,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are basic and good headphones. The cord is very long and tangle-some but the sound is good. Nice buy
641,5.0 out of 5 stars,as advertised
642,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE these headphones.I have washed them 2 times by accident and they came out working like new.They are also very loud.
643,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These worked for less than two weeks and then left ear bud just stopped working. Cheap price doesn't always mean cheap product, but in this case it does. Save your money."
644,1.0 out of 5 stars,I cannot hear a thing out of one of the ear buds. Just purchased for my son to use at school.
645,2.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible and tinny.
646,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound lacks depth and bass (rather tin/can-like) compared to my last Sony earbuds.
647,5.0 out of 5 stars,good and small
649,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very ""tinney"" sounding. no mid range and no bass. very poor"
650,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking to replace my well-worn Sony MDR-E828LP ear buds that finally died. I need ear buds that don't go in the ear and block out outside noise. Although these were comparably priced to the ones I had before, these do not compare at all. I'm no audiophile, but the sound is like night and day. The bass on these is non existent. The cord also seems a lot thinner and fragile. If I hadn't destroyed the packaging trying to get these guys out, I'd be shipping the back. I'm trashing these and looking further.

Update: I just received the Sennheiser MX365 ear buds. They are just what I was looking for - reasonably priced and sound great!"
651,4.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived in time and love the sound quality
652,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad for headphones, especially if you are looking for some that's not earbud. Sound quality is awesome; I just wish it looked a little longer by retaining their older design."
653,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is pretty bad.
654,5.0 out of 5 stars,I needed a replacement for my Sony Walkman this works great. Very comfortable in the ear. Very much like the original headphones that came with the Walkman.
655,5.0 out of 5 stars,good product
656,2.0 out of 5 stars,It can't stay in my ears because the buds are too big!
657,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality for the price. Comfy, reliable, durable. Just what I needed."
658,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are quite comfortable. My hubby often falls asleep with them in his ears. He listens to audio books and music with them.
660,5.0 out of 5 stars,very good and i would reccomend to anyone who needs earbuds for a very low price just very a good product
661,4.0 out of 5 stars,I'm happy with my purchase so far. The quality is very good for the price and I love the color. I'm considering a second pair in a different color just a backup.
662,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are cheap, not premium quality, but they work that is the most important part."
663,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing earbuds I love em :) sound quality is amazing love them
664,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these ear buds a few weeks ago. Me and my daughter have been using them and they work fine so far.
665,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible earpuds, broke so fast"
666,5.0 out of 5 stars,Their great sound a loud good quality
667,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only negative i have on these is that the L and R labels are white on clear, which is very hard to see. Otherwise, they sound good and i use them daily."
668,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thanks everything went faster Than expected
669,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is the one my daughter picked. at the same time I bought MDR-EX210B/BLU Earbud Style Headphones. The best for this is that it cost me only 8 bucks and she has this as spare.
671,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works fine for the price
672,2.0 out of 5 stars,Left one broke in two months so I stopped using it. In the long run you'll end up investing more money on other headphones if you make the mistake of buying these.
673,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very usefull and just what I need. Good condition. You can make promotion. All my friend like it. They what one.
674,5.0 out of 5 stars,Liked em so much I ordered 3 more
675,5.0 out of 5 stars,i have these and they are amazing to listen to. i have not used my apple ear phones and i have had my iphone 4s for 6 months.. i recommend these to any other ear phones.
676,5.0 out of 5 stars,As advertised.
677,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things are AWESOME!!!!!!! I really Recommend them. they produce good quality sound, these things are AMAZING!!! you need to buy them. Go on, buy them."
678,5.0 out of 5 stars,This are my favorite earbuds. They fit in my ears perfectly and work great. They are completely noise isolating and a great value.
679,4.0 out of 5 stars,it's a great headphone for people who like treble more than base.if you want to here things clearly.
680,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They're good for what they are, nice simple cheap option. Average sturdiness. Nothing spectacular, but I wasn't looking for spectacular, just serviceable."
682,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The music quality is good, but I sometimes have a little trouble keeping the earbuds in my ears."
683,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great little practical ear piece... well made. IMO, this Sony one is better materials and made than the apple's original IPOD ear piece that I replaced with. Can't beat the price of less than $10 as well."
684,5.0 out of 5 stars,working well so far. that's the reason i always purchased sony earbuds
685,2.0 out of 5 stars,My son liked the color but the sound quality was not good.
686,3.0 out of 5 stars,so-so. Not as good as previous similar model that came in a circle storage container.
687,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
688,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An absolute better quality sound than the JVC ""gummy"" headphones can't complain."
689,4.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I wanted.
690,5.0 out of 5 stars,They're reasonably priced and the prior pair I had lasted a long time even though I'm kind of hard on them. Hope this pair works and lasts as well.
691,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I needed when my other pair died (after about 4 years of regular use). The best quality of earphones (although I have yet to experience Beats by Dre)
693,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best earphones for $ 10 !!!
694,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have relatively small ears. These are hard, uncomfortable, and slip out. The sound quality is also poor. It sounds tinny and too quiet."
695,5.0 out of 5 stars,These ear buds were great and definitely exactly what I thought I was ordering. They fit great and have lasted for a while now.
696,3.0 out of 5 stars,I am glad i bought these headphones. they do block the sound out in the office. keeps the chatter out. ;-)
697,3.0 out of 5 stars,They didn't hold up very well.
698,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds came out of the package partially broken, requiring holding the wires in a specific spot to get sound to come out."

704,3.0 out of 5 stars,Cables are too thin and long. They get entangled too easly. Sound quality is good.
705,5.0 out of 5 stars,"good earbuds... like your used to.

706,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent quality, good sound. Better than the Phillips I had been using."
707,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not recomend this headphones. Really poor quality. You should pay some extra to get something else. On the other hand, they look quite good"

712,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing product! Great sound! Unbelievable quality. Ever since i got sony headphones i have been in love. I dont like the in-ear buds...i love these ones, nice and easy. The only thing is I wish I had got them in blue! Lol."

718,1.0 out of 5 stars,One side stopped working after only two uses....
719,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a good earphone,it just as same as the one I used before.The sound is clear and remarkable.It doesn't have any negative effects yet. I hardly recommend it to other people who needs one. Thx a lot!"
720,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the most durable earbuds I've ever had. While others only lasted me a month, one of these can last me up to a year."
721,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For simple ear buds and a low price, these are def worth getting. Something I can beat around with and not worry about damaging."
722,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these earbuds. I have had three pairs of these earbuds and I am never disappointed in the workmanship and quality.
723,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome ear buds, no need to spend 3 digits when you can get this instead, quick fix!"
724,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect earbuds for someone on a budget, foam goes on easy enough, and they're plenty comfortable."
726,5.0 out of 5 stars,Durable and great sound
727,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Save your money for another thing that sound good, THIS DOESN'T. Also this doesn't have a good base or sound fidelity."
728,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is reasonable choice in terms of design, sound quality, and price. If you are not that sensitive to sound quality, it will be good for you."
729,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound on these small headphones. I typically have a difficult time using ear buds, but these feel great and do not fall out. I would reccommend."

731,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty bad earbuds, poor sound, no bass, they fall out. But they work and are cheap"

733,5.0 out of 5 stars,great earphones.
734,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
735,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sony makes good & reliable earbuds. Have always bought them . Good listening volume & with my hearing impairment thear are GREAT ! Love'em !
737,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job and last a long time for me. Great product and low price.
738,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these ear buds all the time. They are simple, portable, and comfortable. They have good sound quality for the price."
739,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these, I've been buying them for years,"
740,4.0 out of 5 stars,great sound
741,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is OK
742,5.0 out of 5 stars,I always choose to buy this brand of headphones because they last me such a long time! They feel comfortable and are not too big or too small.
743,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best ear phones i ever bought. You cant go wrong with SONY. And for the price, its just a perfect win"
744,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They were crappy, but you always get what you pay for."
745,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All my family use them, and I always buy this model. Any color. Are great, decent bass and long too much time if you take care of them."
746,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these earbuds for my boyfriend and he loves the sound, great bass, music can be heard very clearly. I will definitely do more buying in the future with this vendor."
748,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unfortunately upon delivery this headset did not work. One of the ear buds is non functioning. Worst part? 'This item is not eligible for return.' Sad. Believe me.
749,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these in 2015, fast forward to 2018 and they work like when I bought them. I use them daily the quality is great, I like that they dont go inside your ear, because I usually fall asleep with them and I dont worry about ear injury. Very good product."
750,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Man I swear I hear things with these that I've never heard before on other speakers. They are VERY clear sounding and really make the music sound good. I prefer earbuds like these because I can listen to music at low volume and still hear what's going on around me. You can't do that with those squishy in ear speakers. They could always use more bass yes, but what do you expect from such a tiny speaker. Plus you can accidentally pull on the wires more than just one time without them breaking like most of the others seem to do. Highly recommended."
751,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate the new gel In-The-Ear buds.. they never seem to fit me. These headphones are exactly what I needed. They sit comfortably in my ear and offer a good sound for general use. They are cheap, but for their price .. They are definitely worth it! It is all relative, if you want something nicer, spend more money, if you want something to just have at a desk or in the car, or use on the bus.. It's a good product."
752,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ok so over the period of a year ive used 4 pairs of earphones 3 from what i bought from amazon that were rated a 5 and broke and another that came with my phone. When I bought these my uncle who works for a big electronics company said that earphones with a right angle cord that you plug into the hole (i dont know what it is called so dont judge me) is good because the wire wont come out when you dangle it and wrap it etc. anyway so these have that and I really like how they have different colors. The only negative thing is the covers are easy to come off but other than that there really good personally these are like the cheap version of beats although you can hear people in them if its low it still gives you that quality of music that the beats has personally to me.
753,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered these along with the Panasonic RP-HJE120. These Sony's have way too much treble and little to no bass reproduction. It always amazes me the difference a good set of earbuds makes vs a not so good set. The difference is not subtle. The Panasonic's do a much better job of sound reproduction, including bass without the ear piercing treble. I was surprised because Sony usually means good (I have many Sony products that are great), but not in this case. Just get the Panasonic RP-HJE120."
754,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these earbuds I accidentally left them in my back pocket and they made it into the washer they actually worked after they have been washed and in the water awesome..
755,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Certainly the most reliable earbuds I've bought so far not because of the sound quality, the durability. I've had this earphone for nearly two years and it still works flawlessly. I often unplug and plug these earphones often and they still work after two years. They also seem to get tossed around and dropped a lot but still work fine."
756,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to replace my ipod headphones that unfortunately went through the washing machine and dryer. I thought they would be a step up since the apple headphones are uncomfortable and had a very short cord. I was wrong. They get 2 stars since they technically produce sound and I can hear my music, but they produce lots of popping noises whenever I use them. Again, they are still usable, but very annoying."
757,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my favorite earbuds. The black ones are slightly smaller than the other colorful versions of this model. I like the black because the slightly smaller size is more comfortable for me. They have withstood multiple tangles, pulls and tugs. I am hard on these things and they have held up well."
759,5.0 out of 5 stars,FUE UN REGALO
760,5.0 out of 5 stars,I would recommend buying from you guys to anyone!! The Sony MDRE9LP/GRN Earbud Headphones are great to listen music or movies with!!!!

768,5.0 out of 5 stars,These were for my teenage son. He loves them. The headphones work great and were a great deal for the money.
770,2.0 out of 5 stars,"You get what you pay for. These are the kind that you buy just to have around when you need a pair. If you want to actually enjoy music, keep looking."
771,1.0 out of 5 stars,They are very hard to stick in your ears. They keep on falling out. So disappointed.
772,4.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my 9 yr old because she kept borrowing mine. The sound quality is very good and so was the price. I would defiantly recommend these.

784,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, good sound and I like the way they look also, my only issue is that they work their way out my ears while running but that is to be expected without a wrap around"
785,2.0 out of 5 stars,This thing must be in dust-bin only..:)
786,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm fussy about earbuds. These have good bass response, a long enough cord, and actually stay in my ear canal. Also, they're cheap."
787,3.0 out of 5 stars,It doesn't fit well
788,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones rock! This is my second pair and I find they are even higher quality than other earbuds that are 20 or 30 dollars. Definitely a great deal!
789,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They fit nice, There is just not enough bass. I like Sony stuff a lot, Just not this. They were cheep, and they sound it."
790,2.0 out of 5 stars,"they term""you'll get what you paid for"" is correct. i didn't think Sony could produce such a poor quality ear buds... but i was wrong"
792,5.0 out of 5 stars,This head phones are really great. love listening to my music anytime and anywhere especially when going to school or going out.
793,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Came early, works fine."
794,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was so glad to see these headphones are still being sold. Great sound and great quality!
795,5.0 out of 5 stars,Items worked well and were shipped quickly
796,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not sure how they work, they were a gift."
797,3.0 out of 5 stars,bought them for my daughter to go with her new ipod she has small ears so I should have looked at the ear piece better but they work fine
798,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones, always liked them alot!!"
799,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great. Good price. Arrived on time.
800,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely can't jog with these ear buds, let alone move too much without the risk of one falling out. meow"
801,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great earbuds and a great price.
803,4.0 out of 5 stars,Can't really go wrong with these guys.
804,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones eevvvveeerrr!!!
805,1.0 out of 5 stars,No bass. The big problem is one of the ear pieces fall apart in a week. Don't buy.
806,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these to use at work and they are petfect. I have had them for awhile now and the sound quality is great and these are very durable. Can't beat the price either.
807,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect. I bought this 2nd pair for work. Excellent comfort and sound.
808,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my favorite earbuds, the fit amazingly. The sound is great and the earbuds last long, this is my second pair."
809,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These were of poor quality an the sound was horrible as well. I would never recommend these to anyone, ever."
810,5.0 out of 5 stars,these are my favorite headphones if only the cord wasnt so long my last ones wouldnt have broken but still a comfortable fit and doesnt give me a head ache
811,4.0 out of 5 stars,It was a good choice
812,1.0 out of 5 stars,"How low has the bar been set for sub-$10 online electronic products? Pretty low. Received these with the left earbud not working and the right earbud's quality was just terrible. I would actually estimate that over 60% of the products I order on Amazon that are under $10 arrive defective or flat out non-operational. Under $10 however, and the manufacturers can bank that you're not going to return their product. And they win, because you won't. I'm writing this review in part to remind myself to stop being lazy and drive to the nearerst store to buy chargers and headphones!!!"
814,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good earbuds for the price
815,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I would recommend the product.
It could be better if it had a narrow bud.
It almost meets my expectations."
816,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound was okay but the wires are really thin and tangle easily.
817,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great. The soft fabric given to cover the ear buds is also great and easily remove. x x x
818,2.0 out of 5 stars,they suck only lasted a couple months
819,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and do not hurt your ears due to smaller size.
820,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is pretty decend -- worth buying for less than $10!
821,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Product showed up as promised, and they work well for listening to podcasts. I use a MP3 all day while working."
822,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice but seems not for rugged use
823,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones are good. Work really well thanks

836,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are ok for the money, but don't fit my ears and fall out easily."
837,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for my kids as stocking stuffers, they love the Sony ear buds"
838,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like these earbud headphones because they are small enough to not make my ears sore. The sound quality is very good too.

852,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only headphones that last me more than a year!! The other headphones get ""destroyed"" in less than 3 months due to my heavy use."
853,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!
854,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like these headphones alot and they are cheap. I've dropped them a few times and they never broke i would buy this product again.
855,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect product!
856,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They work just fine at first, but after only a month of use one side stopped working. Splurge on something better"
858,2.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality works just fine but the ear buds are a bit big. Slightly uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time.
859,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It`s so good! Especially, Sound is very nice. But, first I feel pain my ears. I love SONY as a Japanese."

861,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best, perfect"
862,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good sound. These do not fit my ears very well, so they come loose more than I like."
863,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great earbuds. Quick delivery
864,5.0 out of 5 stars,Earbuds fit really nice and the quality of sound is good. Already lasting longer then 4 sets of other brands.
865,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just Got My Ear buds !! Amazing Quality
866,5.0 out of 5 stars,"love them! i like running so the fact they stay in with all the movement, is fantastic.Definitely worth the money."
867,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this earbud
869,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Straight out of the box, only one side worked. I tried it in multiple devices to make sure it wasn't just my stupid phone, but they didn't work in anything.

otherwise, they fit nicely into the ear."
870,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for the money if you like the old style of ear fit. Plenty of bass and not tinny sounding.I am able to install new cloth covers when needed.The silicone buds make my ears itch after using for lengthy periods.
871,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm happy with the earphones.I have no issues. They last long. Sound is OK.
Only missing is a good microphone and adjusting the volume. I tried other model but not compatible with iPhone."
872,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Uh, why doesn't anyone know that these are the best headphones! I don't like the isolation headphones whatsoever and its all you see at the stores. These sound great, and are quite durable. My last pair lasted me about 4 years and survived around 2 weeks in the mud and approximately 6 wash and dry cycles with the laundry. Highly recommend, I refuse to wear any other headphones. I hope they never stop making these, but that doesn't matter I stocked up."
873,3.0 out of 5 stars,"if they had cushioned pads instead of molded plastic they would rest way better in the ear. The hard plastic makes they very uncomfortable, however the sound quality is darn near excellent. but long term use is painful."
874,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I buy these all the time because I keep losing them, not because they break. I absolutely love these. They fit my ears perfectly and never fall out, plus being a tall person I need the extra .2m of length versus other brands to help prevent the 'earbud tug' and so I can use my phone at a comfortable distance from my body when walking. Awesome earbuds!"
875,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality and convenience is up to par with cost - they are very basic headphones after all and, in these aspects, they work great for me.

The reason for low rating is the cord that gets extremely stiff in cold conditions. It's not an issue if you only plan to use them indoors or during the warm months, but in winter it barely bends"
876,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These aren't exactly like the old clamshell Sony earbuds that I bought for so many years, and I miss the clamshell. But they are inexpensive, sound decent, and don't hurt my ears. I have a small ear canal and all of the in ear headphones, even the ones with interchangeable tips, hurt my ears. These just sort of lay in the ear and I can wear them for hours and hours. Delivery was fast and accurate and the item was well packed. I'm sure I will buy from them again."
877,5.0 out of 5 stars,I keep buying these same Sony earphones because they fit the ear comfortably and has great sound. I don't like other earphones that stick in the ear so this is perfect because it stays on the ear. I even Run using these Sony Earphones and they stay put. The only reason I keep buying this is because I lose them. But I've had 2 of them that lasted for 5 years. Now that's amazing quality for low price earphones. Also I find that I have to lower the volume at night because its kind of loud.
878,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these earbuds for my friend because her other previous ones broke and she specifically asked for them for her birthday. They arrived in the described conditions and with quick shipping. She loves them and uses them all the time. The quality must be pretty good for her to love them so much because she uses them to listen to music and watch videos on her phone. Overall, I'm very satisfied and would recommend these."
880,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love them. they are good quality headphones at an awesome price and they are just really great. Sony is awesome.
881,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It has a good quality, but there is no pause/play buttom or for volume."
882,3.0 out of 5 stars,"sound isn't great and not super comfortable but they work well, which is sometimes an issue with cheap head phones."
883,1.0 out of 5 stars,This are a poor choice in headphone they are fresh out of the package do not fit in my ears are uncomfortable fall out of my ears when I am walking and make a horrible clicking noise.
884,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love em
885,4.0 out of 5 stars,My oldest has a problem with losing headphones. So I buy multiple of these as they are a good quality headphone that does not break the bank when he loses them.

915,4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
916,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My previous one was from Sony, which influenced my decision to purchase this one. However, the quality was v low. Specifically, I have to play/twist around in order for both ear to transmit sound. I opened the package so I couldn't return the it. I not sure if this produce was indeed made by Sony."
917,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful!
918,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones
919,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
920,5.0 out of 5 stars,Luv the headphones
921,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I totally thought these were going to be something else. I had gotten different colored Sony headphones from Target a few times, but either these ones are completely different or they've just redesigned the shape of these. The music quality is better than Apple headphones, but we all know that it doesn't mean much. These are pretty uncomfortable. I could go on, but I'm just telling you, don't buy these. The only good thing about them is the color and that's it. The best headphones I've ever had are Philips Flexible Earhook Headphones SHS3200/28. Buy them."
922,4.0 out of 5 stars,I got a different version of the headphones. The one that I received is alright but I like the other version better.
924,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Most of the time my headphones give out after a few months, but these are still going strong! Good buy!"
925,5.0 out of 5 stars,They're like any other earphone just me price of this one Was a lot better it also came in a color not availablein stores
926,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad quality
927,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very poor sound quality. I had some similar sony ear buds that I was trying to replace but the sound quality of these is far inferior. Can't even listen to them. The free ones you get on airplanes are similar in sound quality to give you a sense of what I'm talking about.
928,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the color. These ear phones fit into my ears perfectly & the sound quality is great, especially for the low price..."

939,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great head phones, use them all the time. They have great sound, and they are very durable. I love them"
940,4.0 out of 5 stars,"only 7 dollars, they come with pads you put on the earbuds themselves an if you dont put them on they dont fit well."
941,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality sound and for a relatively cheap price.

943,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, worth buying"
944,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone who can't fit the new fancy earbuds in her ears, I love these. I have small ear canals so the huge new design doesn't stay. I went to Target, Best Buy, and other stores to find these earbuds and couldn't anywhere. Shipping was quick and they work well."
946,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work perfectly. Great sound and quality!
947,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality and comfort is good enough, and the price would be worth it IF they didn't break within a month. I recommend avoiding these."
948,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After I use it, i know that why Sony always be the best brand of my family because its sounds great and durable"
949,5.0 out of 5 stars,The quality is superb and it also has a low price. Highly recommended if you're looking for a promising and deep music experience.
950,1.0 out of 5 stars,"after about 2 weeks i started hearing a strange sound (disconnection perhaps) coming from the headphones while walking. I have no clue what makes this pair of headphones so horrible. I wouldn't recommend these headphones to anyone. The sony MDRE10LP was a much better design. I had an old pair of MDRE10LP that has been through a lot of wear and the sound quality is still decent and close to when I first purchased it. Just spend the couple of extra dollars and buy the MDRE10LP instead of this one, it will have been worth the money and lack of frustration."
951,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price. All I need.
952,5.0 out of 5 stars,It has great sound and can really block out other noises. The price is almost unbeatable as well! Very pleased

961,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelente
962,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
963,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To keep things short, if you're looking for something cheap that'll last you a long time, these are the perfect earbuds.

I actually owned a pair before purchasing another, and the reason for that is because I broke the first pair. This isn't the fault of the product, but from my own error - I accidentally sat on an earbud and tugged too hard on the cord, ripping the cord itself.

The earbuds themselves don't have the best-quality sound, but for $10 earbuds, you can't really expect that. However, if you're looking for something cheap that will last a long time, look no further!"
964,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent!
965,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good earbuds
966,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!!!!
968,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous
969,1.0 out of 5 stars,I personally do not like these headphones at all.. the sound is terrible and there is no bass. I would recommend just investing a few more dollars for headphones with a much better quality. I would not purchase again.
970,4.0 out of 5 stars,What i expected
971,1.0 out of 5 stars,Keep on falling out of your ear. it is as if you need to scotch tape them in order to keep them in place. There are better earphones for the suggested price.
972,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is clear, crisp and the speaker works well. But I accidently stepped on one of the ear pieces (on carpet floor), and it broke pretty quickly. Also it doesn't really have the look of a Sony product, seemed a little cheap."
973,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible sound quality. I read the reviews and gave these a try. I got them today and they sound awful - like listening through a tin can.The ear pieces are too big to fit in my ears, and this has never been a problem before. I would deal with that if they sounded good, but like I said, worse than the free headphones they give you on the airplane."
974,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear buds are OK in terms of quality and sound, but my #1 gripe is that they do not stay in my ear unless I remain completely motionless. And, like most people, I use my ear buds almost exclusively while I am moving around, whether it be at the gym, around the house, etc. If ear buds won't stay in my ear they are virtually useless to me. Maybe if you are a small person you would not have this problem. But for me, a man of average build, these ear buds are almost completely useless."
975,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Someone recommended these to me so I bought to replace the Apple headphones that don't fit my ears. What a terrible purchase. There is absolutely NO BASS whatsoever rendering them useless to me. The funny thing is, the description specifically comments about their surprisingly strong bass."
976,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Should have listened to the reviews of this product. They are the worst sounding things I've ever seen. Little to no low frequencies, all high frequencies. They sound like garbage."
977,1.0 out of 5 stars,TERRIBLE sound quality. Too bad Sony discontinued the Fontopia earbuds (MDRE828LP)... they were SO much better! These will go out in the trash...
979,5.0 out of 5 stars,They sound great I wish that they had 2 sets of foam covers for them.
980,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Garbage. Worse than those cheap airline ear buds. Horrible, can't believe this stuff is made by Sony.

These ear buds make a crakling noise any time you touch the headphone plug and the sound cuts in and out if you move around too much which means they used really cheap wires."
981,1.0 out of 5 stars,"What a rip off. It's a hassle to return, but they don't work... Won't order from them again!!! Beware low price..."
982,1.0 out of 5 stars,Junk. Had it for a few weeks now and they have already went out. They worked well until today.
983,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are awesome. They have great sound quality and no one can hear the music you play no matter how loud you blast your music. The chord is also long enough for your convenience. Working out or editing is 10x easier using these buds.
984,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i always like sony headphone and this one is also great ,small, light and fit in ear perfectlly.

Good Sony"
985,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had a pink pair that I absolutely loved. Had them for a couple of years until I accidentally broke them. Ordered the black ones to replace them. Opened the package and plugged the headphones in only to have one side not working. Nonrefundable though?! Will not be purchasing again!
986,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't expect Apple quality headphones. They tangle very easy and you will need the foam ear bud covers. They are long and sound quality is good.
987,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I could find these with a mic. They are great and good sound quality!!
988,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work really well and easy enough to open.
990,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I buy a lot of earbuds for listening to podcasts and music at work. My regulars were not abaialble so I tried these. Terrible sound quality and probably the worst I've had for music. Very little bass, even with the iPod on Bass Booster. I will relegate them to voice only and even then, they are hard to listen to. Perhaps I just got a bad pair but I will not try another set."
991,5.0 out of 5 stars,What are all the bad reviews for? these have amazing clarity not to mention the loudness! fits in your ear really well and are very comfortable
992,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first plugged them into my iPod and listened, I was taken by quick surprise. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THESE EARBUDS?

The sound quality was terrible. The song didn't sound good at all; there was no bass coming from these earbuds. This resulted in a tinny, weak sound. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I can tell the difference between my old earbuds and these (and I compared them by switching them out back and forth; noticeable difference).

I wouldn't recommend these earbuds at all. Luckily, I had ordered two different pairs of earbuds from Amazon at the same time. I think you really get what you pay for. I don't like those earbuds that stick deep into your ear, so I tend to get this less intrusive form factor. If you want to stick with SONY, I'd recommend the earbuds with the case, model No. MDR-E828LP. The case isn't necessary, but the earbuds are much better. I've bought them multiple times, and they happen to be the second pair I bought along with these bad ones here. Using those right now and I'm satisfied. It costs a bit more, but it's worth the quality in my opinion. However, if you want to stick around this price range, or you want a white-based earbud, I'd go with the JVC Gummys. They have good sound quality for this form factor, and I've used them a couple times. I don't think they last very long though, as I bought these new SONY earbuds because my JVC burnt out on the left earbud. But they're cheap, and once again, you get what you pay for. Just in the case of these SONY MDRE9LPs, it's not even worth $8."
993,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my default go-to headphones. This is my second time purchasing them. My previous ones didn't break but I'd lost them (I'd had them for almost 4 years at that point). I'm not an expert in ear buds and don't know anything about the sound quality that other people have been talking about, but these are good for day to day use; I'm a grad student and they're great to listening to lectures, watching videos or listening to music while studying. Sometimes I even go to sleep listening music and after sleeping on them, they're still working great."
994,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, doesn't fall out of my ears, very durable, and good sound quality. My friends have also had their same ones for over 2 years!"
995,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a genetic hearing impairment & I am also a radio buff, (big time) In the past, have tried various other Brands but, continue to stay with Sony as these offer the best clarity. I MUCH prefer the flat sided design as they fit the ear better & STAY in! The other types that are rounded and/or have 'cushions' are the very worst! Continually fall out of ear. the only negative I have is, if you drop the Bud on hard surfaces they come apart easily. In spite of that, I just now ordered two pairs so as to always have on-hand!"
996,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 8 year old daughter uses these - they are her favorite headphones and don't hurt her ears.
997,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't waste your money. Buy a more expensive set of earphones. Very surprised that this version of Sony earphones are of poor quality. I've purchased Sony earphones for the past 20 years and this is the first time I've been disappointed. There is no bass, only treble in the output sound. In my opinion, without the bass all you have is noise. Had I not thrown away the packaging I would have returned."
998,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality buds.

Got these because those ""inside your ear"" buds are atrociously designed, when all I wanted was the classic design that has ALWAYS WORKED. (though people tell me the ""inside-ear"" models never fall out - they always do for me!)

Love the classic earbud design, and these are just top notch quality. They even get some decent sub in them, and that's alot more than I'd ever ask for."
999,2.0 out of 5 stars,Material is cheap. Wire gets tangled VERY easily. Earbud itself is quite large and the muff is really cheap so it'll hurt your ears very soon. I'm using it for the FIRST DAY and is already having issue with the sound. I decided to give this a try because they usually only last a couple of years. I figured what's the point of getting expensive ones. Now I understand.
1001,5.0 out of 5 stars,Provides music to the ears A+
1002,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a teenager that listens to music all the time and appreciates the quality that comes with the kind of music I listen to, and these Sony headphones deliver that great quality better than anything else I can find. I first bought a pair of these at Best Buy, but then decided to just order them on Amazon when my other pair after a whole year had worn down a little bit and I am still amazed by the fantastic quality these headphones bring to the table. With great bass and treble, these are unmatched. For this price, you won't be disappointed."
1003,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fits the way I like, stays put."
1004,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have two pairs of these headphones that I purchased at a big box store and I love them. I was ordering these as an extra pair for work. The quality of these is so poor that I think they might be knock off'. They feel and sound horrible. Don't waste your money
1005,5.0 out of 5 stars,great
1006,5.0 out of 5 stars,good product
1007,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these earbuds for my son to use on our 4 hour flight to San Diego and they work wonderfully! First of all, the shipping was way faster than expected! I was worried I wouldn't get them in time to take with us. Anyways, they fit his ears perfects (he's 5) and he didn't complain of any pain even after wearing them for a few hours while he was playing his leapster explorer and watching a movie on our touchpad. Would recommend for younger children but also for adults, as I don't have any problems using them when I'm listening to music while I complete school work!"
1008,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Still holding and still working great. Love these sony headphones compared to those other expensive headphones, this is the best esp with the price. nto a fun of those plug in your ears headphones, used this on the office everyday."
1009,1.0 out of 5 stars,"THEY SOUND HORRIBLE, NOTHING LIKE THE DESCRIPTION. NEVER AGAIN WILL I WASTE MY MONEY ON THIS. IM DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS ITEM."
1010,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very poor audio quality.
1012,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are good, but I've found that it the cover on the ear piece tends to almost always fall off after awhile."
1013,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you read audio books, and there is not a lot of background noise, these are perfect for long time listening."
1014,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality is bad, ear buds don't fit in ear that well. Plastic part of ear bud fell off. Would not recommend this product."
1015,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bommmmmmbb that's all I got to say they last me 3 years and OK that's all I got to say.
1016,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great. They are super comfortable. I've used this exact style and brand for years. The only thing that is a minus is that the plastic piece that reads ""sony"" does become loose with time and I have to keep clipping it back in."
1017,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is totally poor. I expect a lot because of Sony but I am totally disopoint from these Headphones.
1018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I never received the headphones and when I tried to check back the seller ""NO LONGER"" was there or something like that. About $6.00 wasted, if it were more I would've searched harder on how to properly complain about this."
1019,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted black earphones, and that's exactly what I got. The color to me is classy and makes them look expensive. For the price, it was a really good deal. Sony is also a very trusted, quality brand."
1020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price these are great, as overall quality of course there is better but if you're just looking for a quick set of headphone these are great."
1021,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke within a day or two of recieving. Thought inexpensive wouldnt necessarily mean cheap. This product is junk. Dont waste your money.

1053,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are cheap. I bought them because my cat likes to eat all my expensive headphones. She won't touch these so I know they must be total crap. The sound is awful and the fit in the ear is even worse.

Pro? The cat hasn't eaten them."
1054,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Good price.... I bought 4 on one purchase....however, they don't fit properly.. They keep falling off my ear.... very disappointed.."

1057,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I adore Sony headphones! I've bought a few different pairs in the past (usually the ones that were the most on sale). These were my most recent purchase! I love them! They fit great in my ears. I've used them for listening to music on my cell as well as on my MP3 players and computers!

I've splurged on Apple headphones and even Skull Candy ones. However, when they go bad (they always do) I find myself going back to Sony! I love these and they do the job just as well if not better than the other, more expensive brands!!

Plus the colors are so darn cute!! :D"
1058,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to love Sony's cheap earbuds, they gave a great sound and you didn't have to worry too much over them breaking or being lost. This new version just isn't the same however, the sound is very very tinny, nothing like they used to be."
1059,1.0 out of 5 stars,"1)These headphones only last for 2 months, and you know it's over when you put them on and only one ear bud works.
2)The sound quality is decent, but as other reviewers have noted there is no bass whatsoever.
3)This is the worst pair of headphones that I have ever had and they are not worth the money.
4)Buy at your own risk.
5) If you purchase these you'll be back in a couple months needing a new pair."
1060,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought I lost these ear buds one day. Then I remembered that I accidentally left them in the pocket of my sweat shorts, which were thrown into the washer. I quickly retrieved them, dried them off, then plugged them in. I assumed they would not work but they still do! I couldn't believe it!"
1061,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I currently own the Sony Mdr-E10Lp earbuds, and have re-purchased them several times (have been my favorite for years). Now that it has been over a year with my current pair it was time to get a new pair. I found that the Sony Mdr-E9Lp were the newer version of favorite earbuds, and i was expecting at least quality equal to that of the older version.

When i got the earbuds, i had nothing to complain about the packaging and product design is almost identical to the Sony Mdr-E10Lp, except the stem on the earbud itself is much shorter than its predecessor. Everything seemed fine, until i pressed play on the music with these. The sound was a disaster. There is no bass, volume of sound is dramatically decreased, sound is muffled. Even with different music and video players, there was no improvement. I was so disappointed. I don't know if i received a defective pair of earbuds or if this is what the product is. I would not recommend these, even for just music traveling needs.

Now to the hopes that I can continue to purchase the Sony Mdr-E10Lp earbuds, which offer a much better, impressive sound quality."
1062,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty sure these are counterfeit. I ordered MDRE9LP/BLK Earbuds. Instead of the normal Sony packaging they came in a weird little ziplock bag kind of thing with the text ""Original high quality best accessories"".On the back is the text ""Accessories There is no best only better products. Enjoy the best quality Made in China"". No mention of Sony on the packaging they came in anywhere. There is a label stuck on the back that says Sony black MADE IN CHINA. I opened them up and there are white earbuds inside, not black. They actually look more like MDRE9LP/GRAY. However, the printing on the side is so faint you can barely even see it and the parts don't seem to have a good fit. I actually had to put reading glasses on to read the logo. Sony is usually pretty good about making sure you can see their logo on their products and I don't think they usually ship them in a bag that says Best Accessories, Original High quality. I am actually not totally against cheap Chinese products when I know that is what I am buying, but I shouldn't have to worry about buying counterfeit merchandise from Amazon. That is what ebay is for."
1063,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used a variety of ear buds and I can honestly say these are just 'meh.' The main issue I have with these is the design of the wires going into the ear bud. If you look at the photo below you see the wire is on a rail system, however they added a gap just big enough to make the wires to the ear buds have the ability to move up and down. Because of this mobility the wire actually creates this popping sound if you move your head up and down or side to side. At first I thought it was something wrong with the audio or maybe I had my speakers too high. I tested it and on the lowest setting pops still remained if I barely moved my head. Sound overall is pleasant nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done. I must say if I had the choice of buying these again I would on the condition they fix that gap problem. Guess I will be looking for some new headphones for the new year."

---comfortable enough for any ear = curve / size
---very surprising bass response, and detailed mid's (a tin bit muffled - must be EQ 250-300 hz should be lowered down )
----Can be compared or even compete with x5 overpriced Sennheiser CX 300 II Precision, however only if dressed in a foam pads, included with this Sony earbuds, otherwise bass would be much weaker!!!
---stereo-phonics / pan spectrum pretty interesting,entertaining enough
---L shape 3 mm connector
cons:
---as always wires can be tangled easily, though compering to Sennheiser they are not transmit any noise from touching your cloth/body"
1065,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The good thing about these headphones are that they look great and are very very comfortable. The bad thing about these headphones is pretty much everything else. The sound quality of these is absolute garbage. There is no bass whatsoever and music sounds tinny. I've had to replace at least 5 of these before I realized I was stupid for buying them after I suffered the same issue with each pair. I originally bought these from my local Target which carries a lot of these in stock. The problem with these earbuds is that the cable connecting the earbuds and the 3.5mm jack is flimsy. All of my previous pairs of these earbuds died because the sound in one of the earbuds would just stop working effectively making this an earbud for only one of your ears. This is because over time, the cable would stretch and break a connection to one of the earbuds. I know what you're thinking, but I don't recklessly yank or pull my earbud cables either. I've been babying my last few pairs to try to make them last as long as possible, but each of them inevitably dies on me. In addition, the foam padding that is included in the packaging that would be used to cover the earbuds for comfort would always become loose and eventually fall out. To be honest, if you need a cheap set of earbuds, you could look literally anywhere else. BUT I would highly recommend that if you wanted to buy comfortable earbuds that look good and sound good too, invest in a pair of Apple earbuds. Just be careful of buying them online because there's a lot of fake ones around. I'm not an Apple fanboy but I can't deny that my Apple earbuds are pretty good sounding and comfortable too."
1067,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a good choice for a cheap set of earbuds. I use them for audio books for long spans. The quality/price is great for that application. I break/replace them every few months, but it is not a design flaw. The have broken when I stepped on them in work boots, dropped them in the sink while doing dishes, smashed them in the car door.... I am really tough on earbuds. I've owned 8-9 brands over the years, and these are the only ones that seem to break only under tough abuse. I've had other brands that break if you drop them, or the cord frays under normal usage, etc. A good buy if you looking for basic, tough earbuds."
1068,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second purchase. I bought Jose 4 years ago and they are great. Loud and clear just the way I like it. I just found out (5 min ago) that my cat chewed on my old ones and they stopped working. But they are great!!
1069,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a Sony MP3 player & the headsets that came with it broke. I thought Sony earbuds should sound the same as the broken ones I had right? WRONG! These are HORRIBLE!!!!!! No bass & no devision between right & left side! Garbage ONLY & should be avoided at all cost!!!! Spend a few dollars more & get a better quality set because you will totally waste your money, like I did, on these!!!!!"
1070,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave this item 1 star because I had to send it back. Now, I will make this clear that I could have easily received a defective item, however, I do not go back to a design from a particular brand if I don't get one working the way I want it to from the get-go.

These had excellent sound, however, even with the power off these earphones would make a plastic ""clink"" sound. If I gave the wires slack, no noise. Any tension on there and it would make a noise that crackled in my ear. I use these at the gym and hearing that noise was incredibly annoying.

As always, Amazon refunded 100% of the cost which is why I continue to buy from them."
1071,1.0 out of 5 stars,I've gotten earphones that sound better from the dollar store. They're not very loud & have no bass at all. The music sounds hollow. The only reason I kept them is because it makes no sense to return them since they're cheap. I've only used them once since I bought them. Do not recommend.
1072,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm giving these 2 stars just because of the price. I ordered the pink ones, that say Sony on them. What I received were black earbuds and I don't even know if they are Sony. They look completely different than even the black ones pictured when choosing which color you wanted. The plain white box they came in had a tiny sticker that said Pink and I think it also said Sony on it...but they sure weren't pink. And they weren't even wrapped in plastic or anything, just thrown in the box with some bubble wrap on top. I understand that they came from a company with Overstock in their name, but honestly they could have taken a little more care with these.
It's more of a hassle to worry about returning them so I'm going to keep them, although the sound quality isn't that great. But as they say, you get what you pay for. But I am very disappointed that they weren't pink."
1073,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, these earbuds aren't the most impressive looking I've ever seen but they have one thing going for them that all the nice headphones I've owned have not: they are incredibly durable for cheap earbuds. I tend to fall asleep every night watching something on my phone, which is a compromise I made with my partner who cannot stand having the TV on when falling asleep. This means that I have destroyed at least a dozen pairs of earbuds from just the jostling and stretching of the cord that happens over the course of a night. Without fail, I would always get a good two or three weeks of usage before they one earbud would cease working, and then another week before both earbuds were broken.

I don't even remember how I originally got these earbuds, but after a year of using them without the slightest loss in sound quality (n.b. the quality is perfectly fine for this price point, though not necessarily groundbreaking), I felt I needed to order a second set in case I ever lose them.

Now, since not everyone is odd enough to think it's fine to sleep with earbuds so you can watch Cheers until you fall asleep, this durability does pay off in other ways, specifically in surviving being in a pocket or getting twisted during a workout."
1074,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought three of these so far. One set did die and another (the oldest) is getting a little crackly... But they seem to hold up for a while (2 or more years). For the price, I'm certainly pleased.

These fit my ears well, but I'm a smaller guy. If you have bigger ears, these might not hold well."
1075,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My previous Panasonic earbuds lasted me 4 years and I decided to go with these Sony earphones since the reviews were good, but these did not hold up to their rating. These are super cheap and are not worth the money I paid. I can't even return them either. Do not waste your money on these headphones. They feel cheap and the plastic is not comfortable in your ears. I tried these out and the sound quality is not clear. You can hear this faint static, or hertz hum. These earbuds are not worth $8, do not buy these."
1076,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones; they are quality and have lasted a long time. They are still kicking almost a year later, and I use them every day for hours."
1078,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my earbuds on my lunch break at work, every day. They get a LOT of use, and
even went through the washer a time or two, and work like new. These are great!"
1079,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They fit in my ear not too tight and not too loose ! i recomend these, THERE LOUD!!!! Blocks out everything els and i hear my music PERFECT :D THEY SHIPPED TO MY HOUSE FAST! in 4 DAYS! Thank Youuu :3 Must Have!!!"
1080,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Disappointed!
I'm very disappointed with these ear buds, as I got them to replace my old worn out sony ear buds.
The wires are very thin and the sound is terrible compared to my old ones.
I would think the newer ones would have better sound given the technology advances but NO.
If these would have costed more I would have returned them. But they were only a few bucks so I threw them in my junk drawer.
DO NOT buy!"
1082,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second pair that I've broken in under 2 weeks. You can't just leave them in your pockets, or pull them haphazardly out of your purse because the speaker covers just pop off leaving the little copper interior and wiring hanging out. Plus the sound quality isn't very good. I know they're cheap- but for me they've been highly expensive. I just paid $10/week for bad sound quality."
1083,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are very similar to the Apple ones (I don't own any Apple products, but I love their earbuds). I love that they sit securely in my ears without having that little bit that extends into your ear canal. I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality sounds fine to me. I only wish that the cord was a bit shorter (it's standard length, but that always seems a bit too long to me)."
1084,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of SONY earbuds about 6 years ago and I've had the same pair ever since. I've used this pair nearly every day. I've anticipated them to break, but they haven't, so I decided to order this pair in anticipation for the sad day the crap out on me & I have to put them to rest. The new pair seems quite a bit cheaper from the cord to the plastic on buds. I've noticed with my iPhone the cord has static when the cord is moved around. Have not tried with other sources. Not as good as my other pair so took a few stars off for cheapness of quality."
1085,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have a couple pairs of these i use for my PC for gaming and videos and for my mp3 player when i want to be able to hear whats going on around me. They sound good but more importantly they are very very comfortable. Can easily wear them all day long and barely notice them at all. They are cheap and well worth it buy a couple pairs then if you ruin a pair or lose a pair you have a backup. They are more then cheap enough. I dont use the little foam covers that come with them not sure why anyone would bother with them. When these die i will get another pair just like them or maybe in a different color just for a change.
1086,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Work... That's about all the good I can say. Horrible sound quality. Even for the cheap price the sound quality is not something I can ever imagining Sony putting its name on. There are literally 50 different Ear Buds for the same price here on amazon. Try any one of those before buying these. I wish I had.
1087,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When one of the headphones does not work, it is difficult to give it more than 1 star. We have purchased these, or ones like them, in the past and have found them to be just fine. We prefer the ""buds"" that just sit in your ear over the ""in ear"" type that never like to stay ""in"" our ears. We will try again and change the review if both headphones work."
1088,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, I have always stuck with this brand. They're comfortable, tangle resistant, and affordable. They usually last me 2-5 years depending on I treat them; if they do break--it's probably because I yanked from far too often from the cracks of my bed frame. Otherwise it's usually human errors."
1089,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this model a few years back and loved them. I needed a new set now because I kept dropping my left ear bud into my coffee. Brilliant, I know. So as to decaffeinate my ears, I purchased these. I just did a comparison of my old, coffee-swimming version (which still work), and these new ones. The results: this set's sound quality is horrible. I don't know what the difference is between the set I bought previously and this purchase (model numbers are the same). What I do know is that I won't buy these from this seller again and I will continue to use the set that has one bud dunked in coffee and slightly dampened sound. I can't recommend."
1090,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I tend to listen to goof quality of music not FAC or WAV, but acceptable MP3 and this earbuds have been the best, I can listen from Film scores orchestra to some groove metal and the sound does not have any distorsion."
1091,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best earbuds i have ever used. I have had many different types, from many different brands, and I simply cant part with these. I often have problems with headphones sounding like im listening to a 1940s radio, and there has not been a single time these have sounded like that. They are durable (Ive put them through the wash on several occasions by accident, no damage done.), they are long lasting (i can use these for month after month after month without the breaking), and they are a very modest price. You cant get any better than these headphones, and i will buy them as long as theyre available."
1093,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheaply made earbuds, not what I would expect from a Sony product. I used to buy those black Sony earbuds back in the 90's, that came in the round wind-up case. Those were great. I kinda expected that from these. These are like something you'd buy from the 99 cent store. I don't expect Beats, but for 8 bucks, I expect better. I feel they will bust by lightly pulling on them. Cheaply made.
The sound is horrible on these things, sounds really muffled. Like ear buds you'd buy from the 99 cent store. They do not fit well in my ears, they keep popping out when I work out. I've never had this problem before, not even with earbuds from the 99 cent store. I've bought those Gumy brand earbuds from Walmart.com and they sound pretty good for the price, better than these do, and definitely better than earbuds from the 99 cent store."
1094,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They had an odd feedback or clicking-like sound when certain beats would pass through them for about the first month or so, but after using them for about five months now, that issue seems to have dissipated and they work great. They are not the best headphones, but then again, I did not expect them to be because they are cheap. I gave them a four out five simply for the weird feedback issue, but I still use them, and I recommend them to anyone who wants some cheap headphones that work yet may not be the best."
1095,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. Great quality. The original pair I had since I was in 8th grade. 8th traders are what? Like 14? It’s been nearly 8 years since I graduated high school. They didn’t give out, I just lent them to my irresponsible sister.
I am super picky about earphones as I find most to be uncomfortable so I’m going to buy a crap load of these to always have as backups in case these amazing little things ever stop being produced."
1096,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted headphones that were not the in ear kind because most in ear kind are noise isolating and I need to be able to hear outside as well while doing certain tasks. Also the pair of in ear headphones I have now are awesome for music but annoying at the same time because I can hear the cord moving against my chest and hear myself eating while wearing them.

So I bought these earbuds even after reading reviews stating that these headphones were tinny sounding because I wanted them specifically for listening to podcast which is just voice audio and I plan to buy separate headphones for music. They do work great for podcast but when I switched over to some bass heavy songs I have on my iPod Nano there practically is no bass. You can hear the kick of the drum but it's really light. I would have rated these 3 stars but I went to Walmart and bought a pair of JVC Gumy Earbud Headphones Model: HAF14W and those were the same price as these but they're way better overall. The JVC's are also the non in ear kind but the sound quality is significantly better than these both in terms of music and vocal only podcast. I wouldn't recommend purchasing these Sony MDRE9LP headphones but instead go with the JVC Gumy Earbud Headphones Model: HAF14W. If you're too lazy to drive to Walmart you can order them on Best Buy's website."
1097,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are exactly what you're ordering. Average quality at a below average price.

They're decent headphones, and at the price they're at, you don't have to worry about them to much if you lose them. They still function perfectly fine if one of the earpieces gets broken or cut off, the other side still works.

I use these when I don't want to worry about getting my expensive blue tooth headphones damaged, along with acting like a backup, so I've had several over the years and stash some at work and at home and my car. I have never had one stop working from wear and tear, only from accidental destruction."
1098,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the second pair of these I have owned. The first pair lasted through daily use and abuse for around three years, well beyond the Ipod buds that my Ipod came with. So when they needed to be replaced, I got another pair. Great endurance for the cost and the sound is terrific as well.

Edit: WELL...this pair went bust after a couple months this time around, as the cord got yanked out of the plug. The plug last time seemed to have a better design while this one seemed to have the cords be a bit loser rather than have it be molded to the cord."
1099,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Being hard of hearing, I need ear buds that present clear sound. These are excellent. I also prefer the trumpet shape. The bulb type just doesn't work for me. They keep falling out of my ears. Plus, the sound presented is generally low quality.

These ear buds are well priced. So much so that, when the day after I received my order of two pairs and our new pup immediately chewed one pair and chewed the second pair the following day, I didn't have to hesitate to quickly buy two more pairs.

So I'm now struggling to remember NOT to leave them lying casually around the house. But it's going to be tough. In addition to being hard of hearing, I'm also absent minded. Good thing these ear buds are reasonably priced. I might need to order some more."
1100,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been very happy with these ear buds. I mostly listen to talk radio and have found the sound quality to be very good. I like to listen to podcasts at night to help lull me to sleep. For this purpose, the ear buds have been very comfortable. I can lie on my side and not feel as if the bud is going to puncture my eardrum. They also remain in place and I usually find them intact in the morning, with no discomfort to my ears or ear lobe. There is no volume control attached to one of the wires, but that is not an issue for me. My only complaint is that it is hard to know which bud goes in which ear. They are labeled but the label is hard to read and if I am inserting the buds in the dark I do not know which bud is for which ear. I solved this problem by attaching a small piece of colored tape to the wire of the right ear bud. Hope they last a long time since I have found most ear buds stop working in about a year. If this happens, I would consider buying them again."
1101,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These were the kind of inexpensive earbuds I could buy at the grocery store before, but I haven't seen them in a while. They are my favorite type to wear because I don't like things that stick into my ear canal. These just rest at the bottom of the shell of your ear. I guess the drawback is that other people can tell you are listening to something even if they can't fully hear what it is (maybe that's not a bad thing). It's getting harder to find this type of earbud. They are very inexpensive, which is good since they seem to go missing often."
1102,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not sure how these have such good positive feedback. They are simply terrible. I bought these to replace a set of Sony headphones that are failing. I needed earbuds that weren't the in-ear style that isolates outside noise, so I could still hear what was going on around me at work. I didn't need highclass sound, just something to listen to some tunes and make the day pass a little faster. These were a severe let down. They worked and are cheap. Those are the only positives. The earbud is too small for my ears, so it fell out constantly. I don't have large ear canals and most earbuds fit me fine. This is the first time I have ever bought a pair of headphones that didn't fit. The worst and most crucial part that these headphones epiclly fail on is the sound quality. They have zero bass. Like negative bass even. I played a song and switched headphones to see if it was in my head and it was like night and day between my old sony's and these headphones. And my old Sony's were not some high quality noise isolation headphones. They were just like these only with a billion times better sound and fit. These things have tiny sound, so you'll have to crank the volume to hear them and crank up the bass to even slightly make up for their total lack of bass response. Save your money."
1104,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After after my two pairs of Fontopias lasted 2 years each and six months or so using a pair of Sony earbuds that came with my voice recorder, I decided that I am only buying Sony headsets. Durable and the sound is fine for how I use them -- many hours each day.
Unfortunately, the first pair I bought were these. I listen primarily to audiobooks and podcasts; I also depend on them when exercising.
The thin cord -- too long for armband or collar clip mp3 players -- of this pair makes noise whenever I touch it or it touches my shirt or skin. In other words, they are lousy for exercising!
The sound may be a bit tinny in comparison with my previous pair of Sony freebies."
1105,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been pleased with Sony headphones in the past, but these are pretty junky and there's a crackle in the left side. Guess you get what you pay for."
1106,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite fit of headphones since the Sony MDRE828 is no longer available. Earbuds are slightly smaller but no noticeable difference in feel. Doesn't block out all external noise. No annoying rubber ear plug!
1107,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had these earbuds for almost two weeks and it is freaking amazing. Sound quality is great and it feels comfortable in my ears. WARNING: Never buy headphones from this seller named ""Kikimall"", their headphones are horrible and will break within 3-4 days after receiving it. Otherwise Sony has perfect headphones and will last you a long time."
1108,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After my Sony E10LP headphones stopped working after nearly 2 and a half years, I had to find a new set. I went with these, thinking that surely they were more or less the same as what I had before. Nope.

The previous version had a design that would let you tell left from right ear buds at a touch, which these lack. The other ones had a bass level that I previously hadn't realized was possible in a pair of ear buds, while these have yet to learn that such a thing exists.

Ultimately, I should have stuck with the E10LP and accepted the fact that I couldn't find them in black, rather than bothering with these. They work, they're well built, but ultimately I'm disappointed every time I use them because they're not the previous ones I had.

If I'm completely honest, I'm hoping these die soon so I can justify buying a new pair."

1110,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Prompt delivery, they sound great, but they are so hard & stiff that they hurt my ears. I think these might be an older design because my other Sony earbuds are so soft and comfortable - but I lost them. I will go back to Walgreen's where I bought the comfy ones and re-purchase. These will get thrown into a drawer and stay there forever until I get sick of looking at them and just trash them."
1111,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my niece for travel and she absolutely loves them. They do not hurt her ear and it blocks out the noise.

1122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good. It's been working fine since the day I got it and it's my only hope that this would work longer than the other brands I've used before which lasted only a year where either buds conked out. I guess Sony maintains her commitment to quality and durability in whatever product they produce in their production lines. Highly recommended to friends and the community."

1126,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not the SONY EARBUDS that I thought they were.

They work for a computer.
Will keep them just for computer back up.
Again, no good for digital piano keyboards.

1127,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great, stylish and effective earbuds for a low price. The powerful sound they give off makes them perfect for wearing casually or at the gym. I personally enjoy wearing them on a daily basis. Whether it be listening to music or watching movies on Netflix from my cell phone, I love how clear the sound is. I am even thinking of buying them in other colors – you can never go wrong with a few extra pairs of headphones lying around."

1130,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I know I shouldn't expect much for this price, but being Sony I thought they would be better. The headphones sound tinny and distant, and readily jump out of my ears (of course, this is a personal issue, but annoying nonetheless). I do appreciate that they aren't the type of headphones that you have to stick into your ear canal, and I can fall asleep listening to music as they aren't very uncomfortable. I wish they had better sound though!"
1131,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad for the price but I've gotten headphones for cheaper with better sound quality. Music almost sounds like it is far away and if you turn the sound up the quality gets distorted. If you like music with a lot of bass these are not the headphones for you.
1132,1.0 out of 5 stars,I cannot believe that anyone would give these an even decent rating. I can only conclude that there is a quality control issue. The set I got is below acceptable. Very tinny. No bass. Better sound quality from a soup can with a string.
1133,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have spent more money on ear buds which did not last as long as the Sony ones have. I have a teenage daughter that was going through a pair a month until we found the Sony ear buds. They lasted for 6 months and the ones she has now are 3 months and going strong. I will keep on buying the Sony ear buds because they last and I love the colors. We have bought 3 pairs in the last year and only replaced 1 pair. They fit well in the ear and you cannot beat the price for a quality product.
1134,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones. They provide clear and layered sound. They feel comfortable and fit nicely in my ears. The feature of the sound being focused toward the front of the ear pieces is really smart. They are loud without being glaring. No one near me can hear anything at full sound. They also block out sounds around me very well.
1135,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earbuds - I had this exact same pair in gray and they lasted FOREVER. I got these as a replacement when those finally gave out. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because the cord on these seems a little thinner then my old ones, and they should be identical. They still work great but I don't like how floppy the cord is. I still recommend them though!"
1137,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good high sounds but virtually no Mids or Bass for earbuds. Very hollow sound. Don't fit ears well and want to pop out. Do not recommend. Found better $2-3 earbuds in the past.
1138,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are my favorite kind of ear buds because they are smaller than a lot of the common ones and they are more comfortable.
1139,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty much exactly what you can expect is what you get. Good quality but not amazing sound. They fit well in my ears and they lasted for a while but eventually the circular part will come detached from the rest of the headphone which can cause some problems with the wiring and lead to loss of sound in one ear. Overall they are worth the price and if you want headphones without the squishy parts (which don't seem to fit in my ears) just for casual use or at the gym, then these are a solid choice."
1140,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exactly as ordered, good sound, comfortable fit. My son does not like the ones that poke more into your ear, these are just what he wanted."
1141,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had these earbuds before and they work great, except the only reason why I am giving this 1 star is because I received it with the actual sony package opened, and it look like it was used! I don't know if my is really ""new."""
1142,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed something cheap for work. Got what I paid for! Bass is terrible, and can't really hear out the buds. This should be an add on item."
1143,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These appear to be cheaply made and the sound is a bit tinny, but I just use them for listening to podcasts while I exercise. So for that purpose I suppose they are OK.

I mistakenly thought I lost them, for a week. I was about to buy another set of earbud headphones, and to tell the truth, I was going to look at other brands.

On the positive side, the price was pretty good when I bought them. I do like the purple color."
1144,1.0 out of 5 stars,These earbuds are horrible. I have the previous earbuds the Sony mdr e818lp fontopia and these are nothing like them. I have freebies I got with my Samsung phone few years ago that are better.
1145,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. A little bit disappointing. I would return them but return shipping is about the price of the item. I wouldn't buy again or recommend.
1146,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You can't get better earbuds for the money. This was a replacement set for my last pair of Sony's. They are very comfortable. I just got a new iPhone that came with earbuds - and those are horribly uncomfortable compared to these. These stay in place while I'm working out, and they don't hurt my ears. They don't slip out when I perspire."
1148,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The bass isn't all that great but they fit comfortably in my ears and don't fall out. I found that the grey part that goes over the wires constantly pops off but it snaps right back on. Over all you get what you pay for, but I think they are worth it."
1149,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these years ago at Wal-Mart, but couldn't find them after they broke earlier this year so I had to buy them online. Literally the best headphones I've ever used. I barely have to turn up the volume with these (unlike every other ones I've tried) because the audio is so good, and they lasted me YEARS (around 4) before I had to buy new ones."
1150,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We had bought a set a couple years ago, at a retail store, they are still going strong being used everyday. We decided to buy a couple more as back ups. Sound quality is excellent for ear buds. Worth the price. Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds"
1151,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cost me $8 but these are worth every penny in my opinion sound great maybe better than most ear buds that are over priced and fast shipping thanks
1152,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got 'em for my husband's laptop & he's very happy with them. Said he didn't realize how bad his older ones were. Now he can listen to everything, especially music w/o putting his volume to the max.....actually, he had to lower it quite a bit bc they work so well."
1153,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid about $2 for these headphones a year and a half ago and they finally shorted out yesterday. I wasn't exactly kind to them either; they were frequently yanked, twisted into knots by my pockets, banged against things, and on one occasion submerged in water. The first week I used them, they were a little uncomfortable to have in my ears, however I think my ears got used to them or something because it wasn't a problem long. I don't know why, ask science. A year after I started using them, there was a decline in audio quality. The sound quality is mediocre, but if you're buying something this cheap it's to be expected. I highly recommend this product."
1154,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Still,love these ear buds, fit inside the ear canal well. Well made, durable."
1155,3.0 out of 5 stars,"With my ears I can't comment on the audio quality other than it sounds ok except for the fact there's very little base. I'm not too happy about these ear phones physically. The wires are small flimsy and tangle easily. My overall impression is cheap. But then at the price, of course it is."
1156,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only earbuds I'll buy! I have really small ears so it is hard to find ear buds that will stay in my ear without falling out and these are perfect. The sound is pretty standard. Nothing mind blowing but they do a good job. I did like the previous model with a longer colored stem but I've gotten used to the smaller one. Highly recommended!
1157,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My headphones had a defective left earphone.
I realize these are inexpensive earphones at $10, problem is that they sound and feel like $1earphones.
Sub par materials, feel and performance.
Not sure if the following properties are standard or a further result of being defective.
Sounds very tinny,
no bass at all.
Very limited frequency range.
If you can, spend a few dollars more on better bud earphones. Frankly I'm surprised that sony makes these sub standard earphone at any price.
Oct 1, 2017
Someone made a comment today about my evaluation of these earphones. I definitely got a defective pair as the other customer suggested. Could have been a bad batch, it happens. That being said, it suggests poor quality control. Also Sony never bothered to follow up on the defective pair I received.
Just to clarify, the ear buds I received were defective out of the box. The poor sound quality and faulty left ear bud wasn’t due to me not taking proper care of them."
1159,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 6th grade needed
These for school. So
Far they are still working good. He likes the color."
1160,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They are not as loud as I would like them to be. I wish they had more bass in them. Also, at times they tend slip out of your ear when you don't want them too. The Sony MDRE828LP/SLV were one of my favorite earbuds until it was discontinued. I'm not really a fan of the earbuds that are supposed to wedge in your ear (i.e. noise cancellation), so hopefully Sony will have earbuds similar to MDRE828LP model earbuds."
1161,3.0 out of 5 stars,"There were a lot of great reviews, so I was expecting more from these bad boys. They fit comfortably, and they're obviously more stylish than your typical buds, but the sound was kind of tinny and hollow. They were pretty cheap, but if you keep searching, you could probably find a similar sound for a dollar or two less. Up to you if you think it's worth it!

I use them pretty regularly when I don't want to use my nicer (read: bigger, clunkier) headphones though, so it's not like they're bad."
1162,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price ($8) I really can't complain. There isn't much bass but the earbuds are comfortable and the sound is adequate, though muffled, for what I use them for. If you are really into music then maybe this isn't the best buy but for everyday uses like exercising and cleaning they are great. Didn't fit right until I put the foam things they came with on but now they fit great and don't fall out."
1163,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Weak, empty sound from poorly designed earbuds.

Sony knows how to make a great earbud with a healthy sound and deep bass response, yet these have neither. While I might normally give a product at this price point a break, I can't really do that here because I've been buying similarly priced Sony earbuds on here for years that sound incredible and since that model has been discontinued, I figured I'd take a chance with these.

That was a mistake. Pay a little more, get something better than these."
1164,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are excellent earbuds! My husband had tried some other ones, in the same price range, but really liked the sound quality of these the best."
1165,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They're pretty much what you'd expect for $8 ear buds. The sound is super tinny, barely any base. Their base models used to sound better. Honestly, spend a little more and get something else."
1166,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is good (listen to audiobooks only) but can not comment on longevity. The wires are considerably thinner than the previous mdl of Sony earbuds I purchased.
1167,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the first Sony headphones I purchase and I must say I am pleased with the product. I like the size and sound quality. They are literally just as described, which I appreciate. I also received them sooner than I expected, so that is was definitely a plus. I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a quick headphone purchase."
1168,5.0 out of 5 stars,My go-to ear buds. I got my second set after the first one stopped working(after nearly 3 years of use and numerous accidental dunkings in water and accidental slamming into the walls and floor). The sound quality is pretty good too.
1170,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are some very comfortable earphones, and they play loud and clear!"
1171,3.0 out of 5 stars,They don’t last to long. This is a temporary fix until you can get some better buds.
1172,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the size. Sound quality isn't the greatest (very low base even for buds) but they get the job done.
1173,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used it for couple of years and it stills works great. However, the plastics feel a little cheap. I had bought a similar one previously from target and it worked for 3 years. The plastic felt a lot better than this one did. Less slippery and also heavier?"
1174,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these and a pair of Sony MDR-PQ5 ear phones to replace my failed MDR-ED12LP phones. The ED12's fit me perfectly and sounded great and I was hoping these would be as good. The PQ5's are close, I'm not sure they sound quite as good but that may be because they don't insert into my ear as fully as the ED12's did. They're definitely not as comfortable.

On the other hand, the E9LP model sounded terrible and didn't fit my ears at all. The PQ5's stay in my ears pretty good, but the E9LP's won't stay in without using the foam covers and I ended up ripping one of the covers stretching it over the earphones. Soundwise, the E9LP's sound comparable to the Samsung phones that came with my Galaxy S4. In other words, terrible."
1175,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The plastic covering over the speaker came off on mine after a short time. They're cheap, so you might get your money's worth, but I would just save up and get a nice pair that will last."
1176,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For the money - these kick a$$! I've spent less than 5$ a few times and they're not for music. These, for less than 10$, make music a lot more enjoyable. They actually fit well too. I imagine that helps the sound as well as the overall experience."
1177,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They work well but after a while they stop working. I purchased this product over a month or so ago and I only used them a few times since I am not a fan of headphones and the right earbud stop working properly. At first I thought it had be me who broke the ear bud which didn't make sense to me since I take care of them well and hardly use them but my sister also had the same issue, therefore, I am giving this product two stars since the product does not last very long but it works great while it does."
1178,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Fits really comfortably in the ear and the sound is amazing. For the price, I don't think I could have gotten anything better.

EDIT: Broke after six weeks. :("
1179,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are a great color and quality seems fine. However, the ear pieces are really big and don't fit my ears. They are huge, really. It hurts to wear them. Don't buy them unless you have very large ears."
1181,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these as a replacement of my cheap set I use for walking to work. I lost my old pair, and I was searching for a nice budget pair of headphones to listen to podcasts. Audio is crisp."
1182,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are my favorite earbuds! I have bought these numerous times! Love them!! :)
1183,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A good set of earbuds for the price - great alternative for those who do not like the in-canal style earbuds. They seem fairly well made. The cord feels very securely attached the the speaker. They are comfortable to use as well, even without foamies. The sound quality is very poor on these however. They are good for things like podcast and audiobooks but I would not recommend these for music. To that end, these were a good buy."
1184,1.0 out of 5 stars,These came in pretty fast but the reason why I wouldn't recommend these is the awful sound quality. I regret my purchase.
1185,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound of an ear bud is very unique to each individual's ears. To me, these are way to tinny and not enough bass. Sony makes excellent buds, but I will not get this model again. Also the wire to the plug is already shorting out for me after 2 weeks."
1186,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want mid-range, and that's all you want, these are for you. There are far better earbuds on the market at a similar price. They aren't awful, but other manufacturers are producing better products at the same price point. Keep looking."
1187,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I mean most headphones are the same, you can only really tell if your like an audiophile...right?

apparently not

Terrible sound quality

It's so weak and not full sounding at all"
1188,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sorry to say that the previous negative reviews are pretty much spot on. I've previously used several sets of the now discontinued MDR-E10LP and loved them. The discontinued model had excellent sound quality for the price, they were comfortable in the ear and had a flexible cable, it was also easy to tell right from left even in the dark.

The new model MDRE9LP is a disappointment for all the same reasons. Sound quality is significantly worse than the discontinued model, they don't fit my ear very well (slightly larger earpiece?), the cable is a bit more stiff and holds a kink from packaging and they are symmetric making it hard to tell right from left.

Might have gone with two stars if I was feeling generous, but that would mislead readers. These do have the short right angle connector that I like, but that's it. I'll be looking for another simple earbud... these don't do it for me. Definitely NOT recommended."
1189,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My goal was to get the cheapest decent earbuds that did not go ""in"" your ear (something makes me uncomfortable about jamming up my ear canal with foam or whatnot). These fit the bill and the sound quality is fine. My only complaint is they are shaped identical enough that you can't differentiate right from left without reading them. An alternative is to look for what side the ""big"" hole is on (if it's on the right, it goes in your right ear), but the hole is still not ""big"" enough to easily feel with your fingers. Still, I guess the sound would be in stereo anyway so the worst case scenario's not so bad."
1190,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great service, fast shipping, will order again, thank you"
1192,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great service and on time! I paid for my product with amazon gift cards one can earn many just for doing surveys! Yes seriously check it out here, don't just sign up and do nothing really do the surveys you can make lots this way and if you start now then by time its christmas everything is free to you! http://www.instagc.com/422189"
1193,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good! .. My ear canals are too small to use noise cancelling ones so I've gone back to the old standard. :D

Overall I loved the product and I would totally buy it again"
1195,2.0 out of 5 stars,I previously bought these from target and they worked really well so I decided to buy them again on amazon. They worked well at the start. Then suddenly they started actually SHOCKING my ears from time to time!!! Soon after one side of the earbuds broke and stopped working. I ended up throwing them out. Pretty disappointed.
1196,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The string is too long, and very easy to be broken. I have only used it for two weeks, and the string is already broken. Very disappointed. The sound quality is ok, better than the fake Apple earbuds that you see it often in Amazon."
1197,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for the first time a few years back, they fit my ears better than any other buds I'd tried. I can't stand in-ear ones as they just feel funky and the audio sounds muffled while other shaped buds ones hurt part of my ear after an hour. I've ordered these several times now since my cat is a wire chewer and I'm occasionally careless with them."
1198,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am now on my second pair of these earphones because the first purchase stopped producing sound in both ears.
The purpose of me writing this review is because the one I have now, my second time earbud purchase, is doing the exact same thing!
The volume decreased dramatically and I can no longer hear sound through the right earbud.
I am very dissapointed because I thought that sony would be a good brand. Turns out I was wrong."
1199,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You just can't go wrong with Sony for most electronics. We've bought the knock-off headphones before, but always come back to the Sony's for quality reasons. Not Hi-Fi by any stretch, but they sound good and hold up well. Disappointed no one on Amazon is selling the packs with multiple units like in the past."
1200,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute garbage. These have to be fake because they could never be real Sony product. I went and bought $1 ear buds at Wal-Mart that sound better than these.
1201,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After one year and still fully functional, even when i accidentally place it in washer🙈not to mention my sister has gone through seven with other brands. I appreciate the fact that It fits unlike these earphones being maded nowadays."
1203,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones have great audio and last long.
1204,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable. The ear caps tend to get a bit dusty and dirty though. However, the sound quality is decent and it is a good product for the price it offers. I have been using it for a couple of months now and they are still working fine as opposed to some of my other earphones which stopped working in one ear."
1205,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not kid yourself! These are $10 earbuds....and they sound like it. Not even close to Apple's basic earbuds. Got as a temporary until the Senns arrive. Overall the sound is Foggy, like having water in your ears. 👎🏼 ☹"

easy on my ears."
1207,3.0 out of 5 stars,These work well but they are really hard to get into your ears. The sound is good and all but they are uncomfortable. The soft ear buds are much better. Plus I can hear everything my kid is listening to.
1208,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Get the JVC HAF160B Gumy Ear Bud Headphone instead. While these are comfortable, I found the audio quality to be sub-par. The other JVC ones give much superior audio quality and volume."
1209,3.0 out of 5 stars,doesn't fit in my ear as well as I thought it would
1210,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed cheap durable headphones I could afford to break or have disappear. These seem to fit the bill. They sound ok, not excellent by any measure. But for sub $10 earbuds, I don't think you're going to get much better."
1211,5.0 out of 5 stars,these work great - just wish the cord was a little longer. I'm making do.
1212,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was purchasing another brand of ear buds (that I wasn't really happy with) until they were no longer available. I'm glad I switched to these Sony ear buds. They are of exceptional quality and last a long time. Additionally, they arrived a lot quicker than I was anticipating."
1214,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear buds are fantastic. The sound quality is great. The audio is clean and crisp. The in ear buds fits snuggly and are soft to the touch. I live in a city that is very noisy. I have to take the train a lot and i promise you that when i put these in, all other sounds other than my music just disappears. I love that. Another thing as someone who goes through a lot of ear buds I can tell you that with the quality of these i will have them for a long time. Don't be afraid to get these you won't regret it. They were a good buy!"
1215,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good, inexpensive ear buds. I really hate other styles of ear buds, and this is the only style that I find comfortable. They stay in my ears well and they provide decent enough sound for listening to music or audiobooks on my phone. There are other ear buds that provide much better sound, probably without paying much more money, but since all I really needed was a pair to keep in my purse so I could listen to things at work or on the go, they work perfectly for me."
1216,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Short version: I'm sending these back because they sound ""TINNY""!!! I don’t know if that’s how they all are, or if I got one that slipped by Quality Control. Either way, they pale compared to the 818/828’s “Twin Turbo” design.
Detailed version:
I bought these because my MDR-E818 wore out at the jack from daily use/abuse, and the MDR-E818 & 828's prices went from $8 at the W* store to $20-40 after they were discontinued!!! I'll break my review down into separate categories to make it easier:
- Fit: They are very lightweight, and with/without the foam cover fit my ears OK. They are not biased, so you have to look at the shaft to see which one goes into which ear which may be a challenge while in motion (on a bike, running, etc.).
- Durability I tried these out for a couple weeks, but that's not really enough time. I am returning them for the reason below...
- Sound: This is why you buy headphones. I know you'll never get the ""full, rich sound"" from ear buds due to their size and the laws of physics. That being said, they are very ""tinny"" compared to my SanDisk OEM ear buds I use while working out, and EXTREMELY tinny when compared to the MDRE818's I use daily at work which are the ones they are supposed to replace.
Bottom line: If you want cheap, decent ear buds without the rubber “way into the ear” style, and you’re not worried about super-rich sound, these are OK. If you want the best sound I’ve ever heard out of foamy style ear buds, you’ll have to pay a lot for the MDRE818/828. Why Sony had to discontinue their best ear buds is beyond me.
These are going back to Amazon today. Amazon’s purchase was easy, fast, they were packaged nicely, and their return policy is one of the best in the business. I purchased a pair of the Panasonic RPHJE120S, and they are about equal to my SanDisk OEM, which is better than these, but again they also pale next to the 818/828’s."
1217,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really good sound quality for such a low price. I have had a pair of these in the color green for many years until my cat broke them. I bought one of the newer style earbuds for around $10 that is like the rubber ball thing and it was just really uncomfortable, the sound quality wasn't anything like my old ones, and they kept falling out. So I immediately looked for the same model of my old ones and picked them up here on amazon, this time in gray. I love these earbuds so much and will never switch to any other model, they are low profile, have very clear and loud sound quality, and fit really snug in your ears but not in a way that causes discomfort. I recommend these earbuds to anyone who prefers the older style plastic earbuds rather than those new soft rubber ball ones. Best value of any earbuds, so so good."
1218,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have a older par don't know the model but are 30 years old still kicking these have better sound good bass thump thump and good terrible for ear cranking highs work very good on my gpx personal CD player and fm radio picks up even little better than my old Sony's have thought of the inear kind not meny have 3.5mm plug personal CD players and smartphones have check out good reviews see how tuff some have washed um by leaving in clothing not me mine stay with my personal CD player bought two par but probably won't live long enough to use the other par these Sony earphones last and last go with these and if looking for a personal CD go with the gpx with fm radio Amazon has it rocks if by from my stop shop seller or Amazon sold and fulfilled both give tracking
1219,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are my favorite headphones by far because they are really durable and long lasting!! All other headphones I've ever had only last me three months maximum and then one of the buds stops working or I have to hold them a certain way in order for them to work. I've had these for almost a year now and they are still going strong with no problem! The color of the headphones is also really nice and they fit comfortably in my ear. I am an avid music listener so these headphones are in near constant use and I have not seen a decrease in quality whatsoever. I really love the quality of these headphones and I absolutely recommend these to anyone that tends to be rough with their headphones as I accidently tend to be!
1220,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the only earbuds that fit my ears without falling out. Unfortunately, I bought two of these (one for the office and one for the gym bag) and only one was fully functional. The second pair's left earbud did not work at all. However, I have not had this problem with this product before (and have owned several pair in the past- and lost them of course), therefore I will probably continue to buy these until I notice a repetitive problem."
1221,5.0 out of 5 stars,Had a pair from years ago that I still use to this day. It's really beat up looking though so I thought it was probably time to order a new pair. Glad I found it still available on Amazon. Got it in the same exact color and it works great. The earphones that went with my phone gave out after only two weeks of moderate use but I know these will last me years.
1222,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these to replace another pair that lasted about 18 months. I like to listen to podcasts while I sleep so they get yanked and crushed a lot, but these are way more comfortable than earbuds. One odd thing is that the volume is different in the R and L earphones. (There's a little raised dot on the top of the left earbud so you can tell them apart without looking, but it took me a long time to find it.)"
1223,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My third experience of having Sony MDR-E9LP stereo earbuds headphones is still great. My first and second headphones got misplaced in Malaysia when I went back there during last two years and last year summer. As a person who is having an active lifestyle, this earbuds headphones is crafted to perfection for hectic daily activities.
The description of this earbuds stated that its’ provide “quality audio in an ultra-lightweight, compact design with 13.5mm neodymium drivers, an open-air design and 3.5mm chord length”. This statement could not be any truer due to my own experiences wearing these earbuds while walking, running, chilling or even cooking. The good cord length make it easy for you to comfortably place your gadgets anywhere while listening to the audio, the high standard of quality audio lets you listen to the audio without any hassle and the ultra-lightweight make it easy for you to bring it anywhere. Not to mention, the price is so cheap ($10/pair) that even if you want to replace it when it is missing, you will never think twice. As for now, I have had this earbud headphone lasting for one year and it is still working great. This shows that the durability or this earbuds is really good.
This earbud headphones comes with eight colors which are black, white, purple, grey, blue, red, green and pink. The variety of color itself will let you have choices on picking up the color that suit you best. On the earbuds, you will see the letter L and R crafted, which act as an indication for you to plug in the earbuds correctly to the side of your ears. This is because, it is designed specifically to one side of the ear. If you wear it correctly on its side, you will find that the earbud headphone will stay in place and never fall out of your ears as long as you wear it.
As you can see by yourself, this earbuds headphone is a made up using classic design. The new design is either in-ear design or headset design are preferable by some people. If you are the kind of person that did not like classic design, this earbuds is not suitable for you. However, if you are the kind of person that did not care about the design of the headphone, but others such as the audio quality, length of the chord, durability or even the price, this earbud headphone might be for you.

Hopefully, this information can help anyone that is looking for a headphone to make decision wisely before purchasing any headphones."
1225,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Like some of the other reviewers I was disappointed by the sound quality. I bought these to replace a pair that I've been using for several years which I thought was the same model, but the new ones don't have the same depth and range of sound as the old (they sound tinny). These are inexpensive and I'll be keeping them as a backup pair, but if you care about sound quality you might want to spend a few dollars more for a better product."
1226,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound on the headphones it fair. One headphone appears to not be as loud as the other one. The soft cover for the earpiece is something the buyer has to place on the earpiece and it does not hold its elasticity, therefore it falls off."
1227,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these ear buds since the beginning of 2013 and they are good considering their price. The reason I like these ear buds is because they are from Sony. Anytime you buy from Sony you are guaranteed a reliable product. Another nice feature of these ear buds is that they come with different colors which are a cool thing (I bought the orange ones btw). I guess the main disadvantage of these ear buds is that the bass coming from them is pretty standard and not very impressive. I know the description says “enjoy powerful bass on the go” but believe me I’ve had other ear buds and in comparison the bass is not that powerful. If you want one to go with your mp3 player I would recommend “Panasonic RP-HV152 Portable Earbud Headphones with Powerful Sound” they are a bit more expensive but worth the price. If you are price sensitive and don’t really care about the bass, get these ear buds."
1228,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones! These our my absolute favorite, I was so sad when they discontinued them! They stay in my ears like no other headphone and their extremely durable as I'm a headphone breaker and this last me forever!"
1229,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a good pair of earphones to go with my Samsung Galaxy S4 and figured Sony would easily fit the bill. Wow I was way wrong. These were definitely not it. In general the audio was muffled, which is very surprising from Sony earphones. Maybe muffled audio is just a hip new thing that I haven't been able to get into yet."
1230,5.0 out of 5 stars,I just got a new pair of these because my last pair lasted me a hole 2 years and I wear ear bus a ton I never changed the king or brand since.
1231,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After the earbuds that came with my iPad broke, I bought this pair, as well as a pair of the Panasonic RPHJE120V In-Ear Headphone. Unexpectedly, the very inexpensive Panasonic was much better. Here's why:

- I found these Sony earbuds uncomfortable, with an awkward fit. They were coming out of my ears easily. It's like they weren't quite made right for my ears (and maybe any ears). The Panasonic were really comfortable and fit securly.

- The sound on the Panasonic was much more clear and crisp. For the Sony earbuds, when I was watching a movie I found I was missing a lot of the words, and the sounds just weren't as full, crisp and rich as with the Panasonic.

So honestly I wouldn't recommend these earbuds, but I'd suggest the Panasonic as a good quality pair at a very, very low price."
1232,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always liked these headphones . I had a pair for 3 years worked perfectly til they just stopped working but it's okay. I decided to buy these because my apple ones stopped working. When they arrived I saw that one of the earpod had glue or something on the side coming from inside. I didn't pay much attention until it started making a static noise. I took it apart , and tried taking off the glue but it didn't work, therefore, I put it back and it was now a lower noise than the other one when I played music. today, these decided to not work anymore. Worst earphones I have ever had . Never buying these again. I guess I'll buy Apple EarPods once again."
1233,4.0 out of 5 stars,With covers they're very comfortable. Good sound.
1234,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sent as a gift. They were requested. My mother LOVES them
1236,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable in my ears, good sound- bought these years ago at a big box store and over time it started to tear after years of heavy use. I was so happy to find them here on Amazon. Still my favorite ear buds."
1237,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to replace some Panasonic RPHVs that broke because the cord got tangled and I yanked it. These are lighter, less bulky, and more comfortable.

However, the sound is far inferior and there's little bass and isn't much definition between the sounds. They're better than some super cheapo throwaways, but it's bad enough that I'll probably buy another pair of Panasonics and use these as backups."
1238,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first thing I love about these is the pointed tip that tells you which is the right (or is it left) side. Very nice if you don't want to turn on the light to figure out which ear bud goes in which ear. I'm also in love with the range of colors and am very happy with the purple. The sound quality is good, at least compared to the standard apple ear buds but a lot more comfortable."
1239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"On time, as described, good value!"
1240,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought going with Sony would be safe, but just got these today and am disappointed. Sound quality is poor, and the wire/cabling is super thin - probably reason for poor sound. Non-returnable item too! Will end up in drawer and used as last resort backup... If you are reading this review, save the $8 and put towards better pair!"
1241,5.0 out of 5 stars,Order for my children and they love them because they don't hurt their ears. So far they have been very durable.
1242,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these headphones. I break headphones a lot and these are the best cheap and durable option with good sound.
1243,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good for what we need. I can't wear the type of earbuds that sit inside the ear canal. I have small ears and those hurt. Product is exactly as described and I received them quickly. I ordered many pairs. We have earbuds scattered all over the place, gym bags, work, school bags and home use and it doesn't matter how much you pay for earbuds, they wear out, some faster than others. These earbuds are great for exactly what I need and the price is right for the number of pairs that I bought to be able to have them in all different places."
1244,4.0 out of 5 stars,My teenager doesn't like the current trend of in-ear headphones. He had me hunt down a decent pair of these that sit outside of the ear canal. They are not high end but they work well. We have always trusted the Sony brand. No complaints.
1245,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite headphones. The only ones I will buy. Ever! These and the older version. The sound is PERFECTION! LOUD. CRISP. LOVE. If you don't use these, you should start NOW and never stop."
1247,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these earbuds for more than 10 years now and they've never disappointed. The only time they have is when I accidentally put a 7+ year old pair in the wash by accident.

They've never hurt my ears like the Apple earbuds or the other ones that go inside your ear (like Skullcandy - those hurt a lot), so I can listen to music for hours without noticing anything, which is good. If you're paying attention to your headphones the whole time, something is probably off."
1248,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is decent, not amazing, but good for the price. Cords seem a little thin and weak. Not sure how long they will hold up."
1249,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I consistently bought these headphones when they were available at Walmart, Target, etc. I can't find them in store anymore, but I am so glad they can be found online. Inexpensive but not cheaply made. They will work for any casual headphones someone needs."
1250,1.0 out of 5 stars,static filled and cheaply made. Get what you pay for on this one. Marketed as 'fashion' ear phones for a reason....
1251,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great extra set of headphones
1252,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The first problem with these earphones is that the wrong ones came. I ordered the white and grey ones, but the all black ones came. The other problem is that they do not work properly. Unless they are plugged in at a very specific angle, the sound constantly cuts out. I would not recommend wasting your money."
1253,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my third order of these headphones. Love them! Good quality at a good price. They are dependable and comfortable.
1254,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best ear buds!

These are the best ear buds that I ever owned. The last pair that I owned lasted for a year before I broke them (that was my mistake closed the door without noticing them). Then I found them again here and both ear pieces are still working just great after months."
1255,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not recommended for gym or use while doing any physical activity.
The wire is flimsy and creates static easy if you slightly move the wiring near plug/jack (which gets real annoying fast).
They fix real nice and the size is near perfect, but with the sound quality failing / not working properly when needed, that's a fail in anyone's book!"
1256,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My girlfriend hates the new style earbuds where it fits deeper in the ear. So we purchase this traditional ear buds instead.

The quality is good and it came with a few exchangeable covers. The length core is more than enough and it fit in her ear the way it should feel."
1258,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not great quality but better than cheap generic. Did not last near as long as the earbuds that comes with apple phones, ipods, and ipads. These need to be made with a little higher quality wire."
1259,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best headphones I've ever used. This has been my 2nd purchase of the same model since 2010. It delivers a very crisp sound, and delivers the bass and treble better than any other in ear headphones I've used. I also produce music, and find these to be very useful in gaging my sounds. Amazing headphones, super durable, very high quality sound delivery. Will definitely purchase again."
1260,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice replacements to my iPod ear buds. Sound quality is at least as good and the cord is longer. Alos the angled minijack helps keep the ear phones from becoming unpluged easily.
1261,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth a higher price to not have them break on you like the non-name brand ones do.
1262,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor sound quality, I expected more out of Sony and was very disappointed. Will not buy again!"
1263,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these headphones as a Christmas gift for my son and either they were defective or anything you play through them first goes through a tin can under the ocean. There seems to be a bad connection in the cord somewhere however Amazon did remedy the situation.
1264,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good cheap headphones. The sound is fairly neutral and ok to good sound stage for low priced buds. The earphone cover came off and got lost pretty quick but I don't mind that.
1265,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these ear buds as a replacement for a set that broke. Usually Sony makes quality products, but this one is not. As soon as I plugged them in, I noticed a crackle. It did not go away and was not present when I used other ear buds. I returned them.

Update: I received a second pair of these ear buds today for my birthday. My wife purchased them for me without knowing that I had a problem with the previous pair. I decided to try them to see if they would work. They did not. Same exact problem. Must be a manufacturing defect."
1266,1.0 out of 5 stars,Decent quality out of package but upon being hooked to my phone they immediately began flickering in and out with sound. I can tell these won't last me long. Wouldn't recommend for long term use.
1267,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how these are smaller than normal ear buds, I wear them while I run and they stay in just fine"
1269,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these specifically because they allow you to hear noise around you. You can listen to music at a low volume with these in and still carry on a conversation.
1270,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is underwhelming and tinny, with little to no bass response. The connector makes poor contact with the standard headphone jack on my smartphone resulting in constant crackling when cord is slightly jostled. Not an audiophile by any means, nor did I expect miracles for less than 10 dollars. Yet, the ear buds that these replaced, SONY MDRE828LP/SLV, which were 10 dollars when I last bought them in 2012 and apparently now discontinued, were far superior to these. Third party seller does not allow returns, otherwise these would be heading back. Disappointed."
1271,5.0 out of 5 stars,Way more comfortable than those noise canceling ones.
1272,5.0 out of 5 stars,simple and get the job done. Really affordable also. I have not had any problems with them.
1273,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I buy these often for my mother. I will buy again. (I'm not repeatedly buying these because they're not good quality, it's because my mother loses her earphones or gets them caught in the door or work out machine...so it's a good deal since I have to keep buying them)."
1274,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality is not that good but they work.
1275,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unlike the ones that came with my MP-3 player, Sony has shaped these to actually fit your ear shape. They don't move around just because of some tug or tension. Well worth it. (And please consider those foam ear-pad replacements, as after a while, they get a little loose, even though I dry mine off each time.) ~ww"
1276,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product. bought 2 before in the past and has lasted me at 2 years each item. The quality of this product never fails me. Came in time period it said it would and cant wait to use.
1277,4.0 out of 5 stars,These don't hurt my ears as much as others I have tried. I don't know if I have misshapen inner ears or not but it is hard to find starbucks that don't hurt. These are almost perfect.
1278,4.0 out of 5 stars,great headphones
1280,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, well-constructed. A good ear bud. My son doesn't like the ""in ear"" silicone type ear buds that insert into the ear canal. He wanted some that would sit in the ear like the kind that come with iPods, only better. These Sony buds fit the bill, and he really likes them. The slight teardrop shape and foam padding make them comfortable, and they stay in his ears quite well."
1281,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product and exactly what I expected.
1282,3.0 out of 5 stars,"not great sound at all. I was expecting a crisper sound. When played high bass tunes , too much static."
1283,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are perfect ear buds for my small Sony Walkman. I usually order two at a time so I always have a back up. Very reasonably priced, too."
1284,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality and reliability! Would order them again
1285,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Same thing happened to me that has happened to some other customers. They came in a weird baggie, white/gray instead of black. The left side stopped working almost immediately and they fell apart, literally, after a couple of weeks of light use. Knockoffs maybe? Sony gear is usually pretty good in construction and performance - these were terrible."
1286,5.0 out of 5 stars,"had to replace my old headphones, and it's nice to see that my favorite model is still being made :)"
1287,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I already have a pair of the these earbuds that I had bought at a Rite Aid because my old Phillips earbuds with good sound quality finally gave out. I paid twice the price for it at the store so this pair from Amazon.com is way better deal. Sound quality is loud and crisp, very good quality for the price especially when compared to other brands that are so awful, you'd have to crank up the volume to the max just to hear anything."
1288,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sony always does a good job with ear buds. These are comfortable with good sound quality.
1289,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these earbuds. I bought 3 in in dfferent colors for myself & one as a gift. They are very sturdy unlike 3 apple earbuds which have come apart although comfortable. These are very comfortable & stay in the ear.
1291,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I know these ear buds are cheap, but I didn't expect them to SOUND as cheap as they do. Very ""tinny"" sound, no low end, no ability to distinguish instrumentation or background sounds. These are no better than a $3 pair in the checkout lane at the grocery store."
1292,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Always I use sony earbud and my son too. The are more resistant than others brands. Well, at least for us."
1293,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The price is good and it fits nicely my ear, which is something I am really picky about. I am probably going to buy another pair when the time comes. (don't get me wrong, the quality is good, I've been using this product everyday for months.)"
1294,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These fit perfectly in my ear. I had the previous model (I forget the model number) and used them daily for hours and they still worked great. The only reason I had to replace them is because I lost them! These are comfortable, have decent sound quality (especially for the price) and I'm able to wear them for hours at a time with no problems."
1295,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Awful. I've had them for a month and while I will say that the sound quality could be much higher, especially coming from Sony, that's not the reason for my negative review. The ear buds fell out of my hand and onto the floor and the covering of the ear bud popped off and it will in no way pop back on. Cheaply made. Waste of money."
1296,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones.
1297,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought these headphones multiple times before and they usually last a decently long time and the quality is great! However, I bought a pair in mid-August and already one earbud does not work anymore. It's only been a little over two months since I bought them. Very unhappy that I can't even find any type of warranty"
1298,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sound quality and fit is amazing i generally can't stand ear buds very uncomfortable these are so comfortable i have falling aslepp with them in. I listen to alot of Podcast and voices are clear music sounds good to.
1299,5.0 out of 5 stars,These ear plugs are great! My Honey borrowed them and loved them so much he kept them for himself.
1300,2.0 out of 5 stars,Need to replace a pair of Samsung buds that came with an old MP3 player. The bass I get out of the Samsungs are making finding a replacement set difficult. Based on other reviews I was led to believe these had a decent level of bass...they don't. At least not compared to the Samsungs. I have also tried some from Panasonic. The Panasonics were noise-isolating and I don't like in-ear buds...the search continues.
1302,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice buds.
1303,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are just old reliables that dont feel as bad as the other similar options. They are not fancy at all and arent the best sounding but they do take some punishment and are great backup to more sturdy or wireless options.
1304,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these earbuds! They're great, and I use them almost every day."
1305,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is stellar, wouldn't expect anything else from Sony brand, also the plug is an 'L' shape so it easily blends with whatever you plug it in with."
1306,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for school. Has good sound, fits kids ears well!"
1307,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for my daughter and she only likes to use these now because they sound better than others she's tried. And at a great prices with fun colors!
1308,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Awful audio quality. I wanted the earbud style but these are way to cheap. Also, tiny packaging causes very tight kinks in cord."
1309,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I personally love love Sony earphones ONLY. Why? They work well and last long, its tough. and I will always buy these only. It doesn't give you headaches like those gummy ones. Recommend try if have not, you'll love it! One time my niece poured water all over one of the earphones, but it still worked fine, another time it fell in a sauce and it was fine again. The only time I would purchase another one is when it went missing and I really need another one! Price is affordable and lasting earphone!!!"
1310,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great for the price, they're really cute, and they stay in place, even when running. I've had lots of problems with earbuds, but these fit really well with the foam covers, and the covers are very soft. The cord is a nice size so it doesn't get tangled up too badly, and they've taken a bit of tugging without falling apart."
1311,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Broke pretty quickly. Invest in some apple headphones, those are more expensive but will last much longer"
1313,4.0 out of 5 stars,"these are some pretty good headphones for the price. every pair of Sony headphones i bought sounded excellent. i ordered these in hopes of them being just as good, but they're just good. i gave them to my sister and she loves them. i'm just use to having headphones that sounds like i'm at a live concert."
1314,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality. Have been using this for over 3 months now and it is still working fine. Don't expect an enchanting sound quality, but a good product for the price I paid (around 8 dollars)."
1315,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear phones turned out exceptionally good for all that I imagined. I was initially unsure about buying a 7.5$ earphone though it was from Sony. But its totally worth every penny. Its 6 months since I bought them and they've functioned superbly. They have had some rough times.. I've pulled them when they're plugged into the laptop at times, I've lifted the iPhone by the wires. I have crushed them ,slept with them on, left them in my jeans and turned them into the washer by mistake. Both but both the sides still working and they sound great. Noise cancellation- I would say 80%.. Theyre very comfortable in my ear as well..
The only reason I give a 4 is due to quality of the foampads. They are terrible and kept slipping off until they eventually tore when I was refitting them. If not for this, they are perfect."
1316,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only headphones that stay well in my ears.
1317,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I read the reviews here I was worried these wouldn't be as good as the previous model, but so far I've only had success with them. They're very comfortable and stay in my ears much better than any other brand of earbud I've ever used."
1318,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best earphones EVER. They always last me from 6 month - 1 year depending on how well I take care of them. They are extremely comfortable and they sound quality is AMAZING. Definitely a Sony thing. These are my #1 go to earphones. If I ever lose them , I immediately buy the same exact ones . And they come in the cutest colors ! From light blue , grey , pink & green. (:"
1319,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought these headphones were going to be pretty good after reading the reviews. These earphones are terrible. They are the kind that will only play through one ear unless you plug it in JUST the right way. My old earphones that I lost were so much better quality. Also, there is little to no bass when listening to music through these.

The earbuds themselves are bad and the quality of music that plays through them are bad."
1320,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
- really clear sound
- reasonable price

Cons:
- bass seems nonexistent compared to my ""Pioneer STEEZ""
- made in china (not surprised)
- flimsy cable
- transparent plastic on the outside part of the ear bud (the colorful part)

Overall I would say that these ear buds do their job well, given the $7.34 price tag."
1321,5.0 out of 5 stars,Insanely good on smartphones.
1322,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the second pair of these that I have purchased. The previous pair lasted more than five years with nearly every day use. The sound quality and fit of the ear buds is consistent between the two pairs that I have; this brand ear buds have the most comfortable fit in my opinion and are not too big to fit in my ears like most other brands that I have tried. I would buy these a third time.
1324,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work well with my ears.
1325,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this as a donation to a children-teens advocate service. I believe this was a useful device for a deserving teenager that may be going through some difficult times.
1326,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the clear sound from these ! One of my favorite things about them is the foam pads that cover them. I have always had trouble with me ears itching, and these foam pads prevent that! I also like that they come in colors. I bought an extra set since my cat likes to chew on wires and I did 't want to find myself without a set."
1327,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously had these same Sony earbuds only they were pink and white for 4 years. Once they wore out, I bought another pair in this color. Love Sony brand"
1328,5.0 out of 5 stars,thank goodness for a sturdy pair that my cat and child don't break in two days. Good but not amazing sound range.
1329,5.0 out of 5 stars,This headset is fantastic. It has a really cool design and is really comfortable
1330,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is a tank! I accidentally dropped it without knowing and ran it over with my car and it still works! The sound of the headphones are clear and crisp, for a under 10 dollar earbud that is pretty good. Only thing I have a complain about is if you lose those earbud cover they slip out of your ears fairly easily. Other than that complain I love the earbuds."
1331,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are beautiful earphones (I got the blue ones). But the sound quality is a bummer. I have many pairs of earphones from all sorts of companies. These sound cheap. I used to buy Sony earphones that come in the wind-up wheel-like device. They sounded real good. They don't make them anymore. So I tried these. Blah. What a bummer. I guess I can use them to listen to *speech* on my MP3 player. But for music, not worth it. Just a dull, ugly sound."
1332,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This company does not know the meaning of customer service. I placed my order like I would anything else about 8 months ago. I got an estimated delivery date for my headphones and waited for them to come it. The date came and went. About a week after the later part of the date went by I went to look at the tracking and it said it had been delivered.
I contacted the company and told them what was going on. They ignored my first e-mail. After I sent a slightly angry second e-mail they responded saying that the USPS was just slow and to wait for a while. Long story short I kept writing to the company every couple weeks requesting a refund, always first e-mail being ignored, second one angrier one being brushed off. It took them about 10 weeks after the later part of the estimated delivery date to FINALLY refund my purchase. Avoid this company at all costs."
1333,1.0 out of 5 stars,I've had Sony headphones before and these are definitely not Sony brand. These have very poor sound quality compared to Sony headphones I had previously purchased for double the price at a large retailer. I found a lack of bass when using these. I gave them to my 12 year old son as an extra pair
1335,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are absolutely my favorite earbuds.
I wear earbuds at work, so I can't use in-ear headphones (too hard to hear if someone has come into my office or said my name ect). They are the most comfortable earbuds I've ever used, and fit nicely in my ear without being too snug.
They are a great price, and they last super well. I buy a couple pairs every 3 years or so, usually because I've lost my old ones. Over the years I think I've had only ever had two pairs that had one headphone stop working, and I am _not_ gentle with my earbuds.
Exactly what you want in a cheap earbud, inexpensive enough that it's not painful to re-purchase, but sturdy enough that you don't have to re-purchase because they just quit working!"
1336,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very particular about the earbuds I use. The ones with the rubber tip that goes more into your ear canal make everything sound weird to me and the round ""Gummy"" ones fall out of my ears. What I hadn't noticed in the picture before ordering is that these aren't perfectly round (nor are they banana shaped like one reviewer said) and I think that helps them stay in. At least in my ears, I can't speak for anyone else.

Another issue I have with earbuds is with the cord being long enough. If I'm listening to my mp3 player and have it on my desk at work, I can move it close enough that a shorter cord doesn't matter, but when I'm listening to my scanner and having it close to me isn't an option because I'd knock it over I want a longer cord and while the cord on the MDRE9LP could be an inch or two longer, I'm glad they're not shorter. The cord is almost the ""pefect"" length.

Overall, I'm super happy with them after using them for only ten minutes and I'm glad I bought them."
1337,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these ear buds as an upgrade from the really cheap ones I've been using. (The ones I have keep breaking.) So far I am really happy with the Sony Ear Buds. They are a little longer than the ones I have been using which is nice. I mainly use them to listen to music and for guided meditations. The sound is crisp and clear. The only thing I'm not happy with is that the Ear Bud covers they sent with the product are so thin that they both ripped when I tried to put them on. I have friends who paid a lot more for their Ear Buds and they aren't nearly as nice as these. I'm kind of rough on stuff so I don't know how long they will last, but given the improved sound quality I'm happy with my purchase."
1338,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Several years ago I purchased a little MP3 Walkman, and the sound quality was spectacular. It remained good even after my poor little earbuds made the trip through the washer and dryer. But over time and continued trauma, the sound quality did continue to degrade.
I tried several other brands and none of them even came close to the Sonys. So when I saw these I didn't really care about the price (which was very good) - I just needed some good earbuds.
These are great! Crystalline sound quality, and have that middle-of-your-head sound generation quality. :) So glad I found them!"
1339,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the older Sony ear buds and I like them better than the new ones that are out in the stores now. These are tougher, stronger, and sound better than the new ones. I had three pairs of the new all black ones of a big box store and in less than a month I had one pair left. I went to Amazon to see if any of the older ones were available and I found a bunh for under $10 so I bought them and have them put away because I know it will be a long time before I need to replace each pair. These are great for riding around in your travel bag because they take a beating and keep going. Nothing breaks and nothing sounds bad. They aren't for audiophiles. but for the average music fan, they work quite well."
1340,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this product for somebody else, but they were very happy with it. One thing to note is that the white earbuds actually are not 100% white. The middle part is white, but the little piece on the outside is without a doubt grey. Not light grey, not off white, but full out grey. Both the part that says Sony and the little circle part. Luckily the person I gave them to thought they looked cooler in person than in the picture so it worked out, but it is something to keep in mind if you're looking for all white headphones. They came very nicely packaged. They are very happy and there are no regrets."
1341,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an iPod Touch, but I was never fully satisfied with the earphones it originally came with because the sound quality was sub-par. So, I hunted for a new pair, not wanting to spend more than $15. I wanted something brand new and decided to buy these earphones to replace the original pair. I've had about 3 pairs of these earbud headphones over the last 3 or 4 years and the quality has always been excellent, in my opinion. I bought these earbuds to replace the same model I'd been using for about 2 years! My old pair had been dropped, twisted, wrapped around my iPod and the quality of the sound never changed. I only replaced them because the sound finally gave out one day last week. The sound quality is really rich and clear. I only need to turn up my iPod's volume to about 50% in order to hear music or podcast with crystal clear quality. I would definitely repurchase these in the future. Shipping was also very fast too."
1342,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought I would give these a try. We usually buy the Gumy brand for about the same price. I'm sorry to say that these are literally garbage. I tried to return them but they're not eligible for a return, so I will have to throw them away. I won't subject my ears to such poor quality. Sony, you get a major fail on these. Buy the Gumy brand, they give you a reasonably nice listening experience."
1343,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second set of these ear buds. I use them every day and am pretty hard on them, taking them off and putting back on numerous times a day. After about a year one of the ear pieces no longer works, but that happens regardless of how much I spend on them. These are economical, have great sound and fit my ears nicely. I will keep buying them as long as they keep making them."
1344,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I had a pair of these previously in white and I liked them up until one day, you couldn't hear anything out of one of the buds. I bought these thinking that they were going to last longer but after just 2 weeks of using them, I couldn't hear from one of the ear buds EITHER!!!!! It was a waste of my money."
1346,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor quality, and I received a color I didn't order."
1347,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good
1348,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, like being able to hear the world around me and my music too!"
1349,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great ear buds for the price. Remember their are not pretending to be a replacement for high end head phones.
1350,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves all things Sony-she uses this for her cell phone and for taking classes online and watching You Tube-great buy-I am getting one for myself as well.
1351,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use these things for running/biking/climbing/working out. Lets me hear what is around me while still hearing music. I tie a not in the wires just below my chin so that they never fall out my ears.
1352,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I should have read more 1 and 2 star reviews for this product. I got these to replace my sony mdre828lp which finally died in one ear. The old earphones weren't great to begin with, but these felt like a step sown.

They are comfortable and super small, but they have no bass unless I press them into my ears and hold them there. I ended up replacing them with sennheiser mx 365 earphones, which were much better."
1353,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones.
I got them in several colors, I keep a pair at work, in the car and at home.
Plus they don't cost an arm and a leg."
1354,5.0 out of 5 stars,Like them
1355,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For a spare set of earbuds, these work fine for audiobooks, as well as music."
1357,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earbuds! I bought it for my niece, since she wanted pink earbuds. She loves it. Sound quality is great, and very well constructed. She is using it for few months now."
1358,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my husband since these are the only kind he'll wear. I knocked off a star because one of the earbuds stopped working after just a couple of months.
1359,1.0 out of 5 stars,Crap !!!!! That won't stay in ear.
1360,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good ear buds. I've had them for over a month now and I haven't seen any wear or tear on them. Nothing like the cheap $1 ear buds that you can get at the dollar store that only last about a week or two.

Update 9-2-2016:
It's been over a year since I bought these and they still work just fine! No signs of wear and tear at all!"
1361,3.0 out of 5 stars,I am happy with the size and the way they fit in my ears.now I need to find out how long they will stay in my ears once I start mowing my lawn
1362,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They're comfortable, they work, they're cheap, they last quite a bit first pair lasted like 2 years"
1363,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great standard set of semi ""disposable"" ear buds. I use these at the gym, on planes and I jam them in my pocket whenever I get a chance. I have destroyed a few pairs of these by constant use and mishandling but I don't mind. These are great for me because I cannot stand the ""in ear"" headphones, they just feel uncomfortable to me."
1364,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear buds are great, the sound is incredible through these small buds, they are comfortable I'm very happy I bought them. Ear buds of these type are hard to find anymore so I plan on getting a couple more for backup, I bought two pairs. The buds were only $9.00 a pair so for the price it was a real bargain. Great purchase"
1365,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the only type of earbuds that actually fit in my ears. I've bought at least 6-7 pairs over the years. I'm not always very nice to them, but the seem to hold up well.

Sound quality is fine for me too, pretty average, but suits my purposes fine."
1366,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They're fine but ear buds could have been a little longer, decent price."
1368,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I find these kinds of ear buds to fit my ears the best. If you have small ears and want ear buds that are durable, these would be a good thing to try out. My last set lasted me about 8 or 9 years before I finally had to replace them."
1369,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are probably exactly what you expect. They have a comfortable fit in my ears, even when not using the included foam pads. The sound is reasonable, especially for music while working out or listening to audiobooks. The cord is longer than most cheap earbuds, and that is a definite plus.

I've used several sets of these and never had them wear out, only had to replace when my wife steals them or my cat chews through the wires. Longest time in use was probably 1.5-2 years without any problems.

I would highly recommend these if you need a cheap set of earbuds. They won't replace a $100 pair, but they were never meant to."
1370,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Inexpensive ear buds work fine. Sound is pretty good. The wire quality is just OK. My 100 dollar Bose ear buds look sound and feel great, but at this price, i can abuse these and when they break i can toss them and get another pair."
1371,5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect ... thanks
1372,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Assuming you don't lose the covers that protect the earpiece after the first time you take them out of your ear, you will certainly experience the short leash on these the minute you try to lean over to take something out of your desk drawer ... and your head is suddenly yanked back ... The sounds quality is fine, but will never buy again."
1373,5.0 out of 5 stars,Always used this ear buds since it works the best for me as I do not like one of those where you have to attach rubber tips.
1374,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of my older pairs lost sound in the left (always left for me) headphone so I purchase these. I love these headphones! Nice bass and the sound is clear.
1375,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These Sony earbuds are the ONLY ones I buy for my family. We use them for all our iphones, ipads, ipods, tablets, and laptops. Just as good as the Apple OEM earbuds. My kids think the iphone 5's are better... but I don't agree. These Sony's have a nice pure balanced sound. Plus the price is right..."
1376,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Brand, Product, and Price--an unbeatable combination! Many thanks, Amazon!"
1377,5.0 out of 5 stars,best buy. great for running.
1379,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these, comfortable and don't fall ot"
1380,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered two. One of them had a rather tinny sound, and the right earbud popped constantly. The other one is fine (for now) but not spectacular. They're cheap, what else is there to say?"
1381,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound for the price and very durable. Use them everyday during my commute and have had no problems. Only thing that woul d make them better is if they and a mic to use on my phone too. Add to my wishlist so when they do eventually faoil I can get another pair.
1382,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these earbuds had my last earbuds which were the same product last over 2 years and then a wire in in one speakers shaped in 2 and only 1 earbuds was working so went here and found the earbuds I was using here and now I am happy to use my Ipod Nano 7th gen while at work. Thanks Amazon you are the BEST!!!!!!
1383,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these ear buds. I have had to purchase them a few times due to forgetting them in a hotel room or a grandchild running off with them. When I order them I purchase two pair just in case. I have only worn out 1 pair and they lasted over a year with me using them constantly.
1384,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought as school supplies.
1385,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perhaps one of the greatest Ear Buds of all time. I own a pair and they are very durable, reliable, and have crystal clear sound that brings you to a whole new perspective on the true sound of music in your songs listened through them. Highly recommended!"
1386,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second set of Sony MDRE9LP I have owned. The first set lasted about 8 years and would still be going strong if I hadn't stepped on one of the buds by mistake. They are very well made and will deliver quality sound for years (if you don't step on them).

I also wanted to mention the very speedy delivery. Since I have an Amazon Prime membership, I get free two-day shipping. But I actually received this item within 24 hours of my placing the order. That's super-speedy."
1387,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent headphones for price. Fits my weird ears so I'm happy. Good for people who don't like ear buds that go in your ears. Sound is as expected for price.
1388,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are OK for non in ear buds. Just OK.
1390,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lasted me almost 6 months, and I'm always using headphones, whether I'm out or at home or in my bed. Great quality for the price, great sound with music, would recommend and am buying again."
1391,5.0 out of 5 stars,Run a little big (or I have small ears) - but they work fine.
1392,1.0 out of 5 stars,Earbuds eventually fall off. Sad purchase.
1393,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When i first used used these headphones, there was an annoying staticy noise. However, it eventually went away and it works well. Now, to see if it will last 4 years like my last earphone..."
1394,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have difficulty keeping earbuds inserted in my auditory canal. These come with a thin sponge-like cover which makes it easy for the earbuds to remain in place.
1395,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cool ear buds...
1396,4.0 out of 5 stars,bought as a gift for my wife who loved how these fit in her ear and sound.
1397,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say about cheap headphones you don't already know, they aren't the best sounding headphones I've used, they probably won't last very long compared to other headphones I own. But for under $10 they are good enough to not care too much about sound quality, longevity, or if they get lost."
1398,5.0 out of 5 stars,like
1399,1.0 out of 5 stars,WORST HEADPHONES/EARBUDS i HAVE EVER USED AND CANNOT BE RETURNED.(NOT EVEN AN OPTION). UNCOMFORTABLE FALL OUT OF YOUR EAR AND NO BASS OR MIDRANGE AT ALL.
1401,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for my daughter and she loves them. She has them in constantly and they seem to work well and not have issues.
1402,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I accidentally purchased these earbuds thinking they were the Sony MDR-E10LP earbuds. I do not like these earbuds as much as the E10LP, the sound wasn't as good and after a while if you turned the volume up too high on a podcast the sound gets pretty distorted. All in all I recommend the Sony MDR-E10LP over these all day any day."
1403,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product and look upon arrival. Time will tell for sure.
1404,4.0 out of 5 stars,Don't expect to get found shattering sound quality for this cheap. You get what you pay for. Cheap ear buds to use knowing they'll probably get lost or break within a few months. Anyone who complains about the sound must've forgot they paid $8 for these.
1405,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered it back in November will one day shipping and did not receive it until a month later. And now one of the ear bud is not providing sound at all. I have kept them safe and stored properly. I will not buy this product again.
1406,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound! Always stick with sony because some of their headphones last longer than others.
1407,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really disappointed with these earbud headphones. I just expected so much more from the Sony brand. The sound is fine, what I expected...but I first bought them for my 13 year old daughter, and she complained they hurt her ears when she wore them. I tried them, and boy, was she right. They were awful. Very uncomfortable. I used them once and that was it. They only reason I didn't give one star was because the sound is decent."
1408,5.0 out of 5 stars,A bit smaller than the average pair that looks like this... perfect for those of us who are a little petite. These fit good without hurting my ears like others brands do.
1409,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been buying sony for many years. Ever since my first experience with broken headphones. The other brands just don't have the right sound.
1410,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect, fast delivery and nice for those who enjoy the flat buds similar to the old iPhone headphones. Great sound."
1412,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased as a gift but wish I had bought a pair for myself.
1413,5.0 out of 5 stars,This works and does not drain your wallet. I normally changed buds at least every 3 to 4 months due to heavy use as in gym workouts or jogging.
1414,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works very good. happy with this purchase. Thank yoy!
1415,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
1416,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable to wear, but bass is very weak. Had a similar sony ear bud before that had much better bass and was the same price.
Maybe Sony quality going to the dogs these days.... hmm"
1417,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Easily worst headphones i had bought. Ever. it would but it in the mid range of the freebee category.

I put on the headphones, and the first thing i hear is static. If you even touch the wire you get static. Also, sound quality is horrible. I would have head better luck playing my phone on loud and listening to that on my run. Honestly, i think i am just going to throw them in the garbage."
1418,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing quality for a relatively cheap earbud. A bargain.
1419,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Always great. I bought these twice. Though the only reason I had to buy them again is because my new kitten chewed on the wire. I have been buying these for years, (including the older versions.)"
1420,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Good:
-They don't go directly in your ears.
-Made by Sony
-The package included a pair of foam buds.

The Not-as good:
-Not much bass response as I had hoped. News, Talk, and music that isn't bass-dependent sounds okay."
1421,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolute crap product. I no longer have the original packaging and stuff, so I am forced to toss it, effectively tossing $9. The worst ear buds I ever bought. I listen to heavy metal music exclusively and this earset sounds tinny and has no bass. Try Slayer without bass. Disappointed in Sony. I know they make better products, so thi could just be a one off mistake, but I recommend staying away from this MDRE9LP."
1423,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these earbuds. They are very comfortable and makes listening to music easy.
1424,5.0 out of 5 stars,"st patrick gift for my teen not to intense to destroyhearring lose like beats,, great sound total block every one out"
1425,5.0 out of 5 stars,"New earbuds always take some getting used to for me, but I really like these! I find them very comfortable and the sound clear =]"
1426,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great earbuds. Sound quality is nice and clear. They also fit the earcannel completely so it drown out outside noises pretty well. Would definitly buy another pair.
1427,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are doing the job and came in nice packaging in the advertised time frame. I have not had the issues with them that other customers seem to be plagued by.
1428,4.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't last long but my daughter is rough on ear buds. I don't get it.
1429,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best if not the best low cost earphones. They sound good, no bass though. They are great for running / exercise. They are comfortable, you can wear them for hours and may forget they are there."
1430,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are ill fitting and have no bass. I bought these because I listen to more podcasts than music but they're not even good for that. It's like listening to nails dragging across a chalkboard. SCR EEEECH No,seriously, it does."
1431,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this product to replace an older version of similar Sony earphones, which have lasted me the past 4 years. The product arrived at the expected time. I was somewhat disappointed in the quality. I thought that I took care of my earphones well, but within a week, I started experiencing the same problems I had with these new earphones that I had with my old Sony earphones after 4 years. Sound was inconsistent as I walked around the the cord attached to my iPhone entangled itself and rotated around randomly. I also constantly hear the little plastic component as I walk around listening to these earphones, which get kinda annoying."
1432,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These work really well. I've had them for a year now, and I think they might be starting to wear down. But I stuff them into my backpack, my pocket and my gym bag, and have not taken care of them much. I think these are a good buy though."
1434,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Should have payed closer to 5 or 6. Not what I expected from Sony. Mostly because these don't provide much bass. I've had other Sony ear buds similarly priced better than this, those it wasn't much of a spend and they provide decent quality sound.. Audio:6/10 without much bass.."
1435,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these earbuds...
These don't block out ambient sounds and fit my ears better than Beats...
Highly recommended, if you like comfort, and the ability to do things while listening to music or, like me, audiobooks.
I just wish they were easier to find..."
1436,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, doesn't fit as well as a jvc but does the job."
1437,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones.... I took a star away because it could of been packaged a little bit better.... my bubble mailer was opened, which means the item could have fallen out .... I will buy these again...."
1438,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Way more durable than I expected. I accidentally ran these things through the washer and the dryer and they still work fine three months later. Wouldn't recommend replicating my experience, but its pretty tight."
1439,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They work, but the older model was better. Unfortunately you can't find those anymore. So take it or leave it. These are my gym throw-aways anyway"
1440,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These Sony Ear Buds are cheap but the sound quality lasts for a very long time. The only thing you need to wory about it is keeping the little white things that go over the parts that go in your ear on. I wasn't careful and I accidentally lost it, but I just replaced it with a spare one I had, and they are good as new!"
1441,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best earbuds ive ever had. Ive had several pairs of these over the years and they never break from overuse, never fade or lose sound. They break because I am not carefull with my possesions. Good sound and great bass on this pair...as usual."
1442,5.0 out of 5 stars,"send to my friend as gift
gift"
1443,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this earbuds since a while, I had them in white and they resisted a lot of bad handling. They stopped working finally after 3 years of a lot of use. I bought two new pairs.

They have good sound, they are confortable, they would be perfect if the wires be more resistent."
1445,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son goes through ear buds like crazy! These have held up for quite a while though. The sound quality is good and he likes this style over the type that go down into your ear. Definitely worth the price. I'm going back to buy more.
1446,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I need a pair of headphones to work out with, so a few weeks back I had purchased the Panasonic RPHV21BK In-Ear Earbud Heaphones with Built-in Clip, but that was absolutely terrible, so I went back to Sony, a brand that never failed me before. As expected, the headphones were a lot better than the previous Panasonics i bought. They have good sound quality for the price it comes in, and when working out, it relatively stayed put in my ears and didn't fall out. The only problem with it is the volume; I'll have the volume low, but it's still rather loud in the ears, so I would recommend not blasting the volume, at least until you have a feel for the sound."
1447,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not much bass but that's to be expected of earbuds in this price range. One of my better sets of earbuds. Be sure to wipe them off every once in a while to stop wax from building up.
1448,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my husband after buying a pair for myself. They work well and can be turned up very loud without much distortion. The cord length is nice and the shape of the buds seems to help them stay in your ear very well - even when working out.
1449,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product at a great price, or so I'm told. I don't do earbuds but I've bought this twice as gifts, both people loved them."
1450,1.0 out of 5 stars,Warning: Cannot be returned. I no sooner had these out of the box and plugged into my iPhone 5s before I had to start wiggling the cord to get both sides to work. Poor quality. Find something else. Do not buy these. Again: CANNOT BE RETURNED.
1451,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're not really interested in good sound quality and just need something somewhat discreet to use while on the subway or exercising, these are great. I've been using this model or similar for about 3 years now, and they've done the trick. I've been through about 3 pair as they usually crap out within a year or so of heavy daily use, but at $10ish, that's expected and not really a hassle."
1452,4.0 out of 5 stars,good deal when the kids are rough with them and need their own at school. not a tragedy when lost. sound quality is quite good.
1453,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap material that lasted not even one month before the earbuds came apart.
1454,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well the first thing I can say is that I love this ones. I love the color and it's just like the picture... it's just amazing. The sound is good and I'm really happy to purchase it.
1456,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my favorite earphones by far. I tend to break all earbuds regardless of price in less than a month but I owned a pair of these for 5 years before I decided to buy new ones and mind you, the old ones are still fully functional even though I dropped them in water, stepped on them multiple times, and even slammed the car door on the cable. If you're careless like me then I definitely recommend this."
1457,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe because the phone is a Sony? I think Walkman is clearer and crisper than iTunes. But that's not the phones. I love stereo sound in my ears and need to hear what is happening around me. I have scarring on one eardrum so I won't give detail on the sound quality. They have an unusual shape and at first they seemed to fit well into my ears and not fall out. Then I found the little spongey things that made them too big and they fell out easily, so I took them off. Now they still pop out fairly easily when I'm walking about. I'm plugging them into my bluetooth clip on so there's an abundance of wire that seems to weigh, snag and pull them out. Latest engineering has the clip hanging from a safety pin and reducing the weight from pulling on the earbuds. I think I'm missing something, but these earbuds are the same configuration of wires and plug and I think I got them because they are a foot shorter than most. All the excess wire is heavy. Since I seem to be hard on these devices, they cease to function in one ear or the other I keep buying relatively inexpensive sets. I would get these again."
1458,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are decent earbuds for the price you pay. You better find a good source for those little spandex covers because you will be going thru many of them. They either fall off or go to pieces over time. But the buds themselves are good but don't expect rock star quality.
1459,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use to have a walkman that uses similar ear buds like this one, so this takes my back when I use it. Great sound and right length to be tuck in to my shirt. I use it during my breaks and walking around, seems to be fitting into my ears without any issue. I got couple more of these incase it goes bad, still cheaper than my local electronic stores"
1460,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a landscaper, and I go through several earbuds in a year. Because of that, I just go for the cheap ones that are under $10.

90% of the time, I purchase Sony earbuds because they give you good sound at a cheap price. Unfortunately, they failed with this set. Even worse, I bought two of them.

It's hard to explain, but the sound is not as crisp on these. The bass, or lack of, is bad. Because of that, everything sounds flat. Then, that leaves me to go and mess around with the 'EQ' settings on the iPod. That's an issue, because I have more than one genre of music on the iPod. So then I have some songs that sound good and others that sound poor. With previous Sony earbuds, I never had to worry about that. The difference in sound was negligible when it jumped from one genre to another.

When I listen to music, I have to turn up the volume a little more than I usually did with my old Sony earbuds. When I listen to podcasts, I have to raise the volume quite a bit more.

I can't complain too much because of their price, but I've certainly had way better Sony earbuds for under $10. Now I have to put up with these until they break. Both of them.

I do find them to be a comfortable pair. I'll give them that."
1461,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a pair of earbuds without the rubbery attachments that are so common these days. I think I heard somewhere that the rubbery attachment vibrates your ear canal and can damage your hearing over time. Anyhow, these earbuds matched the profile, the reviews were good, and they were cheap ($8).

I am listening to music on these earbuds now as I write this review. The treble is OK but the bass needs some serious help. Just like Meghan Trainor I am all about that bass. For $8 I don't expect too much but my last pair of Panasonic earbuds were much better...they had much fuller sound. I will probably go and reorder my Panasonic RPHV21GA earbuds and put these wimpy Sony buds in a drawer somewhere."
1462,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an authentic review. I did NOT receive this item for free or at a discount for my ""unbiased review."" I paid full price and am just a regular Amazon shopper just like you are.

Very lightweight plastic headphones that I keep in my bag for occasional use. I was glad to find them because those ones with the little rubber pieces that go into your ears are horrible for me. I've yet to find a pair that stay in my ears.

Sound quality is pretty good for an inexpensive set of buds."
1463,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this style earbuds/headphones and would choose/recommend over the new style ANY DAY. The new style hurts like hell and is EXTREMELY uncomfortable as you have to push the ""cusions"" down into your eardrums. Perhaps they do give you a slight better sound and depth. I wouldn't know because the moment I had to apply a single side, I took it right out, threw them away and that was that. I'd rather have comfort than bleeding, puffy eardrums. This set is EXTREMELY comfortable. The sound is good but yes the bass isn't all that. Shocking for a Sony product."
1464,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The ear buds look nice, stay in my ears well, and I like that they're labelled left and right. However, there is absolutely NO bass sound from these whatsoever. Even listening to videos of people talking takes some getting used to. But they're good for the purpose I bought them for, which is watching videos on without large headphones crushing my ears."
1465,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been buying this version of headphones for several years now. They're the only type in this price range that I've found to stand up to heavy long term wear. I use headphones daily (while on my laptop) and I think I break a pair about once a year on average (the only time I've ever had them break was by directly stepping on them but this has happened multiple times over the years). The rest of the time I toss my laptop around from my bed, to the table to the floor and drag hte headphones along and they hold up just fine. Plus, they stay in my ears fairly well as long as I'm not being too active."
1467,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I give these 3 stars only, it is OK because the headphones sound quality is not good compared to the previous Sony ones.
Overall Sony is a good brand, but this new headphones the sound is low and not clear at all.
Few years ago I have a black Sony headphones, and the sound was crystal clear and loud but that old model have been discontinued. So I buy this new model one, and I was not very happy, but I am not complaining since it is only $8.
So if you looking for cheap headphones and just OK quality, then buy this."
1468,2.0 out of 5 stars,Quite disappointed that Sony makes these not-impressive headphones. I purchased 2. The design is cool but the sound is not that great and one of them broke after using it for 3 days. I expected more from Sony especially the sound delivery.
1469,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is what you would expect from a sub ten dollar ear bud. To be fare, these are not really buds, they don't go inside your ear canal, they sit inside your ear. I guess if I could give them 3.5 stars that would be more accurate."
1470,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's so hard to find this ""classic"" style anymore, and these are great. Sony is a reliable brand, always."
1471,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to the older fontopia designs, the sound on these SUCKS. The frequency response is lousy in comparison to the old MDRE 818 or 828 series. There's nowhere enough bass, and the higher registers sound tinny and flat."
1472,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have always loved these earbuds, ever since I got my first pair over 12 years ago. They dont have a mic but fit perfectly in my ear, if I ever won the lottery I'd buy a case lol."
1473,5.0 out of 5 stars,I searched far and wide for these headphones because they are the only kind I use. I love purple it's my favorite color and the sound that comes out of these headphones are so clear. These are really GREAT quality headphones.
1474,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good deal. Not top notch, but good for the price."
1475,5.0 out of 5 stars,Soo cheap but such good quality. Bought these for a wick substitute for my iPhone headphones for listening to music and glad to say they do the job well.
1476,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I chose these as they are not of the highest quality, but certainly not the lowest. Sony earphones always sound very good. The only factor unknown is how durable they are and how long they will last. Time will tell. I recommend buying this model/product line."
1478,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would say that for the price, it is a good set of earbuds. If you're buying this and expecting, super high quality sound, then this product isn't for you. However, if you're just looking for some cheap earbuds that meet your basic needs, this is the one for you."
1479,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little ear buds. Work well with my mp3 player.
1480,5.0 out of 5 stars,always a brand of this ear buds. My 4 since I keep running my chair over it...
1481,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been buying these headphones for years. Recently I've been unable to find them in the usual stores I buy them, so I purchased them from Amazon. Same great quality with an even better price!"
1482,5.0 out of 5 stars,my girlfriend likes the classic style I dont really but they do sound clear with a little bass for what they are
1483,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast delivery. True sound: good for monitoring recording. Cord is too thin, don’t know if this last long. Price is ok. Thank you so much."
1484,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice headphones.
1485,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd time purchasing these. I've convinced they're indestructible. I'm unintentionally abusive to my headphones and these stand the test of time. I've used my first pair since 2009.

Plus, the shape of the buds help you figure out which ear to put it in, in the dark."
1486,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound, especially bass, is as good as any 50$ pair. However, gargantuan bud size can't possibly fit any human being."
1487,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are light, fit snugly into my ears, and produce a very nice quality of sound. Exactly what I would expect from Sony and I couldn't be more pleased."
1489,3.0 out of 5 stars,Cord is too long. Dont stay in my ear right. Sound a bit tinny. Cant distinguish left from right easily.
1490,5.0 out of 5 stars,daughter loves
1491,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good quality and excellent sound ..
1492,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked as expected and received on time.
1493,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite earbuds ever. They work great, they don't go too far into your ear, and they can be worn for hours."
1494,1.0 out of 5 stars,Really bad sound. Like a dance hall sound and no base. Had to get other and much better.
1495,5.0 out of 5 stars,i love them they are comfy and works great
1496,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as replacement for Sony MDRE818LP (which I love & are no longer offered) but these have horrible sound, also after a few weeks, one earbud volume is much lower"
1497,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn't work at all. If I could, I'd give it 0 stars. I expected a little more for it being Sony. But I guess you get what you pay for. Go invest into better earphones then some cheapy 5 buck ones."
1498,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Was looking for headphones that replace the apple ones that come with an ipod automatically and found these. Have not been disappointed yet--they stay in my ears fairly easily, yet don't hurt after being in my ears awhile (I've tried other earbuds and they tend to hurt after being in my ears longer than 30mins/1hr). Love the color options and long cords, and the sound quality is excellent as well. Definitely will purchase more of these once/if my current ones break (which hopefully they won't for at least a year or so)."
1500,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product!
1501,2.0 out of 5 stars,They are made for dumbo's ears. If you have small or normal ears you are screwed. You need to play them super loud to hear anything because they're I'll sized.
1502,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice pair that doesn't go heavy on the bass and rests comfortably in my small ears for hours. I keep them in my purse, but have also used them for running since my Bluetooth buds died and the sweat hasn't seemed to bother them."
1503,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Defective out of the box, but not valuable enough to go through the hassle of packaging and shipping for a refund or replacement. Just a waste of time and money."
1504,2.0 out of 5 stars,"not recommend this one, low sound quality and uncomfortable. for this price and this sound quality, i would say this is a waste of money if you are going to buy"
1505,2.0 out of 5 stars,The quality isn't there anymore. :(
1506,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is a complete JUNK! Zero bass and you can barely hear anything. I doubt this is a genuine SONY product. The entire package is in Chinese (except for one or two lines in English) and the quality is poor (nothing like SONY). Very disappointed. Do not buy.
1507,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are cheap earbuds, but the sound quality is mediocre and you can tell they are very cheaply made. not terrible for the price, but there are better build quality ones for the same price."
1508,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Just an OK ear bud, I'm trying to replace some old Sony ear buds I had but that were all hard plastic (like these), but they had better sound than these. A lot of the other Sony ear buds I've bought and tried have a soft plastic piece that covers the speaker that can too easily pop off."
1509,3.0 out of 5 stars,"No bass whatsoever, and the quality is simply okay, but it's nothing special. Won't order again."
1511,5.0 out of 5 stars,Looks really useful!
1512,1.0 out of 5 stars,"0 stars. A waste of $9. Horrible sound (too hot and middle freq heavy), noisy unreliable jack, flimsy wire connections. Just pay more and get something else. Older models much better (e.g. Sony MDR-E828LP)"
1513,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have found that these are a great cheap pair of headphones that sound good for most daily listening. They do not block out any noise, but they play music very clearly and without any distortion. They do not fall out of my ears at all while running."
1514,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds good, breaks easily when dropped, cheap, would recommend to another cheap wad."
1515,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like these kind of ear buds and they are durable and sound good enough. Great price. My kids don't like them because they do not insert into the ear. Thats better for me. They wont use them. ;)
1516,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality could be better but these are great bargain earbud that are very comfortable and small.
1517,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for easy listening, not the best sound quality, but that's not why I bought them."
1518,2.0 out of 5 stars,These ear buds are a notch above airline headphones that are given out. They use the foam covering that is placed over the ear buds that always slide off and the package only comes with one pair so if you lose them like I did you're out of luck. Quality is subpar compared to other cheap headphones I've owned in the past. I would not recommend.
1519,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are the best!! I am still using the pair I bought over 2 years ago!! I purchased this new pair because I could no longer find them in stores. HIGHLY RECOMMEND,FANTASTIC SOUND!!"
1520,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's very difficult to find earphones these days that have good quality sound. These are perfect. Whether you like them or not will depend on your preference for sound. I have tried earphones that people said were great, and found them to be completely unacceptable to me. If you've always liked Sony earphones, these are good."
1522,5.0 out of 5 stars,great for the ear
1523,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They arrived on time, they were as advertised, the person they were for was very pleased"
1524,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know specific about sound quality and am not picky. Was just looking for some headphones with a long cord to use at work to attach to the computer. Does it's job, very light, very comfortable. Would definitely buy again."
1525,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! These headphones really sound bad. They sound like the cheap ear buds you get with a new MP3 player. Like listening over a speaker phone or an AM radio. Unfortunately, they replace the excellent MDR-E818LP which sounded excellent and cost the same"
1526,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They arrived on time, they were as advertised, the person they were for was pleased"
1527,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The last pair of earbuds I had was the Sony MDR E 10LPs. I used those for three years before they broke, and I had gotten them secondhand, so they lasted a long time, with pretty good sound quality. I got these in replacement, but these are nowhere near the 10LPs. When I put them in for the first time the audio sounded tinny and cheap. Then after one week of normal use they broke. Sound wouldn't come out of both ears unless I wiggled and held the cord in just the right spot. Disappointing."
1528,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these at work all the time. Pretty decent sound for the price!
1529,3.0 out of 5 stars,These are a nice pair of airplane grade headphones. Not worth the buy.
1530,4.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay. This heaphones are really basic but it is a good option for those customers who doesn't want to spend a lot of money and they don't mind about the quality of the sound.
1531,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are subpar compared to my old MDRE10LP in terms of comfort, design, and sound quality, but they no longer make the old 10LP's and are too expensive to replace so these would have to do. I only trust 4 brands when it comes to my ear buds - Sony, Creative, Logitech (Hit or a miss) and Toshiba, and for the price of $8.42 these are definitely worth it."
1533,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great, don't fall out of the ears, perfect!!!"
1534,3.0 out of 5 stars,I had no problem with the ear buds. They work fine and the sound quality is good. The material quality does seem a little on the cheap side so I'm not sure how long they will last. hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised and they will last for quite a while - only time will tell though.
1535,5.0 out of 5 stars,As advertised. Prompt delivery.
1536,4.0 out of 5 stars,The cover for the earbuds is quite uncomfortable and thin. They dont stay in place.
1537,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I go through these like crazy. I find that the plug on them isn't super sturdy, so one ear tends to go out pretty quickly. Usually, I just lose them before that happens, so I continue to purchase them."
1538,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I miss the discontinued banana shape of the Sony earbuds, but these worked okay, all things considered. The sound was good, as is standard of Sony, at the very least. I just wish the earbuds weren't so uncomfortable, due to them not being the banana shape. Please, Sony, go back. I miss the bananas. Please make them again.
I do recommend these headphones, though. Sony has yet to fail me in the quality department of headphones, and I shall continue to buy from them for as long as they fail to disappoint."
1539,4.0 out of 5 stars,great product.
1540,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality for the price. I purchased these for my God-Daughter and a pair for me. They are great and still give me great sound!
1541,5.0 out of 5 stars,We have purchased four pairs of these headphones. We keep them in our vehicles and with my gym bag.
1542,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always buy my headphones/earphones from Sony because they are reasonably-priced, the audio quality is great (it's definitely better than Skullcandy), and they last long. I tried every other earphone brand, but they would blow out within months, but when I tried Sony, there was no going back. I use these earbuds a lot and they've lasted me years now."
1544,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound quality
1545,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these little headphones. I always have a pair because they seem to last forever and as clumsy as I am that is important. They work perfectly with my iPhone and laptop and that's all I need.
1546,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are my favorite brand of earbuds. They work great and last for a long time. I like that they come in different colors and for sony theyre at a great price. The only problem i have with them is as time passes You cant hear from one ear.
1547,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not as great quality as these used to be.
1548,1.0 out of 5 stars,"A while back I purchased some Sony headphones almost exactly like these ones. They were perfect, great sound quality and awesome bass for ear buds. I expected as much from these ones, however, there is a huge difference. The sound quality is really poor. I have gone back to using the old ones which have lasted for over 2 years but have exposed wire near the headphone jack. What is really interesting is that I paid more for these ones than I did for my old ones."
1549,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really good souning headphonne. Verry pleased. They stay in my ear verry nice.
1550,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is not what I expected. It is kind if hollow.
I really was expecting a better sound."
1551,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am stupid... I wrote a review saying these headphones sucked because they didn't work with my phone. Turns out there was just a ball of lint in the earphone jack. I am sorry, Sony. I'll go buy a new PS4 game as penance."
1552,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Whenever I am on my computer I wear these. They are the perfect fit. They are hard to find these days, but I love they way they fit in my ear. All of the new headphones just don't fit right.
These are at an awesome price point!"
1553,4.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable fit and decent sound quality. Delivery was fast
1555,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The pair I received only works if it's turned a specific way when plugged into my ipod (you know how headphones/earbuds get finicky when they get old or pulled on, hate that!), started right out of the box. However, I have black pair that works alright, thus the 3 star. Sound is passable when it works. Having only tested two of this kind, I can't really say if it's worth the gamble for the price. Tell me... do you feel lucky?"
1556,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones.... they fit great and sound great.
1557,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had no luck with the in-ear type of earbuds so when my standard Apple earbuds were finally too worn out to use anymore, I decided to try these. They fit well and feel very secure in my ears. Good sound quality and I think they even amp up the bass more than my old Apple earbuds. Great buy for the price!"
1558,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great earbuds.
1559,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones because I had received a similar pair 2 years ago for Christmas as a gift and absolutely loved them. They were cheap, light weight, and had the best sound quality of budget headphones I had ever heard. When I needed another pair to leave at the office I jumped on these because I thought they would have similar qualities. Completely wrong. Although not a bad price point - the sound quality in these is terrible and overall feel of them is much cheaper. Disappointing to see Sony decrease the quality so drastically."
1560,2.0 out of 5 stars,They don't fit in my ears very well and the sound is so poor it's like listening to records in mono. Would not recommend these to anyone.
1561,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the volume on these earplugs . Fits all my need I would recommend these were a great buy.
1562,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these earphones there very loud and don't pop easily! They last very long if you take care of them my have lasted for 3 yrs now and I have even washed them accidently in the washer and they still work. Their inexpensive and came in only 3 days. I highly recommend them to any music lover out their.
1563,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received the Earbuds today and I am being very truthful here, in that I have always been a consumer of Sony products and probably still will purchase them, but these earbuds are just pieces of crap! The sound is like your sitting in a tunnel listening to music. Do not buy this product at all."
1564,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As much as I love these Sony Ear Buds it keeps on breaking every couple of months. I replace these earphones every year sometimes twice a year because the ear buds usually drop on the floor and the plastic piece that goes into the ear just breaks apart. I still end up buying another pair because I love these ear buds. They are very comfortable, unlike other earbuds I don't have to squeeze these earbuds into my small ears. Other ones also make my ear itchy--not sure why--these don't do that. I usually wear mines without the fabric covers that come with it. I just don't like the covers going in my ear something about it just makes my ears feel dirty.

Long story short I broke another pair of these earphones today. Mostly my fault; I'm a savage when it comes to handling these things. I'll be ordering another pair pretty soon."
1566,4.0 out of 5 stars,Got for the wife. She likes these old style headphones not the new in ear kind. Said she liked them.... If she could only find them now.
1567,5.0 out of 5 stars,they last well and produce excellent sound.
1568,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these headphones for quite a few months now and they were awesome for the first month. Just recently though, I realized that the right side head phone speaker was coming out of the bud itself and I had to reconnect and push the plastic back together. It hasn't given me much trouble since then luckily:)"
1569,5.0 out of 5 stars,good sound use them with my portable to watch shows when out of town
1570,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best earbuds out there. I love that they don't stick into my ears as deeply as the trendy styles do. They are a lot more comfortable.
1571,5.0 out of 5 stars,great durable headphones. last pair lasted me over a year. very happy
1572,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After 3 month review, it has good sound but sometimes the ear caps come off."
1573,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these while I ride my bike around town and they're comfortable, look good, and put out decent enough sound for while I'm riding."
1574,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Comparing these to my old Gummy ear buds I used to purchase before trying these ones out I can surely say that these Sony ear buds are far more inferior. The sound quality is very poor, they feel extremely cheap, and are not comfortable. After only a month or so the left ear bud lost most of the sound. Will not be buying these again."
1575,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound for the price! Fairly durable too; I ordered mine about a year ago and they are still functioning as they did when I took them out of the box despite the abuse of coming in and out of my pockets.
1577,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Surprisingly clear and crisp sound. I'm an avid podcast / radio listener and a lot of times the high-end in-ear headphones make voices sound muffled. With these headphones, I got consistent, sharp audio and I now use them primarily for my day to day use. And if you switch over to music, they're just as good, if not better, than iPhone earbuds, except those cost 3 times as much as these.
If you're looking for headphones that do more than just get the job done but don't want to spend a lot of money for features you won't even notice, these headphones are your best bet.
**Note, I've had these headphones and my apple ones for the same about of time, and the Apple ones have already torn, while these Sony earbuds are still like new!"
1578,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been using these for years for cycling and running. They are not noise cancelling which is important when on the roads riding or running. Too many people zone out with headphones and don't pay attention to traffic. A great way to get killed. The sound is decent for a low priced wired headset. Sure, I have to replace them alot, I just toss them anywhere and they only last so long but for 8 bucks what do you expect?"
1579,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used a Sony Walkman small AM/FM (SRF-M37W) radio for 20 years - earlier versions even had TV channels (audio only) and I prefer the SOny earbuds - no foam covering and not stuffed into your ear.

This version however breaks the FIRST time the earbud hits the ground and then it time for superglue - since I'm wearing the hip radio the wire regularly snags on a drawer knob the dog paw, whatever, but when the ear bud hits the ground the cover and the bud are separated.

Even with superglue getting a fix is tough. Looking for alternatives. Oh - forget trying to get through to Customer Service."
1580,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, these are really, really cheap. They claim ""powerful base on the go"" but this is not correct. NO BASE at all... Very weak sounding, actually. The sound is very thin, if that makes any sense. The closest thing I can compare them to is the headphones that are passed out for free, on airline flights. The really cheap, no name brands. Thus, I would certainly expect more from Sony! My previous pair were Sony MDR-E828LP, which were great. Thus, I went back to the Sony name thinking they would again offer a great product. But, these aren't near as good as their predecessor. Now, I get they are sub $10 headphones, so what do you expect? I guess something that offers semi-decent sound quality. The pros, if there are any, are in the cord length, the ear comfort, and the price. But, to me, the sound quality is so poor they are just not even worthy of purchase. I'm currently listening to the $10 Apple pair of OEM EarPod headphones & these are much better than this Sony inferior product."
1581,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my favorite pair of cheap earbuds. They're very comfortable and the sound is very clear. They last way longer than other earbuds. I think it has something to do with the bent input jack. It's not sticking straight out so the point where the hard connector and bendy wire meet doesn't get as much stress.
These don't go inside your ear so it doesn't block out a lot of noise. Good for when I'm working and still need to be aware of people around me."
1582,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are great for the price. As a mom of preteens things like this tend to disappear. Well, for Sony ear buds for under $10 I can start stash them in a drawer or in my car and don't mind if one of my children snags them. Plus they sound great, have a well designed plug, and are comfortable to wear! The quality is almost on par with the expensive ones my Galaxy S8 came with. I'll definitely be buying again if they get lost."
1583,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I rarely give a 1 star on anything, but I am very disappointed in these earbuds. I've previously owned Sony MDRE828LP and MDR-E818LP, and pretty much all aspects of these are worse.

- sound quality is very tinny and a bit muffled - a huge decrease in quality compared to those other models.The fidelity is what I'd expect from a free pair of earbuds that comes with a cheap phone.
- The size of the speaker is smaller, and thus, a very loose fit in the ear. If you are moving around at all, it requires constant re-adjustment.
- The wire gauge and weight of the buds is less - cheaper construction and cheaper feel.

I bought these to replace my 828's that I wear running 2-3 times per week, which finally died after 3 years, and I simply can't stand the sound quality on these new ones. Maybe worse, the fit/weight makes them pop out of my ears constantly while running. Thus begins a new search for quality earbuds..."
1584,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this type of Sony earbud for years for working out and jogging but lost them... I bought this type again because it's the best sound quality I've heard for an earbud. These newer ones are a lot more flimsy. The sound quality is still good, but the plug itself broke when the cord was pulled as my phone fell out of my pocket (only once) and now they don't work properly. My old ones went through rougher treatment, being pulled at countless times, and nothing like this ever happened. I give these 5 stars for sound quality (for an earbud) 0 stars for durability."
1585,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had these headphones previously and they lasted a really long time until they recently didn't work anymore. So instead of going to the store like Best Buy where I had purchased my old ones, I took the chance of getting them through Amazon. I was a little skeptical after I bought them because I made sure the model matched the same as my old ones, and I did not want to have a problem when I use the new ones since this is the only type of headphones I really like for myself. Luckily they were exactly like my old ones after I received them today in the mail and they work perfectly!"
1586,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband bought a brand for me for Christmas and gave them to me early and I hated them. They would not stay in my ears. The little pads kept coming off and the sound sucked as I would be listening and realize that one wasn't in my ear then I could barely hear the sound anyway. So for my after Christmas present to myself I did some reading and decided to purchase these Sony ear buds. I rarely listen to music except to try out excerpts of cd's on Amazon but they sounded amazing to me. Mostly I use these with my laptop for Netflix viewing and they are great. I did listen to my new Chris Isaak cd and it sounded so good but then he sounds good....what can i say. Anyway, so far I really happy with this purchase and would get them again."
1588,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After using several pairs of the JVC Gumy earbuds I tried this pair from Sony. The Sony pair look and feel about the same and sell for about the same price, but the sound is much muddier. By turning the treble and bass way up and the midrange way down, the Sonys can approximate the sound of the Gumys but they still don't sound quite as good.

More positively, the Sonys have an L-shaped connector which might survive longer than the Gumy's straight connector when connected to an iPod that's constantly tumbling in a runner's pocket."
1589,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Terribly uncomfortable for my ears. And if you move, at all ... they fall out."
1590,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is great. After 6 months still working worth buying it
1591,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones! Sound is crisp and clear. I love how these ear buds don't have rubber around the speakers- to me it is much more comfortable and the buds don't slide out as much. Amazing price online too- in the store these were almost $15. Not to mention how they look; they are very stylish and comfortable.
1592,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound!
1593,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sony headphones - as expected. Came in original packaging and correct color as ordered. 10/10 satisfied. Definitely going to purchase a second set in the future.
1594,5.0 out of 5 stars,great price great gift.
1595,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product as advertised
1596,5.0 out of 5 stars,A++
1597,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sony is class. Time and time again they deliver products with amazing quality and durabilty. The pair I recieved seems to have a problem with the right earphone so Ill check with amazon about that. But they are comfortable and a great fit for the athletic types.
1599,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was looking for a cheep set of earbuds to keep at work. Since i only listen to music on a low volume at work i was not looking for anything high end and in the past Sony has been a great option. But i was very disappointed in these headphones. they sound very cheep and there is no richness or any bass to the music at all. i used them for only a few min and have yet to use them again and may give them to the kids to use.
1600,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I know these are cheap headphones, but they fit pretty poorly even for their price. The sound is also overly can-y. There's nothing to bad with them per se, but they could have at least given them a better fit. You get what you pay for though."
1601,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As good as any earbuds I have had in the past. Actually I was surprised how good they are. I'm sure there are more expensive ones, but these serve my purpose on the workout equipment at the YMCA."
1602,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These r great! I'm using them as I write this actually. The sound quality and the comfort is absolutely great! I was planning on using these as a replacement if my headphones broke, but now I'm actually using them more than I thought!"
1603,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Also, they've lasted me noticeably longer than most earbuds I've bought."
1604,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I dropped my old sony pair in my coffee. I saw these sony ones that are supposed to be the ""newer"" model of my old ones. While I waited for these to arrive, my coworker gave me a free pair that she got from her flight. It was so horrible I couldn't stand listening to my music longer than 30 seconds. Once I got these sony ones in the mail I was so excited to try them. The base in my music is gone. It's only a little bit better than the pair my coworker gave me. A bit more comfortable; a bit better sound quality since it doesn't have that much static noise. I would be impressed if I got this pair for free, but not for the price I paid for."
1605,4.0 out of 5 stars,I really like theses but prefer SONY MDR-E10LP Earbuds because of the shape. They fit me ears better but the sound quality is very good on both. It's just a matter of personal taste.
1606,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound of this little ear buds is phenomenal! The downside, they often go missing. Everyone wants to borrow them."
1607,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had one of these headphones before and they worked very well, even when they are forcefully unplugged that would break other headphones. I already had a pair before ordering these but lost them, just I got another pair. Although then I found my old pair so now I have two."
1608,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good cheap ear buds with acceptable audio quality. When I listen to music with these ear buds, it sounds the same to me when I listen to it other ear buds or headsets."
1610,3.0 out of 5 stars,The last pair of Sony earbuds are purchased had fantastic base. These do not.
1611,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using this style for years. It's my go-to earbud
1612,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gave them to my kids who said they work just fine.
1613,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are comfortable and have great sound-throw out the ones that came with your Iphone/touch and get these instead. We'll have to wait and see how long they last-

Update to my previous review. I lost these outside, about a month ago. I live in the Boston area and we have had a ton of snow and below zero weather etc. Yesterday I found them hanging from a shrub in my yard, they had been outside all this time. They worked perfectly, despite being in snow, sleet, rain, below zero temps etc. Amazing!"
1614,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is a little tinny and there's not a whole lot of base for it, but I use these to walk to and from my apartment to campus and running on occasion, so it works fine for me. I really like the packaging - very easy to pull the headphones out of the package. They also come with two foam earpiece coverings which I thought was nice."
1615,5.0 out of 5 stars,aye
1616,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price one of the best ear buds you can buy. The foam is really comfortable and even without it it's very comfortable. The one problem I've found is that where the wire goes into the jack the metal wire can start to show, but its a quick fix with some crazy glue."
1617,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is poor. Far from what I expected. Even much worse than my old MDR-E828.
1618,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not Worth the Purchase
1619,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I purchased this ear-buds, I wanted something comfortable to wear for long periods of times. As stated in my title it produces/gives good audio (nothing amazing or life-altering) but better than other similarly priced ear-buds. I own the Panasonic RP-HV21-K In-Ear Earbud Heaphones with Built-in Clip (Black)and they are SUPER uncomfortable, in fact wearing them for long periods of time eventually causes my ear (specifically the ""concha"" area).

So if you're looking for something comfortable that provides you the privacy to enjoy your tunes, look no further."
1621,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mom likes very much.
1622,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very loud with not too much bass reflex which is perfect for riding with, as wind speed clouds out most of the sound and bass just makes it worse, but these seem to get around that. Very durable as i've had some pretty nasty bails and these got yanked and janked all around but no rippage whatsoever, no sound shortage or anything wrong, only way I would buy these again is if I lose them cause that's the only way I'd need to."
1623,3.0 out of 5 stars,no issues
1624,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered these in 2014 and they still work perfectly 4 years later
1625,5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter uses these a lot!
1626,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are coming into this product from a headphone user's perspective, be prepared for dissapointment. I wanted earphones to take around anywhere to listen to music with, It is alright for youtube videos but the sound is so tinny and mono. I don't have high standards for earphones but i'd honestly go with apple earphones over this super cheap product"
1627,5.0 out of 5 stars,I keep losing my earphones but I always buy these kinds because they never fall out of my ears. The jelly ear phones are never snug and fall out whenever I move no matter which size I put in but these ear phones are my go to. I hear everything clearly and they come in nice colors
1628,2.0 out of 5 stars,These earbuds fit very well in my ears but when I they started to play music the music was so muffeled and had no bass at all. So disappointed. Save your 8 dollars on some apple earbuds.
1629,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these headphones for years and I love them. Obviously there are higher quality ones out there but these work great for me. I usually end up having to replace them every 1.5-2 years -- I think one pair lasted me 3 -- because eventually one bud stops working (always the right side, I've noticed), but considering they're only $10 and I use them for hours every day, I don't think that's bad at all.

I've seen a few reviews mention the sound being too low but I actually have the opposite problem; I usually have to turn the sound down on my devices to the lowest possible volume because of how LOUD it is."
1630,4.0 out of 5 stars,OK; they fall out with minor head movement.
1632,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband is very happy that these are still made. He can listen to sports while working in the yard.
1633,5.0 out of 5 stars,my son says these are some of the best earplugs he has used.
1634,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect! I have really tiny ears (for an adult)! These are the only headphones that fit comfortably--I can't do the ear-bud thing. Fast shipping. Arrived sooner than expected. Thank you!
1635,3.0 out of 5 stars,"sound quality was okay, but they are not as comfortably fitting as some other earbuds."
1636,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use them for home transcription all the time, great buy."
1637,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great bargain and Sony helloo. This is my 2nd pair one for the office and one for personal use . I have standard sized ears and they fit well my 12 year old on the other hand has discomfort and prefers the apple headphones..
1638,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome earphones for 11 bucks definitely worth the money
1639,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sony earbuds are great! They are a very pretty light blue and they sound very good, no static or distortion even all the way up loud!"
1640,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've bought these headphones once before from a local store and they were my favorite! The quality was great and they lasted such a long time until my cat ripped them apart. I thought I would try them again and I am very happy with my order. Highly recommended!
1641,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality, good sound."
1643,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these sony ear buds (black) like 3 years ago, and i pulled the wire a little too hard and the left ear works not the right, but they were pretty good while they lasted. And all this time i have been using other headphones/earbuds and they were okay, good sound, but comfort not really. I wanted small earbuds so, I decided to buy these again and they are great! Good sound and comfortable and cool color. I would recommend these earbuds to anyone who needs a pair, and anyone who travels or does daily errands and want to listen to music."
1644,5.0 out of 5 stars,good product
1645,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke after a few days
1646,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful. Tinny. Worse than the sound from the 9v transistor radio I had when I was a kid.
1647,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality product, delivered on time as described."
1648,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually don't take the time to write reviews, but I was so upset at the quality of these I had to. They are cheap, but they should be an upgrade to the stock ones you very with most cell phones. They sounded like crap! No bass at all! Couldn't belive the difference of sound quality in comparison to regular stock headphones you would get with a cell phone. Sony, you disapoint!"
1649,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They fell apart within a couple of months, very unsatisfactory!"
1650,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great ear buds, but don't last at all. I haven't had them that long when one of the buds goes out."
1651,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product.
1652,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Still have these headphones after almost 3 years. Love the length of the wires, as they allow me to workout without getting unplugged."
1654,5.0 out of 5 stars,"nothing to complain about! great price, great sound, great fit"
1655,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Product delivered was a knockoff. Arrived in a generic plastic pouch, not from Sony. Too cheap to return. Just buyer beware. You get what you pay for. Wait, I didn't even get that. Should get no stars."
1656,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these because the other style of earbuds do not fit in my ears. These are excellent and stay in during long and hard cardio workouts. The sounds quality is great and I love the color. I will buy these again in the future if I lose my current 2 pairs.
1657,5.0 out of 5 stars,cute and perform well. nothing fancy
1658,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Headphones, very happy with purchase. Fits very comfortably in my ears, quality of sound is great. Bought 2 sets of headphones, one I keep at home and one I keep in my car."
1659,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a music enthusiast and enjoy listening to all types. These ear buds are not study quality. However for $10 they are more than you could expect. I don't like the ear buds that go deep into your ears and have a silicon ring to cancel out noise because it is uncomfortable for me. I also don't like big headphones at the gym. These are a perfect little solution and have a decent sound quality. You can easily replace them if they get lost.
1660,5.0 out of 5 stars,purchased these as a gift for someone who uses them all day at work. They love them and the ear buds are small enough to be comfortable all day.
1661,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For as cheap as these are, they last a surprising amount of time. I've been using these for years, and when a pair does break I don't hesitate to buy another pair to replace them."
1662,2.0 out of 5 stars,The first time I used them they cut out in both ears. It's happened a few times since I bought them a week ago. Thing is I love the tip of the earphones as the customizable ones that keep sound out never fit and always hurt so it's difficult for me to find earphones like these that are quality to begin with.
1663,3.0 out of 5 stars,"works ok, but not impressed with sound quality."
1665,5.0 out of 5 stars,comfortable and pretty color
1666,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They're cheap, but I keep getting them because they work. They're comfortable and they sound ok."
1667,5.0 out of 5 stars,"EXCELLENT!

PHL SK"
1668,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Seeing the name ""Sony"" I expected a decent product. To be clear - for the price, I was not expecting miracles. However these earbuds had NO low end whatsoever! To be sure, I switched back to an ""emergency pair"" I keep & the bass end was there; switched back to the Sony pair & it was like someone sucked the entire low end out of the sound spectrum. I am not an audiophile, just someone who wants a decent product that will let me listen to my music like it was created. These severely disappoint!"
1669,4.0 out of 5 stars,Just recently took these out and it's still working...bought them about 2 years ago...not bad for the price.
1670,5.0 out of 5 stars,it doesn't fall off like other ear bud and love it.
1671,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the older dicontinued ear bud design of these a bit better than the current, but I like the cord is slightly longer than other standard headphones - it allows me to plug them into my monitor/PC and not have to sit super close to the monitor."
1672,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You will be impressed by these very reasonably priced earbuds. no more looking for uncomfortable, overpriced earbuds."
1673,1.0 out of 5 stars,"these truly SUCK ! do not buy these ! only a small child would like them,,,,,no high""s,,,no mid-range,,,,,no bass,,,,,worthless ! save your money,,,,,,"
1674,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is actually my 2nd pair. I had a pink pair that I use with my laptop. Needed another pair to use with my Kindle. These are great earbuds!!
1676,5.0 out of 5 stars,They were good while they lasted. I used them everyday at the gym and tossed them in a bag. Not too many headphones would manage as well. The sound is good for the price. They fit in your ear well and stay in well. They get loud enough to block out the gym speakers with their terrible music. That's all that I was really looking for.
1677,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sounds from these ear buds is pretty good, but I do a lot of running and walking and the speakers inside the ear buds are loose. It is very annoying to hear the click, clank, click all the time. If you are buying these just to sit at a desk or something, these are great! Not so much for being active. Buy something else."
1678,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, crisp and clear with a deep bass"
1679,5.0 out of 5 stars,Liked it.
1680,5.0 out of 5 stars,arrived quickly and were brand new. I cannot judge the sound quality as I am used to larger headphones.
1681,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to the price i thought it wouldn't be as cheap quality, its very weak and you can hear the breaking of the sound through the headphones and sometimes one headphone doesn't work and you always need to have two headphones on to hear what your hearing, i could have got a better headphone at the store."
1682,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Would not recommend. Problems with crackling and sound going out of one earbud or the other on first use. Might work okay if you're not moving, but if you are moving at all, the sound goes in and out."
1683,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the this Sony earbud since day one, I never had a problem i know exactly how it feels and sound... but this one feel cheap and it stop working after a month i had to buy another one from local retail store"
1684,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these ear-buds for almost a year now and they work like new! I'm an avid music-lover so naturally i needed these. the sound quality is ok, i can change the sound on my ipod (EQualizer). They're long-lasting, i listen to my ipod almost everyday for a few hours (i also hook them up to my computer). Will purchase again when I need a replacement."
1685,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted me a long time
1687,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good and didn't work very long BF it broke
1688,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used 3 times and one ear piece is already not working properly.
1689,1.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones have static and the music fades in and out I believe they have a short in them . Always trusted a Sony product .....very dissatisfied.
1690,5.0 out of 5 stars,work great
1691,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not believe these are a Sony product. The sound quality was terrible, no bass whatsoever. The wires are super thin and the FIRST time I tired to use them, the plug had a bad connection where one bud would go in and out. Basically these are junk. If this is a legitimate Sony product then shame on them."
1692,5.0 out of 5 stars,love it
1693,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always return to this product. I love it. I was in a van traveling with my teammates, blasting music through these earphones. A teammate turned around and told me that it is as loud as his Beats by Dre headphones."
1694,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They arrived promptly and sounded good. I was very pleased with the headphones until this afternoon, just shy of a month after receiving them, when the left earbud stopped working. There's a difference between ""inexpensive"" and ""cheap"". These turned out to be the latter."
1695,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have small ears and these work great
1696,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Headphones ever... My ears have never loved another as they do these fashion buds! I should have got more of them since its hard to find in stores. Great buy!
1698,5.0 out of 5 stars,Slightly smaller than standard earbuds and perfectly fit inside my small ears. They do not fall out while on the treadmill or walking around which is wonderful! Worth every penny and the sound quality is far better than my old earbuds. Will buy again when these wear out.
1699,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a huge fan of the Sony Mdr-E10Lp earbuds but those sadly were lost in a move. I bought these as a replacement and they are not quite the same (not quite as comfortable and I think the E10Lp had better sound) but they are adequate for podcasting and casual music listening at my desk job. I have now bought several pairs and they are definitely still better than the equivalent JVC earbuds I picked up in a store. Still cheap enough that I didn't feel like I was breaking the bank to buy extra pairs to leave at home, work, etc. Thumbs up."
1700,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you like to have multiple earbuds around the house, in the car, at work, etc. you can't go wrong with these. Had a minor problem that seller took care of immediately. Would purchase this product again and would purchase from this vendor again. Excellent experience."
1701,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The audio quality from these earbuds is terrible. After Sony discontinued the MDR-E828LP, my favorite inexpensive earbuds, I bought these thinking that they would be of similar quality to the MDR-E828LP. Not even close. The bass on the MDR-E828LP is great considering that they are earbuds. The bass on the MDRE9LP is practically nonexistent, and they have this hollow/boxy sound that is just not pleasant to listen to. After suffering with them for 5 months, I was able to purchase 10 sets of refurbished MDR-E828LP earbuds. These will last me for a while, hopefully long enough for Sony to actually improve on the MDR-E828LP rather than put out something vastly inferior. I tested them just now, and the difference between the MDR-E828LP and MDRE9LP is incredible. I find it hard to believe that Sony would put its name on garbage like the MDRE9LP. Avoid these at all costs."
1702,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to replace my dead—and recently discontinued—Sony MDRE828LP ear buds, thinking they would be a close match, and perhaps even an evolution of the old design. (The MDRE828LP had insanely good bass for the size and clear, crisp treble and midrange sound. And at the time, they were only $5.) The shape of my ears makes high-end, rubbery, noise-canceling ear buds a no-go; I much prefer these type of ear buds.

I was sadly very mistaken. These are horrible. Mushy, muffled sound, like having cotton in your ears. No bass. Tinny. Not to mention the shape, which is uncomfortable and chunky. Unlike the old ones, these are cheap crap quality to go with the cheap price. For music, the sound is honestly unbearable. I ended up giving these away to Goodwill immediately."
1703,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Shockingly bad, even for the paltry eight bucks I paid for them. You can check my reviews; I can't stand super-negative, shrill reviews based on some personal issue the reviewer has with a product. But the sound quality of these buds were, to my ears, terrible--as in no redeeming value even at the very low price point. I've had Sony ear buds before, and loved them (till they ultimately shorted out after a reasonable period of time). I'm surprised Sony would put its name on these. I knew things were not good when I opened the box and the package said ""Fashion Earphones"" or some such. Luckily, I also ordered the Edifier H180 Hi-Fi Stereo Earbuds at the same time. For a few extra bucks, these buds deliver significantly better sound quality. In short, if you're looking to upgrade your listening experience from . . . well anything, keep moving."
1704,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I chose these as the previous generation of Sony ear buds were my favourite. These stay in just fine when I'm jogging and I have used them about 15 times already. The only complaint I have is that the previous generation had curved pieces (arms for lack of a better term) that i could identify SIMPLY BY FEEL as left and right. These new ear buds have an ""L"" and an ""R"" indicating left and right, but you actually have to look at them each time. Soon enough, I'm sure the letters will wear off and it will be left to trial and error to see if I can get them in the appropriate ears. Aside from that one small item, these ear buds are great. Good value, good sound, good fit and durable."
1705,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It does make sound. It does so not so much better than 99 cents store headphone, but cost 8 times more. I use it to replace a earphone for TV series watched on IPAD. I want it to be small so I can sleep with it. Sound wise, it is much worse than a 20 years ago SONY headphone with similar design. It is light-years away from its own MDR-V6."
1706,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are not the super bass ear buds you want to jam tunes with at the gym! But they are well balanced, durable and work well with my Kindle and Android phone when I'm watching Netflix or listening to Podcasts. Sony makes a good product, comfortable even without the spongy ear covers, and if I fall asleep with these in, and they are comfortable enough to do this, they won't tear out of my ears rolling over or break off at the wire connectors. The price was outstanding, the product is tough and works well for many sound applications, just don't expect to use them for outstanding music reproduction. There are better ear buds for that but they will cost about 10 times as much."
1707,2.0 out of 5 stars,"What a difference of sound from the Sony MDRE828LP. Barely any bass unless I squeeze them deep inside my ears. The cords are thin and feels very flimsy. I'm sure I'll tear them easily and soon! :( Sounds worst than the Apple ones. I listen to a lot of electronic, ambient like Moby, also ASMR videos where I need to ""feel"" the sound/music and this is not working for my preferences. What a disappointment. No wonder the Sony MDRE828LP cost $30 + nowadays. I'm afraid it's worth the price! Good for audio books though."
1709,5.0 out of 5 stars,They last a long time i still have mine i got them a year ago
1710,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So lots of folks have said great things about these. One review mentioned lack of base which is true. If you are an audio-book person these will do however, for music they sound like a fish bowl :-("
1711,1.0 out of 5 stars,When I got them the left side was only working.
1712,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought these same headphones on multiple occasions and they have lasted about 3-4 years a piece. Considering one wrong tug on most ear buds will cause one to stop functioning, these have performed the best for the price and my constant usage of them."
1713,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things are still going, 8 months strong. I am amazed."
1714,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm using these as I type this review. They are better than the 5 year old ear buds I had on my MP3 player.
1715,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these earbuds, i can wear them for hours without them hurting like those new apple earbuds that come with there phones."
1716,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just as advertized. These replace the same product which stopped working after several years. My son likes these best because they fit his ears best. Glad they were still available.
1717,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this style of ear bud rather than the ones that seal into your ear.
1718,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always buy these earbud headphones from Sony because they work great, sit comfortably in my ears, and last a long time if you take care of them. My last set lasted about three years of continuous use. Colors are fun, too. Good buy."
1720,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony used to make these earbuds that looked almost identical to this but have shrunk them or something. The old ones, called Sony Fashion Earbuds are perfect, but these constantly fall out of my ears and are uncomfortable to use. I feel like I have to keep pushing them into my ear and it is downright impossible to jog with these in."
1721,4.0 out of 5 stars,ordered for my wife. She claims they work fine and no issues major issues. She has claimed they can be a bit uncomfortable after long periods of wear.
1722,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you need a headphone that plays sound yea their fine. If you need a headphone that has good quality these are not the ones for you. The vocals are raspy and the bass in non-existent. If I were you, spend the money for good earbuds."
1723,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've always used these types of earphones. I just have a bad habit of losing them. The sound quality is great and they fit pretty well. They're pretty sturdy too. ^^
1724,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are the only ones my 15 yr old will wear. He likes the feel of them and for the low price-they're a great value.
1725,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable! They stay in my ears well too.

However, seven months later one bud stopped working. I would expect more from Sony. Thanks Sony..."
1726,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Perform exactly as priced.
Sound quality at barely acceptable level. Basses are tiny, High's are distorted.
At the same time solid construction without obvious problems. Probably will last for reasonable period of time.
Ok for daily Audiobook listening, nothing more.

Not recommended for high quality music listening."
1727,2.0 out of 5 stars,"well !!! i ordered the 2 earphones , other was panasonic RPHV21, and this earphone just nowhere stands infront of it. For similar price Panasonis is the best pick. Its a shame on the Brand name of Sony..."
1728,4.0 out of 5 stars,They work great. satisfied
1729,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is very poor. Pretty disappointed even though I knew I wasn't buying high quality, other reviews had me believing sound was better than expected...it is not."
1731,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I subscribe to a wide variety of daily and weekly podcasts and I am constantly walking around with earbuds on. I'm sure that listening to podcasts constantly instead of loud music is better for my eardrums but it is murder on the earbuds. I have probably bought more earbuds in the last five years than five people buy in a lifetime. Since I have an Apple Nano and an iPod Touch, I was buying Apple OEM and replacement earbuds. I would buy twelve or fifteen at a time. The problem was that the earbuds might last only a week before either one side or both stopped working.

I bought a pair of these Sony earbuds a few days before Thanksgiving at a local discount store. It is now the end of January and the earbuds are still working like the day they came out of the store. And yes, they have been put through the wringer.
The sound is better than the cheaper Chinese Apple replacements, but what really seems to set these earbuds apart is the way they are constructed. The wire connections to the earbuds and the plug seem much stronger and more durable than the Apple design.
I would definitely recommend this product."
1732,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these earbuds! I take them on jogs with me all the time and the sound quality is pretty good. In the 5/6 years I've been buying them, I've never had a pair break. Definitely worth the $8."
1733,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I rate it 5 star for comfortability.

-Does not fall out of the ear
-its light
-over 8 hour use still comfortable. does not hurt your ears.
-You do get the sweaty ear feeling from head phones.
-Sounds good enough for the low price.
-The ear sponge earpad may get a little tricky to get it on the earplugs, but once you get it on its very very soft."
1734,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ive been using regular earbuds everyday at work for two years, caused priblems with ears. They were impacted from the reg earbuds. These solved that priblem and rest in the ear very comfy and sound is great."
1735,5.0 out of 5 stars,These last me a long time and have good sound quality. The only ear buds I will use.
1736,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I think I've already reviewed these headphones for another seller, but they really are great. They're super basic headphones, but, they always last me a while, and they're good quality for the price. Nothing special, they just work."
1737,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter liked it, actually it was for her, she is happy with them because they are a good fit for her ears."
1738,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones for your buck
1739,4.0 out of 5 stars,The right earbud stopped working after 3 months but worked well until then. I was really rough on them and would fall asleep with them in my ear while facetiming all night. That's why it broke after 3 months
1740,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Both earbuds arrived completely severed from the cord. And no, I did not cut them in the process of opening the package."
1742,5.0 out of 5 stars,2nd time I've purchased these headphones. They're awesome! I hate the in ear ones and prefer this style instead. I can hardly find these in store anymore.
1743,5.0 out of 5 stars,excelente producto 100% recomendado
1744,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earbuds are inexpensive and I wasn't sure what quality to expect. I have bought Sony products over the years and always liked them. So I thought I'd try these and I was pleasantly surprised. The sound is crisp and clear with a nice bass tone. I'd recommend these to anyone who doesn't want to pay alot but wants good sounding earbuds.
1745,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound and fit. I've gotten the 100$ ear buds and they didn't last long
1746,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely you can tell the different between this and a good pair of ear buds, however for your buck, it's pretty good. Feels like cheap plastic but I'm not complaining about that for the price."
1747,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These Sony earbuds sound good. They are better than the ones that were provided with my new Walkman. Sadly, they are too large for my ear canals, which makes them uncomfortable, and I frequently have to readjust them. If these were smaller, they would be perfect for me. The wires are cumbersome, which is true for all earbuds. I keep hoping for wireless--maybe someday soon. If you have larger ear canals, and want decent sound, these are a good choice at a reasonable price."
1748,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones! I love this brand of headphones.
1749,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Cute and cheap, but falls apart very, very easily. They usually last me three or so months before they completely fall apart. The longest I've had them last is 6 months. :("
1750,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sound out of a small set of ear buds. Absolutely love them. Nice price.
1751,2.0 out of 5 stars,The second time I used it the left earbud fell apart. It still works because the wires were still intact but I don't expect much going forward. For the time being I will continue to use it as I pushed the whole thing back together. It's poorly constructed.
1753,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap but I love it.
1754,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
1755,3.0 out of 5 stars,it came to me pretty fast. coming out of the box it sounded a little staticky. have to play with It a lil to adjust the sound. so I'm already skeptical about the durability of this merchandise. But it seems to work well for now. may get some backup headsets later on down the line. No Mic
1756,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These arrived faster than I expected them to, they look exactly as they do in the picture. I owned a pair of these previously for a couple of years before one of the ear buds stopped working. As long as you don't just throw them around and you take care of them they will last you a while. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
1757,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality is similar for about 1/3 of the price...I order 2-3 at a time. Mine last for a year, but my kids go thru them faster..."
1758,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice
1759,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality for the price and size
1760,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for a little while, but didn't last long."
1761,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I know is a very cheap product but being Sony I expected more quality, I have some white level brand from China and they sound the same. In the past there was some difference in terms of quality between Sony and any other Chinese brand, now it's the same."
1762,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works okay, but would be better if they were ""no tangle"" wires."
1764,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is terrible though. Like everyone said, it is very ""tinny"". I didn't know I ordered the wrong pairs. The older model is a lot better."
1765,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They stop working the same day I got them, I know you got what you paid for but, 3 hrs after that is unacceptable"
1766,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best in class: small, cheap, great fit and packed w/sound. I have a few pairs for the car, the gym bag, work, etc. They stay in my ears, unlike the newer bud types that are just cylinders."
1767,5.0 out of 5 stars,"got it for my mom, she uses them everyday with no complaints"
1768,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really good sound quality earbuds, which I expect from Sony. I have a little trouble with them falling out of my ears while I am on the treadmill."
1769,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, but poor sound...cheap feel."
1770,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked fairly well for a while but soon one of the buds only worked half the time. I ended up throwing them and going with a superior Skullcandy product. I will not purchase again.
1771,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sound good but to small for a man's hands
1772,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using the same ear buds for three years with no issues. Not too shabby for $10.
1773,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love them!!! the color, sound, packaging w the soft cushion. :)"
1775,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved these until the plastic end of one of the buds twisted off and no longer works. I may order again because they fit in my ear well, even while jogging, and worked fine until the one bud broke."
1776,1.0 out of 5 stars,They don't stay in your ears.
1777,2.0 out of 5 stars,They don't sit well in my ears and while I'm riding my bike the holes on the outside catch the sound of the wind and I can't hear anything. Some may say that's just riding the bike but I've had other head phones that work much better and am currently just using the head phones that came with my HTC 1 phone and they work much better.
1778,3.0 out of 5 stars,These are good for the price but the sound quality isn't very good. Also they are a bit uncomfortable for long term wear.
1779,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used this particular model of Sony earbuds for years and had not one complaint. They normally last so long, I would not need to order another pair for at least a year or so. The order I received last week? HORRIBLE! I'm not sure if I got a bum pair, but the sound quality is barely audible. What I do hear is scratchy with no bass at all. I thought it might just be my computer (which I've never experienced a problem before with this pair of earphones), but it sounds the same way connected to my Sony Mp3 player. DISGUSTING! I'm not sure if it may have somethign to do with the seller Action Pro (fulfilled by Amazon) or what. I'm pissed because I can't return them; I trusted these earphones so much, I threw the packaging away after deliver. Ugh! Oh well, maybe I'll give it another chance using the sell Audio Plaza (fulfilled by Amazon) and see if there is any difference."
1780,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fit and work well for light or stationary activity, not for high motion though, because they fall out."
1781,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome! Really good sound quality, but the cord is a bit short. Otherwise a great set of ear buds"
1782,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good headphones .
1783,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using these headphones almost exclusively for about 2 years now (several different pairs, since I tend to lose them often) they sound great, last a long time, and are very comfortable (if you add the foam insert that comes with them)

These are the headphones that I usually go running with, and have not had any issues with them falling out."
1784,5.0 out of 5 stars,Around my house we go through headphones at a high rate. These are good quality and are expected to last longer than cheaper brands.
1786,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought it would be used for 4 years as my previous sony headphones were (yeah, they held up that long with constant usage). But, these broke in 2 weeks, I was pissed. Never purchasing sony again, unless they up their game."
1787,5.0 out of 5 stars,"using earbuds on a daily basis, I love this type of earbud"
1788,2.0 out of 5 stars,I was looking for a low-cost replacement for the first generation iPod earbuds and decided to try these. Delivery was great but the product is not a good fit for how I want to use them. They don't fit in my ears very well and for anything active (working out) they just don't stay in. The foam covers they provided don't help with that either.
1789,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear buds are awesome! The base is amazing, and the sound is balanced extremely well! I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a nice pair of ear buds (at a decent price)!"
1790,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great ear buds. This is our 4th pair. They last until one of our pets get a hold of them.
1791,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well balanced, efficient, hear every instrument. Much better than the Panasonic RP-HJE120-PPK"
1792,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stay in ears much better than new style rubber earbuds
1793,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've gone through so many headphones in the past year alone that I was surprised that this pair had lasted a whole two months without becoming quieter or only working in the right earpiece. Even if you accidentally slam the things against something you can easily place the broken piece back on like nothing happened. I had a set of headphones of the same brand before this one and it lasted months longer until one of the earpiece's wiring broke.
This thing is best defined by one word: endurance."
1794,5.0 out of 5 stars,"converts electrical signals into tiny vibrations,.. and thats cool, that is all i really ever wanted..."
1795,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product at a great price!!! I would definately recommend to my friends and family.
1797,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these exact headphones for years, and I love them!! I get them from Amazon because I get such a good deal on them! Always come new and excellent quality packaging, and of course I prefer the sound from these (even over the newest Apple earpods). They fit into my ear very nicely and little groove in them helps keep them in place. Highly recommended for price and quality!!"
1798,3.0 out of 5 stars,Just okay.
1799,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones rarely stay in my ears when I work out but the small Sony ones do and they work great
1800,1.0 out of 5 stars,I've preferred Sony ear buds/headphones.. But over the years I've noticed the quality in their products has dropped. I switched over to the bose headphones. They cost more but at least I don't have to be going through new headphones every 1-2 months.
1801,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap. They sounded OK and are adquately comfortable. But one of the buds cracked in half for no good reason in less than 60 days. Have to buy something else now. Better to pay more and buy a good product.
1802,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter loves these buds. They are well constructed, work great, and colorful! She can find them easier with the green color as she is always misplacing things. Great product!"
1803,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is going to be my 2nd pair, they have good sound, pretty sturdy, but the caps pop off after long term use. I use mine frequently so they go through a lot of wear."
1804,4.0 out of 5 stars,True to size very comfortable.
1805,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my new earbuds - they stay in my ears better than any others I have ever gotten! Highly rec
1806,2.0 out of 5 stars,"No mic? What a joke. I really love my Panasonic ear phones. After it got broken, think about trying something new. No mic, sound quality is not bad but the cords are too thin with cheap feeling. Gonna order the Panasonic one again"
1808,5.0 out of 5 stars,nice sound
1809,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sony has the best quality earbuds for the price. The sound is very clear and has very good base.
1810,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This item sounds terrible. Also, this has very weak bass sound. Do not buy this. This item is not eligible for return."
1811,5.0 out of 5 stars,"these are literally the best pair I have ever used. theyre small and they are EXTREMELY comfortable. Yeah theyre cheap, but they are really good"
1812,1.0 out of 5 stars,Short in cord...
1813,3.0 out of 5 stars,"the ear piece came off from the green part. I glued it back together myself but yep, they were in my pocket."
1814,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good ear buds, and a good price."
1815,4.0 out of 5 stars,Product is not as good as other SONY ear buds.
1816,1.0 out of 5 stars,both earbud broke off within a week
1817,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these earphones since they out. Couldn't find then in any stores anymore and I'm not a fan of marshmallow type earphones, just doesn't work for me. I'm super happy to have found them here though. Best ones I've used."
1819,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear buds don't fit nearly as well as my Sony MDRE828LP ear buds did. Sony shrunk down the diameter a little bit compared to those earbuds. Once I the little foam cover is lost, the earbud will easily slip out of position in the ear with the slightest pull of the cord. I have never seem to have been able to make the foam covers stay on longer than a week without getting lost. The angled piece of plastic which the cord comes out is much smaller and shorter than what is typical. This makes these ear buds great when you are listening in bed and your head is lying against a pillow, but no so great if you are jogging and need to re-position the ear buds in your ears."
1820,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect Sony earbuds for the price. I needed another pair, since my puppy chewed the last pair I kept in my bag. Music and audio sounds good and clear. I like the shape of these ear buds as the typical bullet-like buds have never fit my ears right. I would order again."
1821,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't get these if you're going to use them primarily to listen to music, even if they're a secondary pair -- the sound quality is that bad. There's absolutely no bass, and if there's any sound whatsoever in your environment, you're going to have to crank the volume all the way up to hear Your music. If podcasts are your thing, you might be OK with these as a secondary pair.

I bought them because my dog eats the rubber bits on the in-ear buds. I guess I'll just have to buy another pair of those and be more careful about leaving them around."
1822,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot wear the tiny in-ear buds that are so popular/common (they give me instant dizzy spells) and some of the buds in this style (coughApplecough) are either too large or too hard for my outer ear. These Sony buds are fantastic. I like them so much that I've actually stocked up a little. The sound quality is great as well. I might be approaching this in reverse, but if the buds are hurting my ears (or making me dizzy), it doesn't matter how great they sound. So I go for comfort first, sound quality second. These get high marks from me all around. Plus, as a bonus, they come in ORANGE, which matches the case for my MP3 player.

They also don't get as dingy as the ""jelly-style"" buds I've tried, which are comfortable, but discolor quickly."
1823,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's okay. The good thing about it, it is pretty loud, stays in place while jogging, and would probably be great for an audio book.

The downside to it is that headphones lack sound quality such lack of bass. When I'm listening to music I really can't feel the bass and sound quality.

I would not recommend for listening to music, however if somebody likes to hear some good narration sound I guess go for this product.

For it's price, it does what it is suppose to do - except for the quality."
1824,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I subscribe to a wide variety of daily and weekly podcasts and I am constantly walking around with earbuds on. I'm sure that listening to podcasts constantly instead of loud music is better for my eardrums but it is murder on the earbuds. I have probably bought more earbuds in the last five years than five people buy in a lifetime. Since I have an Apple Nano and an iPod Touch, I was buying Apple OEM and replacement earbuds. I would buy twelve or fifteen at a time. The problem was that the earbuds might last only a week before either one side or both stopped working.

I bought a pair of these Sony earbuds a few days before Thanksgiving at a local discount store. It is now the end of January and the earbuds are still working like the day they came out of the store. And yes, they have been put through the wringer. I've snagged them on the cabinet knobs. I've lifted the iPod Touch by the wires. I have slept with them on. Both left and right are still working and they still sound great.

The sound is better than the cheaper Chinese Apple replacements, but what really seems to set these earbuds apart is the way they are constructed. The wire connections to the earbuds and the plug seem much stronger and more durable than the Apple design.

I am happy with the product. In fact, I've already ordered a supply of them from Amazon. I would definitely recommend this product.

P.S. Music sounds great on them, too! Enjoy!"
1825,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear buds were not good. They had a very tinny sound and the volume wasn't great; I had to turn the volume on my device WAY up compared to where it normally is just to get a comparable level. In addition to the terrible sound quality, the construction was very poor; the buds themselves were very light plastic, and the cord was very thin and easily tangled.

The only reason I give this product 2 stars is because they fit in my ear perfectly. They weren't too snug, but they hung in there very well, even on a run. That said, you can get ear buds with those same qualities and much better sound elsewhere."
1826,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I know there are already reviews like this, but I didn't take enough time to read through them and catch this before I bought them; so here's another one.

These sound terrible; don't buy them. Tinny, etc as others have said. I was going to try and return them, but in the return process it says it would cost around 5 dollars to return, and I'd only end up with 4 dollars refunded in total. So I'll avoid that and just be stuck with them I think.

So don't do what I did, read these reviews and heed the warnings."
1827,5.0 out of 5 stars,"NO EAR PLUGS FOR ME, YUCK!! WITH ALL THAT WAX AND ITS YOUR OWN WAX, DO NOT SHARE!!! YUCK AND THOSE LOOK DIRTY YUCK.

THIS IS WHY I LOVE THESE, THEY ARE OUTSIDE THE EAR NOT LIKE A PLUG. THE SPECIAL DESIGN ALLOWS THEM TO STAY IN PLACE IN YOUR EAR.

GOOD PRICE, COMFORTABLE FIT, DISCREET, LIGHT, GOOD SIZE, GOOD SOUND. SONY CAN YOU WORK ON A CORD THAT DOES NOT TANGLE?

THANKS!"
1828,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were the same that Sony made years ago. I've been buying the same pair for years until it seems Sony has halted production. I was able to find them through Amazon, and they have the same great sound quality. They're very comfortable and come with cushioning. There's no carrying case like the one they came with when sold at retail stores, but it's still the same great pair of headphones."
1830,5.0 out of 5 stars,My absolute favorite headphones. Stay in place and dont fall out.
1831,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got a pair of these for my daughter last year. After my 2 iPhone headphones (almost $40 a piece) went caput after a year, I decided to give these a try. They're a great value and working well!"
1832,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are great. I love them. I like them because they fit in my old Sony wind up case. And I love them because of their price. Lastly I like them for their sound quality. I will admit they are not as nice as some of the high end headphones and earbuds. But they are defiantly exactly what they appear to be and that is why they get 5 stars. If you want some great affordable earbuds that work, sit comfortably in your ear... and are pretty! These are the earbuds for you!"
1833,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very low end ear buds...I would recommend another ear bud.
1834,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is pretty poor.
1835,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have always loved Sony headphones for the great sound quality. I have tried others but I always come back to sony. I was disappointed though with this last pair I got. They Sounded Hollow like a cheep 2 dollar pair. I hope it was just a defective pair and that the next pair I buy to replace these are better.
1836,2.0 out of 5 stars,Earphones broke about 2 weeks after I bought them :(
1837,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the only earbuds I use. I love the way they fit in my ear and they last twice as long as any other headphones I have ever owned.
1838,2.0 out of 5 stars,"great for running and cheap, but sound like junk. I used to get the Sonys that come in the windup case and they were $20. When I went to buy those, every place I could find them were selling them for $30 which is no longer worth it. As far as these, I figure I'll run with them for a while and I will get used to the sound. When I need a new pair, I'll get something else."
1839,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I received the headphones, they seemed like the real deal. However, when I plugged the headphones into my phone, there was no sound coming out from the right earbud. After numerous attempts to fix this problem, I realized the product itself was defective. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1841,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works good, but a little large, especially when using the foam pads. I like the sound quality."
1842,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works fine.
1843,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent sound from a low cost set of earbuds. Nothing special. Not cushioned.
1844,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Received these headphones ahead of time and was not disappointed. The sound is loud and clear but a bit trebly. Once I balanced out the treble with some bass,using the equalizer on my mp3 player, these headphones sounded great. They fit well in my ears. The price makes these headphones a steal."
1845,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like these they don't fall out of your ear
1846,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are are y favorite they stay on my ear and they dont bother my ear like the other new headphones now adays i just wish they had a mic though.
1847,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, great price, arrived quickly"
1848,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product !!!!
1849,5.0 out of 5 stars,I beat up headphones wile I work and theis seem to last as long as any others but at a much better price.
1850,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is terrible!! .. I had better expectations of these earbuds since quality that has always distinguished Sony, but it has gone down. I will never buy Sony products again."
1852,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best simple earbuds I've ever had. They are comfortable because my ears are smaller and these fit nicely without stretching my ear canal
1853,5.0 out of 5 stars,It came quickly and as advertised.
1854,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality, comfy to wear, and durable."
1855,2.0 out of 5 stars,The quality of sound is good but the build quality is horrible. The earpiece popped on the first day itself.
1856,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They fit my ears perfectly, and I love that the connection has a 90 degree bend to better protect the cord where it's plugged in. :)"
1857,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great - I was listening to some classical works on my Sony MP3, and it sounded rich and clear. The small plug type earbuds don't stay in my ears, and these disc type earbuds fit better and don't fall out. Great value for the price."
1858,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not quite the quality i expected, but still good sound and quality."
1859,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love them and I think I'll always will. I stopped buying them because i had the apple s***y ear pods. but once those finally broke, i immediately went to these earphones."
1860,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my son. He works in a very noisey plant and he says they are great at covering up outside noises
1861,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It may seem like it doesn't work at first, but after messing with it for about a minute is works great. Would really recommend this brand of earphones because they work great and last so much longer than any other earphones that I have bought. Best purchase I have every made in my life so far dealing with earphones. The price is reasonable as well."
1863,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife and I are in our 60's and these are just what the doctor ordered! Yes they are a bit uncomfortable, but the sound quality more than makes these worthwhile. You can pay much more but you'll be hardpressed to find clearer sound."
1864,2.0 out of 5 stars,"While the headphones are a comfortable, I found the design to be outdated, and the bass was disappointingly non-existent though the product description says otherwise."
1865,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very cheap! Poor sound quality.
1866,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They fit nicely in my ears, build quality is pretty good, and there is a raised bump on the outside of the left bud so you can tell the difference between left and right. The sound quality is pretty good for $8."
1867,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, very useful when I am on the road. Was shipped quickly and wrapped properly"
1868,1.0 out of 5 stars,"dont stay in place, they dall out very very easy"
1869,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Specs were the same as the older version. However, the sound quality of this newer version is inferior compared to the older one. I cant believe Sony allowed this to happen."
1870,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are great. Very comfortable and have a good sound. They are by no means top of the line but you for the money it's a great buy. I give it 4 stars because the wires are bit thin for my taste so I am not sure how durable they will be; however, for now, they serve as a great cheap replacement for my Apple earphones."
1871,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality, for the price."
1872,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At 5 bucks, nothing I can complain about this headphones. It has decent quality sound and good build. If I amped the volume too much, people around me would be able to listen as well though, which is kinda annoying."
1874,5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones do what headphones for under $10 should do. Great quality and stay in your ear without falling out and causing irritation. Product arrived in two days (via Prime). I will probably buy another pair as a backup.
1875,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really cute and the sound is good. Fits in the ears good too.
1876,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for a great price....Will order two more...
1877,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Have some noise when the volume is high, not recommended."
1878,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very satisfying with this product! First of all, it is very cheap. Design is so cute and fashionable. It fits on my ears very well and works well!! I am willing to buy this product again."
1879,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not satisfied with the sound of these.
1880,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a big fan of Sony earbuds. I fly a lot and listen at home a lot while working on the house and yard, but these specific earbuds are terrible. Tinny sound and thin wires, and they failed outright in only a few months. I guess I'll spring for the fontopias, but now those seem to cost a lot more than they used to. I have a pair of Beats headphones but the over-the-ear thing looks ridiculous on a grown man and they cost so much I worry about being punched in the back of the head and mugged while wearing them. I prefer to walk softly and carry large bank account, and am not planning to moonlight as a DJ. I just want good sound.

Sigh. What happened to the perfect Sony earbuds for only twenty bucks?"
1881,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived on time and a great product!
1882,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sony MDRE9LP/WHI Earbud Headphones are crispy clear. This was an excellent purchase.
1883,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great sound and comfortable if you like this style, seems pretty durable so far been using them for at least 3 months daily."
1885,4.0 out of 5 stars,was pretty good ear buds
1886,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds great. Delivery was fast.
1887,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good earphones for the price. However, I have tried different brands, and these are my least favorite. I would prefer the Panasonic for a budget earphone."
1888,1.0 out of 5 stars,One side of my earbuds randomly stopped working after theee weeks of using them
1889,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sounds and fit. Would recommend if you are looking for reasonably priced quality sounding earbuds. I would buy them again
1890,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great pair of earphones for the price. I use them at the office and they keep me going.
1891,1.0 out of 5 stars,Item is junk. Didn't work after receiving it and no returns are allowed. Waste of money.
1892,2.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound quality. Comfortable until foam cover fell off and not easily replaceable.
1893,1.0 out of 5 stars,I just used for 1 week and I dont hear anything from it when I using it! I think its broken.
1894,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is probably my third or fourth pair, but they work great and get the job done. They're comfortable in my opinion."
1896,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but lacks a bit of the highs that previous Sony earbuds seemed to have."
1897,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these, they're exactly what I was looking for and they shipped promptly!"
1898,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great quality and are the second pair I have ever owned. The first lasted close to four years of heavy, everyday use including working out and running. I would recommend these to anybody just because the sound quality is great and they are very durable."
1899,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great ☺
1900,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like them and despite accidentally going in the washing machine they still work great.
1901,5.0 out of 5 stars,⚡⚡Cool beans!
1902,1.0 out of 5 stars,Falls out of your ear. Left side went out after 1 month.
1903,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most comfortable headphones I have - and the best sound!
1904,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for basic uses. I use them at work to listen to music on my computer. I would not recommend them for exercise...I think they may fall out of the ear.
1905,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfext for gym but breaks easily. Price is ok to repurchase at least.
1907,5.0 out of 5 stars,great
1908,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for the money.
1909,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these. I hate earplug style buds and headphones are too bulky for me, plus I'm not interested in making some sort of fashion statement with my choice of audio equipment. I've owned around four of these the last decade and they always work perfect for me. Hope they don't discontinue them any time soon."
1910,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because I constantly lose my Apple Earpods. These are fairly good quality, sound quality great for price, sit comfortably in the ear (not in-ear earbuds though), and look nice as well. Would definitely recommend these for the price."
1911,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great little headphones, do what they should do comfortably, without rubber pieces being in your ears. Perfect, just what we needed."
1912,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my third set it the last 6 years. I have it in my ears 99% of my waking hours listening to my books and music. I have yet to find anything close to the quality of sound. I am only replacing it because I have cracked one side.
1913,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The ear buds arrived pretty quick. I ordered blue ear buds but ended up with black. Other than that, they are decent for a cheap pair."
1914,1.0 out of 5 stars,There used to be a $20 pair of Sony earbuds that looked like this at Radio Shack that had excellent quality. THESE PAIR SUCK. You have to turn the volume all the way up to hear anything. ALL OF THESE NEED TO BE DESTROYED!
1915,5.0 out of 5 stars,My order arrived on time and my headphones works as advertised. Great sound quality.
1916,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good affordable set of earbuds. If you go through them like I do, and aren't looking to be dazzled by improbable levels of sound quality, these will do ya fine."
1918,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy these they are terrible! You also can’t return them. They sound so bad
1919,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound for the price.
1920,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Love these earbuds. They fit well and put no stress on the ears.
1921,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Only the left bud actually transmits noise, but the sound still goes through rather nicely."
1922,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using this product for years. The price is great and they work fine. I abuse them all the time at work and gym so i tend to break them. I always buy the same model for years now and never regret it.
1923,5.0 out of 5 stars,love
1924,4.0 out of 5 stars,their fine
1925,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed a pair of cheapies for work. These were pretty cheap, and my expectations we're that high – I just want to be able to listen to podcasts or some tunes during the day; I don't need anything state of the art. But wow, I realized quickly how badly my previous pair were destroyed when I put these on. They sound great, and it doesn't hurt that they come in some cute candy colors."
1926,5.0 out of 5 stars,I don't care for these in my ears but my sister runs every day with them and loves them. They fit her ears perfect.
1927,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pathetic product, does not fit well in ear, the wires are messy and cheap. The jack is old fashioned and the sound quality is not good either"
1929,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great poduct!
1930,3.0 out of 5 stars,This is the only set of headphones that I own that has static.
1931,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for someone esle
1932,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I ordered. Sound quality is very good. Received order when it was promised.
1933,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great wish it came with extra earbud covers 2 more. Just cause can lose easy if not paying attention go to sleep withit while listening to something Other than Fantastic
1934,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 12 year old approves!
1935,1.0 out of 5 stars,sound quality is lacking from previous mdre9lps and the speaker part fell apart after a 2 months of hardly being used.. not happy with this product
1936,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these as a replacement for my old sony earbuds that were disconnected. They work great for me and I've had no problems with them.
1937,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones.
I got them in several colors, I keep a pair at work, in the car and at home.
Plus they don't cost an arm and a leg."
1938,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE THEM FIT NICE
1940,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely disappointed. Have used Sony headphones for years, same price, but old ones were much better quality. They used to curve to fit the ear and my last pair lasted literally years. This set I had as a back up for when the old ones failed (I use them for hours every day). They didn't even last TWO WEEKS. Stopped working after just 10 days. Won't buy again."
1941,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are great. They are always available on amazon prime for less than $10 and come in a variety of colors. I am not an audiophile by any means, but I notice better quality out of these ear buds than from headphones up to 60-70$ (I have never bought headphones more expensive than that, so they make stack up better in some cases).

Since they are at such a low price, I didn't initially expect much. I am on my 4th pair now, after about 10 years of extensive use. My old pair is only showing some minor signs of usage, but they do need replaced every once and a while because they do go in your ear and they do have small holes.

I am always at my desk, for work or gaming, and I am always listening to music and these do the trick for a low price. I expect to purchase another pair again in a year or so."
1942,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these ear buds specifically for working out and running errands. For $8, I would recommend these to anyone. The sound quality is pretty good for the price and they've held up well, despite being yanked out of my ears multiple times for various reasons (catching the cord on a door handle, my dog pulling them out when he's excited, etc). I've had problems in the past with other headphones where one of the earbuds dies while the other one still works, and I have not had that problem with these yet. I used to buy them at Target, where they were $15, but I bought this pair in November 2014 and recently bought another pair in August 2015 because I lost the first pair. I use these with my ipod, multiple laptops, and my samsung galaxy S3 with no problems. Good quality, but if something happens to them its not a huge loss either."
1943,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality isn't quite as good as Sony MDR-E818LP Fontopia Ear-Bud Headphones with Acoustic Twin Turbo Circuit (http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-E818LP-Headphones-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00005QBUU/ref=sr_1_35?ie=UTF8&qid=1431018564&sr=8-35&keywords=sony+earbuds), but it's much better than Panasonic RPHJE120S In-Ear Headphone, Silver (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EM800S/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1). Also it was almost as comfortable as the Sony MDR-E818LP Fontopia Ear-Buds and much more comfortable and louder than the Panasonic RPHJE120S. Overall for the price it was a pretty good deal. I wish the Sony MDR-E818LP Fontopia Ear-Buds hadn't been discontinued and weren't so pricey now."
1944,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have expensive beat headphones but ise then mostly when I travel on a plane but these have been my must have at all times, they work great and small to always carry with me. I have been using these for over 4 years and in the 4 years I have only had to replace them 3 times."
1945,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the most comfortable for me to wear all day, and ive tried a lot of different sets. i do put a generic soft foam cover on them yet, but its much better then others ive tried. The sound is decent, not the best and not the worst, but sounds great for voice (i listen to a lot of podcasts) highly recommend. My kids like these too (use them without the foam) ive bought several pair."
1946,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought these in pink/white and also in black. My first pair I bought multiple years ago and still works, but I just wanted another set. They stay in your ears well, and the sound is great. I've never had issues with them not working. For being an affordable brand, this is great."
1947,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All earbuds break eventually, This is due to the headphones getting old and wires growing weak. These however can last you 12-18 months before one ear stops working! i have owned other brands like panasonic and Philips that have stopped working in one ear 4-8 months time! Plus these are a bargin price and there are lots of colors.

The big reason these last so long is the headphone jack. You see the main reason they break is when the wire is bent by the headphone jack in a weird way (like wrapping it around your mp3 player) These however got the L shape jack so the wire doesn't get any stress at all! personally i think my last pair broke because i dropped my mp3 player around 5 times over the year causing the wire to catch it causing stress to it."
1948,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Used to have Sony MDR-E828 ear buds which were comparable in price but far better in sound quality compared to these, which have poor low frequency / bass response. Music comes through with a tinny, distant sound. The cord also feels to be a smaller gauge and made of flimsy material. These headphones may be fine for listening to podcasts or the news, but I would not recommend these for listening to music. They do come with a pair of soft foam ear pads."
1949,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is the same model that I had 4 years ago but I bought mine from a walgreens. The quality of the materials used to make this headphone seems to have went down. My previous ones lasted 3 years and they were very durable. This new one seems very cheap. I cannot recommend this to anyone wanting a lasting pair of ear buds...Mine lasted less than a month of regular use and then it started to lose sound in one bud. It was also falling apart. This maybe the same model and brand but it is definitely not the same quality it used to be.
1951,3.0 out of 5 stars,Would like more bass
1952,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it
1953,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good sound quality for the price. No visible microphone on the earbuds, not quite sure how they do it, but I get fewer audio quality complaints with these over other ear buds. Only downside for me is the speaker part is kind of squat and fat and does not stick in my ear as well as some other designs. Would purchase again."
1954,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very uncomfortable ear buds. They hurt my ears and I had to replace.
1955,5.0 out of 5 stars,gift
1956,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love these headphones! Could've lasted a longer time but I dropped them on them road and they got run over :/ But great sound and useful for my daily transport.
1957,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the only ear buds I buy now. They work best and for a long time. So worth the money.
1958,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clear and loud. Will buy more!
1959,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelente
1960,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great all around buds...
For the money, you can't beat 'em!"
1962,5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect....
1963,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, just what I needed."
1964,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered these years ago and were fine, these sound horrible. Very tinny and weak. I bought two and both were the same."
1965,5.0 out of 5 stars,I stockpile these
1966,5.0 out of 5 stars,These worked great and were so nice that they even got stolen. :( Really awesome headphones though.
1967,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earbuds have very good sound! Clear sound and good with both highs and lows. Plus they are comfortable. Great product for the price!
1968,1.0 out of 5 stars,"the delivery took forever. more than two months. when it finally came, one of the ear buds did not work. DO NOT GET THIS JUST FOR THE PRICE."
1969,2.0 out of 5 stars,sounds quality is not good - too much mids and not enough bass - sound cheap (which they are)
1970,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty solid headphones in ny opinion. Sony never disappoints. Bass and sound quality are excellent for price.
1971,5.0 out of 5 stars,great head phones
1973,5.0 out of 5 stars,"God I've been using this earphones for almost 4 years and Ive never been so happy before, you shouldn't pay attention to others, this Sony earphones are GREAT."
1974,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the look of the ear buds and the fact that you can choose many different colors. The ear buds don't fit my ears though. I'm a grown adult man, so maybe I just have big ears. I'm not sure. I wouldn't recommend this to any other adult male due to possible size issues. Someone else, maybe."
1975,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They fit my fiance's ears well, but they just keep falling out of mine. They have a good sound though, and actually it was a gift that they work in her ears as we've been trying to find some that fit her. She has a small ear canal, so recommended for those with small ears."
1976,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought these earbuds before. I recently bought a new one because the one I had for 3 years broke.
I ordered these headphones on March 31, 2013 and received them on April 3, 2013 and after 5 days of use, the right side of the earbuds don't produce any sound. As far as I'm aware, the earbuds were at least 9 days old before it broke.

Pretty peeved.
I'm discouraged to buy these again."
1977,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the third pair of ear buds I have bought in two months...because they work well, have nifty colors that my kids can actually distinguish their own pair and they last during my 2 hour runs. I love that these actually stay in my ears when I'm sweating....not too often does that happen. So if you are looking for trendy colors or just need a bud for a long run, then this my dear is the one for you."
1978,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones provide reasonable quality sound.

My only complaint is that they break fairly quickly. I listen to my iPod/computer using them probably about 5 hours per day. I've had a couple sets of these headphones, and they seem to break within 2-3 months.

So, if you're planning on using them heavily, these are not a permanent solution. However, they are a good, cheap, fast one."
1979,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these because of the price, but they break after about 1 year or so. I end up buying them often."
1980,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cute and comfortable
1981,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my ears even though I have small ears and not all earphones fit comfortably
1982,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you don't care about the remote that some ipod headphones have to change songs and volume, these headphones are affordable and great quality. I only lose a pair every 3-6 months, and only half of the time is because the headphones get lost/stolen."
1984,5.0 out of 5 stars,These ear buds are built good. I have accidentally washed them and dried them around 30 times and they still work. After about 2yrs with them my dog ate the buds so I will be buying them again.
1985,4.0 out of 5 stars,As someone who loses and breaks headphones regularly these are a durable and replaceable option. Generally I get 6 months to a year out of them before they start falling breaking. Sound quality is good.
1986,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Within three months of my purchase, the left earbud has broken apart. I used them only a few times a week - and kept them in their own little compartment in my bag, so not exactly hard use. I have had other Sony earbuds in the past that have lasted years. This was a true disappointment."
1987,5.0 out of 5 stars,My go to replacement headphones. They have great sound for the price!
1988,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recieved my headphones very fast shipping is great . I had dropped them a few time but still works excellent, its great for listening to music and phone calls . Its also very loud good for blocking out annoying sounds around you . Five stars to this person who sold it to me and the headphones"
1989,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These ROCK! Their comfortable and have excellent sound, plus I like the tiny knob on the left bud."
1990,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Work fine with phones, ipods, and mp3s. My only peeve is when I use it with my laptop, it has a really annoying static sound when I'm not even listening to anything. Still good audio and bass for listening to music though."
1991,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good solid buds, smaller than previous ones, but driver seems comparable,"
1992,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absoutly love these headphones! They are amazing for the price an they fit perfectly in my ears.
1993,1.0 out of 5 stars,One of the ear buds stopped working in a little over a month. Sound quality was also not great- heard feedback from the first time I used it.
1995,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There worth the money, there not like the earpods from apple but for the price your paying, its worth it :)"
1996,5.0 out of 5 stars,As described
1997,5.0 out of 5 stars,Okay quality and nice earbud design that doesn't go all the way into your ears.
1998,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They're really loud, and they came pretty fast. I like the color, I can't tell you about the longevity of the earphones, because I just got it, but I will update."
1999,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great and are reasonably priced.
2000,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fragile and didn't work after a month of light use.
2001,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great! Love the purple color as well as the other options available! First pair of headphones that haven't randomly broke on me.
2002,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You get what you pay for. They are comfy in the ear, but the sound quality is horrible. Like listening to music in a tin can."
2003,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have a pair I like better with rubber plugs that go in the ear. Problem is they make my ears pop when I fly.
2004,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Somewhat tinny, but for the money they are the best available headphones. I think I'm gonna spend the money and try some beats though."
2006,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these all the time.
2007,5.0 out of 5 stars,They're good but the buds are a but smaller than I expected. Not a big deal though.
2008,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound. The buds fall out of my ears, even with the mesh on them. So the shape isn't ideal, but the sound is superb."
2009,1.0 out of 5 stars,they sound like tin can crap !!!!!!!
2010,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like these ear buds the sound quality is very good.
2011,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These use to be my go to head phones, but I've had two pairs in a row break the same week I bought them."
2012,5.0 out of 5 stars,The speakers have great sound. Much improved from the ear buds I acquired on an airliner. These babies make it worth listening to music.
2013,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones. They are probably the most durable pair I have ever owned.
2014,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good with me it cheaps and good quality
2015,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Most earbuds today are shaped strangely and don't quite fit my ears. These ones actually stay put and they don't have the weird protruding cushions that some others have. Would have liked a slightly longer cord, but overall they get the job done. I mostly listen with them on my computer."
2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before buying these, I had earphones where I could only hear sound from one ear piece. I picked these ones because of the color and great reviews. I've used them at home and on plane rides and so far they have been great."
2018,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mehh
2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great and I would recommend them to any one who wants to listen to their music. I primarily use it with my Iphone and can't believe how much they cancel outside noise and how great the sound is. You can't go wrong with the price either!
2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have small ears and have had difficulty in the past finding ear buds that are a comfortable secure fit. These arrived promptly (actually a little early) and fit my ears well. The sound quality was a little tinny, but could be adjusted a little within the preferences on my computer to make up for it. Not Bose, but decent earbuds at an excellent price."
2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They work really good , they arrived on time. I would recommend it."
2022,1.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for. Broke down in 2 weeks.
2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Brand New packaging. Cheap replacements for hitting the gym.
2024,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first pair of these headphones I had bought on a whim at a local Big Lots for about $5, and I hadn't expected much out of them-- I had just needed some new ones for the commute to and from school. They lasted almost four years before the right side went out. It was pretty amazing to me that they had lasted through high school and into my first year of college and the abuses that came with that: being thrown into my backpack, surviving PE in 100 degree weather, rain, etc. I bought my second pair shortly after the first had died at Target for closer to $12, which is still inexpensive but more than what you can get here on Amazon. I only bought this third pair because I had thought I'd lost the second, so now I have two pairs that work wonderfully (one two years old, this one six months) that have traveled internationally in checked luggage and carry-on and have put up with the abuse of three playful kittens and an overly-excited toddler. I highly recommend these headphones for quality of sound and construction, and hope that they're still being produced three years from now!"
2025,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Inferior sound quality. OK for voice, marginal for music. Spend a few dollars more and get something with at least decent sound quality."
2026,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my second pair of sony earbuds. After having success with an older model. I got these as the specs looked good. But everything sounded terrible: muffled, no bass, no treble, nothing but crap. I'm incredibly disappointed with these."
2028,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent quality as expected from Sony. I've paid 5 times the price for headphones that give half the sound quality. If you want good quality, cheap ear buds... these are what I recommend."
2029,5.0 out of 5 stars,A + GOOD JOB
2030,5.0 out of 5 stars,i love the sound and they fit perfect
2031,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, they're great. I have a little Sony radio I still love to use as I clean house, etc. Headphones do what I wanted them to do."
2032,5.0 out of 5 stars,I 'm satisfied with the product. Is as described and arrived quickly.
2033,3.0 out of 5 stars,"You get what you pay for, nothing special about these, just a backup earphones"
2034,1.0 out of 5 stars,They are way to big and brake easily
2035,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is poor
2036,5.0 out of 5 stars,Authentic Sony headphones same model as i wanted.
2037,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones.
2039,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have the volume on the first level and the sound is great and extremely clear! Love these headphones! Would definitely recommend other people to buy them!
2040,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first plugged the headphones in and pressed ""play"", I literally laughed out loud at how horrible the sound quality of this product is. All kinds of music, from classical to classic rock, come out tinny and distorted, as if you were listening to a tape recording of a record, played behind a few sheets of cardboard connected to a string tied around a tin can.

The build quality is also shoddy; even the slightest brush against the cable or jack will lead to loud distortion and echoing while playing music from any kind of mp3 player or computer. This means that this item is entirely unusable while walking, let alone jogging.

This item actually makes the default iPod headphones look good in comparison. From its cheap materials (Plastic that feels weak and thin) to the lack of any features (Mic, volume control, quality audio, etc) this item is most certainly not worth even a dollar. I feel silly having paid even $7 for this piece of junk, and would definitely not purchase it again or recommend it to anyone.

DO NOT BUY."
2041,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the way that they fit into my ears. Very comfortable. I like the sound quality and the style
2042,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pair, great price, I just find them so comfortable!!"
2043,5.0 out of 5 stars,"no OG panasonics, but the best you will find (and i have small ears apparently compared to others and have had problems since circuit city went out of business and bestbuy stopped carrying the old skewl metal topped panasonics [the best ever!])

YMMV"
2044,1.0 out of 5 stars,"these earbuds broke after one day of using them - there was a loud static sound, sent an email to the seller but didn't get a response"
2045,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones. They fit in my ears perfect and very comfortable. Sound is great as well.
2046,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to the first time I bought them, they have seem to have lost quality but does the job."
2047,2.0 out of 5 stars,did not hold up one side stop working
2048,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are standard headphones, but they are quite uncomfortable and tiny, and keep falling out my ears. I also though they had a microphone on them but they don't. Unfortunately I waited too long to return them (1 day late) :("
2050,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great replacement set for my wife's MP3 player. Nice and small earbuds.
2051,5.0 out of 5 stars,very strong and music sounds good
2052,2.0 out of 5 stars,At this price you can't demand much sound quality. However the wire quality is so cheap that I stop using it.
2053,2.0 out of 5 stars,"not happy at all, in the first week they stop working. could only hear it from one ear an kind of surprise cause they where sony."
2054,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the only ear buds that I can use, because for some reason, all other ear buds seem to be too big. I thought these were a decent price, and so far, this brand last a long time with a lot of wear and tear. I use them for running and have not had any problems."
2055,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad sound. High treble, low bass, so depending on how you like your music may not be the best choice. I haven't exposed them to much outside of normal conditions so I can't speak to the durability of these headphones. I would consider buying them again."
2056,1.0 out of 5 stars,fake
2057,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my son. He is amazed at the sound quality.
2058,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality seems as good as Sony earbuds that I've purchased before, but they don't stay in the ear as well and the wire leads are thinner. It doesn't look as if they will last as long before they fail."
2059,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are REALLY GREAT earphones! They fit well in ears and they have a great loud sound. Not noise canceling tho but they're perfect! Fav earphones ever!
