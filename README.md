# BIA660D_Group_2_Project
The class project for Group 2 of BIA 660D, Spring 2018.


Update: March 31st
We have written a code which scrape all the data for the intended product. Since we plan to analyze reviews about headphones, each member of group need to collect data for 5~10 headphones. Then, we combine the collected data to use as a data source for text mining.

Proposal: under revision

Aim of the project:
We planned to Analyze the reviews on Amazon website for some specific category of products. We extract important features discussed in the reviews. For example, for a backpack important features could be adjustable/interchangeable length hip belt, side water bottle pockets, load lifters, hip belt pockets, ventilated back, top lid, floating lid. 
Then we do some regression analysis on the data to find emerging, shrinking, and splitting trends in the reviews.

The next step of our project is planned to be some personal data analysis. We analyze reviews submitted by each specific customer in order to find KOL(key opinion leaders) for those products in the Amazon reviews. We also planned to do some work on distinguishing fake reviews from the others. 

The detailed process is not clear to us at this time we commit new detailed information about our project in the future.

Where will you get the data?
Data scraping from www.amazon.com and also use free available APIs

How we analyze the data:
Text mining of the reviews (Natural Language processing using spaCy, NLTK)
Regression analysis for the extracted data from text mining
Social network analysis for the network of the products in one category.
