0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Audio Technica has a huge reputation for the best headphones. These headphones are clear, crystalline, and the best you could get for this price. HOWEVER, for the 1 star review, you are NOT SUPPOSED TO WORK OUT WITH THESE HEADPHONES."
1,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, would recommend you stay away from this product. I have been through 4 pairs of these headphones in 1 year. Yes, you read that right. 4 pairs. While they were working, they were OK.

Positives:
1. They had decent audio quality. Voice and music sounded good and people could hear me while using them to make calls.
2. They were comfortable most of the time.
3. The bluetooth reception was good.

Negatives:
1. Expensive.
2. They lasted from between a few months to a few weeks. Each pair would either: melt, or just stop working for no apparent reason.
They are only suitable for sport if you don't sweat a lot. If you do, they channel sweat down into your ear canal and they lose grip around your ears and can easily fall off.
The mini rubber band that is meant is to keep them secured snugly around the back of you neck is useless. It doesn't hold them there.

Massive Negatives:
1. Customer support here in Taiwan where I bought them. Each time they broke, the shop would send them off for repair and I would need to wait 2 working weeks to get them back. So that was close to 10 weeks I was without the product. After the 4th pair broke I had enough and had to wade through endless customer support calls to eventually get to the dead end of 'No refund - this is our company policy'."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been searching for wireless headphones to use with my Bluetooth surround system so that I can watch TV and not disturb my wife. While these are not Bluetooth headphones, I was able to easily use them with my surround system by using a Toslink splitter (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G191YL8?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00), Toslink cable (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CANMCM?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) and digital to stereo converter adapter (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KCRYIWM?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00).

Audio-Technica headphones have a wonderful reputation and these headphones definitely live up to that reputation. While I am not an audiophile, the headphones produce immersive surround sound off very high quality. I like that the headphones rest in the charging base.

I was nervous about purchasing a product that is not sold in the United States, but I had an incredibly positive experience purchasing the headphones from Japan Import Shop Rise. They provided very clear communications about the progress of the shipment from Japan and the package arrived 2 weeks ahead of schedule even though I didn't request expedited shipping. I would strongly recommend these headphones to anyone in the market for wireless headphones."
3,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've spent a long time in the following comparison, so I decided to write the results, to make other people save the time I've ""lost"" :)

I was looking for a small, portable, good looking and good sounding On-Ear or ""mini Around the Ear"" Bluetooth Headphones to use for music on the Bus and while I do Fitness, and eventually at home, so I have bought a few ones to compare.

I've compared:
Sennheiser MM400-X
Jabra Revo Wireless
Bose Soundlink On-Ear
Philips Fidelio M1BT
Sony MDR-10RBT
= All the best and portable enough Bluetooth headphones available at the moment.

I've compared them for many weeks, with my Xperia Z1 Compact (APTX support) + Neutron as Music Player, and with my PC (which gets Bluetooth+APTX through an Azio BTD-V401 Dongle and a Sennheiser BTD 500 Dongle, which I also wanted to compare. See my other reviews for that. Or simply avoid the Azio!) + MusicBee as player.
I've used many different musical genres, mostly MP3 of different qualities, some Flac, and some CDs.
I've tested each headphone at first without EQ, then with EQ to see how much can their lacks and excesses be compensated with EQ.

Very quickly I understood that the Bose and the Philips were clear winners.
It was more difficult, to be honest, to chose between them two.
Although the Fidelio sounded better, with more detail and soundstage, crispier highs, and a wonderful fat vibrant bass, the Bose also sounded very good and had other advantages.
I initially declared Bose as winner, because of their better portability, better comfort, slightly better range, and their ability to connect with two devices at same time (= Multipoint).
But somehow I have then missed the Fidelio, so when the M2BT came out here in EU, I decided to try them. And I just could not let them go anymore.
Not only they even slightly improved the original sound of the M1BT, but also added Multipoint, NFC, and softer ear-pads.
The Bose are still more comfortable and more portable and have some other advantages, and sound very good, but in this moment they are for me N°2 for ""best mix of portability and sound"", and one of the best overall among more than 20 BT Headphones tested. Not bad at all.

EDIT: it seems that the Bose Soundlink On-Ear have compatibility problems with iOS devices, which cause intermittent connectivity and skipping music. It is not clear to me if this problem happens always to all iOS users or just on some units, but given this risk I would suggest to buy them only where you can return them in case of problems. Like here in Amazon.
I am waiting for an answer from Bose about this. For now I only know they are aware of it and are searching for a solution which could be applied via firmware update.
Android and Windows users are not affected by this issue.

So, the comparison:

Bose Soundlink On-Ear.
PROS:
Light, small and foldable. You can even keep them in the pocket of your jacket.
Elegant form and small dimension = Look good and discrete on the head
Fit tightly enough to do fitness, and still feel gently and soft on the ears for many hours.
The overall sound is impressive, considering how small they are, and the absence of APTX.
The ""tone"" or quality of the sound is pleasantly ""fresh"", like I prefer, and still they're balanced enough not to miss any part of the spectrum. Neither too warm nor too cold.
The Highs are well represented and never ""ear-hurting"".
The mids/vocals are not so warm like in the Revo, but are still near and present.
The basses are actually surprising for something so little. They are not vibrant like the Fidelio, but still strong and punchy enough to make you move the head while listening to your favorite Techno theme, especially after some EQ.
The soundstage is not thrilling, but is quite ok for such a small and on-ear headphone.
The detail is also quite good.
You can turn them on and off very quickly due to the analogical lever.
They have got voice prompts which tell you ""connecting to..."", the state of the battery, and more.
You can connect them to two devices at same time! This means, you can listen to music on your PC, and still be able to receive a phone call from your mobile phone. The music on the PC is automatically stopped when you receive a call, but on my experience you still have to close the music player on the PC or there are interferences. Occasionally I even had to disconnect the Headphones from the PC to avoid clips while talking. Not a big deal. After all, it's an exclusive extra. But it should be improved with a new firmware.
Firmware can be updated via USB
Nice semi-rigid carrying case

CONS:
one single button to pause the music and go to the next/previous track. Not the best solution. Three clicks for the previous track is a bit annoying.
They have no APTX. I am convinced that the APTX would give them more detail.
They require a mini jack if you want to use them with a cable. The cable is anyway included.
The speakers cannot turn 90° in flat position. This allow the Bose to fold smaller in the pocket of your jacket, but makes them thicker than the Fidelio in a backpack, especially once in their carrying case.
The carrying case also compresses them a bit. If you leave them in the case for some days you will find that the soft pads are pressed. Do not panic, it is memory foam, give them a while and they come back normal. Anyway, Bose, this should be improved.
The two LED on the back of the right speaker cannot be disabled, but at least do not blink.
They are expensive.

Philips Fidelio M1BT:
PROS:
They look very good. Elegant. And although bigger than the Bose, still discrete enough.
The buttons are practical: a click on the right speaker to pause/resume. A lever for volume up/down. A click on the lever for the next track, two for the previous track.
They fit tightly and are still comfortable enough.
The overall sound is surprisingly good, actually excellent. A bit warmer and punchy than the Bose, and still very well balanced.
The Highs were crispier and more detailed, just more balanced by the warm mids and vibrant bass, so that on a first listening they do not stand out as much as on the Bose.
The mids are very nice, warm and soft.
The basses are wonderful. They are warm and vibrant. The best among these five Headphones. It is not a matter of quantity but of quality. I can say so: the Bose and the Revo can make you move the head, but only the Fidelio make you smile when the bass line comes... Specially the Sub-Bass ist the best among all BT Headphones I've tested, close to the one of the UE9000, with a wonderful warm gentle rumble, but also with enough Punch.
The Soundstage is better than in the Bose, making them sound a bit more spacious and open, a bit less ""right near the ear"".
They are also more detailed than the Bose, probably thanks to the APTX (Unfortunately I could not test them without APTX).

CONS:
Simple soft bag instead of a carrying case. There is no chance that you can put them quickly in the bag without taking the bag off the backpack first.
Blinking led on the right speaker, which cannot be deactivated
Not foldable (but the speakers can be turned of 90° making them at least thinner than the Bose). I just cannot imagine a valid reason to make bluetooth headphones which are not foldable, but well, nothing is perfect.
TOO slow to turn off (very long click needed). This is annoying. Often I thought that I had already turned them off, and they were still on.
Cheaper than the Bose but still not exactly cheap, and the new model (M2BT), which adds NTFC and supposedly goes even deeper in the bass frequencies, costs as much as the Bose.

EDIT: a quick note about the Fidelio M2BT: it is the same as the M1BT, plus NFC, Multipoint, softer Ear-pads, different color (black over dark blue), different material for the head-band (textile instead of leather), a slightly improved Soundstage due to a different DSP, and a wider Frequency response which is not clearly noticeable on a first listening because it goes way beyond the frequencies we can normally ear. Still, this wider frequencies somehow indirectly improves the sound, giving some more sub-bass and more clarity in the highs.
One negative aspect of the M2BT is that on some units the Multipoint causes connectivity problems. In this case anyway, differently than for the Bose, they can be solved resetting the Headphones a couple of times.

So, why did the other three lose the competition?

JABRA REVO WIRELESS
They are beautiful, I liked their mix of discrete Olive and lively subtle Orange lines. But I prefer the Bose for discretion and the Fidelio for elegance.
They sound warm, yes, but somehow a bit muffled. Probably because they lack highs and a bit upper mids.
With some EQ and a bit of Reverb this improves, but they never sounded lively and open enough to me, having tried the other ones which sound brighter.
They've got less punch than the Fidelio on the bass, more or less on pair with the Bose. With maybe (and I liked this) a tiny bit more rumble than the Bose. To give you an idea, I enjoyed more watching a film with the Revo than with the Bose, because the Revo had more this warm rumble effect of cinema speakers.
The touch controls are cool but also a pain in the A. EVERY SINGLE TIME that I wanted to reach the central button to pause the music I finished turning the volume up or down. Same story for changing track.
The bag is a joke. Period.
They are a bit more comfortable than the Fidelio on long-term, but do not fit tight enough to do fitness.
They have got NFC, yes, but no APTX. If you really need NFC (but, why?) you could have a look to the new Fidelio M2BT.
The improvement given by the Dolby App is only while using that App as a music player (which has got no folder browser. I do not know you, but I like to organize my music in folders), and it does not bring the Revo to the level of the Fidelio for soundstage and detail, or of the Bose for freshness and balance.
They have a wonderful orange cable covered in Fabric, with a Mic to use them as Headset also in cable mode. This is, I must admit, a nice point. I really liked the cable :D

Sennheiser MM400-x:
they look EXTREMELY AWFUL and make your head seem like a Rugby Ball in horizontal position like the kid of Family Guy.
They sound sterile. Boring. The sound is quite detailed (APTX), clear, and fresh, even if with not much soundstage. But it is ""cold"", unemotional. And it completely lacks punch. Hearing Techno with them is like reading a recipe when you are hungry.
They are the more portable, and have a removable battery. This means, you can buy an extra battery and be sure to never stay out of charge.
The buttons are practical. The carrying case too.
They are very light and comfortable, and still tight enough to do fitness.
The good is that at least in EU you can find them cheaper than any of the others if you buy them from the Outlet of Sennheiser. 109 Euro!!!

Last and least, Sony MDR-10RBT:
They look cheap. The ""silver"" plastic is very bad taste. They are also too big to go around.
They are Around the Ear, which makes them the most comfortable of the five on long term, and also gives them a good Soundstage, although for some reason the sound of these Sony tends to come from behind. This is for me very disturbing. The sound should come mostly from the front, or from everywhere like if you are in the middle.
Also, they do not fit tightly enough, and according to how you move your head they leak sound and you lose basses.
The overall sound is dark and dull. Too much upper bass and low mid.
Bass is relatively strong but muffled, not lively, not clean.
They have APTX, but Sony ships them with the APTX disabled as default. To enable it you must press a combination of buttons till the led blinks three times. In my tests the led did not blink the way Sony declared, and I could only confirm the APTX via notifications on my Phone.
The best thing on these headphones is the carrying bag. Robust, a bit rigid, you can manage to slip the headphones in the bag in the middle of a crowded backpack.
Another good thing on the Sony are the buttons. Two buttons for the volume, one lever for pause/next track/previous track. IMO the best solution together with the five buttons of the Sennheiser.

So..., making a list:

Overall Sound:
1) Fidelio
2) Bose
3) Revo
4) Sennheiser
5) Sony

Basses:
1) Fidelio
2) Bose and Revo
3) Sony (n°1 for quantity, n°5 for quality)
4) Sennheiser

Detail and Soundstage:
1) Fidelio
2) Bose and Sennheiser
3) Sony (would be at the first place for Room if the sound would not come from behind)
4) Revo

Portability:
1) Sennheiser
2) Bose
3) Fidelio
4) Sony and Revo (Sony because of the better bag and flat turning speakers even if bigger dimensions, Revo because foldable).

Look:
1) Bose and Fidelio
2) Revo
3) Sony
4) no. Sorry. Sennheiser just NO. The designer should be ashamed...

Battery:
1) Sony and Bose (more or less 15 hours)
2) Fidelio, Jabra and Sennheiser (more or less 10 Hours, with Sennheiser giving the chance to buy an extra battery as reserve)

Comfort:
1) Sony (because Around the Ear)
2) Bose and Sennheiser
3) Revo and Fidelio (specially the new M2BT)

Bluetooth Range:
1) Bose and Sony
2) Fidelio and Revo
3) Sennheiser

Functions:
1) Bose and Fidelio (clear winners for the double connectivity)
Then the others are more or less the same, each with little pros and cons.

EDIT: In the last months I have tested many more Headphones (more than 30). Some of them portable enough to be in this review.
But I just cannot make such a huge review, so I have opened a Thread on Head-Fi, which actually became very successful. It is called ""Huge Comparison of [almost] all the best Bluetooth Headphones"". If you visit us there, we will be pleased to help you finding the right BT Headphone for you.
Here I can only say that my favourite ""portable BT Headphone"" is now the AKG Y45BT. And my favourite main BT Headphone is the Audio Technica ATH-WS99BT.
If you want to know why, visit my Thread, and ask :D

Well, I hope this was helpful to you, and feel free to ask for what else you would like to know, or to comment if you have found some other very good sounding and very portable BT Headphone!"
4,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these headphones for more than a year now. I use them almost everyday, through day at work and afterwards to study. However, in the last few months, the earpad cushions have gradually torn off and right now are almost falling off the earphones themselves. I am shocked to say the least. I have really enjoyed these earphones, they have really been quite functional for me. But i really don't understand how the ear pad cushions get torn after just over a year of use, i thought they were built to last. I really would not mind replacing the ear pad cushions, but i don't even know how to go about that. Would appreciate some feedback, first on if this is supposed to happen and if yes, how does one replace them, because the earphones themselves seem fine and it would be a shame to have to abandon them, because they earpads have finally torn off. Attached pictures"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Beats Solo 2 and this Bose On-ear wireless at the same time to see which one I liked. Bose was a clear winner for me. The Beats headset was really snug and I could see it being uncomfortable with long time wear. Also the Bose is significantly lighter than the Beats. I tried out the Bluetooth and it works very well. I was able to leave my phone in one room and walk all over my apartment into other rooms while talking on the phone clearly. I like the sound better on the Bose as well, vocals are more crisper. I have small ears and had trouble with earbuds fitting properly and I'm glad to find a set of headphones that sit comfortably on my ears. I also tried the around-ear bose wireless and they were nice too, but too large for my head, i can see the around-ear headphones blocking out more environmental noise though. These on-ear Bose headphones do a great job for me, looking forward to traveling with these."
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This purchase is one of the nicest things I have done for myself. I use head phones so I don't disturb my apartment neighbors and these set me free from the headphone cord. Thanks, Bose, for a superior product. I chose the on ear set because I wear glasses and find the over ear headphone end up hurting because of the pressure on the glasses stems."
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just opened the package and paired it with my iPhone 5S in 5 seconds. Great sound! I am comparing it to my Sennheiser RS 180 Digital Wireless Headphones that use an audio jack to plug into my PC.

Both display very crisp sound. The Bose unit is giving me slightly more bass, but the sound is quite pleasant. No equalizer override is being used on either device.

Before purchasing the Bose unit I was wondering if the 'over-the-ear' design would provide too much ear pressure for my comfort level. It does not. Good insulation from outside noises! It is light-weight and should not impose any ""pain"" when wearing for multiple hours.

Crisp highs and good balance along the frequency range. Both pairs of headphones took me to the same maximum frequency range that I can hear before fading out--about 12,000Hz. So my sample does not provide adequate testing for high-frequency response.

The unit is constructed solidly with strong plastic and metal which hopefully means it won't get broken from normal use. I like the padding that goes over my head and the soft rubber covers that touch my ears.

Phone calls are clean for both sides of the conversation and it works seamlessly with no buttons to push on the headphones. It is packaged with a handy storage case that contains cables for recharging and plug-in to an audio port.

It tells me that charge level when I turn it on. It tells me the name of the device I'm paired to. I paired to my iPad and iPhone at the same time and was listening to two sound tracks at once.

No skipping when connected to my iPhone. I did notice skipping when connected to a Winbook T100 (likely the fault of the Winbook).

The only downside to this item is the size of the volume/next switches on it--very small to find/access/operate. This may improve with practice."
8,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is very satisfying. Phone calls are good also, but still sounds odd to me when both ears are covered. I hear my voice in my head rather than through the air and then into my ears - if that makes sense. Pairs easily with two devices at once and plays music (or GPS voice) on either. Other bluetooth devices I've had would pair with two devices, but only play music from the first device paired. Feels more comfortable to me than the around the ear ones that I tried also. My negative with these is that if you're going to be very active, these WILL slide from the top of your head. If I'm walking, they're great, but if you bend over, the top slides off my head and I have to catch them. The around-ear ones are more secure, but also hotter and not as comfortable to me. With the around-ear model I tried, there was limited room to adjust them on my head when they started to feel uncomfortable. With these sitting on the outside of my ears, I can just do a slight shift forward or back or even up or down and it feels better."
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the third set of Bluetooth headphones I've owned, and easily the best. In evaluating Bluetooth headphones I find one has to look at battery life, Bluetooth range, and ease of pairing along with the criteria for traditional wired phones (i.e., sound quality, comfort and fit, construction quality). So, I'm going to focus a bit on these aspects.

My first pair were from Sony - DRBT50's - and were okay. They're well-built and comfortable, and of the over-the-ear design I prefer for headphones. They paired easily and the battery life was decent but not great. They charged via a separate AC adapter, which some people would find more convenient, whereas I prefer phones that charge via a USB cable and computer. It's easy to find an AC adapter to use with a USB cable, but not so easy to remember to carry around a proprietary charger. The sound of this set was middling, but they were among the first available, so I found the sound acceptable since there weren't many options without spending a fortune. Range was only average, they began to cut out about 15 feet from the sound source.

My second set were Parrot Ziks. Frankly, I hated them though they were the darling of the audiophile class when I bought them. The design is totally quirky IMO. They're bulky, and they earpieces didn't extend far enough for me to get a comfortable fit. They don't come with a case, though they certainly should for the price. Pairing was a nightmare with every device I tried though I eventually got them working with everything (phone, iPad, computer). Tech support was nonexistent, though it may have improved; I don't know. One feature I liked was the replaceable battery, permitting one to buy and carry a spare. Another was the ""tap to control"" feature for volume adjustment. Sound was stellar, but to me that was the only strength to these otherwise overpriced phones. Range was good, not great; about 20 feet maximum with no obstructions.

That brings me to the Bose. I'd prefer an over-the-ear design, but at least these are very good for an on--the-ear design. They fit well and are extremely comfortable, they just don't block out as much ambient sound as I wish they did. I also wish they were noise canceling. Battery charging is easy using the supplied USB cable (and since I had a ton of similar cables laying around and always keep one in my briefcase to charge other stuff it means I'll never be without a means to charge them). Battery life is fantastic, I regularly get the claimed 15 hours. I also like having the controls on the rear of the right earpiece. They work flawlessly for adjusting volume, skipping songs, etc. Early wired phones had no way of controlling any of these; while later wired ones do, usually via a cable in-line design, they tend to be iffy in my experience, working with some devices (often only ones from Apple) but not others. That kept me wedded to my iPod when I'd have preferred to simply use my phone (currently an iPhone 6, but I've had every other generation of the iPhone as well as a Galaxy S4 and Note 2). These phones finally let me cut the cord to my iPod. I now exclusively use my iPhone, and can easily adjust volume or skip songs just using the earpiece controls. Finally, these have excellent range, about 25 feet with no walls, and 15 or so with.

Now to the sound. It's very good, comparable to the Ziks. If you're a Bose QC user you'll like these. If you prefer Beats, these will be lighter on the bass than you're used to. As a final note, you can listen to these via a supplied cable if the battery runs down, but the sound gets comparatively tinny, so it's only useful in a pinch. If these phones were over-the-ear and had noise canceling they'd be perfect, but even without those features they're still a great pair of Bluetooth phones."
10,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned Bose in the past, my boyfriend recently bought be the Bose Sound True Ultra In ear headphones and like most people I had issues with the wires bunching up before they begin to crack open. He recently told me to order what headphones I would like and be happy with and I chose these because they are bluetooth and I can used an Audio cable if I want to, plus I like on ear headphones more than Over or around ear headphones. I haven't tested the bluetooth feature yet, but I love them. My only complaint would be that I wish the case that you get was a little more roomier"
11,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these at the gym and YES for the most part they stay on your head.... great build quality and solid sound...wish they were a tad louder but probably just as well that they are not. I used these on the flat bench, incline and decline bench and they will stay on your head. They did tilt a bit on the decline bench but a quick adjustment and I was good to go. When I got up from the decline bench they stayed put! Also nice NOT dealing with a cable! In ear headphones are less of a hassle and I also owned and used a set of SoundTrue™ in-ear headphones in the gym I was however discouraged with the fullness of the sound of in ear sets.... if you want superior full sound while working out these are hard to beat (yes nice full bass as well) ! Size is nice - not bulky like many of the more expensive Beats LARGE wireless headphones. So YES they get my vote for being practical in a gym situation. Could you use them for a crazy circuit training routine where you are moving your body rapidly and jumping up and down? .... probably not :-)"
12,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a comfortable pair of headphones, and the sound quality is as good as I can tell. (I'm not a musician, and I mostly listen to spoken word.) The downside is that Bluetooth pairing is complicated and unreliable. It doesn't remember more than two devices at a time, often forgets the devices it has paired, and has trouble connecting. Once it's set up, it's OK until the next time; but it has real trouble if it loses connection to a device (e.g. the phone ran out of power and turned off) and has to reconnect, sometimes requiring a full setup again."
13,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In love. I bought this item about a week ago, I charged it once until 100% and a week later 60%. Great battery life. Perfect fit, not big at all and not too small. As for the cushions, comfortable. And of course they will wear out after a year, after constant use and mostly sweat, it’s bound to happen, good thing replacement is affordable and easy to replace(haven’t done so yet, since they are new, but I did do some research before buying). Overall, if you need some comfy headphones. I recommend these over beats. Oh and sound is perfect!!!"
14,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought two of these, and used them for a verity of devices, iPhone, Android Phones (S4, S6 Edge, HTC) , Mac Book(s) and PC.

Cushion on the ear pieces are comfortable enough, no noise cancellation, people around you could hear on full volume, but again there is no reason for anybody to go on full volumes. Used if for long hour work calls on many occasions.

Pros :
o Light weight, easy to tuck it in to the case and take it with you anywhere.
o You can listen to music even when the battery is out of charge. (no microphone usage though)
o Pairs to up to two devices simultaneously. While you are listening to music on Mac/PC, you can pick up the calls.
o On ear volume/call controllers are great.
o Can remember up to 6 devices.

Cons :
o The white one could get dirty easily. requires more periodic cleaning to keep it looking better.
o While listening to music from one device, phone call is a bit distorted, Wish Bose would have done a better job of cutting off the steam from the first device, or let me set a high priority to a device.
o For the price, I wish the case could have been hard case not a soft one."
15,1.0 out of 5 stars,"FALLING APART AFTER A YEAR!

While it's not a bad item, which I'd give a ""B"" rating to, look at how it's falling apart on both sides after about a yer of moderate use. I will not pay for replacements and am actively seeking what its warranty says.

At this price, I expect much better."
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best Headphones I have ever possessed. Unmatched bose sound quality. Very comfortable on ear phones. The best part I like about these headphones is that they seamlessly connect from one gadget to the other ones you've paired them. I have them connected to my iPhone 6 plus, Ipad as well as macbook. All you need to do is disconnect from one gadget and they automatically connect to the one whose bluetooth is on. On a hot humid day also they don't seem to feel irritable over the ears. Very happy with the purchase. Need to also mention that even though I think they are not advertised as noise reduction phones, they seem to be doing the job alright. Even with a very very low volume you cannot hear the outside noise at all. One last thing.... they fold immaculately into the case provided."
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing headphones. Bought as a present for wife to remplace Dr Dre beats and the quality is just much superior as well as sound quality as expected from BOSE!!!
18,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very comfortable headphone with pretty decent sound quality. I was coming from an older pair of Bose Triport headphones that I used for years for listening enjoyment and for work as a professional musician as recording monitors and for transcribing recordings. I was looking at these as a replacement.

Pros:
These bluetooth phones function as advertised allowing you to connect to your phone and another device such as a computer or tablet. When used as a headset for calling I received no complaints from callers and most said they didn't hear a difference between me talking on it and straight from my iPhone 4s. Pauses playback when calls come in and resumes when finished.

Decent sound quality and detail for bluetooth headphones. I went to the Bose store after purchasing these and tried all of their current headphones and these seemed to have the most open, natural sound compared to the other headphones.

Good quality construction. I don't have a problem with there being a lot of plastic in these as the design is solid as long as you don't abuse them.

Comes with a cable for non-bluetooth connections.

Comes with a nice hard case for transporting! Something I can't say about my Grado headhones which cost more than these.

Cons:
While the sound was decent it was not as open as my older triports. Everything sounded very compressed even with lossless music files.

The instruments/voices seemed to be mashed together and hard to distinguish. Everything seemed veiled.

The volume was not as much as I would like with the bluetooth. When using corded it was a little better as was the sound but that isn't what I purchased these for.

In the end while they are quality bluetooth headphones - the best I have listened to and I listened to and returned a lot of them - they weren't an upgrade for my current headphones. I wound up getting new ear pads for the triports and picked up a pair of Grado SR325e headphones which sound better than anything I have ever experienced with the exception of my vintage Marantz 2270/Imperial VII combination. These are great for passive listening or office listening when you need to have the ability to keep an ear open for your phone."
19,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had these for almost 2 years, relying on them daily for work, on both a phone and a computer. The bluetooth connectivity/audio quality often degrades, usually mid-call, when connected to a new Macbook Air. Has constant problems when connected to two devices, often disconnecting from my phone (and announcing it) while I'm on computer audio, leaving a gap in communication. Updating the firmware and erasing the connection sometimes helps for a few days, but it always degrades again.

I'm hoping that mine are just a dud, but I certainly expect more from a $200+ pair of BT headphones."
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphone have very powerful and fascinated sound.I'm not a fan of Bose , but this make me want to invest more on another Bose product. I don't wonder Bose Soundlink On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones is the best Bluetooth headphones in the current market.It offer high quality sound without sacrifice comfortableness and convenience.
With elegant and ingenious design, every parts of Bose Soundlink On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones can change with spare part.It make this easier to maintain and fix.You can buy new earmuffs and change it by yourself. If you've found any problems with cable you can just change it with a new one.Besides It provide you with multi-devices function, you can watch movie or music simultaneously with phone call.
However, it's not flawless.It can connect with Android operation system without any problems but with PC or iOS it's another story.There're some major problems when you pair this up with windows 8 operation system. Windows 8 will automatically put this headphones on ""Handsfree Telephony"" mode, It will make very terrible sound in this mode. You have to fix them by right-click on the device in ""Devices and printers"" then click on properties accessing to service tap after that you have to uncheck ""Handsfree Telephony"" service. It's annoying because you have to do this every time that you remove device from your computer memory.Apart from this problem, it also have some problem with transmission. There're sound lagging and inconsistency some time."
21,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are super comfortable and the sound is great. I was concerned about the ease of pairing, but really it couldn't be simpler. It immediately found my ipad and iphone and stays connected at a distance. When they're folded up and in the storage case, they're a little thicker than I'd like (softball sized, larger than an orange) but I can pack around them. The sound quality is really great. I also watched a full season of an Amazon Prime series and the battery was still at 100%. Great headphones!"
22,1.0 out of 5 stars,It will easily fall from your head if you bend over.
23,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I picked up a set of these a few days ago, and am delighted with them. As others have noted, the sound quality is excellent, which is particularly noteworthy considering their use of Bluetooth for wireless connections, a technology that is not generally known for its high fidelity. In that sense, this is a significant engineering achievement -- these sound better to me than some of the wired 'phones that I own, which is remarkable.

I can't over-emphasize the great sense of listening freedom you get when you lose the wired connection on your headphones. No more accidental ripping them off your ears when the wiring gets caught on something or if you move your hand too quickly in the wrong direction. No more cables tethering you to your phone or MP3 player -- the source device can be charging up nearby while you move around the room instead of being stuffed in a pocket with wires dangling all over your body, waiting to catch on something.

Another significant achievement is the long battery life. I have an older set of Bluetooth phones from another company that have a maximum battery life of about three hours. The SoundLink On-Ear phones, by comparison, are speciifed to last up to 15 hours -- enough time that you don't need to worry about a sudden shutdown in the middle of your favorite album or playlist. When I asked a Bose sales guy whether the battery is user-replaceable or not, he told me the it should be able to withstand 2,500 recharge cycles. If this is true, then it's likely that something else on the phones will break or fail long before the battery stops holding a charge.

Although Bose is quite up front about these not offering their well-known noise canceling feature, I tried these out on a recent plane ride anyway, and found that they are indeed no replacement for noise canceling phones like QC15s or QC20s in this environment. I would estimate they passively reduced ambient aircraft noise by about 50%, which forced me to increase the volume significantly higher than the QC20s I also had with me. This high volume level is not good for one's ears, so I must reluctantly report that these are not really a good solution for use on planes. However, I did justify getting these anyway because I believe I will use them far more frequently than my QCs because 1) I am not usually on a plane, 2) they are more convenient to use everywhere else, and 3) they do nicely block out most noises that you'll likely encounter in traditional listening environments.

Portability is another nice feature of these phones. When folded up in their carrying case, they are easy to throw in a bag or briefcase, although the case is nowhere near as small as the one for the QC20s and is about twice as thick as the one for Bose OE2s (wired on-ear phones). Still, they are much smaller than the carrying case for the QC15s and QC25s, so if you're used to taking along these QC bigger phones for general listening, I think the SoundLink On-Ears are a lot easier to pack and carry.

Finally, they are quite comfortable to wear. Bose has developed the softest, most compliant on-ear pads in the business, and they are a pleasure to experience. They fit me better than the OE2s, having enough extension range to easily cover my ears without putting too much pressure on the top of head. Much appreciated, and quite pleasant to listen with for hours. It's also a comfort knowing that if a phone call comes in on my iPhone while using these, I can use the phones to take it -- no worry about missing important calls while you're immersed in your music.

While $250 may understandably seem a bit steep for a pair of headphones to some people -- and I'm sure Bose is deservedly enjoying a good profit margin accordingly -- I will say that the attention to detail and excellent engineering these phones represent is a very good value for the money. How much is it worth to avoid ear or head discomfort? How much is it worth to have relatively great sound quality without wires tangling up when you move around? How much is it worth to have 12+ hours of uninterrupted sound without a recharge? These are a thoughtfully designed, high quality product that are well worth a listen."
24,4.4 out of 5 stars,"Overall not a bad product, but after 6 months the ear pads have lost their cushioning and are flat and hard. It does get several hours of use each day, but I did expect better durability from such a respected brand. The cable also stopped working after only occasional use, which isn't a huge deal because it is primarily used with BT, but speaking of that, the volume is fairly limited while on BT - a common problem with BT headphones in general, I suspect limited purposefully to extend battery life, but I'd like to crank it if I want to!"
25,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a gift for my husband (I already have a pair), and he was skeptical because they are not officially ""noise cancelling"". But he finally tried them on a recent trip and was happily surprised. My experience with them has also been fantastic... I own an older and larger pair of Bose that are noise cancelling, and these actually work better in terms of screening out background noise. Plus they are smaller and easier to travel with. Love Bose quality and sound!"
26,3.5 out of 5 stars,"Got them as a gift. Great sound. The only knock I have is that I wear glasses so after hours of wearing the headset, it can irritate around the glass ear loop."
27,4.3 out of 5 stars,"All I can say is Wow! I have tried many bluetooth headphones and these have to be the best. Great sound (as good as the QC25's) and I can make it to every corner of my house with a connected iPhone at the center of the house. It is also great with the voice prompts and with a flick of the switch I'm able to switch to any of my many connected IOS devices. If you purchase a set, be sure to go to the Bose website and update the software. Very soft cushions and I can wear these for several hours without fatigue."
28,3.9 out of 5 stars,"I bought this from Amazon for a gift, but I have owned a pair that I bought on vacation in Toronto for over a year. These are great headphones. They have survived almost daily use, being thrown in my backpack and getting smooshed by books and stuff. When you turn it on, it tells you the battery remaining. I only have to charge them maybe once a week. I wear them while I do work outside and while I exercise. The only problem I have is that they don't stay on very well when bending over sometimes. But they aren't really designed as exercise headphones so I don't hold that against them. This is a very well designed and constructed product."
29,4.2 out of 5 stars,"Excellent all around design. I've enjoyed the Bose OE2 wired headphones but these are a big step forward in convenience and features. Soft ear foam makes these cushy and comfortable for long periods of time on the ears. There are headphones with cushier ear pads but these are a balance between soft and good fit. I've worn these while doing tasks that challenged their ability to stay on my head and they passed the test. Mind you I'm not a jogger so I can't speak to that. Sound quality is clear and crisp with enough base for my taste but I tend to listen to mostly classic rock with occasional blues, retro punk, and oldies. One thing my wife pointed out. ..they fit comfortably without messing up her hair lol. Yeah some headphones can leave your hair looking like it was run over by a lawn mower :-) from the weight and pressure, she's right!

Super compact, folding design, and a travel case adds to the convenience factor. The ability to change tunes with on ear controls of forward and back options, pause, play are something I love and adds to my enjoyment in using these. Well built and despite plastic design they don't feel cheap to me. Range is not as good as other wirelss headphones I've used but you'll get 20 feet comfortably. When I went into my garage 30 feet away from my cellphone I started to get a little break in the sound.

They came fully charged, thank you Bose. These are mighty pricey and you'll find similar sound quality in some less expensive BT headphones but for all around convenience, portability, sound quality, build quality with comfort and great battery life it's hard to beat."
30,4.6 out of 5 stars,"I have had my Bose SoundLink headset for about a week now. I am using it with my droid turbo android phone. Had no trouble pairing though I was a bit hesitant when I received them because the box said they were designed for apple products. They sound great but have had issues with the sound skipping the past couple of days and was really bad today. I went onto an apple forum and found that other people having the same issue while using with their apple product.. It was mentioned that turning wifi off would help the issue which it did. No skipping at all when wifi is off. This bothers me because when I first received them I had no problems for several days (with wifi on). Now I have to turn wifi off every time I listen. Also have had issues with the pause/play, forward/back button. It is non-responsive at times and I have to turn bt off and then on again on my phone when this happens and it seems to correct the issue for the time. I have a $60 set of Scosche HZ8 headsets that sound about as good as the $250 Bose SoundLink but are not very comfortable after listening for a while. I do think Bose products are overpriced but as I mentioned they do sound great, and are comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. They also cancel outside noise better than the Scosche headset, but not completely because they are on ear rather than around ear. Good sound and functionality when they are working well. I would recommend the Bose SoundLink if you really take your music seriously as I do and don't mind spending the $."
31,4.2 out of 5 stars,"These were bought as NEW and when we received them the packaging had been opened and they were fully charged - don't know what to make of that. In any case, when we took them out of the box they appeared brand new and everything was there and properly packed.

I bought these as a surprise for my wife, who has gone through a series of ear buds and lesser devices with little satisfaction in any of them She has been using these for a week now and they still have a 30% charge. She LOVES them (she thought I spent too much on them, but she always says that). I always maintain that you get what you pay for, and these are living testimony to that principle. After seeing how well hers worked, she encouraged me to order a set for myself (they just came today). Great product, a snap to set up and use, terrific sound quality."
32,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound quality for a Bluetooth wireless technology. Very comfortable and lightweight. Charges very quickly and has a long battery life - charge holds for 15 hours as advertised. I have used it on a long journey flight (~ 14 hours) and I did not have to charge at all. Had little trouble connecting to PC, the output sound is low compared to other connections but I can live with that. Had no issues connecting with my iphone, ipad, android devices(two devices simultaneously). I wanted these because of the ease of use due to losing the wires - a sense of freedom. These headphones deliver irrespective of the music genre. You get a very lively, crisp and clear sound. Try them out at a store, listen for yourself, compare with other models and you would not put them down. Very happy with my purchase. Highly recommended."
33,4.8 out of 5 stars,"After reading many reviews for this and other headphones, I must say that these are very good wuality and the sound has a rich bass. I own a V Moda over the ear headphones that are not NC and corded. The Bose on the ear is slightly more comfortable and better sound. I will be taking a long business trip in the next 2 weeks and will update. UPDATE: The battery life is awesome. I got about 14 hours on a charge (lasted longer than an iPad Air 2 and iPhone 6+). While it did not drown out the engines, it was quite a quiet ride with the headphones. The bass is nice and richer than my VModa over the ear, good mid and high notes too."
34,4.1 out of 5 stars,"I have tried so many headphones and these are hands down the best ones. I have ran across way to bulky, heavy, not the best sounding one. My main use if for the gym. These are so small and light that I actually enjoy wearing them. I can barely tell I am wearing them. I had tried on the beats solo and really loved them but couldn't spend 300 on them! These are even better than them. Sound quality is great and they are much lighter than the beats."
35,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a birthday gift for my boyfriend a few years ago and he still loves them. Uses them frequently for his daily commute on public transit and they do a great job of blocking out unwanted sound with good sound quality itself. He’s a big music fan who always complains about using bad quality speakers, but he likes these. Battery still lasts several days."
36,4.5 out of 5 stars,"I don't know what took me so long to buy wireless headphones.I happen to try these out at a big box store one day and loved them. They are extremely comfortable and for me, the sound is very nice. I am not an audiophile so I am not into high, low and mid range very much. My requirements are nice sound quality, do they fit over my ears nicely and do they feel comfortable as they sit on my head. Answer to all three is a resounding yes. I bought them thinking I would use them in the house but after using them a few times I am wearing them to work, as I do chores, etc. I did not need the capability to answer calls on my phone but so far that functionality has proved very useful and works well."
37,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing! I can't believe how long the batteries last, I using it for work and get my phone calls, skype and play music all the time. I can walk around the house which is a big 3,000 house and I hear as clear as I am by the devices connected too. Compared to the Beats wireless this is 150% better and less expensive. I am super happy with my new headphones. The only issue is that my iMac keep getting disconnected but so does my bluetooth mouth and keyboard so I am think is a computer issue and not a headphone problem, the other devices, BookPro and Iphone 6 work perfect."
38,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Compact, comfortable and sounds absolutely great for a Bluetooth headphone. It also works well as a headset for phone calls, its buttons are easy to operate by feel, and battery life is really good. I've gotten hours of playing music and also binge watch a whole season of house of cards with about 40% battery left. It's somewhat expensive and the sound in wired mode isn't great. It might be a little pricey, but it's also one of the best -- if not the best -- on-ear wireless(bluetooth) headphones to date in my opinion."
39,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing headphones. I used beats wireless headphones and just got the Bose and I just want to say BOSE IS THE BOSS in headphones and music clarity. Best one I ever heard. Very easy set up just turn on the power and connect to your phone or tablet. Great battery life and I used for 4 hours straight and I didn't feel anything on my ears. For beats after an hour it hurt my ears. I love this product and strongly recommend if someone is looking for wireless headphones. You will get the price worth trust me.
40,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, the sound over Bluetooth is amazing. It is clear and crisp. I tried the phone call function and it worked flawlessly. Yes, it really does work in very loud or windy situations. I have a Bose sound system in my vehicle and I would not settle for any other headphones. I compared these to many other brands and models but the Bose SoundLink was the clear winner. The look awesome. They fit well. So easy to adjust. The only downside is that I have pinched my fingers unfolding them. Still love these!"
41,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight. Comfy pads and fits well on my small head. Pairs easily with my iPhone and Macbook. Great for commuting to work and using at my desk.

Cons: Sometimes audio is out of sync when using with macbook (unpairing and pairing usually fixes, but annoying)

Pro/Con: It can be paired with two devices but sometimes hard to switch if I am using them with my computer and get a phone call if I answer with the headphones on it won't switch the audio automatically. Had some confusion but manually can solve by turning bluetooth off for device not using."
42,5.0 out of 5 stars,My mom absolutely loves these. She has poor cell reception in her house so this lets her leave her phone by the window and walk around her house while she talks. She constantly says “I’m talking to you on my BOSE headphones”
43,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Saved our marriage! Not quite, but it has quieted (pun intended) the complain of a loud TV with a hard of hearing husband and a wife uninterested in the news. Easy to install on our Samsung TV, great sound."
44,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good headphones that have held up through extensive use. I've never had any major issues getting the bluetooth to work, and the sound quality is much better than most in-ear headphones."
45,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones, especially if you where eyeglasses. I use them every day for watching movies/TV. The charge seems to last very long, and pairs easily. I would not recommend them for exercise as the ear pads are too absorbent and might wear out prematurely."
46,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These Bose SoundLink On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones are absolutely the best. It's amazing how much nicer it is without the wires. The pairing was VERY easy - I paired mine to my iPhone and my MacBook, The audible sound will tell you how full the battery is, but I haven't had to charge mine yet and it's been two weeks. The sound is absolutely phonemail - super crisp and clear. When I'm watching a movie on my MacBook, it will cut to my iPhone when a call comes in, which is great. The buttons on the right earphone has the volume controls and call answer/end.

I think that the wired option sounds just as great (the product comes with a wire to plug into left earphone). I'm pretty happy with the entire product - I think Bose did a tremendous job of making the best wireless headphones that wear ultra-comfortably and are easy on the ears. I'll 1) never use wired headphones again 2) always use Bose!"
47,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned these. The Bluetooth was glitchy - every once in a while the music would drop out then come back in. Also they did not get loud enough for me. They look nicely made, and noise reduction worked pretty good but I didn't like the functionality. I'll stick with their wired headphones."
48,4.4 out of 5 stars,Right side died less than a year after purchase. Awesome sound while they lasted. Don't recommend purchasing though. $199 is a lot for a set of headphones that don't last a year.
49,4.5 out of 5 stars,"All I can say about these headphones is WOW! My husband wanted wireless Beats by Dr. Dre for Christmas. I started looking things up and was a little surprised at the price. Bose has always stood out to me as a name of quality, so I turned to the reviews of Amazon to help me decide what to do. Hands down Bose was the way to go.
I thought wireless was overrated, but I can’t overemphasize how wrong I was. I borrow his Bose quite often and am so happy with the total freedom. I like to listen to music while I vacuum, but usually with wired headphones, I’m always tangled up. This is a thing of the past.
The sound quality is stunning. The bass is clear and crisp without the disturbance you can sometimes get from music with a strong beat. These are not noise cancelling, so if you’re in a loud area, be careful not to keep turning the volume up to unsafe levels."
50,3.5 out of 5 stars,"This Bose headset is a heavenly product. I had a Sony MDR-ZX750BN headset which fortunately drowned after slipping off my ear and into my bathtub while I was relaxing. I say fortunately because I could not hear in my Sony headphone while my bathtub was running.
I decided to replace my Sony with the real deal Bose. Even though it cost more I was happy to say that Bose passed the bathtub test. I can hear clearly even while my bathtub is running. Since purchasing Bose I am back on my treadmill on my workout routine. My music sounds so great that I'm pumped up to work out again. Thanks Bose for a great product."
51,4.3 out of 5 stars,"They worked fine until the ear cushion came apart. The replacement from Bose is IMPOSSIBLE to fit to the headphone. So you end up with a headphone that cannot be worn. Bose was absolutely no assistance. You cannot mail the earphones in to be repaired, and their only solution was for me to drive two hours from where I live to a Bose store, where someone ""might"" be able to assist.
Do not waste your money. Look elsewhere."
52,3.9 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as a Father's Day gift to my husband. We have several Bose products and of course, he simply loves this headphone. He already had the over the ear, but he fell in love with this smaller unit when he tried out my son's model. Like the over the ear, this on ear headphone sports a perfect and comfortable fit and the sound is clear and crisp, as all Bose products are. Thanks, Bose, you have another satisfied customer."
53,4.2 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because I spend most of my day on conference calls. I had some Sony wireless headphones that had tons of background noise. My peers would complain about the background noise most of the time even when I was muted. I decided to give these a try. Not only did they eliminate all background noise, but they feel and sound great! The voice recording let's you know what percentage of battery you are at when turned on and what device you are connected to. It also tells you when the battery is low. They are of high quality and feel great to the touch. They are super light and they are super compact for travel. I stick them in my laptop bag and when I'm on the go."
54,4.6 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money feel cheap and not durable they are better headphone.
55,4.2 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift to my wife... she loves them! They are super light weight. They are super easy to setup through Bluetooth (not like others that take forever to be recognized by your phone, etc). The hold their charge fairly well... I think she used them on and off for about 5 days without charging them... probably about 2-3 hrs a day."
56,4.3 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a replacement for my old QC3's. After much comparison (Parrot Ziks, Beats, old QC3's) these are amazing! They don't have the active noise cancelling of the old QC3's but they sound much better and are far cheaper than the QC3's were originally. The bluetooth features are great, the battery lasts a very, very long time. I love these headphones!"
57,4.8 out of 5 stars,I got these for my nephew for Christmas and he went nuts as this was the one he wanted. They are very high quality and very sharp and clear to listen with. We are very very happy with this and so glad we got them.
58,4.1 out of 5 stars,The left side of the earphone stopped working! And i just using it for a week for only 15-20 minutes a day! 👎🏽
59,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones , cushions are not durable and are expensive to replace"
60,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Best head phones I have ever owned. Turn them on and they connect quickly. Push the power up again, it gives you the battery charge %.

Intuitive to use, awesome sound. Great mid-level head phones.

Unless you have to have noise cancelling, these headphone have just about everything else."
61,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these for making phone calls 90% of the time and for music the other 10%. With that in mind...

PROS:
*Sound quality is top notch for both voice and music
*Volume is good for most every condition
*They feel great and can be worn all day without issue
*Sound blocking is really great blocking out a great deal of ambient noise
*Range is good (not amazing but good) with my Note 4 and iPhone
*The look is very modern and as a middle age person I don't feel out of place with them
*Battery life is beyond real

CONS:
*The controls are a bit hard to hit quickly; not bad but not great
*The quality of the microphone is just average which is why I took two stars away; I was really expecting a high end microphone - if you don't make any/many calls with this add two stars back
*There is no MUTE control so to mute a call you have to have access to your phone at all times
*The case is just OK. I would rather have a hard side case but that is just my preference"
62,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best headphones . Light and easy to run with and does not look like those huge headphones. classic style and stands out and great music. love it
63,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pricey, yes, but let me explain why I think they're worth it.

Excellent headphones. They fit comfortably on my head; the cushions feel like clouds on my ears, which is not something most headphones do for me.

The sound quality is good, I would be hard pressed to find a flaw in the headphones that isn't a result of a problem in the audio file.

I like the cord that comes with them, allowing me to plug them in via an aux port. It is convenient for the off chance that the batteries die.

The battery is great. It lasts for a solid waking day's worth of use without charging.

The headphones charge via micro USB, which is preferable to any sort of proprietary charger. I am able to use my phone charger to charge the headphones.

The dual channel Bluetooth is a dream, I am able to connect to both my laptop and my phone at the same time, with no cords getting in the way. Switching between audio sources is easy, all you have to do is stop playing media on one device, then start on the other device.

7/16/2016 Edit: Over the past few months, the bluetooth has started to cut out occasionally. A couple weeks ago, it disconnected and then reconnected to my phone almost a dozen times, interrupting the movie I was watching each time. This morning I went to turn the headphones on, and was greeted by nothing. I knew they were charged, as I had just unplugged them, but I wasn't even getting sound from the headphones, let alone a confirmation that they had connected to my devices. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this problem, considering I bought these headphones for $250. This is completely unacceptable for such a costly device, especially considering the care I took with it.

7/25/2015 Edit: Since my last edit, I've mostly been using the plug-in wire for the headphones. Two days ago, the bluetooth suddenly started working again. I've changed my rating to 4/5 now, and I will continue to update as necessary. Also, I'd like to mention that Bose support, while I did not end up calling them, responded very quickly and seemed very quickly to my 7/16/2016 edit, which is a huge plus for me."
64,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound. I would say these are the most balanced Bluetooth headphones I have tried. Super comfortable, if not slightly goofy looking how they bend out a bit. I know why they do this, so that they can be more comfortable and don't feel like you have an anvil tightening against your head."
65,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE THEM! This was my first pair of on-ear headphones ever, so I was skeptical. These headphones are so frickin' soft and comfortable that they practically massage my ears. I can, and do wear them for hours at a time listening to music, or watching movies on my computer. The sound quality is excellent. Even listening to videos on YouTube that were recorded too low can be heard very well through these headphones. The bass is incredible..just right. Not overpowering at all. **I have small ears, and the headphone cups cover my ears perfectly (they measure approx 3in long x 2.25 wide).

Headphones paired easily to my iphone and Macbook (can connect to both simultaneously). I can also answer calls while listening to music, etc. The headphones also come with a handy carry case for protection. Battery life is incredible, and the earphones talk so you know by percentage how much battery life remains. I also like that it calls my name to tell me what it's paired to ""Connected to Jane Doe's Macbook Pro, and Jane Doe's iphone."" How cool is that? :-)

Range is decent..I wander pretty far on two different floors at home. Staying paired works great through floors--if the device I'm connected to is in direct field (basically above/below me). I have also remained paired while wearing the headphones outside as I washed the car in my driveway--with the computer in direct field maybe 35ft away in the house, and behind a closed door. I was impressed.

I considered buying Beats at first, but suffer from Tinnitus. I worried that the extreme bass associated with Beats could cause me further damage/discomfort. I don't worry about that now. There's a nice mix of high's and low's in the Bose SoundLink. Listening with these is like having my own personal concert. **Sound does leak out, but NOT IN. That's not a bad thing with Tinnitus. It serves as a nice reminder for me to be careful with my volume when in public.

This is an excellent product, from a name that knows sound!"
66,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, deep base and clean - paired with my Samsung S6 and light enough to work out with. Pairs easily with devices and talking on the phone is easy. Folds up nicely to fit in my backpack pouch.
Ears get sweaty sometimes and I wish the ear pads were made of a breathable material- my only con. Use most everyday for 6 months now."
67,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was bought s gift and the person loved it! They sound great and very convenient if hearing music and you get a call you can speak to the person and don't miss a call!
68,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones. So comfortable..I have worn them for hours with no discomfort. Very lightweight, soft leather on the ears and compact....and Pairing is so easy. I like the way the headphone talk to you letting you know which device it's pairing to.... So cool! The sound and quality is incredible! Crystal clear natural sound and NOT overpowering bass like some of the other popular headphones. It also comes with a cool storage case. It fits right in my pocketbook with ease. Love these headphones! Bose is the absolute best in audio technology! They did an excellent job with these wireless headphones! Don't hesitate to get these."

70,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just have to say that this headphones are super comfortable. My last premium pair would not work when you were 10 feet away. This one has not had one little issue as I walk around my house talking on the phone or listing to music. I do however wish it has a much sexer look to it. But the quality of sound is great,"
71,4.0 out of 5 stars,When my dog ate my co-workers headphones I felt I had to replace them. He loves them and I'm so happy that I got these ones for him. He says they were better than his original BOSE headphones
72,4.4 out of 5 stars,"I tried their NC buds at the office and while they were truly amazing I got nauseous within minutes and couldn't shake it. Darn it!

A coworker got these locally on Black Friday and paid ... I'm not even going to mention it because it's ridiculous. But once I tried his I just HAD TO HAVE THEM!

After I bought these it occurred to me that maybe I would do better with their on the ear NC than the buds. I'll never know, though.

These are LUXURIOUS! They look and feel like the best you could get. They are so comfortable and sound awesome. They block the majority of noise just through superb fit, even without NC circuitry. The battery last a super long time and they're easy to pair. You can barely hear someone talking to you face on with these. A coworker thought I was messing with him and not actually talking! And that's in a quiet office!

Dang, I love these!

My one problem with them flying was that because they seal so well, they didn't let my ear pressure equalize as the plane ascended. I was left with ear pain for a good portion of the flight as I forced myself to yawn and swallow repeatedly, trying to eliminate the pain. The next flight I took care to briefly pop them open numerous times as the plane took off and landed.

UPDATE: I lost my beloved headphones! Devastated. I didn't want to spend the money again, and really wanted BT. At the time of the loss, Bose didn't offer a BT version like they have now. I went with Sony. There is no comparison in my mind between the two. The Bose are so much more refined and comfortable. The things that I miss include the battery level indicator and the voice prompts."
73,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Best headphones I've ever owned. They're sooooo comfortable and truly block outside noise. I say that because I've bought ""noise-cancelling headphones"" before that just weren't."
74,3.5 out of 5 stars,"These are great for the price. The 40mm driver delivers a nice sound its clear overall, it's good for listening to really anything. It's 40ohm at 100dB/mW so it's rather easy to get peak performance out of these.

I have hearing loss in both of my ears and typically listen to my music on max on my other headphones (given the other sets have different impedances and sensitivity) while on my Android phone. These I turn on about 20% less than I normally do.

These also don't bleed out audio and isolate noise very good.

Finally I like that these headphones don't smash your head like other ones will, they're very lightweight and seem to be good for extended use. I have the Sennheiser HD 558 which are the most comfortable headphones I've ever used, these would be right behind it, the elastic band is a bit odd but I was surprised on how nice it actually works.

The only negative is the stock cuffs, which can be easily replaced with fabric ones, which I would recommend doing so if you will be wearing these for extended amounts of time."
75,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Best headphones on the market! If you are a DJ, musician, or regular old person who just loves music, these are the ones for you. I bought these 5 years ago and they still sound great. They have lasted me through 3 ex girlfriends, 1 dead dog, and the loss of my job (which is why I bought these bargain busters). If you want top quality sound for minimal costs, these are the headphones for you.

*PLEASE NOTE DISCLAIMER* these headphones will not bring back your girlfriend(s), resurrect your dead dog, or make Jenna from accounting drop the harassment charges."

77,4.2 out of 5 stars,Perfect.
78,4.6 out of 5 stars,"It was way too small for my 8.5"" head. But they're letting me return it, so 5 stars."
79,4.2 out of 5 stars,"Something I hadn't read (or noticed) when narrowing down my options, is that this pair of headphones can listen to 2 sources simultaneously. So while I'm listening to my computer for work, it's still connected to my phone, and I can hear when someone is calling, and can even take the call while still listening to my computer. This is something I didn't know was possible, and is 100% what I needed. I'm SO happy with this purchase.

Aside from that feature, which may not apply to anyone else, these are the MOST comfortable headphones I have ever purchased. I have a pair of wired Bose at home, that have lasted for several years. They are super comfortable as well, but these really take the cake. Somewhere in their product description, they say you never want to take them off, and it's true.

I'm also very impressed by the battery life. I leave them charging on Friday night, so Monday morning, they are at 100% (she tells you every time you turn them on what the percentage of battery life is!), and by Friday afternoon, they're usually around 30-40%, and I wear them 10 hours a day!

They also get the best reception of any wireless headphones I've ever used. I can walk around my building and still hear my computer, and they don't cut out like my old Bluetooth ones did.

I also have only had very slight sound delay. But then I turned them off and back on, and the delay was gone. But it wasn't even a full second of sound delay- just a fraction of a second, so it might not be noticeable to anyone just listening to music without using visuals.

I don't know what else to say about these headphones. They are perfect. I'm so very glad I splurged. I know they are THE ONES and will last me a very long time.

Bose knows, man. Bose knows."
80,4.3 out of 5 stars,"After reading reviews and seeing nothing but outstanding remarks for these headphones, I decided to drop the cash and give it a shot. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. I'm definitely an audiophile; I produced EDM music for quite a while which trained me to care about proper balance in songs. These headphones have AMAZING balance! Most expensive headphones that I've tried on just have a crazy boosted bass and it gives me a headache. Not to mention, it just doesn't sound good haha! Anyway, these headphones have super crisp highs, good mids, and crunchy bass. They really are perfect.

As for comfort, I could easily wear these things all day. Sometimes I forget I'm even wearing these headphones... They look pretty stylish and they aren't too big. The carrying case is pretty lowkey and it works fine, no problems there. Headphones charge fast and the battery lasts me about a week with daily usage.

I enjoy the little voice that sounds whenever you switch devices or turn on the headphones. It's not obnoxious in the slightest. Bluetooth is always a little finicky but these headphones connect almost flawlessly. They automatically reconnect to your last device and that makes things go A LOT faster! Switching devices is pretty simple too.

Using the included aux cord doesn't effect sound quality at all. Good for conserving battery life is you don't particularly need the wireless feature at the time of listening!

Overall, I'm more than satisfied with my purchase. It was well worth the money and I would recommend these headphones to anyone AND everyone! If you have any questions, leave a comment and I'll get back to you as soon as possible."
81,4.8 out of 5 stars,"I initially bought Beats Studio wireless and I couldn't wait to try them out. I was debating between these Bose and the Beats studio for awhile. I feel the Beats look better than Bose, but in my opinion looks are the only thing Beats do better than Bose. Beats have quite a reputation of quality and performance, and when I first put them on and tried them out I thought ""huh, well maybe something is wrong with this pair"". Then I thought ""maybe it really is only good for bass"", so I played some bass heavy music, but was still very disappointed. The sound was muddy and weak. I returned them and bought the Bose. There is not even a comparison between the two, the Bose sound crystal clear, and the highs-mids- and lows are head and shoulders above the Beats. Songs that I've listened to hundreds of times sound brand new, and I can hear tones I've never heard before. These are light and comfortable. Haven't used them enough to testify to battery life yet."
82,4.1 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love these headphones. I was hesitant to spend this much on headphones, but I'm so glad I did. They're great for work because you can be connected to multiple devices at once. Controls and switching between them is super simple. Sound is amazing, battery life is great, charges relatively quickly, and in a pinch, you have a cord that allows you to use the headphones without a charge. (Note, though that the mic doesn't work if you use the headphone jack to directly plug into a device.)

The only reason I'm rating this a four is that after a couple months of use, I've had random issues with crunchy sounds from the bluetooth connection. More so annoying than impeding usage because it happens infrequently. Additionally, I've been told that my voice occasionally goes robotic, 8-bit like, when I'm on the phone or a web conference. Not always, but enough to have it be irritating that I'm having issues with something that cost so much. I've confirmed it's these headphones because the second I switch them off or switch headphones, my voice quality improves to those listening.

All that to say. I've used other over ear headphones and these are just so freaking light and comfortable I don't like going a day without them. Great for"
83,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a gift & they supercede all my expectations. My son loves them. All the other great reviews were right! The sound is so much better than dre beats, the ear is more comfortable, longer listening time, & better for gaming. 110% better than the other guy. Having owned both dre beats & Bose makes it easy to compare & there is NO comparison. Its a MUST BUY!"
84,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Recently had my old SL 2s snagged at the gym. I always loved em but now that I had the chance to get the latest and greatest - it was time to shop around. After looking at the B&O Play 8i Sony 1000M2’s and Bose QC 35 II’s the question was were they better enough than the SL Ii to justify an extra $130 to $180?

The Plays had issues so headed to Best Buy to listen to the Sony and Bose phones. They were both good - both had dramatic presentations with good detail on top decent mids and thundering bass. Of the two I preferred the Sony’s feeling the QC 35 2’s bass was unnatural sounding and not well integrated.

What I loved about the Soundlinks Ii soundwise was it’s more natural sounding non-fatiguing presentation. On the chance the Sony’s slightly overwrought sound would wear on me and the $130 price increase I finally rebought the SoundLink II’s.

Ordered this morning and they’re sitting atop my big head as I write this. Granted I listen mostly to classical, jazz and electronic music but I very much prefer this sound still to what I heard from the Sony and Bose QC 2’s. Love the comfort, easy no hassle blue tooth connections and the money I saved. Best bang for the buck going for premium over ear bt cans. Paid $375 first time around. STILL highly recommended!"
85,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm giving these 3 stars only because the sound is very good and they are nice looking and lightweight. But I'm astonished at the construction for headphones that cost this much. I do have larger than average sized ears; most headphones will pinch a bit on the upper part of my right ear after an hour or so, although over the years I've found a few that fit me comfortably indefinitely. But these are, well, simply crappy comfort-wise in almost every way. And they hurt both ears and in new and unexpected ways and places after only a few minutes. Where you normally find padding at the thicker area along the back of the ear, these have a kind of channel between the cushioning and the sound producing area where your ear slips in. In that channel there are hard plastic bumps and knobs and also a hard plastic ring. And under the flimsy striped fabric covering the housing (which is only attached on one side) there are more hard plastic bumps. Ouch, ouch, ouch. I guess if you have small to medium ears and don't look too closely you might never notice this stuff, but still, $296 for this?"
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed a pair of Bluetooth headphones to use with my new iPhone 7 at work. Since I planned to wear them for a significant part of the day, comfort was a primary concern. I find that earbuds at not comfortable so on eat or over ear headphones were what I was looking for. They are light & the ""grip"" around my head is gentle so they don't cause undo pressure. The padding on the headband & the earpieces were far more comfortable than any other headphone I tried (Beats included). After using them for a couple of weeks I'm very happy with my choice. Even with my glasses, I find them to be very comfortable. Occasionally there's some discomfort with larger earrings but I'm usually able to readjust & find a more amenable position.

The next consideration was sound dampening. It's not super noisy but there is a significant amount of background noise (talking, printer, etc.). Based on the type of noise (more variable than steady drone) I wasn't sure that the active noise cancelling of the Quiet Comfort model was worth the additional cost (paid $229). These headphones do completely cover the ears which passively blocks quite a bit of sound. Between that & the music itself, the background noise became a non-issue.

Of course, what good are headphones if they don't sound good? Unlike some others that I have tried there's no background hiss. The sound is clear & crisp. I've discovered some previously unnoticed nuances to my music as a result of the superior sound quality. The balance is very pleasant. You won't find pounding base, rather a nice mix of tones that will allow you to appreciate a broader range of instrumentals & vocals.

Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase. I couldn't ask for a better set of headphones for my needs."
87,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good sound. I visited a Bose store before purchasing these, and ended up going back and forth comparing them heavily to the QC35's. In the end, I really just didn't enjoy the noise cancelling of the QC35's -- feels like I need to pop my ears or something. While I would rate the QC35's sound as superior with noise cancelling turned on, they actually sound much different with noise cancelling turned off. So comparing both with noise cancelling off, I settled on these as being a bit more rich.

I have a very large head and I only need to open these up to the third notch, so I'm very happy with that. I also often use these with a long cord at work rather than wireless. Just make sure you get a 2.5"" to 3.5"" rather than a standard audio cable.

Also, these are very comfortable with thick acetate glasses. I don't feel any pressure on my temples. That was one of my biggest reasons for looking for a new pair of headphones."
88,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i was turned off by the price of these bad boys, so i bought a knockoff from bluedio first. big mistake. the bludio headphones looked good but they were too heavy, didn't fit comfortably, and had all sorts of issues with bluetooth pairing. so i decided to ante up and get a real set of headphones. and i wish i'd bought these years ago.

- first they are light and comfortable, i can wear them all day at work (with glasses on) and i almost forget they're there. this is probably the most important thing for me.
- second, the sound is crystal clear (at least much clearer than anything i've ever listened to over bluetooth before). i go back and forth between EDM and classical depending on my mood and these headphones are great for both.
- third, the bluetooth pairing has been seamless on all my devices (including android phones), which is a great relief.
- fourth, and unexpected when i bought them, these actually work great for taking phone calls. i don't understand how because there's no visible microphone, but everyone i talk to using these says they can hear me loud and clear.

this is my first bose purchase, it won't be the last."
89,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have have changed the way I listen to music. The first month I received my Bose headphones, I did not want to take them off. I originally bought these to wear to the gym so I can lift heavy weights without worrying about the dinky in ear headphones. Now, I wear them when I cook, clean, go on walks, etc. I cannot recommend these headphones more."
90,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great sounding headsets but the interface is about 10 years behind. I wanted to like them but there’s just too many clunky things about the actual physical package. For one thing they don’t fold up at all. So they are huge to carry. The controls are absolutely the most basic they could come up with, really nothing more than the Apple headset three button interface. Compare these to the Sennheiser 550s which have noise canceling, very good sound with a touch pad that is years ahead of these Bose headsets. I also tried the high-end Bose noise canceling headsets and I have the same critique of them."
91,5.0 out of 5 stars,I listened to quite a few competitor models in a box store in the price range from $60 to $300. These Bose immediately stood out as the best sounding to me and most comfortable. The sound is full range and pleasant without what I call silly bass. I've listened every day for over a week and battery is still st 70%. I like the voice prompt that tells me battery level and what device is paired when I turn it on.
92,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first, I was a little hesitant to spend over $200 on wireless headphones but these turned out one of the best purchases I've even made. I honestly have no complaints about these Bose headphones. The sound quality is amazing, the battery lasts up to 10 hours, the headphones can be used in wired form if there's no more juice in the battery, and pairing with my phone was a breeze. I now also take most of my calls using these and the people on the other end say that they hear me crystal-clear.

I previously got a Logitech wireless gaming headset but immediately returned it after seeing how bulky it is to wear on a plane."
93,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these, my daughter ordered Beats. Very similar products, except these are much more comfortable. However, they don't get very loud at all, but I suppose I damaged my hearing enough in the 80's going to all those heavy metal concerts anyway. I don't know why the earpieces turn other than to fit in the case. I wish they had a locking feature, because they tend to spin and it makes them harder to put on and take off. Very annoying. I was going to order the previous version, but noticed a lot of the negative reviews were saying the same things about connectivity. Now they are separated by device, and my apple device model seems to have no problem with connectivity. Range isn't that great though. My home is a two story, and each level only has about 850 sq. feet, but if I don't keep my phone in my pocket it will cut out, even on the same floor. So the range isn't great but I have waited my ENTIRE life for cordless headphones so I'm just happy I lived long enough to see and own them! We can put a man on the moon but I thought I'd spend my whole life untangling headphone wires!"
94,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just bought one of these for my wife for Christmas... she is very particular about clarity and base response. Well thankfully she was very impressed and equally appreciative. I took a listen and could not believe the full spectrum frequency range with these wireless phones! Beautiful sound quality especially when linked to my Ipad Pro for movie viewing. Watched 45min of Rouge One and the battery was still at 100%. Was worried that I would miss the noise reduction feature and wish that I had ordered the much higher priced version of this awesome headphone. But the head gear is very well insulated and very quiet. I kept borrowing hers so much that I just ordered an additional headphone for myself. Merry Christmas to me!
95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The most comfortable over ear headphones I've ever owned. I've worked in high density offices for the past 6 years and I wish I had purchased these years ago. I've owned mine for a month now and haven't encountered any issues. I tried 3 others pairs of headphones before choosing these (Beats, Seinnheiser, Bohm). This pair of Bose headphones are lighter, have a more comfortable fit, do a better job with noise cancelling, and are more compact in their case. The price was more than I had wanted to spend, but because I wear them everyday, they are worth it."
96,4.4 out of 5 stars,"I bought these about 6 weeks ago. The other day, I noticed a static-like sound as I moved my head. That sound has turned into a full ""blown-speaker"" sound, though I suspect it's just a loose wire. Additionally, after upgrading the firmware to correct the poor bluetooth performance, trying to use these with my PC will freeze google hangouts and then crash my entire PC.

It's too late to return them and get my money back. I don't even want to warranty them, I just want to take them out back and burn them.

Why two stars, you ask? The comfort and sound are fantastic. The volume doesn't go loud enough, the battery life is really good. That's about all I have to say. Buy the Bose triports instead. GG."
97,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Give your ears a treat. they deserve it. These headphones are not heavy and wear well on your head, the cups fit comfortably and it feels like the singers are in front of you. You're just relaxing in your LaZBoy, but the sounds take you far, far away and let you enjoy moments of tranquility . Good built, well-engineered, very pleased with this purchase!"
98,3.5 out of 5 stars,"Bose need I really need to say anything else, the name itself speaks of quality so you know what you are getting , It is no different with this product, I had Bose soundtrue headphones and they are still working great after all this time. But I wanted to upgrade to bluetooth and these sound just as great as the soundtrue if not perhaps a little better . Hear the sounds of whatever I am listening to a little more crisper . So am very happy with my purchase thank you Bose !

Edit by me: As good as these are beware if using to skype and watch videos with friends this won't work , so having to send them back . If wasn't for this would so keep them , but I need a pair of heads that can skype with and watch videos at the sametime ."
99,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
- Very comfortable to wear
- Wireless
- Sounds decent

Cons:

- Maybe user error but MBP would not connect and work automatically, had to manually pick the headset in sound preferences to hear anything"
100,3.9 out of 5 stars,"I needed bluetooth headphones that would not break down after 4-6 months, and give me great sound. I am not no audiophile, but enjoy listening to my music without wires going bad, or outside noises. These headphones does the job. I compared Bose vs Sony, and read many of the comments. The Sony rated very high for sound, and features, but Bose had the old school reputation as dependable. I decided on the Bose for a couple of reason. They have the reputation, and a customer complained very loudly about Sony customer service, in the comment section.
I truly did not want to spend that much for headphones, but after using the product for about 3 weeks, it was truly worth it. I have a graveyard of bluetooth headphones, where the wires goes bad, but the Bose fit very snugly, sound great, and the battery charge last longer than my 2 shifts of work.(work 2 jobs). Comes with a carry case, with a cable to charge, and a cable to make it a wired headset. Its expensive, by my taste, but its a great buy in the end, because they are dependable, great sounding, and should last for years, saving me money over time.
Negative, can not change songs from headset."
101,4.2 out of 5 stars,"AMAZING. I Love Bose! I wear these all the time to study and listen to music/audiobooks around the house. I love that they're not noise cancelling because I can still hear my dogs barking when they need to go out, no one can sneak up on me, and I don't feel completely anti-social. However, they are pretty good at cutting out most background noise without having to raise the sound level to the highest level just to block it out. The sound quality is superb as well. Great product. I would definitely buy again."
102,4.6 out of 5 stars,"Everything I've ever wanted in headphones! Good sound quality, impressive battery life, lightweight and soooo comfortable :) Even has an aux port for times when you have a low battery or can't use BT for some reason (my employer doesn't allow BT-enabled devices so this is perfect for me). Connectivity is quick, and the range from device to headphones is on the better side of average. These aren't noise-cancelling; they are more like ""noise-muffling,"" which is fine for how I'm using them. If you want noise-cancelling, I believe Bose makes another model. I waited months to pull the trigger on these after lots of research and deliberation. After putting up with crappy Chinese knockoffs for far too long, I don't know how I ever lived without these.

The + button suddenly stopped working, so I opened one aide of the headphone to investigate. The piece of sodder that holds the internal button has detached, leaving the button, bracket, and piece of sodder rattling around in the housing. I purchased these back in September, so they only lasted 9 months. For the money I spent, this is extremely disappointing. I contacted Amazon, but because I'm outside the ""return window"" for these, they won't do anything about it. Lesson learned. Next time I decide to make an expensive purchase, I will be using a vendor who stands behind their products, like Costco."
103,4.2 out of 5 stars,"When I first tried the SoundLink II's straight out if the box I'll admit I was a bit underwhelmed. The bass was thin and the mids and treble were a little too forward and bright for my taste.

I got an idea hooked them up to my computer using the aux cord and ran pink noise through them for about 20+ hours while I was at work.

After that I connected them to my phone and they completely changed. The bass is just right and everything sounds clear and detailed.

Also these are THE MOST comfortable headphones I have worn to date. Wouldn't give these up for buds ever."
104,4.3 out of 5 stars,"After trying 4 different headphones, this one is worth every dollar! I started on the low end ($35) and worked my way up ($50, $130) to these ($229). I'm not a musician, but grew up in a musical family so I do appreciate good sound. To my not professionally trained ear, they all sounded just fine. For me it was a comfort issue of wanting to wear them for hours. I have a lot of writing to do and need to block out sound with instrumental usually classical music and I travel a lot and want to listen to all types of music or Bluetooth with my iPad and watch downloaded shows or movies. The best part of these headphones is the larger opening for your ear to fit into and remain pressure free for long periods of time. The others lasted about an hour or two and I had enough. I'm glad I didn't just start with these or I would not have appreciated how great they really are! Also, one set I tried had a white headband and ear pieces, and I quickly saw the potential for them looking grubby over time."
105,4.8 out of 5 stars,These are Awesome! Not noise canceling but when music is playing you can't hear anything going on around you. They don't claim to be noise canceling but I notice some people asking. These are light weight and comfortable for long periods of time. I wear them at work and have them on for hours. Quality is great. Not much base but it's pretty equal all through out.
106,4.1 out of 5 stars,"This keep up with playing videos on my Iphone 6. I was very worried but they do well... I have connected to my iphone and macbook pro together... when I play sound on the macbook, it takes over automatically, and when i stop the sound, the phone continues to play. range is excellent... used at the office from my macbook and went four offices down, out the door, and past our elevators... total of about 70' through several walls. Iphone range is about 30-40 feet through several walls.

Good fit. TRUE AROUND THE EAR fit, not on the ear.. the oval design is nice. Not a huge fan of the voice that talks when devices connect (when it powers on)... and the included case is a little cheap and flimsy compared to the hard cover provided with my older set of Bose noise cancelling Wired headphones. Same great fit and comfort though. LOVE THESE."
107,4.5 out of 5 stars,"These are very comfortable and i'm impressed with how long the battery lasts. Keeps out some ambient noise as well. Have worn them several times on an airplane and they feel much better than in-ear buds in terms of comfort and quality of sound. I like that you can connect to two devices, and switching is fairly seemless. Does not work as well as I would have liked for calls (people on the other end can't seem to hear me well, or it sounds muffled). As I only like to use headphones for conversations, this is an inconvenience for me. However, if you only plan on using these for music/movies/etc, they're great!"
108,4.5 out of 5 stars,"3-23-2016 just received it today. Now it is charging. ( does it take some few hours to charge ? )
I am super excited. I work in a tight space office where people are loud and it is impossible for me to focus if I do not have a headphone on. I have tried BEATS SOLO 2 wireless but it hurts my ears although it is certainly attractive looking and draws attention.
Will start using it tomorrow. Hopefully I will like it.

FINALLY FULLY CHARGED I see the green light. It sounds great. Sound quality different than regular ear buds or BEATS. It's like theatre sound quality. Truly. I do agree about the buttons not as easy to use as BEATS. these are much smaller. I will see how I like them day to day at the office."
109,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones! Previously I owned a pair of the Bose AE2W wireless headphones, but they had frequent issues connecting to my Mac. I decided to try these SoundLink headphones instead, and I really like them.

Pros:
• Comfortable
• Light
• Easy to use
• They connect to my Mac instantly when I turn them on
• Sound quality is great
• Bluetooth connection never drops
• Very long battery life
• Easy to recharge
• Works great with all my Apple products: MacBook Pro, iPhone 7, iPad Pro

Cons:
• None that I can think of. These headphones work exactly as advertised."
110,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones came 2-3 days late (I get free 2 day shipping with Prime) and I know that's not Bose's fault, but UPS's -- which is why I'm still giving these headphones 5 stars because the headphones deserve it.

They're great, although not as sound-proof as I was hoping. I love the wireless aspect which is great for when you're cleaning or doing something that requires you to move around a lot (or have cats that like to play with the wire). They're super comfy and never make my ears/head hurt!"
111,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality - nice and clear with not too much base. Its also nice that these dont get so loud they hurt your ears - very balanced sounding. Comfortable to wear, easy to use, nice storage case to keep them safe/clean between uses. I bought my wife a pair of beats headphones for Valentines day 2017 and spent significantly more on those and I personally prefer these ones (beats are heavier and feel bulky on your head to me).

Great headphones and cant complain about Bose quality at the $199 level. Would definitely recommend these for anyone looking for a pair of overall great quality headphones without breaking the bank for some top end studio quality."
112,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been listening to a lot of audiobooks lately. These have been perfect. The battery seems to last forever. The sound quality is amazing. The ear pads are some kind of leather wraped soft memory foam and are very comfy. The range is great. Amazing quality overall, exactly what I expected from Bose."
113,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the MOST comfortable headphones I have ever owned!!! And the sound is also outstanding! I have never been more pleased with a product...ever!!! I am a full time artist working in a noisy studio. I was beginning to have trouble concentrating on my work from all the noise coming from the hallway and the other studios. My husband bought me these headphones for Christmas and I am a happy productive artist once again!. They help cancel out most of the noise..not completely, but enough that when listening to music at a moderate level, I am oblivious to the external noise outside my studio. The battery life is exceptionally long. I even use the headphones to help me relax and fall asleep to ambient music at night. Easy to click off the switch, put them on the night stand and go to sleep. I have always been a Bose fan and these headphones are now my favorite Bose product."
114,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones, sound it's very clear, they are comfortable enough. But they main reason I bought these was because I didn't want to have any wire around my computer. So I feel really disappointment because the connectivity is not the best. I usually connect my laptop (macbook pro retina 15') and my phone (OnePlus 3) and they work great. But If turn the computer off sometimes it's really hard to connect them back again. I have to turn off the headphone, turn off the bluetooth of my computer and start again. Sometimes that doesn't work. I have to remove them from the bluetooth list of my computer and clear the list of device of the headphones.

115,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for My Wife for one of Her Christmas gifts. She Loves them! She said that they fit her ears perfectly. She loves the fact She doesn't have to deal with the wires, since these are blue-tooth. She claims the sound is awesome. I hope this helps."
116,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OMG! I had no idea what I was missing out on. I struggled with spending the money, but now I know it was worth it. The sound quality is WAY better than I expected. I was going for convenience over quality, but I was so damn tired of the wire. Yes, it is another thing to charge for my daily routine, but I feel it is worth it. The best part is, I have these synced to my Mac and my iPhone. What's cool about it is the headphones automatically switch between the 2 depending on where the audio signal is coming from. These headphones are NOT noise cancelling, but they block a lot of the background noise out with crystal clear sound. I really can't wait to try these out at work. The group I work with is a noisy bunch, so it will be a good test. The battery life on these seems pretty good as well. I have used them right out of the box so I have not tested the battery life yet. So far I still have a 38% charge from 50 and I used them last night for a couple of hours right along for this morning. I highly recommend these headphones to anyone in the market for bluetooth headphones. I would definitely buy these again."
117,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect. Couldn't work better. (I have a medium-sized head for a woman and it's snug without being uncomfortable for the 1st hour. If I had a bigger head, it might pinch or squeeze, though. I'm sensitive to this, though, and only guessing.)
The sound-quality is the best I've ever heard through head phones. The bluetooth is a synch to operate.
Don't use these to work-out in - you'll sweat rings around ears and it'll get too hot. They are perfect for all other occasions."
118,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: I'm downgrading this from 5 stars to 3 stars after I tested the microphone by calling my desk phone at work and leaving a message. The quality is terrible. My father is very hard of hearing, and when I use the Bose headphones to talk when he calls, he has more difficulty than usual understanding me. Very disappointing

Exceptional sound, great range, long battery life. I would definitely buy them again, but I have two quibbles. The first is the size of the ear muffs. While I don't large ears, the ear muffs pinch the tops of my ears and so I periodically have to take them off to relieve the eventual pain. The second has to do with the controls. A single button to control backward and forward by pressing twice for forward and thrice for backward is clumsy. A separate button for each may not be as cost effective as using software to give one button three functions (it's also used for pause), but from the perspective of the end user, more buttons make more sense."
119,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I freaking love these. I was using beats solo wireless (rose gold ones) and they are good. But after hours of wearing them my ears would start to hurt. These are like wearing baby kittens on my ears!!! So soft and comfortable, and the sounds if amazing. Better than the beats hands down. I should have bought these in the beginning."
120,4.4 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are fantastic! We live in a townhouse and are trying to enjoy good, clear sound without disturbing our neighbors! Well this was the perfect solution. So easy to sync up and the sound in incredible. The cost was hard to swallow but now that we have used them, worth every penny!!"
121,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Love these! I use them at night when I don't want to wake up my dog. Great for travel as well. They don't completely block out noise during air travel, but that isn't their main purpose. Battery life is great and so is material quality. These are my second pair (dog destroyed the first pair)."
122,3.5 out of 5 stars,"Extremely comfortable, easy to use and the sound is excellent. Ive always thought Bose products were very good, just expensive compared to others on the market. With that said, these headphones really are amazing and worth the price. Im sure you can get a pair that sound just as good from another company, or another pair that is just as comfortable, or another pair that is easy to use.... but youre not gonna get all 3 like you get with these."
123,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Wanted a set of over-the-ear Bluetooth phones for use when traveling by airplane. I'm using them with an iPod Touch, and they work flawlessly. To my ears, the quality of the Bose sound is great. I'm past the point of wanting ""ears bleeding"" volume and pounding bass (in other words, I'm old). The highs are crisp, vocals are clear, and bass is plenty strong without muddling or causing distortion. These are not noise-cancelling, but to me it really doesn't seem like an issue."
124,3.9 out of 5 stars,"I replaced my Beats headphones with these. Beats are C-R-A-P!! They started physically breaking down in a year, and totally broken after two. Nothing about the physical build was quality. THESE BOSE SOUNDLINK HEADPHONES ARE THE POLAR OPPOSITE!! The rocker switches, the padding on the earmuffs, the fast and reliable connection, and even the case, are of the highest quality. And that's not even mentioning the SOUND! They have amazing sound.
I am so glad I trusted Consumer Reports ratings on this one!
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
125,4.2 out of 5 stars,"These are very comfortable headphones, which is important as I wear them to bed. I wish they were noise-cancelling - I knew they weren't when I bought them - but they do a pretty good job of isolating outside noise. The sound quality is good, and they hold a charge well. As I said, my first criteria was comfort. Beats and Sony both hurt. I'm pretty happy with these."
126,4.6 out of 5 stars,"Overall a wonderful product. Great way to fully immerse yourself in your music. Great for watching movies as well. Very clear, true sound. Not bass heavy, although it has plenty of bump. I have reviewed many Bluetooth headphones, this is still my go to. For Bluetooth headphones, this is as good as it gets. Great value, very comfortable, and would highly recommend."
127,4.2 out of 5 stars,"5 stars for comfort
5 stars for the Bluetooth connectivity and speed
I am little disappointed with the Bluetooth range and sound quality during calls when connected to multiple devices. Its a really good headphone. But don't go for it if you are looking for bass heavy and loud sound. It has got perfect soft sound."
128,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Look good, sounds good!

Love that it comes with a case. The case has a little pocket to store the charging cable and the optional cable (for use like regular wired headphones).

They may feel a bit fragile, but at least they are light weight. I really like that they don't squeeze my brain out of my skull, but also stay on/ in place while moving around.

Overall, these could be the last headphones you'll need for awhile. Good sound, no wires and a trusted name in audio."
129,4.8 out of 5 stars,These are the best! They cancel out most noise and sit comfortably on my head. They quickly connect to any Bluetooth giving excellent sound of your music. I also love that I can connect to a phone call with ease and the person on the other line can hear me clearly. Worth every penny.
130,4.1 out of 5 stars,"Not an audiophile... just a guy who likes to listen to music for a while before he goes to bed every night. I listen to a lot of acoustic stuff and these make an acoustic guitar and harmonized voices sound awesome. Comfortable to wear, and I'm really impressed by the amount of time they'll hold a charge, if I listen about an hour a night I probably only have to remember to plug them in once every two weeks at most."
131,4.5 out of 5 stars,I don’t normally write reviews but I had to this time. I just got these but I already love them. They are so lightweight and comfortable. It’s like they were made to fit my ears/head. I even put them on backwards at first by mistake and they were still comfortable. They sound great too. I’m not an audiophile (not really sure what that entails tbh) but I love music and my music sounds great. I tried out a couple other wireless headphones including the Plantronics Backbeat Pro which I had to return. They were somewhat comfortable they were heavy and bulky and put too much pressure on my ears. Not to mention the bass was kind of overblown. These headphones I don’t even want to take off. I’m definitely keeping them. The case is great too and not too big to be inconvenient taking it places.
132,4.5 out of 5 stars,"These sync to bluetooth very easy and allow up to two devices to be synced at one time. The best thing about these headsets are that they are great for phone calls and they come with an audio cable to make them wired headsets. This feature also works when the batteries are dead. The sound quality is good, not excellent and not much bass, and they give you a little noise canceling while on the airplane. I flew from LA to Tokyo (Haneda) and the battery still had plenty of charge left after the 12 hour flight."
133,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome headphones. Good sound , great for phone calls, connects multiple bluetooth devices and easy to switch between PC and Phone. little overpriced. Comfortable to wear and ligh weight. But overall feels little plasticky . May be due to the fact it weighs less when compared to other mics. I have marshalls monitors wired one. I still feel that Marshalls monitor(wired) more superior to the sound and bass range when compared to this one.

Pros: Good sound, comfortable, light weighted, good for phone calls ,multiple connectivity
Cons: Bass range could have been much more. Feels little bulky and ear pieces are not fully collapsible"
134,5.0 out of 5 stars,"these are quite nice... but there is a VERY VERY annoying feature. in the middle of a call - the phones interrupt you saying ""cant connect to my macbook"" while my call is happening on my iphone. i have had several miserable times on a call because of this annoyance. Bose - dont you understand that when one is on a call - that takes priority over some stupid warning message from my 2nd bluetooth connection. you should fire your product managers and hire new ones."
135,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works wonderfully well. I am not tied to my laptop anymore! Battery is really long lasting. I would highly recommend this product. Usual high quality from Bose.
136,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are my best EVER!!! i knew i would never be disaapointed. My husband bought himself Beats...and I chose these.....NO RERGETS...LOL....you got that??!!! My only wish is that they came in more than just 3 colors. The sound is perfectly awesome.
137,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This aremy first bluetooth headphones, and I can say THEY ARE AMAZING.
Also as being a musician, I can say that I really like the sound coming from this headphones. Of course there is no way we can compare to any Studio headphones, but for the daily use is AMAZING. I'm very happy with this purchase.
Bluetooth works great: I'm using this pairing with my Mac and my cellphone (moto g2). If any issue appears, it's only in my moto but because its and old phone, so I assume that when is overload it my clip. But if that happens not very often.
The passive isolation is great: no problem using it in an airplaine (in fact, I slept with the headphones!). If you don't care having 100% sound isolation, then I said it's a good choice ($100 less from the QC).
WOULD BUY AGAIN?? YES"
138,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They have been working great since I acquired them in Nov.28, but, today, suddenly, I was not able to volume up; I noticed that the button was jam, and when I apply enough force by pressing, it sounded like something is broken and bounces insided the speaker. Now, cannot volumen up and can't hear anything in wireless mode... what a shame since they are not cheap..."
139,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really want to like these cans, but my goodness, all that's happened is frustrating feature after frustrating feature. I've run into a whole litany of problems. First of all, audio/visual sync lags, on EVERY device I've tried. That right there is pretty much a deal-breaker. It doesn't matter how nice the audio is (and it is very nice), if I can't enjoy a movie with the audio and video synced, what is the point? And then the even bigger issue is the switching from device to device. When my laptop is ON, my phone refuses to transmit to the headphones. The second I turn it off everything is fine. I have cheap $30 Bluetooth headphones that do this effortlessly. I can have audio from laptop and phone running simultaneously with no problems. Why are $300 headphones (after tax) more frustrating to use that something 1/10 its cost?"
140,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the price would have expected it to be slightly better. Good sound for home listening. Not good for travel. The noise isolation is minimal. I would spend a little more and get the noise cancellation one. Also not good for warm temperatures. Starts getting warm around the ear in a short time. Good in cold temperatures.
141,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using mine for over a month. every once in a while I have some static, but it seems to be caused by other wireless devices like my Jawbone fitness tracker and is temporary. good sound. easy to use. synched easily to both my phone and iPad."
142,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely amazing.... worth every penny!
Earbuds hurt my ears, these are so comfortable, I never want to take them off.
Not noise canceling but cancel out most noise. I have hard time hearing anything else.
My ears sweat a bit, but I live in Arizona, everything sweats here :-)
Thank you Bose!!!!"
143,4.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW! Bose didn't disappoint. I have been looking for wireless headphones since I got my Iphone 7. Finally decided on Bose Soundlinks after some research. I love them. They are so comfortable to wear, easy to sync to the phone (or device) and sounds great.

I had debated on getting these or the noise canceling. I am sure the noise canceling headphones are amazing and if you are looking for noise canceling just spend the extra money and get them as you can hear bound ground noise with these Soundlinks. If you don't mind a little background noise and are looking for a great comfortable pair of wireless headphones I would recommend the Bose Soundlinks."
144,4.4 out of 5 stars,"Terrible sound qaulity, my main headphones used to be the beats solo's, which I love but broke only 2yrs after purchase which was really disappointing.

I returned these immediately due to the weak sound quality......they were beautiful to look at and very light weight, but if your interested in strong beefy sound .....stay away!"
145,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Basically read the title. They are very comfortable and wearing for hours at a time is not a problem. The wireless is great and never drops out at reasonable distances. Lastly the sound is amazing. Bass is present, but well balanced and highs are crisp, but not tinny. Also, these can be paired with 2 devices at a time, which is a major win."
146,3.5 out of 5 stars,"WOW. I own some high dollar cans such as: Sennheiser Momentums, Bose Soundlinks, Denons, and some Marshall Studio monitors and these Audio-technica's sound amazing. Being that they are bluetooth, I would have figured that some of clarity in response of some songs would be lost. This absolutely is not the case. I listen to all types of music and have a random playlist on Pandora with no EQ stabilizing the music and the quality of the sound is top notch. These cans do have the capability of being VERY loud at maximum volume. I can go on and on about how good these sound. Bass quality is very pleasant and does not over power the treble or highs; it even reverbs very low which is quite surprising. I honestly feel like these cans are wired and are hooked up to a standalone synthesizer or are powered by something that isn't the battery within the device. THEY SOUND THAT GOOD! The only gripe I do have is the fact that they feel a little on the fragile side. Comfort is top notch as the max time I have worn them is for the entire length of Wolf on Wall street (3 hour movie) and didn't feel any pain. I have a big head too. Another little gripe would be the unknown amount of time that is remaining within one charge. Maybe this is a setting that I haven't figured out yet, but I always carry the connectable cable with me in the case that they do die. Overall: if you are looking for a set of Bluetooth headphones, THESE ARE THE PAIR TO GET. I fell into the abyss of constantly searching and buying bluetooth headphones and reading reviews until I came across these pair. The instant I put them on my ears and played the first song I was blown away."
147,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Super lightweight and comfortable (key selling point, since I travel a lot), can listen to music, take calls or watch a movie for hours practically without feeling these guys on my head. Sound is a bit muffled, with slight distortions but unquestionably rich and full for BT headphones, bass definitely present. Paired with various devices, laptops, tablets, smartphones, to be honest didn't expect to be a high level audiophile equipment but fully enjoy it so far. One complaint, detachable cable quality, one day the left channel sound was gone, could hear only the right since then. I had few issues with the mic, boiled down to software level conflicts not related to headphones. Multi functional button comes with learning curve... To sum up, lovely pair of BT gear, decent price, sound quality and features."
148,4.6 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality on these ATH-S700BT phones is incredible. I compared them to several high quality alternatives, both wired and wireless, from brands such as Bose, Sony, Pioneer, and the highly rated Skullcandy Hesh 3. While some of those provided impressive sound, the Audio Technicas blew them all out of the water. They feature an incredibly realistic soundstage with extreme depth and detail at all ends of the spectrum. I'm a fan of bass, but not when it dominates the sound profile. The on-board amplifier on the ATHs reproduces DEEP bass -- the kind that you feel more than hear -- but its presence is finely tuned and it doesn't overkill mids and highs. All elements of the sound profile are crystal clear and I have literally rediscovered some of my favorite songs that had subtle elements I had never even heard before listening on these headphones. That being said, not everything is perfect on the S700BT. If you buy headphones based on style, you're a Beats guy. These are some of the least stylish headphones in this category. As others have pointed out, they feel and look cheaper than what you might expect at this price point. This didn't bother me though. The biggest negative for me were the ear pads. They're cheap, stiff, and uncomfortable. The lack of padding does not provide enough sound isolation to maximize the benefits of an over-the-ear headset. I have no idea why AudioTechnica would spend so much time and effort on outstanding acoustic technology and then cheap out on ear pads! I replaced the stock ear pads with some thick memory foam pads and it was a game changer. If you buy headphones for pristine sound quality, buy these along with some replacement ear pads. You will not be disappointed."
149,4.2 out of 5 stars,"Just recently bought these when I saw they went on sale and I must say I am blown away. I've been on the hunt for a better pair of wireless over-ear headphones because I have not been satisfied with my Sony 770 wireless pair. I already own M50's and love the sound of those, so I figured I would stay with the same brand in hopes of finding something similar. Wow, these do not disappoint. I'm no audio-phile, but there is honestly not much difference between the wired M50's and these. I actually think the bass is a bit more lively on the wireless pair.

Setup was a breeze too, and they fit and feel perfect. I've searched high and wide for a solid pair of wireless headphones and these are by far the best I've heard in terms of sound quality and you absolutely cannot beat the price. These cans have to be the best value on the market. If you've been searching for a decent wireless pair, look no further!"
150,4.3 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing. Somewhat flimsy so I am worried they may break earlier than I expect. Also, the plastic tabs on the side (the ones that keep the plugs covered) are so cheap and should be broken off immediately. However, the sound is outstanding. I love the feel of them as well. No lag when watching videos. Overall a solid B+.

My sister has the on ear Bose Bluetooth headphones which I recommend over these if you are willing to spend more $.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
UPDATE as of June 10th, 2017:
Okay. So these headphones still do the trick. They sound nice and I love the mid-range sound. Comfort is awesome. However, I still find them to be very flimsy and am still worried they will break soon. I find that sometimes the charger does not work as I'll leave them in and some days they are great; others, it's like I didn't charge them at all- which makes me wary of the battery. ALSO, sometimes they do not sync with my computer. I have to re-work all the drivers and it's a pain. Overall, a nice headphone for sound, but not the best. I'd recommend Sony or Bose for a super quality Bluetooth headphone."
151,4.8 out of 5 stars,"Alright! Got these over ear baddies for myself because I got the stupid iPhone without a headphone jack, and new I had to finally face the music (hah). I used to work in a headphone store and knew that Beats were overrated, and only sufficient for the bass (and even then, the Sennheiser Urbanites blew that sound out of the WATER when it came to bass), and often pointed folks to the ATH M50x’s when they wanted a crisp sound for a reasonable price point. With this in mind, I did some research on AT’s wireless sets.

What drew me to these headphones was the consistent review in cleanliness of sound— and I’d highly agree. The mids and highs in these cans are tight and full, with bright sounds and an impressive depth. The only thing I wish would have a little more punch is the bass! It’s round and full, just quieter than I expected, which is why I’m only giving four stars.

As for range, it’s pretty good! I was able to leave my phone in my room and move about my apartment without any disconnection or breaks. The Bluetooth turns off the second you plug in the cable (another must for me when it came to wireless headphones), and the sound is pretty consistent (of course, with the wire, it’s always going to sound just a little bit better— but that’s my opinion).

These headphones are also wicked lightweight. They don’t fold in the middle but the cups do turn so they can lay flat against your collar when you’re not listening.

Overall— I’m super stoked for these headphones and am so pleased with the sound quality."
152,4.1 out of 5 stars,I bought these to use in my bakery to help with noise control. I am very pleased with my purchase. I'm impressed by the sound quality for audiobooks and music. Also haven't had anymore issues with the equipment hurting my ears while I'm listening to a book/music with these. I will probably have an extra pair on backup since I'm using them everyday for extended hours. They are also very comfortable to wear. Recommend.
153,4.5 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for a while. I originally had the ATH-M50x but got these because they were Bluetooth. I then thought I needed a mic so I got the ATH-DSR7BT and learned later that the ATH-S700BT has a mic. I was on a flight and could not use my ATH-DSR7BT with the inflight entertainment because it is all digital and no other way to connect other than Bluetooth. On the other hand, if I had the ATH-S700BT, I could have plugged it right in. Although these feel like plastic, it is really light weight, comfortable and I enjoyed them for workouts."
154,4.5 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are work every penny. I can't say enough about them. The sound quality is great, the wireless functionality works seamlessly and you can also plug them in for devices that are not Bluetooth compatible. The sound blocking is rather decent as well, I sometimes find myself wearing them without listening to anything just to drown out some of the background office noise."
155,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These phones are pretty good... not great, and not a piece of junk either. As soon as you take them out of the box you can see what separates this set from a $400 set of a premium brand wireless headset. I use them for hours at a time for work and generally are pretty happy with performance, sound quality, and comfort. The ear pads aren't as supple as top-of the line offerings from Beats, Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, or others, but they are soft enough and have a reasonable amount of give not to cause discomfort. As other reviewers mentioned they are mid-grade plastic and nothing about the fit, finish, or materials scream premium. The bluetooth pairing process is adequate, usually connecting just fine, but they do give me fits occasionally, especially switching between sources. I'll typically have them paired to a laptop, but switch to a phone or iPad and I typically need to turn the other devices off to get them to pair to the right source. This could be user error, but I'm guessing it's just a limitation of whatever revision of bluetooth they are running. I'm pretty satisfied with the audio quality, better than earbuds, and don't have much distinctive coloring or EQ'ing to speak of. Flat response it is. They are plenty loud and the battery life is typically 2-3 days of 3-5 hour use. If you don't manually power them down when finished with your listening session they will stay active and give you a slow drain on the battery. They would be improved by an auto-off, or a more responsive sleep mode when not actively listening. I do notice a high sound-floor (white noise hiss) when connected via bluetooth, but I can't be certain if that is bluetooth, the ATH's, or the source (macbook pro '15). Either way, it fades away when your audio starts and is effectively inaudible. They don't have active noise canceling but reach a good middle ground of blocking ambient noise while not completely shutting out the world. I've used them mostly in an office environment and a little at the gym and I'm pretty happy overall. I would love to see an updated version with a little better materials, a little more premium feel, and a better bluetooth receiver. I don't regret purchasing them, and would rather have two pairs of these than one of the Beat's over-ear offerings. For the pricepoint they are pretty hard to beat, but Audio-Technica will need to do something different on the next revision to separate themselves from the other offerings at or below this price level."
156,4.4 out of 5 stars,"Sound is respectable for the price point. Definitely not for audio heads. I would say
they have a medium sound across the board between base, mids, and highs.
Super light weight! Unfortunately, too snug. I have a TMJ issue, which started to ache
within 15 minutes. Btw, my studio AT headphones are AMAZING!"
157,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Super rich, warm sound that I absolutely love when it comes to headphones. There's a lot of headphones out there that put all of their priorities into bass, but I find that they have a hollow, tin-y sound that starts to grate on my ears after a while. These headphones are a great balance and it certainly doesn't hurt that they're incredibly comfortable, too.

P.S. When it comes to Bluetooth headphones under $200, these are at the top of their class. Don't waste your money on designer brands when all of the sound you'll need is right here."
158,3.5 out of 5 stars,Very Happy with the purchase. Very Good sound (and volume) for wireless headphones. Not Bass heavy at all which is a big plus for me. Comfortable headband and cups with a charge that has lasted me upwards of 7 hours (at max volume). the one downside I do have with these headphones is that the light that indicates they are charging is very small and dim. if I'm at the office under the bright lights I have to cup my hands around the headphones to make sure the light is on and they are charging. other than that no complaints at all.
159,4.3 out of 5 stars,I've had these headphone since October and I'm very unimpressed with the build quality. After about a month the padding started to crack and flake away. I've used these headphones as a headset for my PS4 and the cord that connects to the controller is of poor quality as well: the box that controls the volume and houses the mic doesn't always evenly distribute audio. I've reached out to Audio-Technica and customer support has been helpful in replacements but it doesn't change the fact that build quality isn't high. Every time I put these headphones in my bag I'm worried they're going to come out broken.
160,4.6 out of 5 stars,"I really love Audio-Technica. These are real headphones, not the Beats crap.

Considering that it is a Bluetooth model, very lightweight, the sound quality is above average (from the ones I tried at Best Buy), and super confortable to use. I usually use if for more than 6 hours, and you can't feel it in your head."
161,4.2 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones! The sound is fantastic. It is crisp and just the right amount of base. They sound as well as the Dr. Dre phones that my son has for less than 1/2 the price. The directions are in Japanese. However it is not to hard to figure out how to use the phones. There are no ""bells and whistles"" on these phones. Other than the volume you have to control the headphones on your mobile phone. I have a i-phone 5s. I use the phones while working out. The headphones are very light and stay on well."
162,4.3 out of 5 stars,"The one issue I've not been able to overcome with any of the bluetooth headphones I've tried (Bose, Sony, Audio-Technica) is the cut-out of sound at times due to wireless interference. However, in regards to sound quality, the ATH-S700BT's are hands down the best I've found so far...much better than Bose, at a much better price point."
163,4.8 out of 5 stars,"I did a lot of research before buying these. I wanted Bluetooth over-ear headphones which could also used wired for about $100. When I found these, they checked off all the boxes for me. Now that I've used them, I can say they are a great value. They sound really nice, balanced. They paired over Bluetooth first try with my phone. The mic works well over Bluetooth. They work well in wired mode as well. You can trigger Siri in either mode. They have pretty good passive noise reduction, since they fit completely over my ears. I like that when you insert the 3.5, Bluetooth turns off automatically. The controls are fine, all on the left side. There are a few things I don't like. They are made entirely out of plastic and faux leather. On the other hand they are very light and seem durable. I don't like the port caps for the mini USB and 3.5mm jack. The covers are sort of hard to put back on. I don't like how ""left"" and ""right"" are displayed on each side in white lettering. I'd rather they just put raised letters as labels. The white lettering sort of ruins the otherwise discrete all black look. I think these minor issues are fair trade offs for an otherwise great set of headphones. If they last, I'll consider them to have been a great value."
164,4.1 out of 5 stars,"Dang I've bought so many things on Amazon but I seldom leave comments because I am too lazy. But this time my friend, I am sooooooooooooo happy to have this pair now and you won't regret this 129 bucks.

Bass is awesome, bright is bright, very distinctive sounding. Audio Technica is life. The only drawback is the tiny noise it has when you are close to stronger magnetic fields."
165,4.5 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones! I shopped for a long time for headphones for my kids and finally decided on these. I looked at Bose and Beats but didn't want to spend that much money. For the price these are very good quality and my boys love them! Highly recommend!
166,4.5 out of 5 stars,"For the price you can't go wrong with these headphones. I wear these around the house, as well as to the gym. They are comfortable and lightweight to wear but one negative is that the volume is not as loud as others, but besides that (which isn't a big deal to me) they are amazing. I even chose these over my Sony mdr xb950bt because they seemed to loose on my head which didn't allow me to mov comfortably."
167,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The volume button broke a few short months after purchasing. I made do by removing the volume button cover and using a aperclip to press it but that soon broke as well. Very disappointed,"
168,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and a lot more durable than they look.
169,5.0 out of 5 stars,Have a special edition head set but wanted a wireless pair. So here I am love it.
170,1.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are amazing. The sound quality is perfect. Doesn't overemphasize the bass like the beats do and the treble response is just brilliant. The other thing I really like about it is that it is not excessively noise cancelling as I would like to wear it while I'm walking on the road or in the subway and I don't want to feel completely isolated from the world.
171,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ive been using Beats at the gym for about 6 years now and got tired of the cord plugging out so, i went with audio technicas , i currently have ath 50x for the house and i love the sound so i went with the bluetooth version and they sound just as good. There is no english manual but pairing is easy."
172,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a bit of an audiophile, so sound quality is always a huge concern for me. I had low expectations, due to prior bad experiences with bluetooth headphones. But these headphones actually have very good sound, almost as good as similarly priced wired headphones. I got this pair to use at work, since the wire of the wired set was always getting in the way. Plus I used to get a static shock on my ear every time I stood up. Now I'm immune to that. I have not tested the microphone, but I didn't buy it for that purpose. The mic is built into the body of the headphones, which is not clear from the literature. Since the mic will never be in front of your mouth, the sound will suffer. The buttons are a little non-intuitive, and I still don't think they do what they're supposed to do. After 1 day of use, I cut off the rubber cover for the charging port because it's too much hassle to close."
173,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the fourth audio technica product that I bought, at it's great but when I am near a wifi source the audio signal becomes completely broken. I have returned the headphones for another and it is also borked. buying the sony headphones of the same price but 3.33x the battery life."
174,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound quality. Light and comfortable due to the material used. Battery recharging after 5hrs of use. Some slight improvements needed but a great deal for the price.
175,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great heaphones! Really enjoy it. Pairing was easy with ip6plus, just search and connect! No passwords or whatsoever. Skip previous-next song and fast forward rewind. Use as bluetooth headset to make and accept phonecalls it all works. One nifty little feature that is worth mentioning: it sends info to ios according the battery status if the headphone, an icon besides the normal battery icon of the iphone shows the status, isnt great?!"
176,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. Little bit of learning curve with the buttons, but still great headphones."
177,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never thought $150 pair of headphones could sound this good. We'll made, comfortable and great sound."
178,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish these were a little more compact (they don't really fold up). What I do like is that you don't HAVE to use the bluetooth with these, especially for when I'm on a plane and can't use bluetooth. Having the option to connect it with a cable is great."
179,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my husband and he really likes them as they work great. Now, I want another pair for myself! :)"
180,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, great fit. These are my new everyday headphones for iPod and iPhone for my daily commute."
181,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality sound and I love the all black look one of my favorite pairs of travel headphones to date.
182,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Has a rare hiccup while I'm in the city surrounded by wireless signals, but besides that it has an awesome balanced sound and sounds a bit better when I use the wire."
183,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took a couple tries to sync with my phone, but after rebooting my phone, it sync'd perfectly. Other than that small hiccup, it has been perfect ever since I bought this device."
184,3.0 out of 5 stars,Quality......go for it!!!!
185,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality. Not quite as good as the standard wired Audio-Technica's, but still very good. Can be used over bluetooth or wired. They feel very light as they are made of plastic, but they are comfortable. The manual was entirely in Chinese/Japanese, but the controls are intuitive."
186,5.0 out of 5 stars,The audio quality is excellent. The fact that it has a headphone jack is amazing. I wish the battery life was a little longer though. Its just a tad bit too short.
187,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely comfortable. The sounds are great for a bluetooth headphone. If I were to nitpick, I'd say they run a bit on the bulky side (which sort of draws attention), but I don't really care."
188,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband loves these headphones! Super comfortable, great sound, intuitive controls."
189,5.0 out of 5 stars,No volume. Guess I’m just to old at 50 cause back in the day when you put headphones on it was like being there. But not the ones they make now. No bass no volume no likey 👎
190,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Feels very cheap, sound quality is ok, right speaker broke after about a month. Not worth your money."
191,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Only good thing about these headphones is that they are very light & comfortable to wear.
They look very cheaply made.
Sound quality wasn't impressive even after a significant burn-in period.
Worst of all was the microphone - the other person on the call couldn't hear a single word properly.
Needless to say that I returned it with frustration and disappointment."
192,5.0 out of 5 stars,"good, actually one of the better wireless headphones. as good as Beats or Parrot, but not as pricey...unfortunately none of the wireless headphones sound as good as the cable models...."
193,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these. great over the ear Bluetooth. appears a little flimsy, but I have not had any problems with them. have used them in office, airplane, in bed. comfortable and good sound quality."
194,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones perform as good as the all the positive reviews state. The sound is pretty even to my ears across the range. Everything I've listened to from a good source has sounded excellent. They sound even better when connected by the cable. There's no replacement for more power. This is my first set of Bluetooth headphones and I'm impressed at the fact that I can listen to my IPad laying in the living room anywhere in the house. I'm surprised at the worry of some at the construction. They are all plastic but they don't feel flimsy at all. They are just light which makes them much more comfortable for long periods. I'd buy these again in a second.
195,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After studying for weeks and trying multiple headsets i come to the conclusion that the ATH-WS99BT are by now the best Bluetooth Bass Headphones on the market. While they provide a big bang or clear and smooth 20hz bass, dependend on your personal preference and EQ setting, they also give you beautifull mids and highs. Dont let youself get fooled that other Bluetooth Headphones are better, they are not. Its worth to mention they look pretty good. What you cant see is that next to the cushions they have a chrome colored ring wich reflects light nicely forward. Its just cool.

None the less there is room of Improvement. To be more particular, the Earpads could be larger. Or at least they should offer bigger ones as a replacement. Next point is that the buttons to control are small and very close to each other, wich makes me often pressing the wrong ones.

One Neutral point is the material they used for the frame. Its a lot of plastic. Yes it is high quality plastic. Its light, does'nt smell and looks very good assembeld together. Anyhow i would have wished myself a metal frame, even though they would have been heavier.

Quick summary
Pro:
-incredible Bass, best on the Market, in the bluetooth sector
-beautiful mids and highs
-lightweight construction
-cool look
-comes with two cables and a faux leather bag

Con:
-Control buttons are too small
-Earpads/cushions might be to small

Im sorry for my english, i hope i could help you with my little review anyhow. If you have any question just let me know. Thank you very much for your time."
196,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So I’ve had these headphones for a little more than a month and here’s my take on these:

First, buy the brainwavs earpads (you’ll find links to this in other places here) as they make these headphones much better. This review centres around having those earpads on.

Sound: the earpads make the soundstage a little bigger and really nice, so the sound feels large and punchy. I find that the “solid bass” actually doesn’t mean anything, but the clarity and quality of the sound through all the different frequencies makes it sounds really good, and they may be the best wireless headphones I have ever had. The immersive nature of the sound is slightly lost when you are in louder environments but in quieter places the sound is amazing.

Sound isolation: the headphones are terrible at this. When you have them on sound leaks in from the outside, meaning that some of the sound is drowned out by the noises around you. They also leak a considerable amount of noise out, so you have to be careful about paying loudly inside somewhere like a library. That being said, the openness of the headphones leads to the same open sound I praised earlier, so it's a decision to be made about what you prefer.

Daily use: the Bluetooth connection is fine, nothing spectacular, but good nonetheless. It'll play smoothly and up do about a distance of twenty or thirty meters, but after that starts to get very choppy. The mic is good and picks up surprisingly well, meaning that I make calls a lot more than I used to on the headphones. Lastly, the battery is good, not spectacular, but I don't mind charging my headphones every other night, and they charge pretty quick. I also keep the audio cable inside the carrying pouch for the headphones, so if I ever run out of battery, I have a high-quality solution.

Build: with the brainwavz earpads on they are probably the most comfortable Bluetooth headphones I hace ever worn. They hold extremely well and feel really light, and the increased thickness of the earpads mean I've worm them for a twelve hours flight without any signs of pain or fatigue from wearing them. The buttons on the headphones themselves, on the other hand, are horribly unusable, as they are tiny, feel low quality, and are all crammed into one spot. I have probably not touched any button besides the on-off button in the past month.

Overall: these are defenitely one of my favourite pair of Bluetooth headphones, and at this price point, it is probably the best pair, with those replacement earpads. They aret't perfect, but what they do well they do so well that the downsides are negligible."
197,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice sound. Great for lifting and running! I have always had issues with in-ear headphones while working out. As soon as I moved a little or began to sweat, the in-ear headphones started slipping out so I was constantly having to push them back in. The Audio-Technica's have solved that problem.

The battery life is better than I expected. I have been working out for weeks (45 min - 1 hour on average) on the initial charge and just recharged them for the first time last night. I use them solely for listening to music and have not tried using them while making a call.

I read reviews for weeks before deciding to purchase these headphones and regret that I didn't order them sooner. I have had no comfort issues, but the ear openings do seem a bit on the small side. Grunge, metal, classic rock, hip-hop, rap, classical and singer/songwriter all sound great to me."
198,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've not written many reviews but I have compared these against a number of other wireless headphones so I thought I would let people know what I found. First off, we all have different ears and we all have certain preferences in what we like to hear. I like bass, but I don't want it to overpower the mids and highs as I feel those are what make the music really sound alive. I compared 4 sets of wireless headphones including the Backbeat Pros, Bluedio UFO Plus, Audio-Technica ATH-WS99BT Solid Bass, and Beats Studio 2. Here is what I found:

Bass:
The Backbeat pro's have great tight bass and pick up the deeper bass better than the other headphones I tried. The Bluedios were also quite adept at handling bass, maybe the best at high levels (literally headshaking bass, but at that volume you are also completely drowning out any vocals), but didn't pick up the lower frequencies as well as the BB Pros. The AT's had a good amount of bass that would satisfy a bass lover, but not as tight or clear as the BB Pros. Finally the Studios, which after hearing about how Beats are all about bass did not have the amount of bass I was expecting. To me, the winner on bass is the Backbeat pro's. I am hearing bass response on songs that I have not heard on any of the other headphones while at the same time being deep and refined. The bass is tight and not sloppy at all.

High/mids:
To me, crystal clear highs and mids are just as important as bass as I it is the high and mids that really allow a headphone to sound alive and allow you to see what kind of soundstage the headphones. It is also important the bass from the headphone not muddy or drown out the mids and highs. I don't listen to music just to listen to bass. The Backbeat Pro's sound good great on vocals as well. They are extremely clear and vibrant, and unlike some other headphones where the sound seems to run together or become sloppy. There is clear separation between the highs/mids/bass while all working in harmony to create excellent sound. The AT's I believe were the worst as far as mids and highs. I thought they had less on the mid to high range than the other headphones and just didn't sound balanced with the amount of bass they produce. The Bluedios had clear vocals unless you really cranked up the bass, but just didn't sound alive or exciting. Even though they are adept headphones, they just didn't get me excited to listen to music. Finally, the Beats actually have the second most vibrant mids and highs, which again was really surprising knowing what people say about them. What I did notice however, especially after comparing them to the BB Pros, is the sound sounds very sloppy with no separation between the different frequencies of sound. It's like it just kind of all runs together. Interesting enough, I did not notice this about the beats until I directly compared them to the BB Pro's which are very clear and tight in all frequencies. So, after comparing all 4, the Backbeat Pro's again come out the winner.

Comfort:
Of the headphones tested, the Bluedios weren't uncomfortable but were massive in size and you would never forget you have them on. The AT's we somewhat comfy but not as comfortable as others. I was also not a fan of the ear-pads. The BB Pro's have nice pads but I am finding the shape of the headphones forces the bottom of the ear cups to have more pressure than the top so I definitely notice them on where the bottom of the ear cups sit. Not sure if this gets better as they break in. Finally, the beats are actually the most comfortable. I think the shape they have works well for comfort and the pads seem to work well. I would give this one to the Beats.

Battery Life/BT range:
BB Pro's: 24 hour battery, 100M (330 foot) range, although I have not tested that range yet.
Bluedios: 25 hour battery, 10M (33 foot) range.
AT's: 6 hour batter life, although reviews say it lasts much longer. Didn't see anything on range so I assume it is the usual 30 or so feet.
Beats: 12 hour battery life (although I do not believe I've ever gotten them to last 12 hours, I didn't see range info, but I can confirm it is no more than 30 or so feet.
Winner, BB Pro's. They have 1 less hour of battery life, but much higher range.

Noise Cancellation:
Bluedio and AT's do not have active noise cancellation.
Both the Beats and BB Pro's have NC that works decently well, but if you are strictly looking for noise cancellation, neither of these would be my first choice. On headphones like these, I would consider them more noise reduction in both cases and consider it more of an added bonus for the headphones that a serious noise cancelling headphones. You would need to look more at headphones like the Bose QC35, Sony H.ear or the Sennheiser Momentums for better noise cancellation. So, I don't really have a winner here.

NOTE: I had 1 important feature that I've been looking for on a set of headphones and that is the ability to pair with 2 devices simultaneously like my BT headset can do. I FINALLY found a set that can do this, and of course it is the BB Pro's. I use 2 different devices and want to be able to switch back and forth without having to pair back and forth and the BB Pro is the only headphone I've found that will allow simultaneous pairing with 2 devices!

Overall:
After trying out all 4 headphones, my overall ranking would be:
1. BB Pro
2. Beats Studio
3. Bluedio UFO Plus
4. AT Solid Bass

I will note, I am an Audio-Technica fan, so it is possible that I had extremely high expectations and was disappointed in how I thought they would perform and was therefore harder on them, but I didn't find them to have great overall sound and the music was neither exciting or inspiring while listening to them. I really wanted them to win, instead I feel they were at the bottom or near the bottom. I would keep a pair of Beats studio 2 headphones over those Audio-Technicas any day, which is shocking after experiencing how great the sound on the ATH-M50xMG's is that I own.

The BB Pro's have by far the most clear, crisp, tight sound of any of the headphones. Other than the fact that I read great reviews about them, I would have never even thought about a set of cans from Plantronics, but these are amazing and easily won in this comparison. Aside from the best sound of the group, they have longer battery life and range than the others and can pair simultaneously to 2 different devices at the same time, which is a huge plus in my book. Regardless, I judged these mainly on sound alone and these definitely took the gold with a significant lead over the other headphones.

As I noted earlier, we all have different ears and you may agree or you may think I'm crazy for how I ranked these. My intent is to help others in selecting headphones that suit them the best just like I have used the reviews of others for this very reason. If you have any questions, feel free to comment. Thanks!"
199,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these for about a year now, they are fantastic.

Pros:
-sound quality, the SQ is amazing in these headphones. The bass is NOT punchy even though the name would imply it. The overall sound quality is superb.
-Wireless range, I can easily walk 20-30 feet with walls in between when connected to my macbook pro.
-Battery life, I can usually get much longer than the advertised battery life for these headphones. I regularly get 10 hours+ on them. I think they rated battery life at max volume or something.
-VOLUME, speaking of max volume, these things get loud. Too loud in fact, they get uncomfortable loud for me but almost never distort even at near max to max volume.

Cons:
-Small ear pads, BUY BRAINWAVZ ear pads. The stock ones were too small for my ears. With the after market pads, the comfort of these in very good."
200,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought them for my fiancé for a Christmas gift. Work great. Only downside is the background noise from microphone as they are not noise cancelling. If you use them with your phone, you need to be in a quiet environment."
201,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After 3 weeks of owning...

These bass headphones are ideal if you’re looking for some cans that don’t muddle out high frequencies. They deliver punchy tracks with great clarity and have an excellent soundstage that sounds full and open. The battery life is excellent and should only require a charge every few days at most. Considering only these criteria, they live up to their lowered price point well. The only downfall of these headphones is the plasticy build quality, as creaking sounds from the plastic can often be heard when listening at low volumes, especially if you’re listening while walking down the street. However, I haven’t found this quirk bothersome enough to effect my enjoyment for the overall listening experience."
202,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are ideal for audiobooks and classical music. I played various R&B, metal, rap, dub step and alternative music through these and the bass is mediocre. The bass becomes destorted at low volume. The controls on the headphones are fine for me, I use my iPhone to control the volume. The instructions that came with it are in Japanese. I have included the English version in PDF form from AT below. So far I have been playing these for a few hours and the battery is fully charged (per the battery indicator on my iPhone).

As for comfort, I have a big head (XXL) and these are comfortable for me. These are on-ear design headphones and I will replace the ear pads with the Brainwavs replacement pads soon. The pads that shipped with this set are fine. I wanted something with more padding when I need the wear them for an extended time.

The highs and mids are fantastic. The sound stage is good as well. These are no where near the ATH-M50 series. Classifying these as ""Solid Bass"" is misleading. I have been using Amazon Music App, iTunes, Spotify and my files are 320kbps with LAME 3.99 codec and the results are the same. The volume on these is weak as well.

[...]

Wrap up: for 200 bucks these headphones are over priced for the sound quality. The construction quality is ideal. I'd recommend these to those who like audiobooks, classical and some rock music. If you're a bass head you'll be disappointed."
203,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What a GIANT WASTE OF MONEY. Save yourself and buy a pair of the ATH-S700BT Over-Ear Headphones instead. Audio-Technica ATH-S700BT SonicFuel Bluetooth Wireless Over-Ear Headphones
The sound on the headphone listed above has MUCH more clarity than the Solid Bass ATH-WS99BT model. These cans sounded tinny and for being advertised as 'solid bass' there was an underwhelming amount. Maybe due to the circular shape of the ear pieces! I've never met anyone with circular ears and not sure how these could possibly go ""Over-Ear"" when designed like this. What a giant piece of crap. Save the money. Buy the lower model. You'll thank me later."
204,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice sounding headphone. Excellent, but not loose or boomy bass. The build quality is very nice and they are quite comfortable to wear. I find the Bluetooth quality of sound, range, and stability of the connection excellent. I also like that it has a fairly solid amp and as a result can get to the volume level I like which is typically rather loud. All round, it is a solid, well done sound signature with no real weakness to speak of. I think given the quality, the portability and the ability to play very well wired or in Bluetooth mode makes this headphone a very good purchase at this price. I would have no trouble recommending the WS99BT to anybody.

I am an experienced audiophile like person, and I do have years of experience with rather nice headphones including the TH 900, AH D7000, HE 560/400i, HD 650, DT 880 among others so I do have some frame of reference when I say this is a solid sound signature."
205,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are a bargain for the price, especially since they are Audio Technica's. I'm not sure why these aren't marketed more, as it is one of the better wireless headphones they have, maybe it's just AT playing their cards safe. These guys sound great, feel great, and look pretty good also. I haven't even broken these in yet and they still sound great, sound quality is awesome for the price.

Cons(Only one)
- Ear cups are uncomfortable like the aforementioned reviews"
206,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. Bass is great but doesn't drown out the highs or midst. The build quality is good the battery life is decent. My only complaint is that the headband isn't an all metal construction
207,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best sound out of a wireless headphone. I compared to Plantronics Backbeat pro and these look better on and have better sound (highs are not as harsh) but the Backbeat pro has better controls (rotary volume), dual pairing, longer runtime and are quite a bit less $ than these. It's a tough call if your willing to spend more for a bit better sound with these but realize they don't sound as good as their wired studio version the ATH-M50."
208,2.0 out of 5 stars,I'm sorry to report these headphones stopped holding a charge after 5 weeks of use. We contacted the manufacturer and they would not replace or repair them.
209,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent Bluetooth / wired headphones. Great sound, comfort, accessories, and ease of use. Much better than my Sony MDR 10s. Would certainly buy again without hesitation. This review is unsolicited."
210,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superb sound quality, clear and distinct through the entire range of the music. Bass is strong when the song is mixed with heavy bass. Fantastic if you are picky about your sound, and run your own EQ on your device. The headphones are tuned to play what the artist/producer who mixed the song wanted you to hear. Also great for mixing a sound board, as the headphones aren't interfering with what you hear. (And the drums are easier to mix when you can hear all of it!)"
211,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Highly recommend. They turn up louder than your source. Battery life is phenomenal
I definitely recommend purchasing the Brainwaves ear pad upgrades; I'm currently using the sheepskin offering and they are great."
212,3.0 out of 5 stars,great sound
213,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first, I was in love with these headphones, okay quality, wireless, comfortable. Then 3 months later the left side became a lot quieter than the right side. I clearly should have purchased the warranty they offered sadly I did not."
214,5.0 out of 5 stars,I replaced the crap pads for Brain Waves. If the stock pads were better I would have no problem rating these 5 stars! Sound is amazing!
215,5.0 out of 5 stars,These paired easily & were very comfortable. Other than that I was very dissatisfied. The sound is delayed when watching video. I assumed the pair I had was defective and ordered a replacement but the replacement had the same problem.
216,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them!! Great sound quality bass is not too punchy, just right! I was originally going to buy the overpriced beats but i think the sound quality on this is way better!"
217,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked the sound and comfort of these headphones, but after a year, they stopped charging. I payed over $200 for these pieces of junk"
218,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds clear and fits comfortable. After long use it still felt comfortable. Bass is good and bluetooth work excellent.
219,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product; only minus are the command buttons on the headset which are not easy to use.
220,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality. Awesome bass. Does not seal out external sounds.
221,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good Bluetooth headphones with good range competently satisfied
222,5.0 out of 5 stars,more clunky than I thought there would be
223,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great set of headphones that work very well with Apple products. The only minor problem I have found is that the rubbery bit that covers the charging port tends to not stay in place. All the controls are on the left earphone, so it is nice for lefties as well, but in truth you can always rotate them round to suit your right-handedness."
224,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super not impressed with these headphones. The sound is thin but the bass is ok. It works well for music but anything else like podcasts, video games, etc sound kind of weak. The batteries seem to last for awhile though so that's cool"
225,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No other headphones comes close to the bass impact of this headphone, at very high volume and no distortion, coupled with HM5 earpads and Viper4android sound plugin, these are the best.."
226,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality (subjective): The bass is definitely boosted but not overly so, with plenty of detail left. The mids and highs aren't drowned out, everything is still there.

Isolation: Poor with the stock ear pads and poor with HM5 ear pads. (-1 star)

Bluetooth: Range is on par with my other headsets but... I could not get it to pair with more than one device at a time. This is alone was almost -2 stars. Unlike my Sony, Plantronics, and Jabra headsets these would forget the last device once I paired it with a new one (Startech adapter with Bluetooth 4.1 and Nexus 5 with 4.0). How it pairs is also different. Powering it on without a paired device nearby would send it directly to pairing mode, no way around it. However there is no way to force it into pairing mode if there is a paired device nearby. Keep holding the power button after turning it on doesn't work and forcing into pairing mode is not mentioned in the manual. So I have to turn off Bluetooth on the existing paired device, cycle power to get into pairing mode again. In the instructions, to turn on the device you hold the power button for 2 seconds from off, but it also tells you the same thing for pairing."

230,5.0 out of 5 stars,These do not sound any better than my old set from Best Buy I have returned them and purchased a set BackBeat Pro by planTronics they sound much better and the controls are much easier to use but still not of the quality that you would expect from a $250 unit I'm going to try Sennheiser or Bose next
231,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great item
232,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great soundstage. The sounds are well balanced. Battery is easily 8-10 hours of steady use. I have 2 complaints. First is the ear pads. They suck. They are very shallow and my ears touched the cones of the speakers making them very uncomfortable. I swapped these for a 3rd party pad and they are excellent. My second gripe is the call quality. While mostly clear, it's often VERY quiet. I can't understand people on the other end when driving. Overall, very good set of Bluetooth headphones."
233,2.0 out of 5 stars,"There are a lot of different head sets on the market; however, many of them are not Bluetooth wireless nor do they omit background or outside noise like the Audio-Technica Solid Bass Wireless. The only drawback here is if a family member is wearing them, don't expect to carry on any conversation. They won't hear you, but that's why you're buying headsets. Audio Technica sound is so clear, and is great for those who demand clear, concise sound. Unless you're proficient in Japanese, don't bother reading the directions."

238,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Most reviews are for the Japan Import Version, which is a bit cheaper. I previously purchased that version, however, there were some material construction defects with it, so I returned it.

Admittedly, the earpads are small and the opening measures approx. 50mm in diameter (the speaker driver itself is 53mm); this is unreasonably small for an adult. However, there is an inexpensive solution: http://www.amazon.com/Brainwavz-Angled-Memory-Foam-Earpad/dp/B00ZY8PGJI

Aside from the earpads, and having several other high-end BT headphones, these defintiely rank right up there with the best currently on the market. The sound improves with the new earpads, enhancing the soundstage and clarity, without losing the ""solid bass"" aspect.

I currently own 3 BT headphones, the B&O BeoPlay H7, V-Moda Crossfade, and this set. All have a different sound signature, with the B&O BeoPlay H7 having the best clarity with a bit of emphasis on highs, while the V-Moda Crossfade excel with exceptional bass/sub-bass and mid performance. The ATH-WS99BT is not actually a bass heavy headphone, rather, the bass is truly ""solid"" and well represent across the lower frequency range. It is overall the most balanced of the 3 and good for all genres.

I definitely recommend this, but only if you also grab the Brainwavz HM5 earpads. Without the earpads, they are not wearable for long periods of time."
239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"love it,"
240,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the Headphone. The sound quality is great. Clear sound. I use the MDR-1ABT and I was having pains on my Ear. But, the ATH can be on my hears for close to 5 to 6 hours straight while working and not feel anything. But, my concern is the Bluetooth aspect. It works fine with my iPhone 5 and 6 and the range is also wide. But, I noticed while walking and if I place my hand in my pocket which makes my hand rest on the iPhone makes the sound break sometimes.And for my MacBook Pro 2014, I can't go as far as 7feet before the sound start breaking. The sound quality is a 9/10 better than my MDR-1ABT and my Bose SoundLink. But, the bluetooth on those two devices are way better. The sound quality and me not feeling pain on my ears is the reason I'm sticking with it. I always use my chord when it comes to using it with my Mac. And I had a very bad experience with Shipping after paying for Express shipping. Shipping and Bluetooth are the reason I'm leaving you a 3 Star. DEAL WITH IT."
241,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm returning the ATH-WS99BT. The one I was sent had a lot of noise in the left channel when using Bluetooth, a low volume buzzing sound ththat was very distracting when listening to classical music. Noise was not a problem when using the cord for a direct connection to an audio source. I guess the built in amp in the Bluetooth circuit was defective. I also found the level of sound on Bluetooth when turned all the way up was barely adequate for listening to music on the subway or on the street.

The Audio-Technica ATH-M50x Professional Studio Monitor Headphones with Bluetooth Adapter-Amplifier BAL-M50X from East New York Audio proved to be better (once I got East New York Audio to replace a defective Bluetooth adapter). The ATH-M50x sound is clearer, richer, capable of being louder, and less noisy."
242,4.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't have any complaints for a week. But that was when I noticed the poor driver matching at higher frequencies. There was a gray area for frequency response on the right driver. Kinda turned me off. It could just be that I have a defective unit.
243,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Disappointed. The wire is fickle and needs to be pulled out half way to get the volume loud. I have no idea why. When it's pulled out half way, it sounds awesome. Great great great sound with the wire half way out but I wanted the wireless feature most. However, once the wire is out, the sound fades away and no button will increase volume. It's awful. The controls +/- only work as a skip feature, not as volume control. I have to reach for the phone to control volume on Bluetooth, which defeats the point. Highly disappointed. I have no idea if it's the product, wire or what but I am returning this."
244,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me preface this by stating that I am normally an Audio Technica fanboy and have a few sets of their cans. So, the ATH-WS99BT function very well as Bluetooth headphones. I haven't had a single glitch or hiccup regarding connecting to and staying connected to Bluetooth sources, and that in itself is impressive. The Bluetooth functionality works consistently well. However, two things that detract from the experience are: 1) Sound quality - The bass is definitely prominent yet not boomy and holds up to the marketing claims, but the mids and highs sound digital, clinical and cold to my ears. It's not the best sounding headphone from a mere sonic perspective. I use FLAC files from my Android phone, fwiw. For comparison I hard wired the cans to my Schiit Audio Magni amp and the nature of the sound is exactly the same as it is when listening via wireless connection to my phone. Not super impressed. 2) Comfort - It's almost a home run here. The only downside is there is a dome inside the earcups which protrudes from the driver to such a height that your ears rest against it. A short while after donning them the dome becomes painful and I end up removing the cans due to discomfort. I am searching for aftermarket earpads but haven't found much since it seems that earpads with any thickness to them are oval shaped (the earpads for these cans are circular).

I realize that BT sound is a tradeoff for the awesome convenience it provides. For this reason I will keep searching for a solution to the comfort issue and once I have that figured out I will likely be happier with this product. I read about a guy who stuffed cotton balls inside the cups beneath the earpads to get them away from his ears. It looks funky in the pics but I'll try that as an interim solution. I recommend these headphones, but only with the caveat that new earpads will add to the overall cost and should be factored in when shopping for Bluetooth cans. YMMV."
245,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound awesome!!!! This is my first jump into really, quality headphones. I have been getting by on some Phillips Earbuds for the gym and had some cheap $35 over the ears from Ausdom. When I first put these on, my first thought was ""Oh, so that's what they mean by soundstage"". You really can perceive the location of the sounds. It's fantastic. The bass is exactly where I want it. Mostly I wanted a pair of headphones that would clean up the mushy mids and treble that came out of every pair of headphones/earphones that I have ever owned and these did exactly that.

I compared them side by side to some Beats Solo 3's and some Beats Studio 2's. Yes, the bass from the Beats gave the music a nice full feeling but mids and highs were just drowned out. I liked the fit of the Solo 3, it grips my head a lot more securely than the ATH-WS99BT and really isolated a lot better but the overall sound quality just wasn't there. I can see why Bass heads go for Beats but it's just not me and the ATH-WS99BT punches it right where and when I want it.

My only complaint is that they just don't grip my head and isolate my ears like I would hope. I little larger earcup that is oblong instead of round would be a plus as would a slightly thicker earpad. I have ordered some Brainwavz earpads, hoping to get a little better feel. I'm just hoping I don't lose too much bass in the process because the Brainwavz are thicker and will distance my ears from the drivers.

They are great wired or Bluetooth. I have never worn them long enough to identify the actual battery life so it seems pretty significant. I just don't like how the microUSB port is recessed, making it impossible to use some USB cables and I wish the buttons were a little more pronounced and easily identifiable by touch."
246,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I put it back in the box after an hour and began looking up how to return it.

I have had the Audio-Technica ATH-M50 for several years and love it.

I picked up this ATH-WS99BT because of the bluetooth feature, which is awesome. The reason I down voted and am returning these headphones is the physical shape of the speakers. The M50 has oval speakers, where the padding goes entirely around my ears and the pressure is against my skull. Where as the WS99BT has round speakers, and the padding does not go around my ears and instead the pressure is against the ear itself. Also, I found that this lack of a snug fit entirely around the ear, caused the sound to be poor."
247,5.0 out of 5 stars,One month and 15 days I could use them to talk on phone. The music is good as of now. But if I have to take a call I cannot hear the other side properly. Silly thing is I cannot even return and get a replacement as 1 month is already over. Dis this happened to any one?
248,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The BEST bluetooth headphones i've ever had. I have the ATH M50X, Plantronics Backbeat Go 2 and Bose Soundtrue, and these are my favourite ones.
The sound is awesome: crisp, clear and balanced, and can get VERY LOUD since WS99BT include a preamplifier inside. It's like have a M50X wireless.
About the earpads, the stock ones are perfect for me, but bought anyway the Brainwavz angled foams HM5, wich are cool too because they change the sound signature, giving them more bass and space."
249,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound fantastic for the price, fit well, and are of good build quality. I use them as my gym headphones as I prefer over the ear to buds, and only have to charge them about once every two weeks with daily use. Couldn't be happier with this purchase."
250,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones. High quality sound over both Bluetooth and cable. Battery lasts about as much as advertised. I would recommend purchasing different earpads with them, though. I got these: Brainwavz HM5 Velor Memory Foam Replacements Earpads for Over The Ear Headphones"
251,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If I rate these on the ability to be great sounding wireless headphones, I give them 5 stars. A few things keep them from being truly outstanding. The round stock Ear Pads are easily some of the worst I have tried. I purchased replacements that made a huge, seriously huge, difference. The controls on the headphones are just really bad. They work. They do exactly what you want them to do, but you need to be very exact with what you attempt to do. That required precision mostly takes me out of my ""zone"" and away from my music. I still feel that these rival my favorite wired headphones, and I am willing to deal with the controls, but I hope A.T. addresses this in the Revision 2 because they are so damn close to having the greatest BT headphones ever."
252,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have many bluetooth headphones... This is one of the worst ones... Only because of uncomfortable controls... The headphones do sound ok... But i hate the controls... It's confusing which button to press! Instead of one or maximum two buttons, there are four small buttons that i always get confused which is which... Gotta take headphones off to control. It's a primitive control design... One of my headphones's company realized user friendliness and made headphones with two buttons... And you can control everything with ease!!! Audiotechnica doesnt know user friendly control!"

It connects to my Asus laptop and runs like a charm, but not my smartphone. Kind of defeats the purpose of buying it when I wanted something to take with me on the go. My recommendation---keep looking."

257,5.0 out of 5 stars,"MOST UNCONFTABLE PAIR OF HEADPHONES EVER F***ING MADE

Im going to make this quick the sound on these things are not terrible, they are actually pretty good. But what spoils these from being amazing headphones is that you can't wear them for more than 20 minutes with out your ears hurting from how uncomfortable they are, and how easily you sweat while wearing them doing the most simple of tasks. I bought a pair of Bose headset and those are easily much better then this piece of s***."
258,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm coming from the Bose Quiet Comfort 20s, where I had an issue with the chord not surviving past a few months. I wanted a pair of headphones which were wireless, in-ear, and noise-cancelling. That seems like a bit of a tall order, but luckily these fit the bill (as did some other headphones which I've never heard of before).

:: Sound Quality ::

My first thought was, ""I wonder how good they sound."" It doesn't really matter how comfortable a pair can be, nor how long the battery lasts, nor how great the noise cancelling works if in the end they sound terrible. The Bose QC20s were ok, with some exaggerated notes here and there across the spectrum (especially different when you have the noise cancelling feature turned on). My favorite pair of travel-focused headphones are still the Sennheiser PXC-450s, but over-the-ear headphones are annoying to deal with, and on long flights in particular, my ears get too hot, hence my preference for in-ear headphones.

These Audio Technicas sound great. In fact, I was a little surprised how good they sound, given they only have 1 driver (I think). The range is quite good, and they have a more ""natural"" (read: slightly bass-heavy) response curve, which is great for all types of music. My big test is pairing deep bass, focused midranges, and tight treble in the same track and seeing how they fare. I have to say, these did an incredible job, and didn't distort at all (even at very high volumes).

:: Bluetooth Compatibility ::

Going along with sound quality is the suite of protocols which the headphones (and your phone) support. You'll hear a lot about Apt-X (which is a nice codec by itself, but largely absent from most phones). The thing to remember is that a codec or protocol selection is just a piece of the audio quality puzzle. The larger piece is bitrate. Luckily, Android (at least Marshmallow, on the Nexus 6P) supports AAC/MP3/SBC (in descending quality), and these support AAC. In other words, you probably won't notice the audio quality too much in wireless mode. I can hear subtle differences when I use the included headphone jack adapter (which is another great feature of these headphones), but to be honest the sound of background noise contributes more to the quality than these particular codecs would.

:: Microphone ::

While they have a microphone, so you can chat with them as a Bluetooth headset, it's located on the left side, which resides under my chin (and likely under a collar), making my voice very muffled and quiet. It's not unusable, but it's not in a great location, and I wouldn't talk without moving them around a bit. This could use some improvement, in my humble opinion.

:: Battery Life ::

So far, they've gone about 6 hours or so without failing. I haven't gone longer than that, but I'd assume they'd be around 7-8. Of course, enabling the Active Noise Cancelling system will decrease life further.

:: Noise Cancellation and Fit ::

I find these earbuds fit relatively well, but they could definitely use an ear fin for added security. The standard silicone bulb doesn't quite fit as nice as either foam like the Jaybird X2s, or the looser yet better coupling of headphones like the QC20s. Overall, the noise cancellation is very good, but it's somehow more subtle than either my previous Sennheisers or Bose, the latter of which is extremely effective, almost making it sound like you're in a vacuum. These just kill the background noise (up to a point), but don't completely isolate you. I agree with their statement of 90% reduction. If you're on a plane, the engines are drastically reduced, but that doesn't mean you don't hear them at all. They do attenuate a fair bit of ambient noise on their own, so walking around a city with these on is probably not advisable unless you focus on remaining alert.

:: Ease of Use ::

The on button is easy to hold and pair, but it takes 4 seconds to switch on, and another 4 to turn off. The controls for volume up, down, and play/pause are on the inside, and the switch for ANC is on the outside, making it hard to switch on without accidentally hitting another button. I'm not sure why they couldn't have moved a few buttons to the other side, where there aren't any switches.

:: Weight and Comfort ::

They're very discreet. I'm not going to wear them without a collar, as I don't like the feel of rubber on my neck, but after a long day of travelling, I honestly forgot they were still around my neck, so that says something about their weight.

:: Overall Impression ::

They're great headphones, with a great set of features, for a decent price. I like that Audio Technica is the first to enter the in-ear, ANC, wireless marketplace, and they did a great job with these. If they were to add some ear fins, sell memory foam tips, and beef up the chords to triangular or flat ones (for more durability), I'd give that product 5 stars. As it stands now, they are a very solid 4. I'll update this post if they die in the next few months, as my standard for headphones is about 5-10 years of perfect operation."
259,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can say with certainty that the engineers from Audio Technica know how to produce quality audio products and it has shown through the earbuds,headphones they create. This is my 3rd pair of AT In-Earbuds, starting with the CKM-50...wow, those were incredible earbuds for a beginning supposed audiophile like myself..great bass response and clarity, most noticed in Michael Jackson's Dangerous, at least..when I realized how great they could reproduce sound! Second pair of AT earbuds were the Solid Bass CKS 1000i...those were such a beloved set of earbuds...the bass respone was so incredible, sometimes just a tad overwhelming depending on the song and style of music. Clarity was still there and vocals came alive...But now, we move on to the bluetooth set, which I have owned, for almost seven months now. These bad boys are so damn incredible words can't quite describe the sound that they project...If you are a bass lover and want extreme pumping bass, move right along on to the Solid Bass line, they won't dissapoint! If you want tight, punchy and more accurate bass, these do deliver very well. Coming from another bassy type earbud, from another brand that starts with ""S"", at first I was missing that exaggerated punch..Adjusting to the more refined bass took a little bit of time but once my ears settled down, boy was I more happy with how the lower frequencies came out of this set. On to the mid range and most importantly, the higher/treble ranges. Where these earbuds really excel, it is in the higher frequencies. VOCALS! Vocals have never sounded more ALIVE and UP FRONT! One of my favorite example tracks in where I could really feel the singer's voice coming at me as though she was right in front of me is Zedd's ""I Wan't You to Know"" with Selena Gomez...for one, the production and mixing/mastering of that song SHINES with these earbuds..I get tricked, when I close my eyes, into thinking that she is in my room singing to me every time! Whether you listen to Dance/EDM, Folk, Pop, Acoustic/Jazz/Orchestral, you will find yourself being pleased to have purchased these earbuds...I am a music producer, a passion of mines, and I take audio very seriously. I know what I want from my audio equipment and expect the products I buy to deliver the best sound possible and after owning and then misplacing/losing my previous AT earbuds, I knew that I could yet again try a new set and not be disappointed. I have learned to trust in their audio philosophy and the quality in their products! The build quality is pretty good. The neck band isn't much of a nuisance and fits comfortably around the neck but I'll admit I am not of a fan of having anything around my neck..Like I stated before, vocals really do come alive on the ANC40BT. From Josh Groban, Michael Buble, Barry Manillow to Celine Dion, Imogen Heap, Barbra Streisand etc..their voices shine like the top of the chrysler building! I can't believe my ears when I lay down and listen to these artists sing..The soundstaging is so natural and wide. All instruments sounds clean and clear. Bass doesn't interfere with the other ranges on the frequency table. An album that so very easily stands out on these earbuds is Josh Groban's Stages...wow, I am moved every time I listen to that magnificent album. I live for dance/trance music but my tastes are so variated, as you can see by list of vocalist/artists above. I can't say it enough, so far, after a few months, EVERYTHING sounds great. Nothing I listen to on these is disappointing. One last feature that really does seal the deal for me about this set is the ability to use them as a wired set when the battery dies! I like to create music on the go via my mobile device, an LG V20 if you must know, and when doing so, I need a wired set as to avoid any audio delays when using the on screen piano/keyboard. I will say that the V20's excellent headphone/audio Chip a.k.a QuadDAC, from ESS really lets these earbuds perform more naturally and wow, do they go even LOUDER! I highly recommend that phone and listening to these wired when laying in bed, sounds start to breath even more and your music comes out even stronger. You close your eyes and just listen to the music, you'll hear all the little ""subtle yet present"" sounds you hadn't noticed before and be amazed at how you hadn't heard em' before! ..Most mobile devices have weak/not so good audio processing chips, meaning that your audio quality can be hindered and can break your experience in sound, especially with higher end/more expensive headphones/earbuds because they don't supply enough power to output the right amount of sound, so that is why after testing them out with the supplied audio cable, I can wholeheartedly recommend the LG V20 to anyone whom needs the ""best"" audio output from their mobile device when using these earbuds. Anywho, whether they are wired, or wireless, these earbuds will meet any requirements for all sorts of audio/music enthusiasts!
Umm..wait, these are also noise cancelling huh? woops...almost forgot to talk about that! My first experience with these, when they came in my mail: I was at Olive Garden and I tested out said feature, WOW, I was blown away because all I could hear was the music and nothing else. The whole place was filled with happy people eating great food, talking and laughing..I could not hear ANY of them when NC was on! It got to the point that I even forgot where I was and my ex wife was getting frustrated because she was trying to get my attention and I couldn't hear her voice nagging me! For me, that feature most comes in handy when I am on the city bus getting travelling across town. I cannot compare that feature to any other set because this is my first set with Noise Cancellation. But yes, it does work pretty good...
So there you have it, I do hope this may persuade you into buying my new favorite all time set of earbuds. Music has never sounded BETTER!!"
260,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise cancelling technology on these headphones is good. The sound is good as well. Not great, but good. Little low end but basically flat response. Not overly ""tinny"", just a flat response. These get louder than others I have tried. I had to get some XL tips for the earbuds, but after I did that the fit was good. I don't have to keep re-positioning them into my ears every few minutes. The battery life is good as well. I can listen to music all day at work on a single charge. The neck band is not too tight around my neck which is one thing I hate. Can't stand to have things clinging to my neck. Overall I would definitely recommend these to anyone. But if you are looking for a headphone with a deep bass response this is not the one."
261,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound great,but they do slip if you have them on for a while even without exercise. I used mine for a year and took good care of them. storing them in the bag and everything but the cable still got damaged. the inside cable got exposed and began making noises while hearing music. they broke about a week ago which was quite upsetting. I used them a lot, but i would expect that with the care i gave them would have lasted more."
262,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The things that should be improved upon is vibration for incoming calls, a warning when out of range and louder volume and stronger but clear bass. Retracting buds would be nice but if it diminishes reliability I can do without it. The noise cancelling is great."

268,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These have been my favourite headphones for years. Good price with this supplier, reliable delivery"
269,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones (and customer service).

Listening-wise, these are quality headphones in line with what I'd expect from Audio-Technica; they are solidly built, as far as headphones go, and quite light. The earpads are soft but do not cover/wrap around your entire ear, so if you're looking for the physical noise barrier you get with studio headphones, you won't really be finding it here. That said, they do block some noise and are comfortable.

The Bluetooth is easy to set up and pair with a first device (especially if you read the instructions). Once you add other devices, it can be a little difficult to make sure the right device is selected/paired...this is pretty common with my experience with these kinds of devices and is inherent, I'd guess, with having a really simple user interface. Sound quality is good with Bluetooth, and I give the designers extra props for allowing a traditional plug-in option...it really irks me when those kinds of details are left off, and in this case a perfectly usable pair of headphones could be rendered useless with, for example, my old iPod classic. Battery life is impressive--supposed to be 30 some odd hours and I am still going strong off my initial charge.

I did contact Audio Technica customer service--after less than 2 weeks of gentle, indoor, home use, the earpads started wearing through and splitting in the area where their sleeve slips around the plastic of the phones (see photo). There is a 2-year warranty on the phones, and after contacting customer service with a photo and my information I received a response in less than a day and replacement pads in less than a week without needing to send the phones in. Kudos for good customer service!! Although, it's not super inspiring that part of the phones wore out through so little use. I am cautiously hopeful that the more important components will hold up a little better but will update if anything catastrophic happens."
270,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The build quality is amazing. So comfortable. The sound is good, but id say for certain type sod music. For acoustic, live, monitor type stuff its great. You hear every detail and many sounds you dont hear with other headphones. The packaging is also premium. The problem i had with them were they were just too bright for me. After awhile i found them harsh and didn't like listening to my music for long periods. Of course its down to taste. Im not a bass head, i didn't like the sony 950s because even with the bass boost off, the bass was just crazy and overwhelming. These however didn't have enough. Even with an equalizer app, and the bass turned all the way up, music that should have decent bass didn't have nearly enough. These are great if you like totally neutral sound though. I wish they made these with some bas because the comfort and quality was amazing!!!! Not for me though."
271,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First, they are tiny, light, they look very pretty, they are very comfy and they fold flat (which is very practical on the go). The battery life is astounding (around 40 hours). Impressive for a small pair of cans! I’ve noticed some hiccups in Bluetooth mode when my iphone is in my left pocket, but I don’t think this is a deal breaker. They’re not hard to drive (32 Ohms of impedance), but they don’t sound loud in Bluetooth mode (but it’s okay wired). You can notice the difference in sound between Bluetooth and wired, they sound much more vibrant wired. The wire comes with a mic/1-button remote, that is very cool.

As for their sound quality, here is my impressions after one week of intense listening :

They lack a little bit of sub-bass, but the bass response is however punchy, quick and very tight. No muddiness and absolutely no bleed in the mids. Personally, it’s the kind of bass response that I like a lot : not boosted, just enough punchy, quick and very accurate. But in comparison with other well-ranked Bluetooth cans (like the Sennheiser Momentums Wireless), they could have a more vibrant response in the sub-bass region. They’re definitely not for hardcore bassheads.

The mids were very upfront and presents a lot of details and enough richness for on-ears cans. At my first listen, I was amazed by the way the voices come so close to my ears. The singer seems to be quite next to your face. These cans have a definite emphasis on the mids, but I don’t think it’s a flaw, they are accurate and well enough rendered.

Where their weakness begins is from the upper-mids to the highs... There is a noticeable emphasis in the upper-mid region that brings some harshness with the already noticeable treble emphasis (I think it’s part of Audio Technica’s common sound signature). This sounds like there is too much traffic in the mids to highs transition. It sounds harsh, congested and too much sharp in certain tracks, especially in some jazz tracks (saxophone peaks), rock tracks (fuzzy electric guitars) and some high-range vocals (female voices). It can brings a lot of details in some tracks, but it also can be a tad too bright to be non-fatiguing on some others, particularly at higher volume. For example, in some rock tracks, the vocals, the electric guitars and the cymbals together takes too much presence in the mix, so almost all the juicy details, the accuracy and the resolution (that is so pleasant to listen in some quieter tracks) were simply lost into an unpleasant moments of intense harshness. Too bad...

So, considering this, I am wondering if I will return them (I’m very picky with sound). But maybe some treble less-sensitive listeners will love them. They were so close to fill my picky needs... Too bad...

EDIT: Following this frequency graph from a Head-Fi.com review, I decide to give them another chance with a little help from EQ settings. A little tweak up in the sub-bass and low-mids region, tuning down high-mids just a tad, and that's it! Wow... Just amazing. They now worth a 5 stars."
272,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I hope to save many of the readers some time when looking for a great sounding, compact, bluetooth wireless set of headphones. These are the ones. I really like to listen to quality music and have about $15K of equipment my home system.

Rearch: I bought my daughter some black Beats Solo 3's for her birthday from Costco and of course she wanted another color from Best Buy so I decided to keep the black ones. After listening to them for a week or so I really found them uncomfortable and the sound was not great. My ears sweated and the bads ""stuck"" to them. The sound was nothing to note. Kind of flat. Admittedly, I am using my Samsung S7 for a source. I returned them.

I then picked up the Bose On Ear Wireless Soundlink headphones. They are comfortable and very compact. That said, they do feel a little like ear muffs as they really do sit on your ears and have foam in the center. I kept playing with the settings on my phone trying to get more separation out and vivid sound out of them. They just sound muddy as some others have described.

So, after watching the documentary on The Avett Brothers I noticed they use Audio Technica in the studio shots. I tried to find a retailer that carried the SR5BTBKs locally. No luck. I ordered them on Friday night and they showed up this morning. Testing so far: with high res setting on my phone for audio: Diana Krall (various songs), Pink Floyd, Khalid (off my daughter's playlist - this kid Khalid is really good), Wes Montgomery, Neil Young and some Dave Brubeck. Listened to the same music with corded hook up as the directions say that is the way to get high res. Bounced back and forth between the Bose and the AT's. The result: The Audio Technica blow the Bose (and for that matter the Beats) off the map. Even though they are on ear, they almost hug your ear instead of pressing against them. Very comfortable and not ""ear muff like"" like the Bose. They are not as compact as the Bose really fold in and these just turn to lay flat. I think there is more sound leakage than the Bose but not much. Sound w and w/out blue tooth: Bright, vivid, nice separation but also have a sound stage. The Bose almost sounded like a mono recording which is fine if that is what the source music was recorded. Some say the AT's are too bright. I disagree, they are vivid. Do they have bass? Yes, Khalid sounds great. They just reproduce the music like it was recorded. You just notice things that you didn't on the others. On Wish You Were Here, you hear all the sniffing and moving by David Gilmour but then you also hear his fingers changing position on the strings. Not changing between chords but actually moving on the strings to get in position.

I am very happy with these. I think the ultimate stamp of approval is that I just keep reaching for these to listen to another song. The Bose sat on my desk for weeks. Also, my wife put them on for about 10 seconds after listening to the Bose - same song from Diana Krall, put them down and said ""those sound much better, I hope you still have the box for the Bose so you can return them"""
273,5.0 out of 5 stars,".What a catchy Name: ATH-SR5BT. SR stands for “Sound Reality”. Let’s call them ATs.

Clean, clean sound. Not super loud, but enough so you aren’t always itching to turn them up to eleven. Not for bass heads and I could have wished for a little more, but still very good at this price point. Beautiful construction; I can’t emphasize that enough. Small and light. Quite comfortable unless I wore glasses. Excellent controls unlike so many BT headphones that are finicky and fiddly. Fast and easy initial pairing. When pairing or re-pairing to a new or previously registered device, be sure EVERY other paired device has bluetooth turned off or is out of range, because these ATs stubbornly cling to the last known device. Battery seems to last. Worked flawlessly with iPhone, great microphone for calls. Paired to my TV with fairly good sound.

Sound: To my chagrin, age has robbed me of high frequency hearing over 9K Hz. So look elsewhere for a nuanced judgement. But I can say if you are a bass head, skip these . But for me, the bass felt clean and tight; Really a pleasure. There was accurate bass right down below 30 Hz. Not loud, but there. Up at 40 Hz or so you start to get real bass. I think being on-ear instead of over-ear costs in the bass department, but that is an inevitable compromise. Midrange felt really accurate. I give these a “B” grade, or, for the price, an “A”.

From what I can tell, very good detail in midrange. Obviously, if the ATs claim high resolution capability, that has to come through the supplied 4' cable. Blue tooth gave great results that I could not hear as being any worse than being cabled, but what do I know (or rather hear)? At this point, that BT isn't as good as cable. Still, they sounded great. As for Hi-Resolution? Personally I think the whole Hi Res thing delusional... even if I had the ears of a 20-year-old. I rely on rigorous double-blind tests for that opinion. Does anybody need headphones that go up to 40Khz? I've heard the arguments and I think not. Your opinion may vary. Obviously if Audio Technica is bragging on Hi Res, such a capability, then they are praising their clarity right down to the bass, but especially at high frequency. I’ll let Golden Ears chime in on that. I can tell you I walked with them for a couple hours and the music was never fatiguing. So much better than my V-moda buds, which I quite like.

-Initial charge is supposed to take up to 5 hours. It only took 2. REALLY hard to see indicator light turns from red to blue once you are fully charged.

-Power switch on right side gives a down-note when turning off and up-note when turning on. It gives a chime when bluetooth connection happens. I found the sound cues more useful than the microscopic indicator light.

-Auto power-down after 5 minutes if no signal. ATs reset to medium volume with power off.

-The battery goes for a long time.

-These on-ear headphones exert some pressure but I could wear them forever without glasses. With glasses about an hour. Sound isolation? Pretty good for on-ear; They sounded kind of like I was underwater as I walked around outside.

-Pairing is fast and easy. The ATs search for a device each time they are turned on. They will remember the last device so make sure that device it is turned off or out of range if you want to switch from, say, your phone to your laptop, or pair to a new device. ATs can remember 8 devices. When you power on the ATs they pair to the last device within a few seconds.. If that device is not found, they go into discovery mode and pair to whatever you have open. I'm paired to a desktop, an iPhone, an iPod, and my Panasonic VT60 TV.

When I turn on the ATs near the Panasonic TV, The Panny senses the ATs and pairs within seconds. So easy... as long as last paired device has BT turned off. Sometimes I have to hunt around and turn off 2 or 3 devices till the ATs will switch to discovery mode.

With my TV, for some reason the fidelity is just a shade less than my Sennheiser RS120s; Maybe it's the 12 foot distance or that the Sennheisers are using between 863-927 MHz RF. On the other hand, there is sometimes some hiss with the Sennheisers, and none with the ATs. I can get the traditional 30 feet away or a little bit more before the sound breaks up. If I walk to the room behind the metal chimney, range is half that.

Using bluetooth on your portable device? Have a backup battery for that device.

Phone performance: Best external microphone ever. No fast forward/reverse but everything else worked well. My callers could not tell I was using a mike on a cord.

I did not use the NFC link. I wish my Apple devices had them. Many Androids do. Any iDevice that has Apple Pay has NFC, but Apple, as far as I know, just limits it to Apple Pay. Too bad. From what I can understand, NFC is just used for really fast and automatic Bluetooth connection, but once connected you are still listening over bluetooth."
274,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound as good as any Bluetooth headphone I ever listened to. I had a $499 pair of bang and olufsen h8s and they were luxious and I loved them except the Bluetooth cuts and in a out. I would say for $200 headphones these sound great but honestly I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between $500 Bluetooth and this pair. They sound that good. I heard bass lovers should avoid these and despite listening to hip hop I love them. I also listen to pop, rock, reggae, alternative and r&B sometimes.

The connection is great and I never hear it cut in or out. I also saw in a review that you can't do one of the controls I think the person said volume. But you can. The switch when pressed to forward will do volume but if you hold it down a second or so it'll skip to next song. So all the controls on headphones work.
The headphones are also comfortable. They are close enough to Bose comfort so that I am happy and don't have issues. They also are pretty lightweight. Looking at the pictures of them online I thought they would be large headphones and I don't like that. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived and were about perfect size. Not too small so the sound seems small and not to big to look dorky or ridiculous. I think the headphones look stylish enough and not too flashy or plastic feeling.
One more comment on sound quality. The headphones have a hi-res sound sticker on the box but that is only when they are connected by the wire. I didn't notice a sound quality drop without cable however. I have owned a lot of headphones from most of Bose, beats, bang and olufsen, bowers and Wilkins, Sony, philips, senheiser and more. I have not seen it being worth spending $500 for Bluetooth headphones when one like this $199 set sounds as good. These headphones retail for $199 which means on due time there will be cheaper prices. It is a bargain and most normal people will not see how any other Bluetooth set sounds better. I highly recommend them"
275,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are not for me because the bass is very light and while not being a bass head, I would like considerably more bass in my headphones. So why the five stars? They sounded the way they were meant to sound and just because I didn't like them, I'm not going to down grade them.

They are really nice headphones. They are very light, they look good and appear to be well made."
276,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Audio-Technica ATH-SR5BT are ok. That's about it. It isn't amazing, you will not discover anything new in the music that you listen to.
The pros: 38 hours of battery life. Very light, good looking design. The bluetooth range is pretty good compared to other headphones. It played back without interruptions while I was in the other room separated by a wall and a fridge.
The cons: biggest con is LATENCY. The time it takes for the sound to play in SR5BT just isn't fast enough for gaming, watching videos with people talking, for video editing where you would have to sync dialogue, or for music recording. So the bluetooth function is really only good for playing back music, which might be fine for most users, since you won't notice any latency. Otherwise, the latency in the actions that I have described will make you plug them in.
Comfort: wearing longer than half an hour will start to get on your ears, taking them off might hurt a bit."
277,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great battery life, unfortunately they dont get very loud and the bass is lacking (reason for the minus 1 star). But the sound is very clear, movies/Netflix sound great for vocals and background sounds. Music sounds excellent but again they dont get very loud, i can listen to them at full volume comfortably. I have yet to test them in a louder environment where im trying to avoid outside noises.

They're comfortable. I have yet to get the nfc feature to work when switching between my table and cell phone. The range on them is also amazing, i can walk around my 2 level home and stay connected.

Overall im very happy."
278,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a producer, live electronic performer and audiophile. I need folding headphones with high quality sound and portability for recording and live mixing/monitoring that also work around the house. I have tried many on-ear and in-ear headphones, and these are, by far, the best! I bought two pairs just in case! I was drawn to the design of Beats by Dr. Dre, but was disappointed by the sound and the ridiculous price-to-quality ratio. These are so much better in every way! They have a nice, balanced sound too."
279,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these today at a local retailer. Being a bit of a fanboy, I decided I wanted these even though I already own the QC25. I have only been listening to them for less than an hour, but I am very impressed. The soundstage is the thing that keeps wowing me. The separation and placement of instruments is really good. The comfort is supreme and the bluetooth paired very easily to my iPhone 6 plus. The QC35 arrived with 70% power out of the box. After almost an hour, they are still at 68%.

Sound impressions:

I always start with Thievery Corporation - A warning (Dub) from Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi album. This is about the deepest bass of any track I own. The QC35 handled it easily. Very deep and without driver rattle and still able to reproduce the midrange and treble. The rhythms in this song like to oscillate back and forth and that staccato effect is reproduced very well.
Next up was Steely Dan - Everything Must go. I started with Green Book as it has a very prominent piano (always the most difficult instrument to reproduce) and a ""Lead Drum"" pushing the song forward. This song also has a wide soundstage and, again, wow. I moved on to the Title track 'Everything Must Go."" The song open with a cacophony of instruments all improvising with a rolling drum adding backbeat. On the QC25, every instrument can be picked out. The sax is wonderful and seductive.
Moving on, I played The Toadies ""Possum Kingdom"" to see if the grungy rhythm guitar could be reproduced. Sorry, but I got lost in this song and forgot I was reviewing. That is always the mark of a great headphone to me.
When I regained my senses, I played Sublime ""Garden Grove"" to see if the impact from the steel drum would show up. It did, easily.
Moving on, The Stone Roses ""Love Spreads"" was up next. Lots of chances to muddy up on this one - bass and lead play together with a heavy drum set. Nope, the QC35 handled and kept everything in it's place.

Oh, the noise cancellation. Come on...Bose owns here. Literally, they take legal action against any company that attempts to infringe on their noise cancelling algorithm. Even Bose detractors admit that they own the NC segment.

Should you buy the QC35? If you own no other NC headphones, it's a no-brainer. Get these today. If you want to cut the cord and have the best noise cancelling money can buy, get these today. If you are completely insane (like me), and already own the QC25 - well, your call on that one. You could probably purchase a bTunes add on for a lot less.

If you find this review helpful, go ahead and click on the button to let me know. If you have questions, leave a comment and I'll try to get to it quickly.

************
Updated Tip: If you want to pair to more than one device, it's not real clear how to do that. This is what I found out playing around today. Power the QC35 on - you will hear it pair or attempt to pair with the last device. Now slide the power button to the on position again and hold it for 1-2 seconds and the voice prompt will say ""ready to pair a new device.""

*************
Tip #2: I have read a few reviews that wish Bose would have included a cable with controls instead of just a straight audio cable. I just checked and the QC25 cable Bose Quiet Comfort 25 Headphones Inline Mic/Remote Cable for Apple devices - Black works with all functions. So, if you really want that function, it is available."
280,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Product seemed to be good, tech support is terrible!

I purchased this headphone and had been enjoying it since December 2016. I've found the sound quality and noise canceling features to be great until it started malfunctioning.

First, it started as some static in the left earcup. After an hour the sound started breaking, and now it does not work anymore. Tried to contact the tech support, which took about two days to get the first answer. Despite the fact I have filled the ticket with all details about the headphone (model serial) and my personal information (address, name, phone number), the person asked again for the very same information.

Another two days waiting and finally received a response with a few steps asking to test the headphone on other devices. Have tested it, sent the message with the same problem, and it has been radio silence ever since.

It's amazing to see the reviews here at Amazon with people complaining about defects and detailing their poor experiences with the tech support. Bose, this is not a cheap product and we expect an appropriate support for it. You cannot send a reply to these reviews asking to send an email to tech support after customers had already done it, to be just ignored or to get delayed and improper responses.

It does not matter the product is good if you don't act properly in a problematic situation."
281,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Intro: If you want to experience what it’s like to go deaf and only be able to hear beautifully presented music, the QC35s are for you! With unbeatable noise cancellation, superb comfort, exceptional sound quality, and solid build quality, $350 may seem like a hefty price but it is worth every penny.

Design: The QC35 have practically the same design as the QC25, but with wireless controls built-in to the right earcup. The headphones feel tough and premium. The QC35 utilize Bose’s special plastic that is glass-filled nylon, soft Alcantara on the headband, memory foam in the earcup padding, slanted drivers inside for better comfort and soundstage, metal caps on the earcups, and solid clicky buttons. The mechanism for size adjustment is solid, and the QC35s can fit a wide variety of head sizes. The ear cups rotate 90 degrees, but the earcups face outward instead of inward when worn around the neck. The folding mechanism allows the QC35 to fit in the included carrying case (which is equally high quality in its build). Throughout the past two weeks of my testing, I have accidentally dropped the QC35 one or two times from around 4 feet, and they have suffered no damage whatsoever. Solid. UPDATE: I have owned the headphones for over a year now. They've been thrown into a backpack without its case, accidentally tossed on the ground during gym workouts, and I have worn them through the wear and tear of everyday life almost every day, yet with the exception of a few tiny nicks in the paint, they still look practically brand new.

Comfort: The QC35 headphones are VERY comfortable. Just the best out there with no competition. Out of all my friends who tried it, the only one who complained about comfort has a relatively small head. I have no problem wearing them for several hours in a row, so long listening sessions and airplane flights are easy. Comfort slightly improved over time, as the headband grew slightly looser through use. Due to the previously mentioned material choices and perfect clamping force, wearing these feels like having pillows hug your head. Bonus: they can also sort of function as earmuffs during colder winter seasons – they're saved my ears from freezing numb, multiple times.

Noise Cancellation: There’s really not much to say. The Bose QC35 is simply the best noise cancelling headphone in the world. Previous iterations of Bose's noise cancelling headphones and earbuds convinced me that they had perfected noise cancellation and it couldn't possibly get better, but I was wrong. The QC35 isn’t massively improved, but it is even more perfect than previous Bose noise cancelling headphones. Noise cancellation feels extremely natural because it lacks the feeling of “pressure” on your ears when being used, and there is ZERO hiss or white noise from the noise cancellation. The QC35 cancels sound so naturally and smoothly that it feels more very comfortable pair of soundproof-earmuffs than electronic noise cancelling headphones. Previously, sudden noises (such as a shutting car door) would cause the QC20 earbuds to “pop”, when it fails to cancel the sound. The QC35 handles these situations much better. Bose was already the king of noise cancelling and these just takes that a step higher.

Sound Quality: Overall, the sound is warm, full, and relaxing, but fairly neutral in general. (Although they are very neutral, their nature as being noise cancelling headphones doesn't make them a good option for audio monitoring.) Whether listening to music or watching movies, everything just sounds right. Vocals, instruments, bass notes, bass rumbles, high-frequency sparkles all isolate from each other very well. Bass is especially impressive: it’s exciting, but not overpowering whatsoever, and bass extends DEEEEP, to below 15hz with no distortion! Also, for the first time in Bose’s series of noise cancelling headphones, they sound almost equally as good turned off (and through a cable connection), as when they are turned on. Sound quality over Bluetooth is fantastic. Even the soundstage is quite respectable for a pair of closed-back, noise cancelling headphones. Sometimes I wish the sound is a little more energetic, but honestly that's just nitpicking.

Features: First off, I would like to make it clear that Bose’s claims that the QC35 has 20 hours of battery life and 33 feet of Bluetooth range are utterly false - BUT in a good way! In my testing, the QC35 lasted me upward of 25 hours on a full charge, and after the battery was drained, they charged up very quickly. Even more shockingly, I found that the QC35 has more than DOUBLE Bose’s estimated Bluetooth range. When connected to my OnePlus One smartphone via Bluetooth, the range is at least 75 feet with no obstacles. With this insane wireless range, I can leave my phone upstairs in my bedroom, walk downstairs to grab a cup of water, and walk back upstairs with almost no stuttering. It’s incredibly liberating, being free from a physical connection. Additionally, I was extremely pleased to find that the QC35's volume and play/pause controls work on Android, iOS, and Mac OS X!! Edit: after testing the QC35 on more Android devices, I found that on some devices the headphone volume controls will adjust the phone's media volume, and on other devices it adjusts its own internal volume.

Comparison to the competition: When the Sony MDR-1000x was released, they were touted around the internet as the Bose QC35 killers, but having tested a pair, I can confidently say the QuietComfort 35 is better at making the world go ""Quiet"", and better at being ""Comfortable"". The MDR-1000x has a very audible electronic hiss with active noise cancellation enabled, and is not as good at reducing the sound of voices, compared to the QC35. The QC35 is also significantly lighter with a much softer and well-distributed clamping force around the ears. In comparison, the Sony's felt hard on my head. In terms of sound, both are good in their own ways: the QC35 is smoother and more relaxed while the MDR-1000x is more aggressive/energetic, so that's just up to personal preference.

Quotes: Here are a few testimonials from my friends who tried them out. Friend A: “Spending $350 on headphones is a LOT for me, but I hate to admit that I’d be very willing to pay for these, because they’re SO GOOD.” Friend B: “(to another friend) Dude you gotta try these, it’s like being put in another universe.” Friend C didn’t say anything. He just closed his eyes and started dancing in his seat.

Conclusion: I guarantee you that the Bose QC35 will make you smile, and you will love them, regardless of who you are and what you do. So if you have enough money to spend on high-end headphones, hesitate no longer and make yourself a very lucky person by owning a pair of QC35s."
282,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've now had 2 of these break in less than a year. On the first one, the sound stopped working on one side. On the second one, the battery suddenly got very warm and the unit wouldn't charge anymore. I was traveling both times, and Bose's options were abysmal for helping me out; I could wait weeks and weeks (hard to do when traveling) and have them receive my old ones and repair them, and ship them back. They wouldn't cross ship or allow me to return at a store, despite being under warranty.

TL;DR -- the warranty has had a major downgrade compared to past products."
283,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a professional musician who does a fair amount of travel. My main considerations in choosing a pair of headphones were sound quality & noise cancellation. I tested the Bose, Sennheiser, & Sony — paying particular attention to those two parameters. Here is what I found:

N O I S E C A N C E L L A T I O N
BOSE: These have the best noise cancellation by far. One of the tests I did was to turn on a vacuum cleaner beside me and listen to the differences. Bose’s ability to cancel the sound is quite amazing. All that was left was a whisper. I also turned on the dryer in an adjoining room. With the Bose, all that I heard was the click of the buttons on the drum.

SENN: The Senns do a pretty good job of canceling sound. What’s left from the vacuum test contains more mid-range noise than with the Bose. The annoyance factor is cut way down, but Sennheiser is clearly not trying to equal Bose in this regard. With the dryer test, I could still hear the machine, though greatly reduced, and the quiet sound of the clothes.

SONY: The Sonys are about equal to the Senns in the vacuum test, but the spectrum of what’s left is different: Whereas the Senns let pass a fairly neutral midrange, the Sonys pass a smaller spectrum focused in the high-midrange. They bested the Senns in the dryer test, almost equalling the Bose: Most of the machine sound was gone, but more of the upper-mid sounds of the clothes remained.

VERDICT: For cancellation the Bose are the clear winners. The Senns are the weakest in this regard, and the Sonys about in between. One thing must be noted here: Only the Sonys have the capability of running Bluetooth without NC. This is an advantage in that NC causes a slight amount of hiss — and the Sony’s hiss is just slightly more apparent than that of the other two to these old ears. Turning off NC does not otherwise affect the sound.

S O U N D Q U A L I T Y
BOSE: Of the three, the Bose offer the least pleasing sound — which is not to say that it’s bad. The sound is very clear and tight, but it’s also kind of brittle — a little too pristine and bright. In passive wired mode, this effect is mitigated and the sound is somewhat warmer.

SENN: Here is where the Sennheisers excel. Of the three, these sound the most like an audiophile headset. Whereas the other two tend to flatten the sound, the Senns have a lovely transparency. They have the richest spectrum, such that you can really hear the subtle raspy timbre of a voice or the expressive nuance of a bass tone. The sound is even slightly more luscious in passive wired mode.

SONY: The Sonys fall about in the middle between the two, although this may be a matter of taste. They offer a truly beautiful, warm sound — clear like the Bose but without the brittleness; warm like the Senns but with less detail. In passive wired mode, the tendency toward a bass-forward EQ is accentuated.

VERDICT: If sound quality is the most important factor, then the Bose are not in the running as far as Bluetooth performance is concerned: the other two are a significant notch above. Those who prefer a transparent, detailed sound will prefer the Senns. Those who prefer a warm, focused, bass-forward sound will prefer the Sonys. If wired mode will be a significant use, then the Bose can be considered at least in the same league, with the Senns setting the standard.

L O O K & F E E L
BOSE: A nice feature is the pivoting earpieces, which make them the most comfortable to hang around the neck. These headphones put the least pressure on the head, and the pads are very comfortable. All controls are on the right ear. The on/off/pair button is well-designed and satisfying. The Silicon-Valley Generic voice gives a percentage of charge on boot-up.

SENN: These have a kind of vintage look to them. They offer a bit more pressure on the head than do the Bose, but the leather pads are luxurious. The volume/pause/skip button is an elegant design feature. The voice on boot-up does not give a charge percentage, but the lovely British accent almost makes up for it.

SONY: These are some sharp-looking pieces! I got the teal-colored ones and they’re stunning. Pause/skip and volume are nicely separated on the right side, with on/off/pair on the left. They provide the most pressure on the head, with nicely-finished pads. The boot-up voice gives a high/medium/low accounting of charge. While not as sensuous as the Senn’s Brit, the Sony’s Midwest Professional voice is more refined than the Bose’s.

VERDICT: The Bose are the most comfortable, the Senns have the most elegant volume/pause/skip control, and the Sonys are by far most fun as a fashion accessory.

S U M M A R Y
These are all well-designed headphones. Not one of them is better in every way; rather each offers a solution that makes different trade-offs. The Bose favor NC. The Senns favor sound quality. The Sonys offer a kind of compromise between these two, while adding the NC-off option and a fashion-forward look. You can’t go wrong with any of them, but the optimum choice will depend on the user’s priorities.

S P E C I A L N O T E T O M U S I C I A N S
The third test I did was to play soprano & tenor saxophone with NC on and no incoming audio, as one of my intended uses is to cut a few dBs off the volume while practicing. All three headsets function better in this regard than do custom in-ear passive hearing protectors, as the ear canal is not blocked. The Senns let through the most natural sound by far. The Sonys are a slightly better at reducing the highs, but the resulting sound is a bit hard-edged. The Bose cut down the overall dBs the most, but the result is a downright tinny sound."
284,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES... when they work. :/

I was psyched when I got these, and felt like they were well worth the $350.

However, after using them for about three weeks I noticed the bluetooth was glitchy, causing the music to cut in and out.
I sent that pair back, hoping it was isolated to the one pair.
Got the new pair and within a few hours I noticed the bluetooth cutting out again, although not as bad as the first pair.

If you get a pair of these headphones that don't have bluetooth issues, then these are the best headphones out there.
If you want a pair of headphones that offer noise cancelling and take wireless calls, these are the best out there.

I did research online and found that several other users also had bluetooth problems.
This is disappointing to me because I LOVE the Bose brand.

Message to Bose: FIX THE BLUETOOTH ISSUES!"
285,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After experiencing a problem with these headphones, I contacted Bose Customer service. While I like the product overall, the customer service that one gets for what I consider a major purchase is left wanting. After my contact with Customer Support, I was asked to complete a survey (not that it could actually be submitted - see below). The information I put into their comments section should answer any questions:

---------------------------------

1. Representatives should first listen to what has been attempted by the caller. I understand that there is likely a guide/flowchart for resolution, but having to explain to the representative ""Nope, I can't do that due to the issue I've been attempting to explain"" is frustrating (Rep: ""Slide the switch towards the bluetooth symbol for 10 seconds"". Me: ""I've told you that doesn't work, but I'm doing it."" Rep: ""Now you should be hearing the confirmation."" Me: ""Nope."" Rep: ""Just slide the switch to the bluetooth setting for 10 seconds."" Me: ""I am and I have."" Rep: ""You should be hearing the confirmation."" Me: ""Nope. Because it's not working. That's why I called."" Rep: ""Are you sliding the correct switch <explains switch location>?"" Me: ""Yes."" Rep: ""Are you holding it for 10 seconds?"" Me: ""Yes."" Rep: ""It sounds like there may be a problem with the switch on the headphones. Please hold while I attempt to find a way to resolve this problem.""

2. Representatives/Bose Support should not utilize and even use as a troubleshooting referral/tool the Community Support area on the Bose website if they are going to discredit the information given in that site. When I indicated that the bluetooth switch not working on some models of the QC 35, citing the Bose website, I was told ""No, that issue does not exist for these headphones."" If one reads the community support that Bose encourages users to utilize it is clear that this is a problem. If Bose Support does not think the information on the Community Support site is valid, then don't refer customers to it.

3. After paying over $350 for a luxury product, I think it was inappropriate to then ask for me, the customer who was supplied with a defective item, to then be required to give my credit card information and pay for shipping. When this happened, I actually double checked that I had contacted the correct Bose support phone number as I thought I had perhaps stumbled into a scam.

4. I was told by the representative the amount that I would be charged for shipping. When the first email was received, I was actually charged more. So not only was I required to give my credit card number, and get charged for shipping a defective product, I was not even given the correct charge. Did I stumble into a scam after all?

5. The support emails that were sent had dead image links (making it look even more like a scam) and were in two parts. The information about the ""Return #"" was not mentioned during the call and was not mentioned in the first email until the very end. That information should have been clear and at the beginning of the email. The second email, the one that actually had the shipping label, did not mention at all that a Return number was needed. It simply had instructions for attaching the shipping label. In short, don't split shipping instructions across two emails, make sure that relevant information is presented first, and fix your image links.

6. The emails that were sent have also indicated that I am required to now insure the headphones being returned for their $350 value. This is yet another charge to insure a product that no longer even works properly. Your returns policy is not fair and is misleading.

7. The survey asks if I would refer family or friends and simply gives a 1-10 Likert scale for likely/unlikely. I want to make clear that, based upon this experience, I will actively discourage others from buying a Bose product until the problems outlined above have been addressed. I also intend to publish this information at the site where the purchase was made.

------------------------------------

To add insult to injury, after taking the time to complete the survey, the Bose website experienced a ""Runtime"" error due to a configuration problem that actually presents a security risk (the customErrors tag does not appear to have been turned off, and configuration information is presented - a ""no no""). Attempts to try and resubmit simply result in the same error. Their survey tool is broken.

To be clear, the Bose Community Support site has multiple posts seeming to indicate that the latest Firmware update breaks the functionality of the bluetooth pairing feature. One can still use the Bose Connection app to delete devices and connect, but 1) only on IOS and Android devices (not Windows, Linux, etc.) 2) can only connect to one device at a time, deleting the previously paired device and adding the new one [the headphones are advertised as being able to connect to more than one device], and 3) the bluetooth pairing feature on the headphones themselves remains broken.

I will be attempting to return the headphones today. Customer support indicated that after the headphones are received, it can take 10 days to verify the receipt, several more days to process, and then another week or two for shipping the replacement. Approximately 3-6 weeks from the sound of it. I carefully took pictures to show how I shipped the item back, including the RMA on 3 surfaces of the outside of the box as well as another copy inside the plastic bag that contain the headphones. And, of course, the shipping label for which I had to pay. I'll try to update how long it takes and if any further difficulties are experienced."
286,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just bought these a few hours ago from Best Buy. I started with the original Triports in 2003, then the OE Triports in 2007, the QC15, and now these QC35's. Take a look at the pic I posted to give truth to my review.

For this review I am going to compare these QC35's to my QC15's and focus the review on upgrading if you already own a previous model and if these are worth buying if they are your first pair of active noise cancelling headphones.

First off, the silver color is so much more better than the black. I think what makes the silver pop is the shiny Bose logo and the silver/gray contrast. The black would have looked better if it had contrasting colors but it just looked plain and kinda cheap really. The silver just looks so stunning.

BUILD:
The QC35 is built way better than my QC15. Honestly, I never liked the build quality of the QC15 since day one but since I take very good care of my equipment, it was a non-issue for me. The QC35 has a good amount of metal accents and hardware and just looks more high quality. I like how the headband has a stainless steel brace (The QC15 has a metal brace too but it is surrounded by a lot of cheap plastic and it is much thinner.) Bose says the QC35's are built with ""glass-filled nylon."" I have no idea what that means but they definitely feel substantial and clearly superior to the QC15. They also weigh a lot more than the QC15 (8.2oz vs. 6.8oz w/o wires.) Actually at the Best Buy store, they even had these right next to the QC25 and I felt the QC35 was superior to them as well. The headband of the QC35 is made of Alcantara compared to the cheap ""I have no idea what it's made of"" material on the QC15. Both headphones are comfortable but the QC35 appears like it would be more comfortable for longer periods of time. I feel like the QC35 cradles your head but the QC15 squeezes it slightly. I feel that the QC15 headband pushes down on the top of your head and it can get uncomfortable after some time. I can't describe it but when you put the QC35 on your head, it just feels good and comfortable. You can check my QC15 review from a few years back and I think I said something like ""you can take the BOSE logo off them and they would feel like $30 headphones."" I still stand by that today. The QC35 definitely looks more high quality than the older QC15.

SOUND QUALITY:
This is where it gets interesting. You have to look at another review for specifics but I will say that the QC35 does have some better low-end punch compared to the QC15 at lower volumes. I think it has to do with the Bose EQ circuitry that is new for this model. Here is the problem, the QC35 in wireless mode does not play as loud as I would like. I have it connected to my iPhone 6 and I would need at least two more clicks on the volume for me to be satisfied. For a headphone in this price range, this is actually quite laughable as you would think this would not be a problem. In wired mode, attached to my computer, it gets loud enough for my satisfaction but the problem with that option is that the cord they give you is too short, too thin, and too cheap. Bose should really be ashamed of that move on a headphone at this price-point. People are complaining that the cord does not have an inline mic or volume control but what's the point of that when those two features are actually built into the right ear cup of the headphone? I'm not one to be that picky regarding an upgraded cord but Bose should definitely have included a longer and a much higher quality wired cable with these headphones to match them. This is just not acceptable and a little surprising from this company.

In summary, I did pick up the low end punch of the QC35 at lower volumes but I would still say both headphones have similar sound quality overall. There is nothing else about the QC35, with regards to sound quality, that jumps out for me. If your first reaction is ""I don't hear a difference"" then that's probably true; and that's how I feel.

I will say this however, when you finally listen to headphones w/o wires, it is really an amazing experience to move around and be free without being attached to something. I think that alone is reason to consider these headphones.

BLUETOOTH:
The QC35's paired to my iPhone instantly. Much faster actually than my Soundlink Mini or my Solo 5 which take longer for some reason. I also like the voice prompts which are really cool. The voice even says ""Battery at 100%, connected to Dan's iPhone"" which is really cool and really creepy at the same time. I already turned off the voice prompts via the Bose Connect App because I already found them annoying; the process is quick and simple. Some reviewers were complaining of the Bluetooth being out of sync so I decided to test that out. I pulled up a few movie scenes on my iPhone and I personally didn't notice any delay or anything out of sync. Again, watching a movie with wireless headphones is really cool. I mean, now I can connect my iPad to my mini projector and sync these to the iPad and watch a movie in my room in any corner of the room without disturbing anyone!

NOISE CANCELLATION:
Here is another important area and from the few hours I have spent with the QC35's I can say that there really is no difference with the noise cancellation in this model compared to my older QC15's. The only thing that I noticed was that the ear cups are of much higher quality on the QC35 and this leads to better passive cancellation; they seem more ""leathery."" I was honestly expecting the QC35 to muffle out more noise with the noise cancellation activated but that's just not the case. I'm using it in a room with an AC unit blowing at full blast and both headphones sound the same to me. Honestly, I'm a little surprised. I bought the QC15's about five years ago and you would think the technology would improve slightly at least from a company who's motto is ""Better Sound Through Research."" The only thing I did notice and this could be big for some people is that the QC35 has slightly less ""hiss"" than the QC15. By slightly I mean you have to recognize that there is a hiss in the first place and then close your eyes and listen for which is louder. The hiss can only be heard in silence though. It's an issue for me because I use these for studying and the hiss is actually a distraction. I can tell you the QC35 definitely has less hiss than the QC15. This is a big issue for me but it might not matter to you. I always felt that the noise cancellation put a slight pressure on my eardrums but maybe I just got used to it because I don't really feel it anymore on either model.

With regards to noise cancellation, it is very subtle between both models and definitely not night and day.

I want to point out that noise cancellation is a very broad term. When I was looking at the QC15's before I bought them, I thought noise cancellation meant isolation and that couldn't be farther from the truth. With either headphone on, I can tell if there are loud sounds or if someone is calling my name loudly. I can tap on my desk and I will hear the tapping. I mean right now the AC is behind me and I can hear it even though it is muffled. I will say that when you are on an airplane, these really do an amazing job at drowning out the engine roar. I used the QC15 in flight once and they really do what they say with regards to engine noise. I think Bose developed the original QC headphones with the frequent traveler in mind but the technology became so popular that they just said it would be good for the non-traveler as well. Just keep in mind that noise cancellation is not isolation and you can still hear a lot of things granted those ""things"" will be muffled and perhaps muffled to the point that they are not distracting. And I guess that is a good thing.

MY THOUGHTS:
I think the QC35 are excellent headphones but I don't know where Bose is getting $349 from; honestly I don't know where Bose gets a lot of their pricing from but that's for another review. You are not getting that type of value from the sound quality OR the noise cancellation in these headphones. I personally had to debate this purchase for three days and I have the cash to burn for these. I'd be more comfortable paying in the $200-$250 range for what you are getting here. Added to that, Bose cheaped out and offered these with a pathetic micro USB cable and an even more pathetic wired cable. The wired cable looks so embarrassingly out of place attached to these headphones that I am just going to force myself to listen to these wirelessly even though I want to listen to them wired for the added volume that I had mentioned earlier.

The QC15 was from five years ago when Bose was a different company catering to a different audience. I think they were catering to a certain niche of adults and boring adults at that because the QC15 doesn't score any points in the looks department; it looks boring, bland, and cheap. Bose has shifted in a new direction over the last few years and you can clearly see that in the way they are designing their products now. The QC35 looks more hip and modern and will certainly attract a larger group of customers. I still wouldn't be caught walking down the street with these on as they are big and the headband has a larger arc than the QC15 or QC25. I have them on as I am writing this review and they feel very comfortable and they are certainly helping me concentrate without getting distracted by any noise outside. A plane is flying overhead outside my window as I am typing this and I can tell it's a plane but these nicely muffled the sound so that it wouldn't cause any major distraction. Comfort wise, these QC35's are really nice and I liked them more than the QC15 and I think the QC15 is already comfortable to begin with.

CONCLUSION:
If you have the QC15 or even the QC25, these are not a major upgrade. I would consider these worth the upgrade if Bose included better cables, made the Bluetooth sound louder, and somehow improved the noise cancellation so that I could tell that it was better than the QC15. In my honest opinion, these are not worth the upgrade from a sound or noise cancellation point-of-view. Looks-wise they are but you have to decide if that is worth it for you.

If you are new to the ANC scene and you have no problem spending $349, I think you will be very pleased with the QC35's. If it's sound quality you are after, I know you can do better than these even in this price range; I don't know which model, but I can definitely tell you that you can do better. For ANC, my understanding is that these stand alone. I personally bought them for the ANC so as long as the sound quality is good enough, I'm OK with that. I've been typing this for about 40 minutes now and these feel great on my head and I can't see myself taking them off just yet.

Here's my quick summary:
1. Not a significant upgrade; they are nice but you have to decide how nice.
2. If you're after sound quality alone, look elsewhere
3. For ANC, I think these stand alone
4. Not worth $349 + tax for any reason
5. Silver looks so much better than the black when they are side by side.

What I want to see in the next headphone...
Make a slimmer ON-EAR design like the OE Soundlink addressing all the shortcomings I have described above. I think that would be the ultimate ANC headphone.

Try these out before you buy them. Most big stores should have these on display. I was lucky that they had the black, silver, and QC25 side-by-side.

I hope my review has helped you in your decision!

EDIT August 27:

I have had these for almost a week now and I am liking them more and more. That hiss I was talking about really is a big issue because I had these on for several hours and I actually felt more comfortable with these on for that period of time than with the QC15. I think the hiss is distracting and I think it tires you for some reason. For that reason alone, these are a major upgrade.

I made a couple of Skype calls using these and the freedom of no wires is a major upgrade. I was able to sit however I wanted instead of close to the computer; I could move around if I wanted to; and I just felt more relaxed for the calls. I didn't notice any problems with the speaker or mic overall. There were just a few times when I was talking that I felt there was a delay on the other end because we would both interrupt each other. That could be the Skype connection though.

I was on a three-hour flight this past week and this is my experience with the noise cancellation... I was right next to the engine on a packed 737. The noise cancellation does not mute the sounds but it muffles them to the point that you can actually fall asleep! It's weird but you can hear the engine, you can hear the crying baby, you can hear the pilot making their announcements but all those sounds are nicely ""calmed down"". It's sounds funny explaining it like that but I did manage to take a nap on the flight and I felt like I was in my own little world; it was relaxing. I took the headphones off a few times during the flight, and the noise was obnoxious. You can get used to the noise cancellation to the point that you won't want to fly without them.

Regarding sound quality, I read a few reviews that said these headphones lack deep bass. I was listening to these wirelessly and I did notice that the bass is not as punchy as I would like. I don't know if this is because of the Bluetooth compression or the headphones themselves. I haven't listened to other headphones so I'm not in a position to offer comparisons but I do feel you could find a better high-end headphone that sounds much better than the QC35. I am keeping these because of the noise cancellation and the good looks but I do wish they had better bass response over all volume levels. As I stated previously however, these do have some type of internal EQ setting that enhances bass response at lower volume levels. I guess this is good for those who listen at moderate volumes but to ""feel"" the music, you need to crank it up a bit and that's where I feel these could do better...considering the price.

As an addendum to my earlier review, I am leaning more towards the idea that these are a major upgrade because I don't want to use my QC15's anymore. These are built much better; they look better; the hiss is a big issue for me; and they are wireless which really does make a world of difference.

My experience with the headphones over the last week has been all positive and I highly recommend them.

I recommend you also buy some type of headphone stand to put these on. I personally bought one that clamps to my desk and has an arc-shaped cradle. It cleans up your desk and it makes them easily accessible.

And I still say Bose should issue an upgraded micro USB and wired cable as the ones supplied with the product are not up to par with the quality of the product.

EDIT September 17:

I've been studying with these headphones and they are very comfortable and I can say they are very useful for what I am mostly using them for. From a sound quality point-of-view, I want to say that these definitely don't play as loud as I think they should when they are wireless. Like I said earlier, I need about a few more clicks on the volume to get these to where I would be happy. The sound quality is good but more volume will give more impact. Also I did notice that a good amount of sound ""leaks out"". So if you are in the library and you are blasting something, the person next to you will certainly hear something. The QC15's wired, definitely played more louder. I refused to use these wired because of that cheap cord Bose provided.

If you are buying these strictly for music, I would look elsewhere because it's fairly obvious you can do better. For noise cancelling, which is what I bought them for, I am very happy with them. I also want to point out a few things with the Bluetooth for calls. I was using them last week and the other person said there was an echo on their end. I thought the call itself was fine but I did notice a slight delay when using Skype; I would be talking and there would be that awkward pause and I'd have to say ""go ahead"". Using these wirelessly is real nice though. I made a call and I was walking around the room instead of sitting at my desk staring at the computer.

Also, I am very satisfied with the good looks. The gray, silver contrast is just stunning and the old-school BOSE hologram logo just makes these pop. I wear these for hours at a time and they feel good.

EDIT September 5, 2017: See the edit below, read this for fun only or just skip to below. Wow, it's already been a year since I bought these. Just wanted to update the review again with a turn of events. I like the headphones but I don't love them. For the price paid, I need them to be louder while connected via Bluetooth and I just can't get around that. I don't care what the limitations are to that technology but Bose should figure out how to overcome those limitations when they are asking for $349 for these and they claim to invest so much money in R&D. As I pointed out earlier, you have to use this crap cable they supply you with if you want to use these like normal wired headphones and well, that wire is just too crappy for me. Quality wise, these are built very well and look fairly nice but that's not enough to make them worth keeping. You can buy speakers that look really nice and sound just alright but I'm afraid with headphones, they have to sound exceptional regardless of any other qualities they may have and I'm going to say these are a little lacking in that department for my tastes. For the last year I keep telling myself that the volume should be louder and that's how I feel today. I don't recommend listening to music at loud volumes for an extended period of time but lets face it, a lot of emotion from music comes from that volume and these kill that feeling. Some of my favorite songs just don't have that ""oomph"" that I can get with a wired headphone. I still have my QC15's and honestly I listen to those more. The problem with those is that they only work when I have a battery in and that too the battery needs to be fresh or the sound gets choppy.

I'm looking to unload these real soon. Bose are a bunch of jerks because you can't sell Bose on Amazon anymore. It's like they sell us an inferior product and then control what we do with that product which we purchased with our own money. Bose is lucky that they have a monopoly on the sound industry but if they annoy their smart consumers, those consumers will spread the word about what Bose is really about...and it ain't sound quality.

I'm dropping the review to three stars. Try these before you buy or buy mine!

EDIT September 19, 2017!!! These were about to go on eBay when I decided to go downstairs and plug these into my amp with a plug adapter. Long story short, these are staying yet again. I think I figured out why I was disappointed in these. There is something definitely going on with the Bluetooth compression that really tames these headphones for some reason and I don't like it at all. Use these wired with either a nice sound card or a DAC and these will literally come to life. I think I was using these wirelessly and feeling unhappy for some time that I was just getting frustrated with them. The compression they use removes so much detail from the music and it's actually very obvious if you pay attention to it. I don't know exactly what's involved in the compression algorithm but I'm saying it's clipping all the frequency levels off. When you do that, you take away a lot of the intricacies that make the music sound good. Now, the wireless issue comes back again to the wire/cable itself. It's so damn short and flimsy. It's a proprietary cable too so you can't find a suitable replacement unless you get a cheap Chinese knockoff which I am not about to do. I sent a scathing e-mail to Bose scolding them regarding this issue. Maybe they'll issue something in the future as an upgrade. This headphone needs a 6-foot braided wire and then everything will be just fine. I would be very surprised if someone is writing a review stating that these sound amazing wireless.

So I promise this will be the final edit and I hope this whole review helps you in your consideration of these headphones. These are apparently excellent headphones but NOT WHEN USED WIRELESSLY FOR MUSIC OR MOVIES. Wireless is fine and useful for calls or listening to something like an audiobook because you're not going to be blasting the other persons voice and the other person is not singing to you when they're talking to you. But Bluetooth is not the answer here to great wireless sound. To go wireless, the technology they use to kill the wire is going to cost you sound quality and I'm not paying that price because I'm not stupid and I know the difference between clean and compressed music. I do hope you all know that most of your mp3's will never sound as good as your CD's unless you ripped them at a high bit rate which I find is usually not the case for most people.

I was listening to some of my favorite songs with these connected directly to my home theater amp and I was literally blown away. The detail, the bass, the dynamics, the CLEAN headroom...everything was just amazing and breathed new life into the music. Made me very happy. Now I don't expect anyone just to listen to these connected to a bulky home stereo setup...especially with that cheap cord I've been complaining about so here is a solution that I think it actually better.

Audioquest makes a product called the Dragonfly. It's a portable DAC (digital to analog converter) basically it's an amplifier for your headphone. It'll do the same thing that I'm doing now by plugging them into my home theater amp but it will do it better and it is portable. Get that and the lightning to USB cable if you have an Apple product and then you'll be in business as the dragonfly connects via USB and is the size of a USB drive. I will be getting that setup next. It's not cheap but you won't regret it. I was looking at some other headphones on the market and I found a Sony model with a built in DAC which is really cool. Price wise, it was still expensive and I'm sure the QC35 + an external DAC should sound better. If you want to just listen to music, get some earbuds. If you want to listen to good music, you're going to need good equipment. Maybe in the future Bose will eventually make a headphone product with it's own built in amplifier. But knowing Bose, they will make the customer foot the bill for all that ""research"" and a product like that would probably be very expensive.

In conclusion...use the wire if you are able to, these are beasts when you power them up properly. They're convenient as a wireless headphone but the wire is what makes them shine. Back to five stars. I approve them.

To Bose...For god's sake man stop being so cheap and get us a real cable!

ONE MORE UPDATE...I bought the Audioquest DragonFly Black DAC and it is the real deal. Plug these headphones into that and your sound will literally open up. Read my review if you are unfamiliar with DAC's and what they do for your sound. Once you use the DragonFly, you will not listen to your headphones without a DAC ever again; it's that good."
287,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Such a painful price ticket, worth every single penny. I fly constantly. With or without music or movies, they are awesome. Plus, it drowns out the guy next to you who won't stop hitting on you, and the babies behind you whose parents should be buying everyone vodka for listening to their child, who should sit in the back, babies like it better back there. Don't get me wrong, babies need to fly too, but if you owned these, you wouldn't have to listen to it. You don't realize how loud a plane is until you have these bad boys on!! Get the silver, it ages better. They travel easy, and they are super comfy."
288,5.0 out of 5 stars,"EDIT 8/26/2016:

Double ugh.

I exchanged my first set with Amazon since it was in the 30-day window. This morning, my second set failed. This time, the power switch broke in the on position. So, two product failures in the first 60 days.
****************************************************************************************
Ugh.

Got these for Father's Day and was absolutely loving them. Put them in the case and packed for our family vacation. I pulled them out after arriving and they are no longer functioning. Somehow, the on / off switch on the side of the headphone has broken. It will not ""catch"" as you slide it, and therefore the Bluetooth / noise cancelling will not turn on.

For a pair of headphones that are targeted to a travel-oriented demographic, I can't believe that they had < 2 weeks of durability. I am not looking forward to the warranty process I'm about to encounter."
289,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Glad that the Bose QC35 arrived just in time when I was looking for some nice headphones.

Pro:
- Perfect for me ... mainly using them for watching movies and listening to music
- Sound is great for me
- I am using them every day due to baby on board and due to the great sound and getting all the details of a movie
- Battery life so far (after 10 months) is still pretty good (never run out of juice even after binge watching a few episodes of something).
- Great during flights ... it lowers the noise dramatically but does not cancel it completely
- Firmware updateable online (now on 1.2.10)
- Carry case works well

Con:
Bluetooth Multi-point technology:
- Quite annoying when in the middle of a movie the headphone has to announce that it lost the signal to the second bluetooth transmitter and then again picks up the signal again (e.g. xyz device lost .... connecting to xyz and abc ...). I always have to rewind the movie to actually hear what I lost from the movie.
- Would be great to disable this feature and just use single-point e.g. via the App
- The fake leather ear pads started dissolving/disintegrating after about 8 months and now I have always black flakes around my ears after using the headphones (requires Bose Shampoo?)
- Having almost always a hell of a time connecting iPhone App to headphones. I have to follow a particular sequence in order to get the headphones connected to the App.
- Most of the time missing release notes for firmware updates

Other notes:
- Noise cancellation side effect ... my wife hates the headphones since I never hear her when she is trying to tell me something ;-)
- Would be great to disable noise cancellation when I also have to listen to other noises like the door bell, the baby monitor etc. (by e.g. pushing a button a little longer to disable noise cancellation)
- Had to get used to occasional flying objects to grab my attention while wearing the headphones
- I would even trying to sleep wearing the headphones but that is quite difficult due to the bulkiness
- Looking for breathable mesh fabric ear pads now or something which is as good as the original pads but lasts longer than 8 months.
- Works great with the MEE audio Connect (connected to my TV via optical connection)"
290,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not buy these headphone unless you want to throw money away! I ignored the MANY complaints surround the power switch and went ahead and bought the haedphones because I love Bose. It has been roughly 15 months ago and now they turn themselves on non-stop without any interaction from me and they cannot hold a charge. I’ve had to unpair the headphones from all my Bluetooth devices because they keep turning themselves on and connecting without me knowing (see photo). Nothing like getting a phone call and can’t hear the person on the other line because the heaphones magically turned on by themselves and connected to your phone. Sorry, but for what I paid, I expect more and this! Pretty sure this is the last pair of Bose I’ll own, too many competitors.

YES! I’ve updated the firmware to the lastest version.
YES! I’ve attempted the reset instructions that Bose has suggesteds"
291,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Dear Bose,

These are wonderful headphones except for the bluetooth and Noise cancellation being connected and required to be operated together. the Noise cancellation is great when out in a load public area with lots of changing noise, but in quieter, and even louder but more constant noise levels I can hear the noise cancellation waves almost like a ringing in my ears. I get a headache if I use your headphones for too long. Right now I recommend your quiet comfort 25 instead to family and friends because of this problem. I feel this could be corrected easily by adding and a slider adjustment in the app to adjust the cancellation between 0 to 100% active. Adjustment for manual EQ would be nice also as opposed to the required auto
EQ feature. Auto EQ is fine for most things but it would be nice to have control when I want it. With these changes to the app you would have a near perfect product in my opinion, but for now"
292,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought Sennheiser PXC 550s, Bose QC35s, and B&O Beoplay H9s.

*Sound
1. B&O — hands down, esp. mid-range and base (think pipe organ or cello); great with high's, too.
2. Sennheiser
3. Bose — it's a joke compared next to B&Os, really. I was surprised.

*Noise Cancellation
1. Bose — hands down, though can be a pressured experience
2. B&O — good but you're not deaf to sound around you, and it might come in at when you're wanting that midrange!
2. Sennheiser

* Materials
1. B&O — the best hands down, not just in looks but feel: matte aluminum, lambskin leather
2. Sennheiser — smooth and clean and handsome (p)leather, though cans are mostly plastic
3. Bose — plastic and pleather

*Warranty! (No one ever mentions the warranty in reviews)
1. B&O: 2 years
1. Sennheiser: 2 years
3. Bose: 1 year (read reviews @ bose site --- lots seems to happen around then)

Battery life
1. Sennheiser: 30ish
2. Bose: 20ish
3. B&O: 12ish

Charging versatility
1. B&O: can replace batteries forever; can listen while charging
2. Sennheiser: no replacement, can listen while charging
3. Bose: no replacement, no listening while charging

Wearability
1. Bose: barely notice them, super light, no extra space around head or above cans
2. B&O: a bit heavier than Bose, lots of space between headset and head, which == more bulky looking
3. Sennheiser: huge though not heavy; like a biker helmet

App & Connectivity
1. Bose: Pairs multiple devices, app is very nice
2. B&O: Nice app, 1 device
3. Sennhesier: Clunky app, 1 device

Case
1. Bose: most compact
2. Sennheiser: like Bose, but not as compact
3. B&O: a sad polyester sack

Touch controls
1. B&O: you have to fine-tune your finger motor control but afterward, you tap + slide on chic aluminum
2. Sennheiser: also have to adjust; but afterward, you tap + slide on some weird matte plastic
3. Bose: fat plastic/rubber press-buttons with caterpillar tractor treds.

Feedback
1. Sennheiser: a natural human Australian femme voice keeps you in the know (also tried it for German: natural and femme too)
2. Bose: robotic femme
3. B&O: no feedback, and annoying beeping when battery is low (HELLO! i know that, let me enjoy the last 3 mins, please)

Price
1. Bose: 330
2. Sennheiser: 390
3. B&O: 500

Unweighted averages from above (lower = more often top ranked)
Bose: 1's: 5, 2's: 2, 3's: 5 = 2
B&O: 1's: 5, 2's: 3, 3's: 4 = 1.9
Sennheiser: 1's: 3, 2's: 6, 3's: 3 = 2

So, which ones? The average cost of the three = 403. So, B&O looks like a lot at first, but it's about 100 more than the average high-end. Bose, widely thought of as the best, is 70 less than the average high-end. What do you lose by paying 70 bucks less? What do you get by paying 100 bucks more?

Obviously sound quality > the femme voice who tells you the device is paired. For me, it comes down to the warranty (consumer electronics always fail), sound quality, noise cancellation, and materials (related to warranty). So, the rank on those four criterion would be BO (1), Sennheiser (2.25), and Bose (2.5).

Is 100 more-than-average worth it, though? Or: are the B&Os really like having a pair and a half of Bose (170, the diff between the two, is also half the price of Bose)? When I listen to Beach Spring for pipe organ on the B&Os, I know the answer is: yes. It's a spiritual experience! I will keep the B&Os, mostly because I care about this experience, am guaranteed to enjoy it for at least two years, more considering their overall superior manufacturing, and won't be trying to have such an experience, say, while commuting."
293,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Bose QC 35 headphones are a tour de force in headphone technology. They incorporate Bluetooth wireless, microphones, noise cancellation, comfortable cushioning and over-the-ear isolation, and on top of all that, they talk to you!

When you turn the device on, it reports its battery state and what devices are currently active. You can pair it with numerous devices but it will only play audio from one device at a time. It has some kind of built-in logic to allow your phone to interrupt another device. For example, if you are listening to music on your laptop which is paired to the phones, they will switch to your phone if a call is coming in. (You can ignore a call by pressing and holding the ""Multi-function"" button on the headset, situated between the up- and down-volume buttons.

To turn on the headset, slide the power button to the central position. To put the headset into Bluetooth pairing mode, push the power button all the way to the right (it will spring back). The headset will then report to which devices it is currently connected.

I've already brought the QC35 on a couple of plane trips, and it has performed quite well, muting the dull roar of the engines down to almost complete silence. It's the only way to really enjoy a video or music on a flight without jacking up the volume to harmful levels in your ears. Now that the FAA has relaxed the electronics-off rules, you can leave this device turned on the entire flight, from take-off to landing.

Phone calls work well with the QC35; just put them on and pair once with your phone, and you are good to go. Once your call is under way, you can put your phone back in your pocket where it belongs, and talk wirelessly. It's also handy for playing games quietly on your phone or tablet. I enjoy watching Youtube or streaming movies in bed at night and this headset is comfortable for lying on a pillow, not true of all headphones.

Bose provides a free mobile app for both Android and Apple devices that lets you set some preferences on the headset, such as turning off the talking feature and enabling/disabling some paired devices. It's handy if you wish for example to force the headset to ignore a device such as a laptop that's emitting audio and make it instead work only with your phone. When a paired device emits audio, the Bose QC35 automatically makes it the active device on the list, which you usually want, but not always.

Back when I was working in a noisy office, I found noise canceling headphones very helpful for blocking out the world so I could concentrate. Working from home, with a noisy family in the background, I find them equally useful. They are so good that you literally might not hear someone addressing you until they tap you on the shoulder. You might not hear the microwave beeping that it's done. A phone call might be missed, unless your headset is connected to the phone. You might not hear the doorbell.

The battery seems to last a very long time; I haven't done a drainage test but they are rated 20 hours and I have yet to get them down below 60%. They charge up quickly on a typical micro-USB charger and you can take them on a pretty long plane ride and not worry about needing to recharge. Your phone will die a lot sooner than these headphones. They will work without battery charge, by the way, if you use the included cable, though of course you don't get the noise cancellation.

Note by the way that the battery is not user-serviceable. In other words, you can't change the battery, which distinguishes this model from the previous Bose QC 25 headset; that model runs on one AAA alkaline battery that lasts 35 hours, then requires replacement. It's a tradeoff that some may find unacceptable if they need the noise cancellation for long hours out in the field. If you routinely fly New York to Australia, for example, you're possibly going to prefer the QC25 to the QC35 because you can easily carry a few spare AAA's. On the other hand, you can also get an external phone charger battery that will top off your QC35 and still have enough juice to recharge your phone and other peripherals on a long flight.

The kit comes with a stereo cable to connect directly to a phone or other audio source. I have yet to use it. Bluetooth is ubiquitous today and if you have an audio device that lacks Bluetooth capability, you can add it by purchasing an inexpensive Bluetooth transmitter for around $20 and plugging it into the audio device's stereo headphone jack. I'm planning to get one for the digital piano in the living room, to get away from having a wire dragging off my head while practicing late at night.

Bose doesn't really have a monopoly anymore on sound cancellation; good noice cancelling headsets are made by many other top manufacturers such as Sony, Sennheiser, Bohm, AKG, and a host of Chinese knockoffs that range from OK-ish to very good, often for a fraction of the price. But Bose is still the state of the art in high end noise cancellation."
294,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone who has an incredibly hard time focusing on anything and who is easily frustrated by people who talk in the library, squeaky chairs, and people conversing loudly during lab when we're supposed to be working, these are a DREAM. For the first couple days, the noise reduction feels a bit like ""pressure"" but you quickly get used to it and I don't know how I've gotten this far in my collegiate career without owning a pair of these headphones.

The sound quality is great, the battery is plenty long enough for a couple 8 hour days without charging and they charge extremely fast. These are worth every single penny I spent on them. The noise reduction is at its best when music is also playing, but even without, things like the hum of the a/c, a fan clicking noise or your neighbor's music are completely canceled, while voices and the tv are taken down to a more manageable and MUCH less distracting level. For anyone who has trouble with sensory overload, or who has ADHD, these are AMAZING.

Another thing these are great for is just replacing corded headphones. While I didn't buy these with that in mind, I can't tell you how handy it is to have a pair of cordless quality headphones. I use them to listen to podcasts while baking so I can actually hear the show and keep my phone out of the kitchen somewhere. Also, great for watching TV without waking someone up or distracting somebody else in the room. They come with an AUX cord so you can plug them in if you run out of battery, though the sound reduction won't be available nor will the sound quality be as good; they also come with an airplane audio jack adaptor that can be single or double pronged.

Lastly, if you're concerned with whether they'll fit over any ear piercings, I haven't run into any problems yet, and I have two cartilage piercings as well as the standard single lobe piercings, though I do take off any dangling earrings (and store them in the case) while wearing them."
295,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Replacement for stolen QC25. The sound is still wonderful, but now my arms are free and I don't have to worry about knocking things over or getting snagged. Battery life is fantastic, and I don't have to keep buying these damn lithium AAA batteries just to slow down the wear and tear on the battery door. Only problem is the microphone. It's horrible. You have to be in a sound proof room at a recording studio for anyone to hear you. So yeah, for a $350 pair of headphones, you'd think you wouldn't have to turn them off just to make a phone call, but I do. What would have been nice is if the included headphone cable had a mic in it that cancelled out the one when plugged in. or if they just didn't put a mic in the headphones at all. Honestly, trade off (cordless vs good mic) for me is fine, I'm happy with it. However if you need to make lots of calls with these on, stick with the Quiet Comfort 25 (and try to me mindful of doorknobs when you go thru doorways)."
296,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible!

Put these on, the world goes away. If you're in a lousy apt, these things shut out the idiots.And when you do household chores such as running the dishwasher, it shuts that out too. You will listen to music at lower volume since your music no longer competes with other noise for your ear's attention.

Having all the extra noise gone from your environment, you will hear new things from songs you've listened to many times before.

The noise cancelling works without playing music. If you need peace and quiet to think, throw these on and enjoy.

These headphones sound good. They are not flat, like a pair of Beyerdynamic DT-880's. They do color the sound. But it's a wonderful coloration. I've tried these albums with them so far:
- Buddy Rich's Mercy, Mercy
- George Thorogood & the Destroyers' Bad to the Bone
- Rush's Moving Pictures

I've only tried them over bluetooth on my iPhone and my 2010 MacBook Pro.

If my opinion changes over time, I will update this review.

< Update 08.05.17 >
I'm impressed by the sensitivity of these things. Meaning: the quiet parts of the songs are quieter, the loud parts are louder. I didn't realize a lot of the music I listen to had such dynamic range. It opens up the expressiveness of the music.

Using these with my Nintendo Switch playing The Legend of Zelda is awesome! The game has great, nuanced sound. These headphones make it come alive.

< Update 08.17.17>
Geesh, these are comfortable! I spend several hours an evening, and most of the weekend with them on.
They never hurt my head.
Also, I appreciate the controls on them. They have a volume up button, a volume down button, and a button that pauses iTunes.
And wiring them directly into my Nintendo Switch for Zelda...wow!"
297,1.0 out of 5 stars,"... a bit over-priced. I base this on a comparison with these iDea headphones:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0761QYMWT/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s06?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Both sets are Bluetooth phones with ambient noise-cancelling features.
The Bose phones cost $350; the iDea cost $100.
The Bose are about 30% lighter, making them a little more comfortable for long-term wear.

The iDea seem more solidly constructed, using metal where Bose uses plastic; they seem like they will wear better in the long run, and I have, in fact been using the iDea set for more than a year, whereas I've only had the Bose for a month.

The noise cancelling feature works well in both brands. Bose damps a tiny bit better in some situations (like sitting on an airplane), but you really have to be paying close attention to notice the difference.
The iDea phones have a separate switch for the noise-cancelling function, allowing you to use it independently of the Bluetooth function.
On the Bose, one switch turns on both the noise cancelling and the Bluetooth. This is unfortunate, because if you \just\ want to use noise-cancelling, the Bose phones are still eating up extra power searching for Bluetooth devices.

The sound... well, much to my surprise, and counter to my expectations, there really wasn't much difference in sound quality between the two sets of phones. The Bose may offer a \tiny\ bit more bass with certain kinds of program material (heavy metal rock, for example), but really, its only a trifle different from the iDea phones. Both sets had clear highs, crisp midranges, and solid bass.

Don't get me wrong, these are good-sounding, comfortable, quality headphones.
They just didn't sound * $250 * better than the $100 headphones. If Bose had priced these at $200, or even $250, I would probably rated them five stars. But at $350 there needs to be a more obvious difference between them and the cheaper competitors."
298,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the headphones. I even discovered that they are actually comfortable for me to sleep in even with me sleeping on my side. For an entire night, I only use 10% of the battery power (using with Power On and No Music - just for sound dampening). My ears were getting sore from the ear plugs. Another use for me is when I am in our power boat sitting in the back of the cockpit where the engine noise is loud. Now with my headphones, I enjoy watching the scenery in more quiet or even listening to music. I gave only four stars because some people have mentioned that my voice is suboptimal when I use them to make/receive a telephone call. Another downside is that if you want to use them to listen to music while biking, you cannot turn off the ""noise dampening"" independent of the music as a Bluetooth device. The only way to do this is to power them off and use the included cord. This is doable, but not as convenient as I had hoped. My little included charger separated at the place where you plug it in, so I had to use packing tape to make it stay. I have contacted Bose and asked them to send me a new one. That is pending. I had bought a Sony set at Costco for $100 and there is no comparison: the Sony was returned immediately................I have owned these for over a year now and even sleep with them on most nights (ear plugs can be a challenge). The cushion on the right ear cup started to come loose (I do sleep on my right side). Bose customer service is sending me a new set FREE OF CHARGE!! They have always responded very quickly to my email communications. This is the greatest customer service of any company I have ever dealt with."
299,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used noise-canceling headphones before... but none of them prepared me for the Quiet Comfort 35s. The noise cancelation is downright eerie: I can't even hear myself walking with these things on! Think about the booth you're in for a hearing test. Yeah, that. The Bose Connect app was recently updated to include an option to reduce the noise cancelation or turn it off altogether. It works better for constant, droning noise like a fan or engine... quick, sudden sounds like a handclap would not allow the circuit enough time to cancel it.

The soundstage is fantastic, with rich acoustics and great dynamic range. I love that it can connect to two sources at the same time - I use it with my smartphone and my Envy laptop. Great headset, were it not for the problems, and I have two real problems with this headset. Well, one problem and one annoyance.

The annoyance is the female voice in the headset. Great gal in there... but if something goes wrong, she's a total drama queen. If I'm connected to my laptop and put it in standby (or walk away), I get a voice of desperation gasping, ""Envy, lost! Envy, lost!"" When she says that, I picture Scarlett O'Hara, her hand to her forehead, ready to collapse onto a fainting sofa. Please, sweetheart, it's not lost! It's just in standby, really!

The problem, though, is the RANGE of the Bluetooth radio. I can't walk more than five feet away from my phone without the sound breaking up! In fact, the radio is in the right headphone cup and if my phone is in my left front pocket, it breaks up. That is BAD for a Bluetooth 4.x radio, Bose. Really bad. I should be able to walk 10-15 feet away without dropping connection.

If you want state of the art noise cancelation with great acoustics, and don't mind the voice that becomes an emotional wreck if a source disappears, then this is a great headset.

However, I would expect a FAR better Bluetooth range for a headset this expensive. I recommend it, but with reservations. Bose really needs to fix that."
300,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sure took me awhile to figure out exactly how these work (please see photo) but once I did it was smooth sailing and no complaints whatsoever!
301,4.0 out of 5 stars,"All I can say is Wow! Bought 1 week ago. Business trip meant flying for 2.5 hours that turned to 6. I have given up on all the sub $250 noise cancelling headphones, they don't cancel or lightly cancel, they always allow the low noise of the airplane through.

My flight was a small jet, 50 seater, which means that the engine noise was going to be ever present and loud. I put these on before the delayed flight, the Bose QC35 took away the airport noise but allowed enough of an announcement through that I would lift an ear to hear the gate agent.
During the flight, no engine noise, but was slightly aware of the overhead announcement, again, lifted the earpiece to hear. I took them off during the flight to answer the flight attendant's question. OMG, I couldn't believe how loud the noise was! Quickly put them back on.

The ear cushions fit perfectly over my entire ear, the headband is comfortable so much so that I forget I'm wearing headphones.

I decided to test them out cutting the grass with my tractor, normally were ear protectors. These Bose were so good I didn't hear my deck blade having trouble with a rock!
You are not wasting your money if you respect quality, COMFORT, and noise cancellation. Have already recommended, and would buy again."
302,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Being an owner of the Bose SoundLink 2 wireless headphones for close to a year now, I really wanted to give my 1st impressions after picking this up from Best Buy a day ago. I've ALWAYS wanted Bose's active noise-cancelling (ANC) headphones, but they only had the QC25 wired at the time and I had to have a wireless headphone so I picked up the SoundLink 2 (as I use my headphone to drown out the traffic-noise and noisy neighbors all around my apartment). I already have a Sony MDR-10RNC ANC headphone, but I'm tethered to wires and their ANC isn't that great (I can still hear a majority of the traffic outside and there's definitely that signature noticeable hissing sound found in almost all ANC headphones I've tried). When I heard news of the QC35, I was super excited.

After using it to watch 2 horror movies with tons of bass, YouTube videos, and music; I'm confident to say I really like this better than my SoundLink 2. I expected the sound to be the same, but the bass on the QC35 is ""tighter"" - as if I had my 300W Boston Acoustic subwoofer running on low-volume. The SoundLink's bass is pretty weak and flat. The high's and mid's are just as crisp; and I have absolutely no pairing issues like my SoundLink 2 (I actually gave the SoundLink 2 a not-so-favorable review because of the pairing issues). I was also surprised by the construction because it's not all plastic like the SoundLink 2 - surprised because I was expecting the $70 premium over the SoundLink 2 only adds ANC inside. The QC35 has metal (such as the ear-cup plate where the ""Bose"" logo sits on). The QC35 is only $70 more than the SoundLink 2, but you get much more than ANC - better materials, almost 2x battery life over SoundLink2, wider head band, better case, and ANC.

The ANC is really NICE because as I'm writing this at 3PM Sunday sitting next to my windows (tons of traffic outside my apartment since I live next to a large mall) with the QC35 on my head without any sound playing through it, the traffic noise is almost non-existent - can only hear the occasional Harley Davidson that whizzes by. Is the $350 price-tag worth it? It depends. In my situation, a definite YES because it feels amazing to be able to relax in my apartment on a lazy Sunday without my eardrums being bombarded by traffic noise and the noisy neighbors. I'm also not destroying my eardrums or getting music-fatigue by playing my music loud or watching Youtube for hours on end in order to drown out the outside noise - so the long-term health benefits of my hearing is priceless.

Lastly, a reviewer mentioned that the QC35 weighs ~60% more than the SoundLink2 wireless - which may make some people hesitate on the purchase if they're keen on comfort. Either he doesn't know basic math, his scale is messed up, or he is just purely throwing out random numbers. My digital scale shows the SoundLink2 wireless as being 200 grams, and the QC35 at 235 grams. The QC35 weighs 18% more, but if I didn't have a digital scale to measure the weight, I could've sworn they weighed the same. Other physical differences - on the SoundLink 2,the battery and Bluetooth icon actually lights up - something I found cool (SoundLink 2 is on the left). On the QC35, there is simply an LED light shining next to the battery and Bluetooth indicator - just something I wanted to point out."
303,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As many reviews have mentioned, Bose could not have inserted the cheapest power/Bluetooth switch they could find. I am now on my 3rd unit in the 1,5 months I have owned them. Not acceptable for a product costing this amount of money. If you are a heavy user like I do due to the amount of traveling I do, I guarantee they will break at some stage. I just hope they don't break during a flight. If you buy them from a Bose store, Bose will allow you to replace them in store on one occasion. My advice to Amazon users is that you contact Bose and make sure they allow you to replace any time the switch does break.
On the positive side, it has the best noise canceling out there. Let's hope Bose resolve the switch issue.

Come on Bose, fix this and let us all give them 5 stars."
304,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to have cable-free noise-cancelling headphones. What I was using before buying Bose QC35 for this purpose was a small bluetooth receiver (Sony SBH50) connected to one of my Audiotechnica ANC headsets with a small male-to-male adapter. Sony SBH50 was working without any stutter with all of my devices (laptops, phones, tablets etc) and the sound quality was very good. The only issue was having an extra device dangling on one side of the headphone.

I was expecting Bose to create a bluetooth version of their succesfull QC line and eventually QC35 is shipped. I was happy to have these even though they were expensive. My wife has been using the non-noise-cancelling Bose headphones and was very happy with those. So I assumed I'd have the same bluetooth experience. Unfortunately this wasn't the case: There are random stutters (especially with Galaxy S7) and even worse sometimes my Galaxy S7 becomes very unresponsive when connected to QC35: this never happened with any other BT receivers. As soon as I turn the QC35 off, my Galaxy S7 becomes responsive again.

I'd also prefer to have separate controls for bluetooth and active-noise cancelling. Under windy environments having the the noise cancelling on makes the wind noise even worse (mics pick up the wind and headset try to undo it, causing lots of noise). Unfortunately this means that if you want to stay untethered, you have to live with the extra noise in the wind.

I was hoping that the latest firmware (v1.0.6) would fix some of the bluetooth issues but just the opposite happened and now it stutters even more. It's not very acceptable for the highest-tier NC headphone on the market."
305,5.0 out of 5 stars,After less than 2 weeks of use the headphones got into a state where it will not turn off even when the switch is in the off position. I simply cannot recommend this.
306,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Bose QC35s I received from seller AIR Shop are counterfeit. I was not able to register the product on the Bose website with the serial number on the package. The headphones connect to my phone, however, the Bose Connect app does not recognize the headphones and connect to it. Per Bose Customer support, the product is counterfeit."
307,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphone is just amazing. I have several headphones in the past but nothing compare to this. Bose is known for their sound quality and this is no exception. You can clearly hear the different in term of quality when you wear this headphone and any other ones that you have lying around right now. Not only that, the noise cancellation technology is top notch. You will have a very difficult time hearing anything beside your music when wearing this headphone.

In term of built quality, it is very light and soft. You can use this for quite some time without feeling uncomfortable. There is a bluetooth button on the right side of the headphone where you quickly turn on and off, Also on the right side is the volume control and multi function key. The paring is simple and you can pair up to 2 bluetooth devices at the same time. Another good thing is that you can switch between the devices easily just by toggle it.

One thing that I noticed when using this headphone is not only it provides great sound quality, it helps you block out all the constant noise that you fell to notice normally. You are used to hear it constantly and tune it out. The headphone is great with cancelling out those kind of noises and leave you with a silence environment. Even if you don't listen to music, put this on and read a book. You will appreciate the quietness that it is able to provide. When you finished using the headphone and take it out, you will be more sensitive with the noise that you have fail to notice. It is a amazing and exciting moment and it makes you appreciate this headphone more.

Now, let's talk about the bad thing and why it is only deserve 4 stars.
First, the price of the headphone is very expensive. It's $350 headphone and of course I will have high expectation of it. So simple nuisances or mishap would greatly affect my rating of it. So let's get it on it.

1) You cannot turn off noise cancelling when connect using bluetooth. So people that like to use their headphone without noise canceling is out of luck and have to connect your headphone with the provided wire.
2) The rotating part of the headphone seems very flimsy and may break off if you are too hasty and apply too much force on it. For such an expensive headphone, I expect that the engineer should design to prevent such common situation.

Overall, I am happy with the purchase and my wallet is hurting right now. If you traveling a lot, this is a great headphone to keep you company during long fight and you can happily sleep quietly."
308,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing! They are a little pricey (hence the 4 stars) but the noise cancellation is phenomenal. It cancels out fan/furnace noise, machine humming, etc really well, but peoples voices still cut through. The sound is excellent as well, very clear and sharp, but the bass isnt very intense. My phone has a bass boost built into the music app and that helped a lot.

I highly recommend these to students!

Update 10/23/17: I have since used these on a plane, and while listening to pop/rock I couldn't hear the engine drone at all!"
309,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was initially hesitant to purchase such an expensive pair of headphones (especially Bluetooth headphones with a battery that's not replaceable). But after having them for about a month I am in love. I rent a room in a house with a roommate who has a son who has severe autism. While I like his son he sometimes gets pretty loud. When I put these headphones on my head and get on my computer it's like I live alone. The noise cancellation is exceptional. If I have the headphones on without audio playing I can faintly hear him but if audio is going I can't hear anything. Even if these headphones cant hold a charge after a few years I feel that it's money well spend. No ragrets.

Pros:

Exceptional Noise Cancellation
Solid Build Quality
Comfortable (even after hours of use the only discomfort is sweaty ears which is inevitable with over ear cans)
Great Sound Quality (no highs no lows yadda yadda, they have enough base and their very clean)
Long Battery Life (I use them for 4-5 hours a night and charge them every 4-5 days)

Cons:

Battery Not Replaceable (unless they are serviced by Bose I assume, I can't score 5 stars because of this flaw)

UPDATE:

I have now had these headphones for roughly a year and a half. About two weeks ago I noticed that my ear pads were beginning to deteriorate, today both sides have stuffing coming out. Replacement ear pads are $40 from Bose. Last week my original fears were confirmed, the battery light started to turn on. I did some research and Bose DOES NOT OFFER BATTERY REPLACEMENT. From what I have read there is a third party company that will replace the Battery for $99 but these should have been designed so that the user could easily opened them and replaced the battery. I have used these headphones several hours a day since I bought them but they have always been well taken care of. While I love these headphones I am bringing my rating down to 2 stars because they are essentially a $350 purchase that has no solution for when their battery dies. I will contact Bose and update this review accordingly."
310,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had these headphones about 1.5 months and really enjoy them! I would recommend these as an investment to anyone looking for solid Active Noise Cancelling headphones. When I first received these headphones, my husband and myself yelled at each other just for the fun of it and we could barely hear each other. It does take a little time to get use to the power button being able to switch between multiple devices and selecting the one you want. The headphones do give immediate feedback, such as ""Connected to X device"" or ""Battery at 80%"", which does make it easier; but still wasn't initially intuitive. Additionally, the headset is super comfortable for long hours of wear with glasses (4+ hours). The balanced weight of the headset is perfect and when I take it off after listening to a long session, my neck and head feel as if I never had them on in the first place.

The only hiccup we had was when we updated the headset through the app, it felt like the noise cancelling was diminished. We immediately contacted Bose Customer Support and they quickly resolved the issue. We realized were ""behind"" 2 firmware updates (probably since the headphones were released). Once the firmware was updated, the headset felt great again and the active noise cancelling was just like new. So, moral of the story, if you find your headset diminished or the noise cancelling not as effective, check the firmware.

The single downside (probably the only downside) I have with the headset is if you enjoy listening to softer, instrumental music (ie: classical) at lower volume levels, the Active Noise Cancelling doesn't feel as effective and you can hear sounds around you, even though they are muffled. Even with this small issue, I wouldn't hesitate to repurchase this headset again if anything happened to it. The quality of construction, enjoyment of active noise-cancelling, quality of overall sound, and solid Customer Support will have me coming back.

(P.S: For you who want to physically ""feel"" your bass vibrate on your head, I wouldn't recommend this headset. My husband wanted to feel the bass and he instead opted for Skullcandy Crusher Bluetooth Wireless Over-Ear Headphone with Mic and LOVES those.)"
311,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These appear to be spectacular ear phones, much quieter than the previous models. The ability to use blue tooth to connect to iPads and iPhones is just fantastic if you want watch TV or proves while you are working out a an example. However there are two fatal flaws.
First, you cannot really use the bluetooth for a phone conversation. They work for about an hour. Then the other party will think you are muffled then you won't hear them at all nor will they hear you. The other is that the connection between the earphones and the headband is incredibly and inexcusably weak and prone to breakage. I have three of the $1000 pilot Bose and two Comfort 35s. On four of then, tthey broke easily without any major force and with no possible easy way to get them fixed. I've just had to throw mine in a pile of junk. Consumer service? Don't count on any at all. They respond sporadically but will never actually help you. Appalling for such an expensive product.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: So this is the worst customer service on the planet. My first pair broke months ago. They made me rip apart the headphones to get a serial number...then did nothing. The headphones are amazingly fragile for the price. Angelo from customer support wrote me a note about ""support options"" about three weeks ago. Then never followed up. They just don't care and they will leave you with a $350 piece of pure junk. Just appalling that they even have jobs since their main purpose seems to make customers go away!!!"
312,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely LOOOVE this headphone! It is definitely worth the money. I've always wanted to buy one for so long, but the ridiculous price prevented me from doing so. Until one day when I went to the mall with a friend, I saw a Bose store and tried out their headphones. I was amazed at how beautiful it sounded.
Although I did put 5 stars as my rating, there were some ""downsides"" to this headphones, but not enough to lower my rating.
The main ""downside"" in my opinion is that I CAN'T USE IT WHILE CHARGING! I had a $20 Bluetooth headphones, and I was able to use it while it was charging. Also, it WON'T CONNECT TO MY ANDROID SMARTPHONE (BLU VIVO 5) which was disappointing, and I still don't understand why it won't connect. It connected very easily to my Macbook Air, iPad Air, and Apple TV 2. I'm hoping I can figure it out later. Lastly, it's not so much a bad thing, but the Noise-Cancelling is so awesome that I don't notice people around me who might be talking to me. I also found myself wondering if I was THINKING OUT LOUD OR THINKING TO MYSELF because I can't even hear myself talk quietly to myself. I worry someone might hear me say some CRAZY shit I would normally not say OUT LOUD. Lol. It's a dilemma I'm still working on.

A COOL FEATURE I really liked was the TALKING LADY in the headphones when it connects or disconnects from devices, charge percentage, and ready to pair."
313,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely shocked at how many problems I have with these. When you have two devices connected, you NEED to disconnect the headphones from one source in order to play audio from the other. I have my iPhone and my Macbook connected, for example. I cannot switch back and forth from audio sources while they are both connected. I don't expect to be able to play two devices at the same time, but even being connected to two devices at the same time eliminates the ability to switch between them. Which...well if that's the case, why even allow two connections? It's asinine. You have to disconnect from your current audio source, then reconnect to the new audio source in order to listen to the new audio source. Having two connected devices is useless, because you'll need to disconnect and reconnect to whatever device you want to use anyway.

In addition, there are near-constant and continual pauses/interruptions/dead spots while listening to audio. It doesn't matter what device from which the audio is streaming - it just constantly cuts out for seconds at a time. Podcasts, music, audio editing - doesn't matter what it is, or which device. I've had these a few months, and in probably close to 40 hours of usage I've had maybe 5 total hours of listening time that's not been interrupted by pauses.

That all being said, the audio is good, and the noise-canceling is excellent. They're great for conference calls, and convenient for audio editing when I'm not at home and am in a more crowded/noisy place, but overall there are just bunches of problems. It's both frustrating and unfortunate, these could be amazing, but they don't live up to the hype."
314,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not very impressed with these headphones.

I bought these primarily for travel and my work in an office environment where I am trying to tune out coworkers on calls, talking, etc. Up to this point, I have been using a cheap pair of $20 ear buds which work okay for the purpose.

When I use these Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones at work, there is a noticeable reduction in persistent ambient noise such as air conditioning but I can still hear my coworkers talk, phones ring, printer printing, etc. I was expecting much more noise cancelling performance. At about the same volume, my $20 ear buds drown out the same background noise as these $350 headphones.

The sound quality on the Bose headphones is decent but not very rich, and tends to get very muddy at higher volumes (which are needed to fully overcome outside ambient noise). By comparison, my $150 Audio Technica ATH-M50x headphones sound far better. although the Bose headphones are wireless which is pretty darn convenient.

I downloaded the latest firmware, hoping to improve the situation, but there wasn't much of a difference. The sound quality and level of noise cancelling seems to be the same through both bluetooth and wired connections. I have also tried the headphones on multiple phones and computers; no change. The Bose technical support offers suggestions to improve the ear-seal, but I do not have hair around the ears and do not wear glasses. I am the perfect candidate for a good ear seal and there is no improvement to be found here.

I am hesitant to say that these headphones are a rip off at $350, but I was expecting much more from something so expensive. I will either try to return these for a refund or end up using them only for mowing the lawn and vacuuming.

Very disappointed; I hope this helps others."
315,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, just got back from a month long stay in the U.K., and man...I really had a chance to use these headphones. On the plane, in the hotel room, on the train, at the airport. Wow, never thought I'd get my money's worth, but they are incredible. The noise cancellation is about 70% in most of the environments in which I used them, unless I was listening to music. In music listening mode, I was completely transported. I have paired these phones to my iPod, iPad and I use the Bose Connect app on these devices to switch between these two devices and my iPhone. You can have two devices paired simultaneously. Very easy operation. In London, I used them at night in bed to help lull me off to sleep and they are somewhat comfortable for doing so. They hold a charge for about 9-10 hours of continuous use and charge quickly, even using a battery charger. I think you'll be pleased, although, I have no other similar products with which to compare these phones, but I am pleased"
316,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned many pairs headphones. I've tried other noise canceling versions of this style. These Bose QC35s are supreme compared to any brand. The noise canceling is superior. I use them for meditation, airplane travel, late night TV watching when my fiancé is sleeping, at the gym and even at work. I can't even stress how multifunctional and comfortable these headphones are on my ears.

Second and most importantly, the sound. I listen to music all the time from Hip-Hop to Classical Piano, the sound on these headphones is deep, rich, layered and clear. Everything I listen to sounds beautifully orchestrated.

Third, a bonus feature is the battery is quick to charge and lasts a long time. I often forget to turn them off and the next day I still have battery life. Super great for a guy like me.

Overall, these are the best headphones money can buy! They can be used to your benefit in many ways. A great purchase, probably my best purchase of the year."
317,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise canceling works great on these. It will turn low frequency ambient noise in to a very dull roar, once you turn on music you cannot hear anything else. You will still hear people talking and some noises but it will be considerably less. For me, the freakier part is being in a loud place and turning the headset off, it feels like you are drowning in noise and even the slightest hum will annoy you. Let's face it, at over three hundo, this why you are buying these and the feature works very well.

But be warned if you have tinnitus. I have tinnitus pretty bad and wearing the headphones makes me more aware of the ringing since there is no longer any ambient noise to drown it out. I am not saying the ANC cause it or made it worst though, the ringing in my ear just sounds louder.

The headset is lightweight and the pads are soft yet make a good seal around my ears to keep the sound from leaking. There is a little more pressure exerted but it's not painful. The build feels pretty high quality but could be a little better. The included case is a nice touch. Usually stock cases are not that good but this one is small, sturdy, and has pouches to hold cables.

It seems the latest trend is the move to bluetooth/wireless. Pairing to my 6S+ was simple and took only a few seconds, much quicker than off brand wireless ear buds I have tried. It is also VERY nice not having wires hanging off of my head. Switching back to my wired Sennheiser's feels like a step back into the old days. Bose includes a thin 3.5mm audio cable but the change in audio quality isn't that noticeable. Wired is slightly better but wireless is much more comfortable. The 20 hour battery life seems pretty true too.

The Bose Connect app is useful for disabling the voice prompts, which I found kind of annoying. The button interface is also a little strange. The top button increases volume, lower decreases it but the middle button has multiple functions. Press the middle button once and it stops the music, hold it down and it activates Siri. Press it twice to skip forward and press three times to go back. I found I have to press it 6 times to make it go back a song some times.

So far my biggest annoyance is the shipping time with these. I have ordered two pairs from different vendors with prime 2 day and both times they have been delayed several days. If you do get a pair, I would get the faster shipping option."
318,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After much research I had narrowed my choices to: the Bose QC35 & Sony H.ear (MDR100ABN). Initially I bought the Sony because they were less $$ and they had the option to turn off the noise canceling. I currently have a pair of older, wired Sony headphones & have been very happy with them over the years. I've always wanted Bose, but have always hesitated because they are usually at the higher price range.

The first pair of Sony's had terrible static in one earphone (with NC on) right out of the box. They were immediately returned to Amazon for another pair. The 2nd pair started to arbitrarily turn off & on within 2 weeks. They were returned for credit toward these Bose QC35's. I guess Sony's quality control has slipped over the years? Two strikes & Sony was OUT!

And now I realize why Bose is more expensive = Quality & features!

Pros of QC35 vs Sony H.ear (MDR100ABN):
- Lighter
- Better padding on the head band. I can wear them comfortably for hours.
- Not as much pressure on ears. Sony was too tight.
- Fold more compactly
- Superior NC
- Bose Connect app for smartphone allows control and monitoring of the headphones on my iPhone & iPod
- As a nice surprise the Bose Connect app's latest update allows me to adjust the NC to high, low & off. I've found that the low setting is great for blocking ambient noise & still being able to hear people talking to me.

Sony subjectively seemed to have a slightly fuller sound - using same EQ's on my phone & Mac.

Buy the Bose! You'll be very happy."
319,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My original opinion of these were that I hated them. Their ANC was so powerful it made me feel sick on flights. It was as if all they cared about was proving how good they could conceal noise, and everything else be damned. I tried other headphones, some of which I liked much more than the QC35. The Denon AHGC20 sounded just phenomenal and were insanely comfy, but had somewhat weak ANC. I could enjoy them on long flights, though. But they snapped pretty easily and so their $399 price point meant they were not a rebuy. Then I tried some others before finding the Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2, and relay really like them. Sound as good as the Denons, good ANC without the sick pressurized sensation, and ridiculously good battery life. However the comfort was not as good a the Bose or the Denons.

While trying to accustom my ears to the Plantronics, I noticed that Bose had issued a firmware update that allowed you to select ANC levels as high, low, or none. Once I set the ANC to low, the cancellation was still pretty good but that pressure sensation was reduced. Now, I think I can wear them again for long stretches, and since I own both, I am torn between the superior sound of the Plantronics and the superior comfort of the Bose. I consider them 1:1 rivals now.

However, if you haven't bought either yet, know that the Plantronics are $179 while the Bose are $349. Were I wanting to buy a set, I would probably start with the Plantronics. But good for Bose for finally understanding that strong ANC is not THE ONLY requirement of a good set of noise cancelling headphones. I can handle lesser sound quality on a plane, but I need multi-housed comfort while not feeling like my head might implode."
320,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My first thought was that these headphones are too expensive. Recently, my brother brought a pair with him to our annual Guatemala fishing trip. He'd put them on just to cancel the drone of the twin diesel engines as we made the several hour journey out to sea. He let me try them and I was absolutely amazed at the amount of noise they canceled. I'd say they are better than advertised. Most of the noise I was still able to hear was coming from vibration induced through my body. Incredible noise cancelling ability, very good sound quality and very, very comfortable to wear. I wore these the entire flight from Seattle to Honolulu (6 hours) without fatigue, and the jet noise isn't nearly as loud as the boat engines were. Very nice to be able to listen to quality sound at levels that aren't blasting your eardrums out. My thoughts now? Worth every penny."
321,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best bluetooth headphone with best noise cancellation in the market.
COMFORT: 10/10 it is very comfortable to wear. I think it is on a little loose side in general but it never fell out of my head when I walk. Because these are made of leather and over the ear so it will get hot when you work out on them but that is expected.
SOUND: 10/10 at first I was used to the heavy bass of SONY headphones so I thought the Bose was lacking the bass but now that I've been using these for over hundreds of hours, I can say these sound amazing. You can hear every spectrum of sound low mid high without loss of detail. I listen to rock, metal and I really enjoy listening on this.
BUILD QUALITY: 10/10 I'm stationed in South Korea as Army solider. I've been to field with these and these endured all the scratches and dust. I even put these on to sleep when my environment gets too loud aka snoring of fellow soldiers and loud and dying sound of generator. I accidentally scratched this against metal part of humvee and tents but I can barely notice scratch unless I really look closely.
BATTERY LIFE: 10/10 20 hours it claims and I can definitely say that it can hold as close as it claims. One of the best battery life and that is with the active noise cancellation on.

Improvement: there should be more color choices or they can make the ANC toggle on or off. And it uses smaller aux cable to connect from headphone not the standard 3.5mm cable."
322,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them. This is my 4th pair. I've looked at so many other options each time but come back to these for all my travel, noise cancelling requirements. Love the sound quality (I'm sure there is better), features and functions. No issues with any pair I have owned."
323,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay. So I bought it this morning. I paired it with my iPhone. And now I am trying to pair it with my Macbook Pro. While trying to connect, my Mac kept saying Pairing Failed and now the green battery indicator on the headphone is lit up even though I have turned the headphone off. I was on call with Bose customer support and they wanted me to unpair the headphone from my iPhone and try to pair it again. But once I unpaired (deleted), its not connecting to the headphones either. So basically I am stuck with a $350 headphone that doesn't turn off and doesn't work. The rep suggested that I return the headphone and then get a new one. The store is going to return it to Bose so that they can analyze and then fix all the issues in the next version. When asked what would have happened if I found this bug after the 1 year warranty has run out, the rep suggested that Bose would offer me a discount after the 1 year warranty to buy a newer version.

So, long story short, if you are willing to take a risk and be a beta tester for Bose while shelling out $350 (+tax), this one is for you."
324,2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: I increased my review from 4 stars to 5 stars because the Bose Connect app now lets us turn off the voice prompts. The app also lets us control the ""auto-off"" feature and rename the device which is helpful in case you have multiple in a household.

I'd give these five stars if not for the way they perform when being used simply for noise cancelation without bluetooth music.

When I get on a plane and turn them on without a music source the computer voice says over and over in my ears, ""PAIRING... iPhone.... PAIRING...iPhone... PAIRING.. iPhone... PAIRING... MacBook Pro... PAIRING... MacBookPro... PAIRING... MacBookPro. Unable to connect - Bluetooth disconnected.""

This is quite annoying and I hope they find a way to fix it via a firmware update."
325,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! I never thought that I would be willing to spend this amount of money for a Bose anything. However, you do get your money's worth, and then some! Bose has a patent on the world's best noise cancelling software, which is nothing short of magical! I just bought a new ZTR mower that is really loud, especially when engaging the PTO and blades. Bose QuietComfort 35 connects seamlessly to my iPhone, via Bluetooth, and turns a mundane chore into an unexpectedly pleasant experience. I mow 4 acres; Bose lets me hear my music and answer phone calls, while leaving the volume at a safe level, which is absolutely amazing! Not sure how Bose's noise cancelling actually works, but I'm very glad that they do it so well! Buy the best, and you won't ever regret it."
326,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just had to move into a new area at work where the cubicle ""walls"" are only 3' high instead of 6' high; so I can see 100 people at once instead of one person in my old cube. I was worried that all the additional noise would make it hard to focus. I know noise-cancelling headphones work best for constant background roars like planes and trains; but I've heard these help in the office too. I am blown away at how well they work in my new cube at work. Yes, I can still hear my cube neighbor when she is one the phone, but just barely, and that is WITHOUT any music playing. Spin some jazz and no problem. My only complaint is sometimes the audio cuts out from my laptop bluetooth connection, but I just wiggle my head and it comes back in fine. The built-in microphone works well for answering your cell phone calls; and no microphone boom to get in the way. Nice case has pouches for the audio cord and USB cable, and a secure place for the airplane adapter, in case you ever travel in an old 737."
327,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these probably for a different reason than most people. I am a computer programmer and participate in many conference calls on my cell phone at home and wanted headphones with great clarity as people on the call are from all over with different accents and can be hard to understand. The problem is that the microphone on these headphones is SUPER sensitive and people complain LOUDLY that my typing is way too loud even though I have a pretty quiet keyboard. There is no way to reduce the sensitivity of the microphone on these headphones so I must resort to muting my phone every time I want to type (even though I sometimes need to talk while I type to show people what I'm doing). I'm surprised other people have not run into this problem. Other than that, I do agree with the other reviews in that these headphones are great. Great noise reduction and great sound (the conference calls are super clear)."
328,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The good: They are Bose - for anyone who has never had the pleasure of their noise cancelling on a long flight, you don't know what you're missing. They seem to handle multiple devices well. And making calls on them is passable, in terms of quality reported by the person at the other end.

The bad: Basically a step back from my QC2's. This is my third set of Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones over the last decade, and by far the worst. There is nothing in the world wrong with my QC2's which replaced their predecessor via the Bose upgrade program (which is no longer available). I got these because the new phones have no headphones jack, and I was forced to buy a Bluetooth headset.

The sound is muddier and seems better at music I would not listen to. If you want to play YouTube videos and your Beyoncé 65kb mp3 - you're going to be fine with these. If you think Beats headphones sound good - you'll like these better. But my Pink Floyd and Supertramp sounds more like the sound from an earbud. I don't expect Bose to compare to my Grado Labs or anything - these are my travel headphones. But for the price and bulk - I expected better.

The sound from an iPhone is particularly bad - perhaps it has to do with the codec or Bluetooth stack - I don't know. But it's night and day between an LG V30 and an iPhone X.

They way they fold into the case seems nice, but actually, the case is bulkier that the old one. I am concerned that the stress of constantly bending the headset will result in some broken wire or joint far too soon as well.

I am also worried about this rechargeable battery. In the QC2's, I replaced the battery perhaps five times over several years. In a month, I've had to recharge these twice from dead. This is going to be far less convenient than a simple AAA would have been.

They are also ridiculously less comfortable than my QC2's. I understand this is subjective, but these make my ears sweaty and hot, and smooch my hair if I wear them to support the weight at the odd angle of the cups. Also, they seem smaller, and they push on my ear lobe - unlike the QC2's, these cannot contain my entire ear inside the cup. That means noise leaks in, comfort leaks out."
329,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are wonderful and have saved my sanity. I live in a noisy neighborhood, and these headphones have allowed me to be able to read, study, or just listen to my own music without having to hear my downstairs neighbors' constant stomping and door slamming, neighbor dogs barking, backup beeps from nearby construction, the downstairs neighbors' vacuum, etc. Sure, I can maybe hear a little of some of these noises, but the noise cancelling on these headphones makes it so that the noises seem further away and much less obtrusive and irritating. The girl downstairs is loudly gettin' it on with her boyfriend? Pop these on, and BLISS, no hearing things you can't un-hear. Even without music and just having the NC turned on does wonders.

The battery life on these is great. I'm getting maybe 11-12 hours on a full charge? For point of reference, I took these on a 9.5-hour Amtrak trip recently, and the battery outlasted the trip with maybe 20% power left. This is GREAT, since my trip was over a holiday, when trains are rather full and noisy. I could sort of hear the people around me if they were talking loudly (and I could hear the conductor's/engineer's announcements, so no worries about being clueless in an emergency), but everything was nicely toned down and muffled so that the noise was there but not overly obnoxious.

Also, you can download the Bose Connect app, which allows you to update firmware and also to toggle the NC on or off or set it at medium--which is handy if you want to listen to music but still be aware of what's going on around you, e.g. if you're out walking and don't want to be totally oblivious to traffic, or if you're sitting at home but need to hear the doorbell or something.

The only thing I've noticed is a little static when listening to Pandora at home if I'm a little too close to my wireless router, but that's only if I'm using my cell phone instead of my laptop, and it's only Pandora, so I think that's just a matter of interference between cell and Wi-Fi signals, rather than a Bose issue. The Bose literature does say that there can be an issue if you're too close to a radio signal, anyway.

The only thing that would be an improvement for me and knock these totally out of the park is if the wireless control buttons on the headphones would work with Linux so that if I am listening to Pandora or a movie on my Ubuntu laptop, I could still use the buttons. Then I'd give these six stars."
330,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first Bose noise-canceling headphones. So to start with, the noise canceling is amazing, literally. I got them for a 5 hour flight from PDX to NYC and holy cow do they make a difference with the jet engine noise. From what I can tell they are very impressive at eliminating sounds that are steady and of consistent frequency. So you can hear erratic sounds, like people talking, car horns, etc., but anything that's ongoing and the same sounding will be diminished by roughly 90%.

So 5-star point #2 is the sound quality. I consider myself an audiophile and have since the invention of the CD. I've had some high-end Sony studio monitor headphones in the past, and I gotta say, these Bose are hands-down better sounding. They have a very impressive frequency response. The low-lows are there, the clarity of all the assorted mids is there, the highs are crisp. These are truly amazing.

And third, bluetooth. Icing on this very delicious cake! The quality of the bluetooth transmitted sound is by far the best from bluetooth I've heard on any device, and I have plenty. Add that to the fact that these headphones also work as a headset for phone calls. I've never had a great experience with bluetooth headsets for phone calls... until now. These are wonderful. They can hear me perfectly, and with the noise canceling and using both phones over both ears, I can hear everything they say with ease. I've used them on my noisy balcony in downtown Portland, a place where NO headset, even wired, worked well enough to use... the people on the other end always hear too much noise. Not the case with these.

I had originally purchased a pair of $100 Sonys to replace my $350 Sonys, and was sorely disappointed (guess that should have been obvious!). I returned them here on Amazon and decided to just buck up and buy these. I am super pleased with that decision and cannot recommend these magnificent headphones enough!

I also recently learned that the noise canceling technology used is patented by Bose. Being that it's pretty much the only technology that actually works, no other brand of noise canceling is even worth consideration. If that's your goal, be sure to try any Bose noise canceling headphones before deciding to go with another brand."
331,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones in black look even better in person. The Noise canceling is perfect for commuting on the train and/or walking in the city. You won't hear other people, just your music. You will be focused and in your one world. Music quality is good too, but not worthy of the Bose label.

Reason I regret my purchase:
The Bluetooth is aweful. My connection constantly drops when I place my iPhone 7 in my pocket. In order to enjoy these, my phone needs to be in my hand at all times. This sucks!
I am using their controversial app and updated the firmware as well to eliminate any possible bugs.

Would have given these 5 stars if it weren't for the bluetooth dropouts.
I would wait for the next QuietComfort release"
332,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the Bose Q25 already , which is the same quality product except it isn't wireless. The Q35 is so much better ! I can go outside to water my yard while listening to music or an audible book, hold a beverage, not get tangled in the wire, and not have to hold my iPhone....or put it in a small purse! I can vacuum my house, go up and down the stairs, without the wire catching on drawer knobs, door knobs, etc. I love how freeing these are!
A few noted observations in comparing Q25 with the Q35: The Q25 can be used in sound cancelling mode or without, while the Q35 is only able to work in sound cancelling mode.
The Q35 tells you the percentage of battery charge left every time you turn it on. This is a nice feature. It also tells you what device you are connected to.
I haven't had any problems yet with sound cutting out, even when I'm outside and my iPhone is left in the house. I haven't yet measured how many feet away this works, but I would estimate that I have been at least 35 feet away from my phone.
I don't feel like having both sets is redundant. I still use my Q25 with my electric piano, and since I purchased them over 2 years ago, I don't feel like I've overindulged too much. Ha!
I also feel like the noise cancelling in the Q35 is even quieter than the Q25.
No regrets yet! I use them every day. I'm at 40% battery power after 6 days!"
333,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easily one of my most satisfying purchases on Amazon. Easy to use, good battery life, good sound performance. Noise cancelling is ridiculously effective. I flew for 5 hours in a window seat, watched two movies, and every time the stewardess stopped to ask if I wanted a beverage or snack the person sitting next to me had to tap me because I couldn't hear a thing outside of the headphones. My ONLY concern is the plug jack doesn't seat with authority into the headset, and tugging on it (as in if it gets caught up under your arm or somewhere else while moving your head about) can cause the sound to get cut off. We'll see how that connection holds up...."
334,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As a long time Bose headphones customer, I was elated that Bose finally released a wireless set with noise cancellation. I have been using pairs of QC15s (over the ear) and QC3s (on the ear). I also own a pair of Soundlink wireless on ear- which cause significant ear discomfort after lengthy use. My only concern with the QC35s was Bluetooth quality and possible audio/video lag. Some observations after two weeks of usage: the headphones are *INCREDIBLY* comfortable. I have worn them for hours on end and not the slightest discomfort to my ears. Also, compared to the excellent QC15s, the noise cancellation on the QC35s is a quantum leap - far superior to the previous wired sets. Like the Soundlink wireless, pairing and battery level is communicated via automated voice through the headphones. Paired with both my iPhone 6s Plus and iPad Air 2, there has been ZERO audio lag watching YouTube and shows via TiVo app. The sound quality is crisp and absolutely amazing. The noise cancellation alone is worth it. If you're a QC 15 (or older) holdout like me, don't hesitate to get the QC35s. They are comfortable, user-friendly, and the sound and noise cancellation features are incredible. I strongly recommend the QC35s without hesitation."
335,3.0 out of 5 stars,First of all let me say that the sound quality is indeed awesome. BUT These headphones keep having a gap in playing my music when connected to Bluetooth even when my phone is right next to them. I don't have this problem with any other Bluetooth headphones. Both phone and headphones are fully charged. At first I thought it was a one off thing but it keeps happening. For this price you don't expect to have to deal with issues and can't accept issues like these! You expect a product that works out of the box and you don't have to spend time on trying to get a fix for ! Disappointed!
336,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I travel quite a bit and have used the Bose noise cancelling over ear headphones for years and loved them. The sound quality and noise cancelling is second to none. I have tried a couple of other similar noise cancelling bluetooth headphones and the biggest issue is audio sync if you are trying to watch video on a device and use those headphones for listening.

That is not the case with these. The sound quality is AMAZING!! There is zero lip sync issues with these. Also, I was talking to a fellow tech geek today on them (paired to my iPhone 7) and he said I sounded amazing, even while sitting in the middle of a busy airport.

Pros:
Sound quality is second to none
Noise cancelling is amazing (almost too good when you are trying to hear announcements in the airport)
Phone conversations sound amazing on both ends
Full volume control
Hard on/off switch (love this feature)
AWESOME battery life (I charged and have used for about 7 hours already, and it still has 80% battery life left)
Nice carrying case (took a couple of times to figure out how to fit them in there)

Cons:
UMMMM....the left and right ear cups aren't labeled, maybe because you can wear them either way
Haven't figured out how to change audio tracks on iPhone from earphones

Overall these are the best set of headphones I have EVER used and I have tried many different ones. These are a must have for travelers that want a serious, adult pair of headphones. 8-)"
337,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was between these and the Sony NC headphones. And while I'm sure the Sony headphones are great, I'm quite pleased with these.

The build quality is top notch. Very solid and comfortable. The Noise Canceling is among the best available. Great on planes, trains, or in the office.

Using these on my commute, at the office, and while cleaning around the house, I would say I average about 4 hours per day, and charge about once a week. The built in microphone seems to work well. I really like that they pipe in sound from outside while you're on the phone, it gives you a sense of how loud your voice is and helps you stay aware of your surroundings. I'm hoping these last a long time!"
338,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I like Sennheiser sound - I still have HD650 with me and I have owned 600 and even Orpheus HE-90 at one time. I ordered a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 2 a while ago but could bear the small ear cup. I gave them away. I saw the recently release 4.50BTNC and thought Sennheiser should have fixed the problem, but sadly no. I don't like them at all ( see my review of them here on Amazon ) Desperately looking for a comfort set of noise cancelling wireless and good sounding headphones, I finally pick Bose QC35. To be honest I didn't like Bose brand at all -- all from my experience from their speaker performance. To me they are all marketing with subpar sound quality and hyped price.

Got QC35 today and did some side by side comparison with 4.50BTNC and Definitive Technology Symphony 1, my only pair of noise canceling headphones so far. And Sennheiser HD650 just for reference purpose. Boy I am pleasantly surprised by QC35:

(1) the comfort is insanely good. leaps and bounds better than Sennheiser M2 and 4.50BTNC
(2) the shocking surprise for me is the sound quality -- shattered my prejudice over Bose brand. very neutral, coherent, and balanced. no sizzling highs yet not dull at all. good resolution. non-fatigue. Only minus is a tad boom at mid-bass but not overly done IMO.

I haven't tested the noise cancelling performance but it is not a high priority for me since they will be used primarily for office cubical environment to help me to focus.

I am returning my Sennheiser 4.50BTNC, and buying another pair of QC35's for my son as well :)

posted a couple of pictures of Sennheiser 4.50BTNC, HD650, and Bose QC35 as a reference."
339,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the past few years, I've tried a variety of Bose products. It all started the first QC wired headsets which was more than 10 years ago. Being a gadget freak, that unit ended-up in eBay and I've spent that last decade chasing that good ol' sound quality. Even newer Bose wire QC series products did not impress me and It was one disappointment after another. I am not a musician but I love clean audio quality. I can hear every single beat, tune, noise, even a darn fly in the other room can get my attention. I got these today and was praying not to be disappointed again... And darn it! It took Bose another decade to finally get those nice lows and highs back in the hole.

The Noise Cancelling it hands-down, the best even in it's own class. When it to comes to music, I'm happy that I finally got my original QC quality from a decade ago, but with no strings attached and no batteries to replace. Honestly, I'm still shocked."
340,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to use them with my Windows PC, iPhone and my TV. In Wireless mode.
First I had Windows 7 and a new Bluetooth 4.0 dongle. Could not really get them to work reliably. Bottom line is that Windows 7 cannot handle Bluetooth 4.0. Don't even bother. I spent days trying to get them to work. Then I upgraded to Windows 10 (meant to do it for a while anyway). They work flawlessly and no drivers needed for the Bluetooth 4.0 dongle and none for the Bose headphones.

Here are my opinions and discoveries:

Pros
- Sound is amazing. Great lower ranges. I can now hear base that I did not hear before in some songs.
- Very easy to pair and reconnect with Windows 10 and iPhone
- Great battery life. I used them for days and they are at 40% at the moment. I do turn them off while not using them.
- Very comfortable and easy to adjust
- Volume control, skip/pause songs etc. Controls work great with my iPhone.
- They sound great while making phone calls
- Noise cancellation tech is amazing.

Cons
- (<strike>Cannot disable noise cancellation</strike>) It is possible after updating the firmware. I start to get a little bit uncomfortable, almost like a headache after using them for a while.
- About 25% smaller wireless range than Apple Airpods. Also the range is shorter when the left headphone is pointing toward the transmitter. It seems that the headphones have only one Bluetooth receiver, in the right headphone. Apple Airpods have one in each headphone. For this price, Bose should have included 2 receivers. Second receiver might give you an additional 2 or 3 feet range, depending which way your head is pointing. Compared to the Airpods, the Bose headphones seem to have about 6 to 10 feet shorter wireless range. In spots around my home where the Airpods have zero interruptions, the Bose cut off the sound.
- Short charging cable (1 foot USB cable? Really?) Charging cable should be at least 3 feet. 6 feet is ideal. Will buy one.
- If your battery goes bad, you cannot replace it. So you will be buying new headphones.
- Price.

I would give them 4 1/2 stars is possible. Not 5."
341,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfection in every way. The sound is amazing, you hear every sound so clearly and with dimension. The noise cancellation is great. It's also very comfortable; I have recurring jaw pain and usually over ear head phones press right on my trigger point, but these are so gentle and comfortable that they don't bother my jaw at all. The Bluetooth is also perfect, I left my phone upstairs and came downstairs with no fault in sound. Truly excellent headphones. I'm going to buy another pair for my husband. I recently had the new sennheiser momentum Bluetooth noise cancelling which were horrible compared to these."
342,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these so much.

The noise cancelling is incredible, it's better than ear plugs. I have a 22 mo and a 6 mo and when my wife needs to go to sleep I have her just put these on while I manage the kids.

They're extremely comfortable, I've worn them for 7 + hours, the top gets a bit tired but it's not bad.

The mic is quite clear, many I call prefer it to my phone (though background noises can be annoying for them).

The battery life is extremely long for wireless headphones, honestly you have to use it for a solid chunk of time before it will even drop below 100%. Quick bits here and there on your audiobook wont do it for a week.

They are a bit bulky, it's not something I'd exercise with though I do mow the yard with them.

The sound is quite incredible coupled with the noise cancelling, it's what you'd expect from a higher end Bose product. Music is crisp and beautiful with high highs and strong base."
343,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've thoroughly enjoyed these headphones, but they did develop a fatal flaw.

First, what I like about them:
- I felt the sound reproduction for their size was exceptionally good.
- the noise canceling feature is extremely good. My wife has a tendency to snore a bit (PLEASE don't tell her I said that!). I'm a light sleeper, so getting a restful night's sleep was sometimes a bit of a challenge. When I put these on, it's a though I'm the only one in the room, it's so quiet. I've stood outside my office, next to I-95 in Jacksonville. Normally, that noise is so loud you can't hear someone speaking in anything less than a shout. With these on, the expressway at its busiest wasn't much more than a faint whisper.
- They're very light, and I find I can wear them an entire day without any discomfort. Sleeping with them on is not an issue, except when I want to lay on my side.
- I found them to be very well built. Though they're a small form factor, they're solid, yet soft and plush where they need to be.
- I used them when doing light exercise, like walking, though I don't believe they're built for intense workouts at the gym. The ear cups are somewhat absorbent, and they wouldn't stand up well to a sweaty workout very well.
- I like the voice interface when I turn them on, telling me what percentage my battery is at, and what the headphones are connected to.
- They were VERY easy to pair with my iPhone and my PC. Being able to pair two devices to the headphones was really very handy.
- the bluetooth range is really exceptional. I was over 70 feet away from the source before I began to lose my connection.
- the battery charge lasts a few days, even under heavy use. Well, at least it DID (more on that in a bit)

Indifferent: the app. I really can't make sense of the app - it doesn't actually seem to do much. I found I couldn't update the firmware via the app on my iPhone - had to connect them to my PC and update from the BOSE support site.

Problem: I purchased these headphones in October 2016. In June 2017 I found that the headphones began to power on, even with the switch in the full OFF position. Just once in awhile at first, but over the course of a couple of weeks it became every day, and eventually they power back on as soon as I turn the switch off. Essentially, they're never powered off now, even though the switch is in the full OFF position. As soon as I turn 'em off, they power back on and immediately pair with my iPhone and my PC, which effectively mutes the sound on the mobile device or my PC, since it's routing through the headphones instead. I checked my warranty, and found it to be for one full year from date of purchase. Bose even provides a support link on Amazon with a phone number to call. I searched the reviews on Amazon, and found that a few other users were experiencing this issue as well. The reviews I read on the tropic didn't mention if they'd contacted BOSE for help or not. I called Bose, and spoke with a very friendly, helpful support tech. He walked me through the process of removing an ear cup to find the serial number so he could verify the warranty, and immediately set me up with a new replacement pair of headphones. He said he'd never heard of my issue before, but when I told him that it had been reported on Amazon's site, he said he'd certainly check further into it. Hmmmm.....

So, yeah - I like the headphones. A lot. But that deal with not being able to turn them off is pretty bad. In all fairness, there are a LOT of very strong 5-star reviews for this device, and only two (that I found) that mentioned this issue, so it does appear to be a very isolated issue. I hope it doesn't affect the replacement pair!

In spite of it, though, I find that I highly recommend the BOSE QC-35. I'm quite sure the audiophiles out there will tell you there are better sounding, better noise cancelling, more comfortable headphones for a better price. But I'm not in that category by any stretch. To me, the combination of weight, build, comfort, sound, noise cancellation, ease of use, and service after the sale make these a very worthwhile purchase, and I strongly recommend them. No 'free or reduced cost' in exchange for my review; I paid the full price for these, so my views are my own, based on my experience with this device. Hope you find this review helpful as you search for your own personal audio solution."
344,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded from an older Bose model QC15. What I disliked about the older headphones, Bose has improved with the QC35. For one, the cord. I've always disliked the hassle of the cord. I'd lose it or forget it when traveling. Now, that's no longer an issue. Bluetooth pairing is easy and fast every time. Another improvement is the USB charging. Went through packs and packs of batteries because I would always forget to turn them off. Being able to charge / recharge with USB is golden, so no dead headphones on those long distance flights! Although I'm not sure what the true battery life is, I like that there is an audio indicator that tells you ""Battery at 80%"" and the device it's connected to. For me the sound is awesome. I love the ability to throw these on and stay focused in environments where I'd like to block out the noise. That said, as always Bose delivers on the Noise Cancellation, which is outstanding. Are the Bose QC35 perfect? As near perfect as you can get. I'd love to see additonal improvements with long-term use and comfort and overall size. Hopefully, Bose will consider an auto-off option in the future, but outside of that I would buy again! No cord, no batteries and I'm fine."
345,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pair of headphones, here is a what I like, and dislike about them.

Pros: 1. Sound quality is absolutely amazing. I think these headphones will beat or compete with any others on the market.
2. These are the most comfortable pair of around ear headphones I have ever worn. The leather pads on the ear cups actually go around your ears (great for people with glasses like myself) instead of sitting on your earlobes like most ""around ear"" headphones.
3. The battery life is actually better than advertised. You can get close to 25-30 hours of actual wireless playtime from a full charge.
4. The noise cancellation feature is quite amazing at blocking out low background noise without any music playing.

Cons: 1. The construction seems very fragile. They are made of almost 100% plastic. The ear cup hinge and pivot points seem like a major weak spot. I can almost gaurantee that they would not survive being dropped on a hard surface without some kind of damage.
2. The battery is not replacable. Once the battery eventually loses it's strength and doesn't keep a charge you cannot use the bluetooth or noise cancellation features anymore, but they can still be used with the auxillary cord.

Hope this was helpful. I am an actual customer, I have not been paid or compensated in any way for this review."
346,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Short version... if you want the best Noise Cancelling Headphones, that are very comfortable, and offer top notch sound quality... buy these.

Let me start the review by saying I am by no means an ""audiophile""... I have a moderate setup for my home music listening. I use Sennhesier HD 580s with a Cambridge DacMagic - about a $400 setup in total. I was not expecting a wireless Bose NC headset to compete... but I have to say the sound quality of the Bose is on par with my desktop setup. In short, for the price point the Bose are about as good as HD 580's with a DAC. IMO at least.

I travel for a living, so comfort is a key aspect for me. I would say these are again on par with my 580's, and maybe even a slight bit more comfortable. I have a HUGE head, so this is always a area of concern for me, but the QC 35's do a great job of flexing, without putting extra pressure on me. Padding is top quality. Build feels ""strong"".

Now about the NC... my god... I don't know what type of sorcery Bose is conjuring up at their HQ, but the NC is unlike anything I have heard before. It's not natural... I tested this by turning up my white noise machine in my office to max, turned on all the fans, and opened the door to my office to allow my screaming children a chance to contribute to my test.... it was like someone hit a ""mute"" button to the world. It was one of those moments when you experience a new type of technology that leaves you speechless for a minute. Like seeing 1080P for the first time 10 years ago... I even let my wife try it on, and she literally looked at me and said ""I feel like I'm 20 feet underwater"", which I guess is the best way to describe it.

The only ""Con"", and it might just be me... whatever they are doing for the NC, makes my ears sometimes feel like I'm changing altitude. Its like a small ear pop to adjust when you're flying. It can be a tiny bit disorientating at first. after about 10 minutes, this sensation went away."
347,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I did a lot of research before purchasing the Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless Headphones. My main goal was to find active noise cancelling headphones that actually worked. I am an IT professional, and my day-to-day work requires intense focus and complex technical challenges. But my work environment is also situated next to support specialists, and other less technical roles, wherein there is an excessive amount of noise, and quite frankly a rather Jr. High School environment. My company tries to be hip, and tends to attract a very young work force. Needless to say, my productivity (and sanity) has suffered due to the less than ideal circumstances I am required to work in.
When the headphones arrived, I couldn't wait to try them at work. Let me just say, in all honesty, I am astonished at how good the headphones cancel nuisance noise, such as the loud hum of the air-conditioning units, (did I mention my ""office"" is situated inside an old converted building that used to be a sausage factory)? Yes, the ""perfect storm"" of nuisance noise due to a building that acts like an echo chamber. By the afternoon, the warehouse environment has the noise and volume of conversations akin to a Jr. High School cafeteria.
The price is worth every penny for the noise cancelling properties. Its just amazing how quiet and serene the environment is that the headphones produce. Yes, it is like being immersed in a totally different environment, not just having the nuisance noise reduced to a negligible level.. I am more relaxed, more focused, less irritable, and I have reclaimed the ability to be more productive and to work at my level of maturity and focus.
I would not rate the headphones as studio quality for the music. I would say they are above average at best for music. But I bought them for their main purpose, and that is active noise cancelling. Active as in ACTIVE. They really do cancel noise, while allowing me to hear the conversations of those around me. But even more amazing than the noise cancelling is that the conversations around me are more muted, though still discernible. So I don't lose business continuity because I still need to collaborate with co workers, by keeping up with the conversations next to me.
The battery life is awesome. And the comfort is absolutely perfect. They are soft, light-weight, and they completely surround the ear without harsh pressure or a bulky profile. And the Bluetooth is very nice too, since I am not required to be tethered to my computer. 10 stars!"
348,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I contemplated for a long time whether or not to spend the $350 and buy the Bose QC 35. BUT I'M GLAD I DID! These headphones are very comfortable and they work great with my iPhone. Sound is nice and clear and I love the case it comes in. These are the most comfortable and relaxing headphones I've ever used. The Noise Canceling only works when they are turned on and these are the best noise cancelling headphones I've ever owned, however, on one airplane flight I did notice that a lot of people were talking loudly and I was still able to hear some of the talking passengers sitting around me and a baby crying in the background but it wasn't too bad. So far 98% of the time the noise cancelling works great, I've noticed that it's only on airplanes that I can still hear background noise sometimes. Overall, this was an excellent purchase and I can't believe I ever thought of not buying them now that I finally own a pair."
349,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile, I'm just an engineer. These are AWESOME!! Best on market. Incredible noise canceling experience!! I've yearned for a set of Bose noise canceling headphones for over 10 years. About 10 years ago or whenever the 1st set emerged, I was a poor college student. Even w/ my paychecks over the years, I couldn't justify spending $300 on a set of headphones and on top of that, i was reading how Bose started to use cheap material. Instead, i ended up buying numerous cheaper ones ranging from 50-200$. Then Apple headphones came out and they were good enough. Well, now that I'm older and have a bit more $$ to spend on better things, I finally got around to buying this and I regret not forking up the chedda for a pair over the years. This actually put a smile on my face listening to some of my favorite songs.

Pros:
- IMO, 80% of background noise is gone when the noise canceling is active with NO audio. Up to 90% of background noise is gone when you start playing your favorite songs or have audio. You do hear people talking or a bit of noise, but it's faint. If you're enjoying the music, you're not going to hear anything
- comfortable. I'm a natural type of guy. No watches, bracelets, ear rings...etc. Needless to say, I don't like to wear anything. After using these for a few days, I now feel I need them. i can use them for hours.
- As mentioned, I'm not an audiophile, so I can't tell you what its lacking in terms of sound quality, but it sounds just perfect for me. I hear excellent quality music.
- Wireless. Not a big deal nowadays, but it's a pro nonetheless. Answering call feature worked for me in my office. I received a call and worked out perfect. The other person heard me fine.
- Includes airplane adapters - I haven't tried them on a plane, yet. Will report back to see if it's convenient or do i need to buy more adapters.

Cons: I barely have any cons and i don't even think they're that bad.
- The only thing I felt Bose could've done was do more research on sleeping w/ these headphones on or using them for extended periods for traveling. I tried to use it w/ one of those neck pillows and it always rubbed. You could hear the rubbing noise or crackling noise. So it's best not touch the headphones while your again something. Would a better material block this or allow you to at least lean on them w/ a pillow? Or is this asking for too much? For $350, no.
- no batteries. pros/cons. You have to compromise at some point. Because of this, it may not last as long as the QC25, but hopefully, they'll redesign better for QC45? But we're talking at least 5 years.

Bottom line - if you travel a lot, it's an absolute must. Best on the market for the price. Even if you don't travel and you're into headphones...get them! Forget about Beats."
350,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I fly frequently for work and personal reasons and had a pair of the Bose Quietcomfort headphones that were wired. They have always worked great and I've never had any issues with them. Then along came my iPhone 7 and a new problem was created -- in addition to fiddling with the headphone wire, I had to use the inconvenient headphone adapter for the phone. Great...one more gadgety/wire-like thing I have to be sure to have on hand. So that sets the stage for the need. Then Bose decides to produce this headset. Feeling cash leaking out of my wallet in an unprecedented way, I ordered this headset with some hesitation. $350 is a LOT and I mean a LOT of money to spend on headphones. I'm not an audiophile -- what I need is the noise cancellation. Ever been on a flight with a chatty seatmate that won't give you any space and wants to relay their life's story? Babies screaming? People behind you carrying on a loud conversation for the entire flight? I'm not a grump, but I like my quiet space sometimes. The Bose headsets on a flight send two signals: 1) I'm busy, don't bother me, and 2) I have some class.

Despite the huge cash outlay, I'm REALLY happy with these headphones. They flat-out work great. They eliminate the problematic wiring and the fussy adapters. And I gave my wired Bose headphones to my wife, who doesn't travel as much as I do, and she's really happy with them!

My final advice: if you can afford these, they do the job they're intended to do in a reliable way. They're not audiophile headphones, but the range is just fine for normal people. :-)"
351,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You get what you pay for. Not much to say really. Bose is leading the way for NC tech. I looked at cheaper brands but I just kept coming back to these because the reviews of others where that they wished they'd paid the extra for Bose. I use these when I'm working at my computer and the kids are playing. I don't hear a thing. My wife will call for me and I don't hear. She ends up texting me to get my attention. At night if I'm working I'll put them on to listen to music. When you put these on when there is no noise already, it's errie feeling. These are also super comfortable. They cover the ears completely and are soft and light. They don't end up hurting the ears after wearing them for a long period of time. They also stay charged for quite a long time.

Could you get cheaper NC headphones? Yes. But I will say what you always hear. You get what you pay for. This is the first thing I've ever purchased that is Bose. I can't afford to buy a lot of Bose products. But I'm so happy that I decided to get these over a cheaper brand. They are expensive because they work. They cancel the noise, they are comfortable, they are wireless or wired, they stay charged forever, they don't heat up on your ears when you use them. Bose uses the best noise canceling technology and no one else is anywhere near having the same quality NC tech as Bose. So if you really want NC and comfort then she'll put the extra cash. You won't regret it. Once you put them one you'll know you made the right choice."
352,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first pair of ""nice"" headphones so I don't speak from lots of experience, but these are a pretty solid pair of headphones. The quality of sound is great and the bass is perfect (as long as you're not a bass-a-holic). There's a few things to note, but they're mainly just super nit-picky.

1) The range isn't great, sometimes it even cuts out for a second or two while my phone is in my pocket. I can generally walk into the next room with no problem, but the room after that usually gives me a little bit of cut out. Going onto a different floor basically guarantees cut out.

2) It's difficult to connect to non-phone bluetooth devices. I connected these to my computer and I had to jump through hoops to get there. I don't know if it was just my computer, but the headphones were a little to blame. You have to ""clear"" the bluetooth memory on the headphones first before you can connect them to anything else, which made my computer not able to recognize it for about ten minutes.

3) Sound over bluetooth is very quiet. This is the feature I'm most disappointed with. I don't know if this is a common aspect with bluetooth listening devices, but the maximum volume doubles when connected with a wire. I can't watch movies on bluetooth because the volume is so quiet. I don't mind it with music, however. In fact, I think that counts as a plus so you don't turn your music up too high and damage your ears.

4) Noise-canceling isn't absolute. It eliminates low rumbly sounds almost completely (car, fan, plane, etc) but higher noises (other music, voices) sneak through, though they are muffled."
353,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice quality headphones with stellar noise canceling capabilities. Having tried numerous brands the bose continue to impress and far exceed others. I have issues with the fixed battery and hated having to deal with individual batteries. The charge lasts a very long time so no worries on how long they can last. I really like that they are also wireless and can easily connect to the phone.
354,4.0 out of 5 stars,"paid, what i thought, was too much $ for a pair of the bose sport in-ear headphones in 2010...$130.00...sooo wrong!!!
Best buds EVER!!! Still have them, still sound better than any other buds out there!!!
So when i came across the QC 35 wireless headphones, the only hesitation was from the spotty wifi.

i have had other over the ear headphones with heavier bass but, NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD OVERALL SOUND CLARITY & QUALITY.
I cannot stress this enough, Bose hires tiny fairies to hide in ur headphones that jump out and massage ur eardrums with sweet sweet music!

Bose is audio for true audiophiles, plus, they are physically made well...very durable and comfortable.
They are stylish, if like me you like understated.
Noise-cancelling tech is great and they probably make great earmuffs!

Unfortunately for Bose, unless they come out with headphones that make sweet love to my ear canals, i will not need to buy a new pair for at least 10 years."
355,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the design of these headphones but after a few months of use I have major gripes about 'em. I live in an open concept house w/ 3 other guys and we all work from home. I had Win 7 and tried for 4 days to pair these with my PC and no dice. I'm a techy guy for a living so generally know how to make this stuff work. Roommate got same model and had same experience w/ Win 7. Called tech support and 1st agent said they should work automatically, reboot. Called back and 2nd tech said ""they're only for mobile devices"". Bout lost it.$350 for headphones that only work on mobile?

Got upgraded to Win 10 and they paired easily and have been using them for conference calls Do about 4-6 hrs of conf calls each day so important I hear them and they hear me. Few people say they know I'm on bluetooth cuz of a tingy sound. Not a showstopper. What is driving me crazy is that in order for these to work w/ Skype the sound has to be set to the ""Hands-Free"" device in Sound settings. If I want to listen to music (in stereo) I have to switch it back to the ""Stereo"" device. I do this about 3 times a day otherwise my coworkers can't hear me on Skype.

The real kicker is this is because Bose won't develop the necessary drivers. If they did then they would pair easily and work properly. I'm seriously considering switching to the Seinnheiser's. Heard they are better developed.

Pros:
- lightweight
- comfortable
- good sound (not great)
- noise cancellation (both mic and ears)
Cons:
- pairing these with a Windows 7 OS is apparently impossible
- ease of use not ideal on Windows 10
- voice quality not greatest when on conf calls"
356,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are the Best!!!! Cancel out noise, clear, can move around with 'no strings attached'! Why did I wait sooo long to get them!!!!
Can sit back or work on preparing dinner as I listen my latest Audible book...no distrubance to others around and no worry about the other people, pets, etc. disturbing me.
Thanks, Bose for a great product!"
357,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, I can stop fighting the wire. I loved my QC25 earphones but It seemed the wire was always getting caught behind me, under me or tickling my neck. Now at last I am free of the cord - Thank You Bose. Plus, the noise canceling technology has been vastly improved and really shuts the world out just enough that I can focus on my music. The balance of the different ranges of sounds is well done and keeps just enough bass to sound great without becoming a constant pounding in my ears. I love these things. Worth every penny.

Update: After about 1 week, my QC-35 earphones suddenly stopped pairing with my iPhone 7. Contacted Bose customer service and after several attempts to correct the problem over the phone, without hesitation, they prepaid the return of the earphones and are sending me a new pair. This update is not a critique of the sound quality of my QD-35 earphones.

Update: 10/31/2016 Bose sent an entirely new set of QC-35 earphones to replace the ones that stopped pairing. The support staff was efficient and helpful. Bose makes quality products and it's nice to see their support staff is also great. I have not lost any respect for Bose.They are A+ in my opinion."
358,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off the Bose QC 35 1 has great quality in construction and build similar to the soundstage. I'm not an audiophile but did enjoy the sound quality. The case they come in is a harder than soft shell case which seems firm enough if you dropped them from an average height.

However, I did end up returning them for two reasons. The first is the Bose connect app privacy concerns. You have to allow the device GPS location and it needs to stay on. This drains the battery of your device and seems unnecessary for people using non GPS capable phones. The second reason is a personal reason not an issue with the headphones. The ANC is pretty effective and tricks your ear into thinking you need to pop your ears like on a plane. From some forums it seems this goes away after a few weeks but I didn't want to wait and adjust. The light hiss when not having music on was pretty audible and the ANC made me feel sick somewhat like a stuffy nose and pressure on the ears. Again this seems to be because the ANC is very effective at blocking ambient noise.

If it doesn't bother you or you can adjust to it then these are definitely a good buy."
359,4.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATED

I've had these a couple of weeks now. I still consider these to be the best headphones I've ever had. I had to deduct a whole star and in the CONS section you'll see why.

PROS:

First: Super comfortable. I never get tired of wearing over the ear style headphones and these, while they can get hot if you're outside on a hot day, are really comfortable to keep wearing endlessly otherwise.

Second: They connect to two separate devices!!!! I can connect them to my Macbook Pro AND my iPhone *simultaneously*. No more disconnecting from one device to connect to the other. YAY!

Third: The sound. I've had a number of bluetooth headphones over the past three years and nothing beats the sound of these.

These replaced my Beats headphones, RIP. Those were good, but these are exponentially better.

CONS:

Any apps which access the microphone (i.e. Voxer, Phone, etc), will mess with the noise canceling aspect of these headphones to such a degree that it's causing noise problems. The volume, clarity and quality of the person's voice is diminished considerably while the sounds of environmental noise are amplified over the person speaking. I don't know if this is a bug or a fundamental issue with noise canceling bluetooth headphones with a bluetooth microphone in general. Honestly I'd prefer people leave out the microphone when it comes to bluetooth headphones of any kind, it's rarely of good quality and the delay in microphone activation is too late. This is especially the case with Voxer and speech to text apps."
360,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I do think these are worth the price. I commute on the subway and am always surprised at how they block out a lot of the ambient noise. They aren't great at blocking conversation completely, but I love these headphones. The battery lasts very long. I only wish that the charging cable was longer, since it is so short that you can't charge the headphones and wear them at the same time."
361,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using the Bose QC35s for about a week now, I can definitely say they are amazing. I am pretty shocked at how much power, volume, clarity, and noise cancellation they have.

They are very comfortable, and I’m the pickiest headphone user comfort-wise that I’ve ever met. I still need to take breaks from them every couple hours, but that’s better than any other over-the-ear headset I’ve tried

Noise cancellation is on par with the QC25s, battery life is insanely good - 20hrs according to Bose. I haven’t tested it out, but I can say they easily last a full workday with ~60-70% battery left

The pairing is a little weird at first if you’re just trying to use the controls on the headphones…. this is because it can sync to 2 devices actively, and up to 10? total. You can use the headset itself to change sources between the two it’s connected to, and it is a little weird until you understand how it works
It also tries to determine which one to connect to automatically, if only one of the two sources is playing audio

There’s an app you can download to manage all of that, though, and the app works really well. So far I’ve used it on
1. My iMac
2. My Macbook
3. My iPhone
4. My AppleTV
Downside - doesn’t work with XBone since XBone doesn’t support Bluetooth. PS4 it works wired as headphones, not headset.

Has dual external mics to help with noise cancellation as well as an internal mic in the earcup. Voice quality is pretty good, not as good sa dedicated headsets, but better than most phone headsets
It has great range, and surprisingly good bass. They are my best sounding headphones - between these, my Denons, Sennheisers (though these are a high-end gaming headset), and Apple earbuds.

I really dig the wireless as well. I was watching Spider-man (originals) the other night, and was wearing these. Was able to get ready for bed and still listen to the movie very clearly.

I’m really excited to take these camping and try them there, because my Mom and my Brother both snore really bad and I always sleep terrible. The noise cancellation on these help a crap ton. I have a couple people in our small office that use loud mechanical keyboards, and with these on with some low-volume music, I can’t hear their keyboards at all"
362,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are several reasons functions to speak to for these headphones:

1. Wireless (Bluetooth)
2. Sound Quality (output and input)
3. Comfort
4. Noise Cancelation

As far as bluetooth pairing is concerned, it paired very easily between my phone (iphone 6s running latest) and my mac (El Capitan). I have three devices paired to bluetooth on the Mac, and yes, it does stutters when it initially starts. I did find a suggestion to modify the defaults on the BluetoothAudioAgent's minimum bitpool. The headset swaps seamlessly between a phone call on the phone, and audio from the laptop, or even audio from the phone. Note, I don't think it's blended the audio between the two sources, so be aware of which device is active at the moment.

Sound quality seems pretty good. I'm no audiophile, I just like listening to decent sounds, so I'm sure I'll get a ton of flack here. However, at moderate volume levels, you can hear quite a bit of the lows and the highs, and they're not muddy. I'm quite happy with the sound quality, and I'm sure there are many, many reviews from people more qualified than I on this front. Note, technology-wise, this pair of headset does not implement the aptX protocol, so you will not benefit from the higher transmission rate from bluetooth on Android phones, or other devices that support aptX.

These are probably the most comfortable set of headphones I've ever owned. That said, these are also the most expensive set of headphones I've ever owned. The pleather cushions are quite soft, and the top band is also cushioned. It comes in a case, and folds up quite neatly. I think I suggest using the case, instead of throwing the pair into your backpack, or carrying case of choice. The construction seems solid, but they do fold, so there might be weird stresses if you put them in a bag without protection.

Noise cancellation is great. I started wearing them in the office, and immediately I noticed that I did not hear the HVAC system anymore, when I put this on. Everything else seems a lot more muffled, though I do hear a bit of noise when the door closes. I suspect I'm going to need a mirror on my monitor. Sometimes there are people walking by who need me, and have startled me already, when trying to get my attention.

Overall, I'm quite pleased with this pair of headsets. I don't know why it took me so long to take the plunge. Oh yeah, it was being wireless."
363,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for the past 2 months, and used them mainly for studying both with music and without. These are incredible! Sure they may not have the most accurate sound signature, but for the average consumer these will be leaps and bounds better than the majority of other headphones. That being said, I have had the Sony MDR 1000x and the Sennheiser PXC 550 as well. I honestly hated the Sonys, due to the sub par noise cancelling and poor audio quality. The Bose in my opinion sound much better and the noise canceling isn't even close. The Sennheisers had great sound quality but for mostly EDM and Alt-rock that I listen to, I found that I like the Bose better. All in all I found that after a good couple of hours burn in these are far exceeding my expectations. Which I hate, because I hate Bose and beats fanboys."
364,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent noise cancellation, excellent battery life (10 hours or more in a noisy environment). Reasonably good microphone, considering it does not have a boom mike. It would be perfect if it had a removable boom mike. Maybe Bose will engineer one some day, here's hoping.

Sorry, wanted to add that the headphones connect up to two devices at the same time,and can track up to 8 bluetooth pairings. It will also work off of an audio cable but be aware that the headphones use a 2.5 mm plug, so your audio cable must have a 2.5 mm male connector on one end and a 3.5 mm type male connector on the other end, assuming you will be using the headphones with a device with a standard 3.5 mm plug. The headphones come with a short cable but to be practical for use in an airplane for example you need a longer cable (such as the Black 6ft Gold Plated Design 3.5mm Male to 2.5mm Male Car Auxiliary Audio cable Cord headphone connect cable for Apple, Android Smartphone, Tablet and MP3 Player, sold by KetDirect)."
365,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headset for anyone who wants to drown out all background noise when listening to music. I'm making this review for one reason, when I read reviews on this headset, some complained that the noise cancellation could not be turned off while on bluetooth, forcing them to go wired and turn off the headset entirely in order to get around this. However, I looked past it and hoped that it wouldn't bother me, and it didn't. Recently I've updated the app for the headphones and noticed a NEW feature, one that allows you to have the noise cancellation off, Low, or High (while connected to bluetooth as well!). So for everyone worried that they want to use these without noise cancellation, YOU CAN NOW and you should ignore the reviews which complain that you cant."
366,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Whoa. I've had these for a less than a day, and haven't even been on a plane yet -- but so far, the noise-canceling feature is the best I've experienced on any wireless headset. Tuned out four barking dogs AND Fox News and enjoyed myself a morning of Guster and podcasts with no interruptions. Design-wise, clean and simple, a step up from the earlier version, which I also loved but left on a plane (and that version's noise canceling was only so-so). I'm also mildly obsessed with the case, which looks like it was designed to hold a very fat iPad Mini -- roughly the size of a mid-sized paperback. Secret pocket holds the wired interface. Bose put a TON of thought into the design and function of these headphones. They were worth the uber-premium price, especially if you're on planes a lot. I'm going to nerd out and tape my name and address into them (somebody returned my iPad thanks to doing that), because I never want to lose them or buy another pair until they wear out. #allthestars"
367,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The QC35s are amazing! For the record, I was born partially deaf, so my right ear doesn't work for the most part. Left ear pretty good. These are great over the ear headphones. They don't give feedback into my hearing aid in my left ear at all!!!! The sound is ridiculous!!! I paired it simply and easily with my iphone. The app that you can download is ridiculously easy to use, shows battery life, what you're connected to and you can play music from your iphone. Add to this I bought a bluetooth external device for my TV. It paired with that simply and easily. Now I can watch TV with my QC35s on and oh my goodness the sounds others take for granted I am hearing now. And for sports on TV it's like the announcer is in my ear. The sound is so crisp and clear.
I've not done much with the noise cancelling as of yet but I'll add that to the review once I play around with it a bit. Seriously, well worth the coin!!! For me, it is the pairing with my TV that put me into a whole new sound world because of them.
The band Boston, I have their first album on my iphone. The guitar sounds are so pure and crisp."
368,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best thing I purchased in many years. The sound is great. The battery lasts long and the level of noise cancelling is really good. When I flight, I can avoid the loud noise of the engines and have a nice travel and sleep. When I'm walking on the streets, the noise from the cars and people is almost imperceptible.

There are two little things I don't like it: the size could be a little annoying, because you can't hang it in your neck, but it's acceptable because the most of the time they will be in your ears ;-) The other is that, sometimes, they're glitches when you are walking. I guess that is not a problem of the headphones theirselves, considering that this happened on the streets, in some places, but never indoors. Maybe it's some kind of interference, because of the bluetooth, I don't know.

However, I'm really happy with my new headphones. They're wireless, good noise cancelling, good sound and the battery lasts enough for a long day."
369,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Knowing what $350 can buy you in the wired world, you have to be prepared to compromise on sound quality with wireless. These are very close to the best on the market right now for the price (haven't tried the Sony 1000 yet); I think the Sennheisers edge them out. Wireless audio has ways to go before getting to hear the perfect bass and snares like you would on wired sets. I've had high end Grados, own Denon 7000s, owned Bose wired cans before, and listened to wireless JBL, Beats etc for a comparison.

The noise cancelling works very well, which I fully expected with Bose.

I can easily recommend these to others, but I'm not blown away with the sound given current bluetooth audio tech."
370,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had QuietComfort 15 for few years, went though three cords and a set of earmuffs. Time to upgrade to 35. And these are an upgrade indeed.

The set can be paired to several devices. It is good to install their iPhone app if you want to have more than two devices paired to it. Only two devices at the time can be active. The others will be inactive.

The sound quality is good for a non studio set. The noise cancelling as good as on old set. Battery life, after a full charge and a day use on transport and in the office 80% reserve remained. To me that is very good. The set also comes with the cord, when used with the cord the battery life doubles (or so their manual say, I have not tried yet)

The set came charged at 70% and ready to be used out of the box. To charge attach the set to a USB port. To access advanced features install iPhone app. You will be able to disable the annoying voice prompts. Volume, FF, REV, SKIP can be operated from the set. The set is light, inside of the arch is made out of springy steel. Comfortable and feels very nice."
371,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Frankly don't buy this headset if you're going to use in Windows 10. It has constant hissing like a cheap RF wireless set from the 90s. Extremely disappointed with my expensive purchase. When trying to use it for video conferencing it will sometime result in very loud static noise being sent instead of your voice, so terrible for conferencing. And yes I've got it updated to the latest firmware.

The one thing they're good at is cancelling out ambiant sound. But again it just doesn't work well at all when paired to a computer. Must only be good with iPhones..."
372,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The good:

- Incredibly comfortable. These are the first over-ear headphones I've owned that don't hurt after extended wear. Even with glasses on, it feels like I'm not even wearing headphones. Very little pressure applied, but still manages to stay on my head without issue.

- ANC is great. As others have noted, works better on low frequency sounds. Won't block everything -- higher pitched intermittent sounds will still get through (but will be very muffled).

- Battery life as advertised. You could wear these to sleep and still get through the day without charging.

The bad:

- Minor connection issues at times. Walls and things can really interfere with it, but that's pretty normal.

- Had some troubles when connected to multiple devices. Would cause the occasional audio skip if sounds are coming from both devices. Not really a deterrent, just something to keep in mind.

All in all, great purchase. Cost a pretty penny, so budget-minded individuals might want to look into a refurbished one. This won't cut it for audiophiles, but I don't think it gets much better than this when it comes to wireless, noise cancelling headphones. The Sony MDR-1000X is a good alternative if you are willing to swap comfort for better audio, and also comes with some nice features that the QC35s don't offer, but if comfort and noise cancellation is what you're after, you can't go wrong with these."
373,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just bought these off amazon for $350 a week ago. But if you're considering them and the cost isn't to much, I'd say go for it. The noise canceling is amazing and doesn't have that high pitch buzzing noise some noise canceling headphones have, they're extremely comfortable (I'm a bit of a headphone head and these are the most comfortable a pair I own; DT 990 pros, sennheiser hd 598, few others), and the Bluetooth connection is very strong plus it can be paired with multiple devices.

The sound quality I'd say is 6.5/10, it's a very all around noise. Nothing sounds bad, but nothing is particularly blowing you away either. However with the noise canceling ability you get to hear the music undisturbed from your surroundings. Which lets me get more into the song.

Over all, I'd give these headphones a 9/10.
Unbeatable comfort, best noise canceling I've used, solid battery life, good build quality, and decent sound."
374,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I purchased these headphones I was quite nervous. High price point items are always something that I tend to steer away from. I'll try and stay on the lower end of the spectrum as far as listening devices go. I'm not into finding the ""perfect"" headphones/buds, just something that will work and do it's job well. When my old wireless buds got chewed up by the dog, I was back on the market. I tend to only use my headphones/buds at work, which is a highly noisy work environment. With that in mind I started my search for over the ear, noise cancellation headphones. While online I found pairs that had good reviews and around the 50 to 100 dollar price range, but the reviews were always saying how lack luster the noise cancellation is. Then I came across these.

At the 350 price range, I was skeptical. But for the ""supreme"" noise cancellation I kept reading about in the reviews put me on the, ""I need these."" side, so I purchased them. When I did I had no idea they released a new version of the headphones with Google assistant integrated, and that kind of kicking myself BUT I then realized I had a phone where Google assistant was already there and it bothered me less.

At first these seemed GREAT. But then I kept hearing constant cut outs. My phone was right in my face and it'd still happen at times. I went online and download the firmware update, but that still didn't help. I thought these were a lemon, I got really upset that I had spent so much money on a pair of headphones that didn't even work properly. With some more searching online, I found out it was because of the Bluetooth on my phone. I'll tell you how to fix them if you've had this issue:

If you're on a Google Pixel Device uncheck the ""Use high quality audio: ACC"" box in the Bluetooth settings for the device on your phone. After I did this, no more cut outs. My confidence in these were back and in full swing.

Music quality is by far better than any pair I've personally had. Wired and wireless. I've been rocking LG wireless earbuds, so maybe you can see where I came from. Noise cancellation is superb. Although things aren't blocked out completely, they are definitely muffled and way quieter. You feel like you're in your own personal world. It's great, especially within my work environment. My only complaint is that I always feel like my ears have slight pressure on them due to the noise cancellation. This is something that I feel I'll get used to, so I'll update this review if that's the case. The range on these are great. Very similar to other Bluetooth products I've had. I've seen complaints about this, but I don't have that issue. The case the headphones come in is very nice and I use it as the primary way to transport these to and from work. Charging cord is a bit short, and the wired adapter is very thin but has a good length. If you are sitting at a computer with a audio jack, use these wired. The sound quality is a lot richer.

Nevertheless, I'm proud of my purchase. Some flaws, but overall great quality and build."
375,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound. Active noise cancelling. Good mids. good treble. good bass. I'm not an audiophile the best set of headphones I've had are some Samsung headphones that I got recently with a phone purchase. these are light years apart. Very comfortable. controls are easy to grasp. silver pair are perfect.

had issues connecting to my pc. resolved in about 10 minutes cleared Bluetooth memory on headphones and was able to pair with my pc then paired with my phone. perfect can connect to two devices that's why I chose these over Sony. Get these people lol. I have even made some phone calls no complaints at all about my voice quality. good stuff Bose best on the market right now. Now I can stand out at the gym when all these curlbroz use beats that suck."
376,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll keep this brief. I commute to NYC every day for 4 hours a day*5 = 20 Hours of use/Week * 52 Weeks = 43 Days straight of use. The train sounds like you're in the living room. The dsp chip attenuates the low frequency sounds around 100 hz which is exactly what the train produces. I keep my iphone on 1-3 bars of volume and never more. Definitely saved me from hearing loss and blasting my music to mask outside noise. They updated the firmware so now on wireless mode I can keep normal NC, slightly less NC, and none at all like normal wireless headphones.
TLDR: I use these 43 days straight, works great for commuting, give 100% recommendation. Hit me up for any technical questions etc."
377,5.0 out of 5 stars,"FIrst off these are expensive really expensive....BUT I've gotta say I have completely forgotten about the cost since I've had mine. They are just really that awesome. These really do deserve 5 stars, of course they aren't perfect in every sense they are some issues but non of them in my mind overshadow at all the overall package.
First thing I noticed when I took them out the travel box. They're a nice colored jet black that is nice to touch and feels like it's quality and it's got the nice Bose logo. Next thing is the leather or pleather I'm not really sure which, it's super soft, it just makes me want to squish it over and over. After that immediately I see all the controls (Bluetooth on off, volume, play, pause, skip forward, skip backward buttons) it's super straight forward.
Once I put them on there is a nice feeling of pressure, the headphones suction cupping to my head and if I turned on the ANC before I put them on I feel like I'm in my own bubble.
The ANC is pretty good on these, it does do a good job of tuning out background noise it feels pretty awesome to be somewhat isolated from your environment. It's not super audible, you do hear a slight hiss in the back round and a bunch of times I wondered whether it was outside noise or the headphones themselves, turned out to be the headphones. This isn't a drawback apparently it's there on ALL ANC headphones.
Sound quality is great, I'm not an audiophile but I do appreciate good headphones/earbuds. Good bass but not overly apparent like you might get with other headphones like Beats or others I'm not familiar with. The bass is there though make no mistake. I've always wanted good bass headphones and these are a 8.75/10 for me. Overall great sound it's clear with great bass.
Build quality is good all around maybe Bose could improve a bit on the buttons making them feel more ""quality"" with metal or some better plastic especially for the nearly $400 price tag. That goes for the plastics elsewhere also.
Battery life is awesome it takes like an hour to charge them from nearly dead to 100% and then they last a while, I'm not sure if it's Bose's 20 hours but honestly it seems to last long enough that I forget about charging them most of the time.
Things I like:
wireless (the ability to be cordless and walk around is just Great)
Sound/bass
Build quality
ANC
ability to make phone calls (they're sooooo awesome to make phone calls with!)
Great battery

Things I don't like:
I think it's due to the earmuff? Getting worn over time but the seal isn't as good as it originally was and the noise cancellation doesn't seem to work as well as it did. There are a lot of complaints about this online and people say it's due to the firmware but I'm not so convinced and I'm pretty sure it's the earmuffs or pads w/e that wear and lose their loftiness which makes the seal not as good. So just make sure to store them properly it should help with that.
Sometimes the Bluetooth loses connection. When it started it was every minute or 2. If that happens go to your phone w/e clear the device paired list and try repairing. I did it and it worked for some time but then the issue started happening again but less frequently then the first time. I recommend returning and replacing either through Amazon or Bose.

Overall I've had them for a little over 1 month and highly highly recommend them."
378,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was on the fence about getting these since I already own an old pair of Bose headphones (wired) and Bohm wireless headphones with noise cancellation. They were completely worth it, even as an upgrade.

1. Noise Cancellation: The noise cancellation is a huge improvement over my old Bose. Most low ambient sound is blocked before I turn music on. If I play white noise, I can comfortably wear these at night and block my husband's snoring. It's also good for blocking my toddler's bedtime tantrum, when I'm about to cave and get him. Typically he gets loudest right before he falls asleep. If I go tuck him in again it takes another 30 - 40 minutes for him to go to sleep. If I can hold out another 5 minutes he usually falls asleep. The last 5 minutes are rough, but these have helped.

2. Amazing for ADHD / ADD productivity: These have been a huge boost for keeping me on task due to the noise cancellation, easy bluetooth pairing and wireless component. I don't have to stop what I'm doing to mess with pairing, wires, batteries etc.

3. USB charge lasts all day: Easily lasts all day without needing to charge and fast charging time. I like the Bohm pair I have, but I really would only get about 5 hours when they were in use.

4. Bluetooth Pairing: Really easy to put the headphones into pair mode. Downside: If I don't completely remove the headphones from a device's bluetooth list, it will automatically pair with it. So if I had paired to my iPad, laptop and TV and something starts playing music or I turn the headphones on it will automatically pick one of those devices. It sometimes randomly switches to another paired device. Kind of annoying when the kids are watching a movie and it starts playing in my headphones, but it's easy enough to work around. I think the convenience of not having to re-pair every time is greater then the annoyance of needing to un-pair.

5. Bose Connect App allows listening on multiple headsets. I haven't tried this, but that's the claim."
379,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
- Noise cancellation (ANC). In my first 3 weeks of ownership, I've used these things in a variety of settings and they continue to surprise me. From a noisy warehouse floor, to airplanes, to noisy hotel room A/C units, to even mowing the lawn, these things do an exceptional job of filtering out the droning noises you don't want to hear without totally blocking out noises, alarms, and other things you may want to hear. The best part about them is that you can listen to your music at a comfortable level because the headphones block out the surrounding noise so well
- Comfort. If you've never tried a set, find your nearest Bose outlet store and put a pair on your head. You'll be blown away. I've worn these on and off throughout a long day filled with work and travel, and my head never got tired of them
- Weight. Despite the fact that these are wireless ANC headphones (consider the amount of circuitry, batteries, radios, microphones, etc, that that implies) these are still considerably lighter than my Sennheiser HD280s (and more comfortable too)
- Style. Let's face it, these are a great looking set of cans. The controls are very sleek and intuitive also, and there was virtually zero learning curve to get comfortable with them.
- Battery Life. These things handle 10 hours (if not more) of continuous use without breaking a sweat.

Cons:
- No aptX. If you're an audiophile (or just someone who appreciates hi-fidelity sound), you will notice a subtle quality loss from 320kbps MP3. That said, these still sound great over wireless Bluetooth audio. The quality loss is not nearly as noticible as it is in my 2012 Infiniti M37x, so I've trained myself to ignore it. However, if you're really picky about sound and have a sensitive ear, you may opt to use the supplied audio cable while listening to your collection of FLACs

Other comments:
- I've always been a bit skeptical of Bose's quality-to-price ratio but they really hit the nail on the head with these. I've only owned them for a few weeks now and they have already been worth every penny, and I get excited when I think about all the ways I'm going to be able to use these in the coming years"
380,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own Sony MDR-ZX780DC headphones (analog of Sony MDR-ZX770BN) that I bought at Costco for $100. I have decided to do an upgrade to Bose QuiteComfort 35 but at the end decided to return Bose headphones because did not find significant improvements for 3.5 times higher price ($100 vs. $350):
1) Obviously, Bose headphones are more comfortable to wear.
2) Bose provides much better (but not ideal) noise cancellation. However, this feature is not critical to me.
3) I did not find any difference in the sound quality. Honestly saying, I would say that Sony sounds even more naturally than Bose.

So, if noise cancellation feature is not critical to you, and you are not going to use the headphones for 6-8 hours a day, I do not see a good reason to overpay $250 for the same sound quality..."
381,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hesitantly bought these headphones for all the work I prefer to do in public spaces. I am by no means an audiophile, but the music sounds great and the noise cancellation is even better. I can put these on anywhere and the exterior sounds are significantly dulled if not completely removed.

Few things to note:
* Battery life is great. 20 Hours with bluetooth and 35ish without.
* You can actually turn off the noise cancelling through their app
* They DO NOT NEED TO BE ON if you are utilizing an Aux input. You will not have noise cancelling, but they will still work. Great fall back if the battery dies.
* Bluetooth connection is great and I have had zero issue with both my laptop and phone (you can connect two devices at once).

The only complaint I have is the cost and while I am almost ashamed to say I spent $329 on headphones, I absolutely love them and I have zero inclination to return them."
382,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for nearly 10 months, and when they work, they're fine. Unfortunately, they do not always work as they should. Considering they're $350, I would expect their price to match their functionality, but that is unfortunately not the case. It's not uncommon for them to randomly stutter or intermittently cut out. One time it even blasted a shrill screeching tone in my ear — that was pretty unpleasant.

Compounding the issue is that Bose offers no real technical support or path of recourse, which is pretty astounding considering how much these headphones cost. I probably would not buy these again."
383,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to love these headphones! I have been through many lesser variations of wireless headphones as an early adopter of Bluetooth technology. These are my second pair of Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones (forth pair of BT headphones), but after having my previous pair break twice in as many weeks, I decided to upgrade. They do sound great with fantastic battery life, are very comfortable and pair to my droid in under 2 seconds. However, I knocked off two starts for because the wireless connection is extremely susceptible to interference in city environments (automatic doors, etc) and they cut out constantly. I had $100 BT headphones that did not struggle with connectivity in the exact same scenarios. The other thing which is just annoying is that you cannot turn off the noise cancelling. Admittedly, lack of ability to turn off noise cancelling is more annoying to my wife who has to wait for me to pause or remove the headphones before communicating with me (the noise cancelling is that good...not that what my wife is trying to say is noise)."
384,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The main reason why I bought these ears phones is because of the noise cancellation ability which in my opinion is really good. I had compared these against the sennheiser momentum 2 and the noise cancellation on qc35 is better hands down. The battery life too is better than advertised it lasts me close to 27-28 hours on a full charge. There is no loss in noise quality too when compared wirelessly vs wired. The headphones are super comfortable I wear them for 8 hours everyday and my ears never pain nor have I ever felt any discomfort.

However I do have a few complaints. A couple of times when my Bose drained out completely I was not even able to use it even with the wire in. For a second I thought my headphones were spoilt but I charged them and they started working again. I don't know why that is and it was really frustrating (However it does work most of the time I have just had 2 such incidences).

I have the black pair of the Bose qc35 and I don't know wether they have been anodized or what but it is with cheap material. You can see on the pictures below that the color has started to fade a little bit around the Bose logo, note my headphones are barely 6 months old and I have never kept them out the case. I also don't travel with them I have a separate pair of headphones which I travel with, these just sit on my desk. For me this is really frustrating because after spending $350 I would expect premium quality headphones.

The headphones have another software bug. I happen to have a Mac and iPhone and my headphones are connected to both. If my laptop and phone are on the same network on getting a call it rings on both my devices (Mac and iPhone due to apples handoff feature) and the headphones get confused. Worse when I try picking up the call always gets disconnected. I have never been able to receive a phone call when my headphones are connected to both devices I don't know why Bose can't deal with the simple feature of handoff on apple devices.

All in all if you were too buy it mainly for the noise cancellation I would definitely suggest buying this as in my opinion its the best out there currently."
385,3.0 out of 5 stars,Was not impressed with the volume when I first got these but they are bose right. The noise cancelling was phenomenal when I first got these. Comfort awesome. Very flat sound not alot of bass. But had beautiful sound. Well make a long story short bose started with the updates and the noise cancelling went to crap. You can go to their site and look up the noise cancelling issue alot of people returned their headsets because of this. Bose seemed to like to mess with the equalizer when updating too. The last update screwed up the equalizer and it was like the headset had barely any noise cancelling at all. So I ended up sending them back to bose and that was a fight in itself. I bought the new Sony wh1000 and aside from them not being as comfortable as the bose they are better in every other aspect noise cancelling sound.
386,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my Bose QC35. The thing that I noticed as using it is that I cannot use Bluetooth without using Noise Cancelling. On my opinion, this is a major flaw of this headphone.

If you never used Active Noise Cancelling, when you turn it on, you feel a difference like a ""pressure"" inside the headphone. This is very uncomfortable, so in places that I don't need to have ANC, like when I am alone in home without noise, I would use just the BT connection. But this headphone does not allow me to that! Very disappointed!"
387,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used this everyday during my commute to and from work on the public transit bus, and they are wonderful. It let me block out/reduce the noises from the bus, road, and other passengers on the bus. I get to enjoy the content of my audio with minimal distraction caused by external sources. The battery life is great for I tend to charge it up once every ten days and it does not take long to charge up to full capacity. The wireless Bluetooth connection is very stable and consistent when compared to other Bluetooth headphones that will sometime drop in and out. The build quality feels well made and will not break from just a couple drops on the pavement. I'll admit that the volumes on the headphone is not as loud as the other brands like Beats or Sony. The price is a bit pricy, but for the quality and the true noise canceling technology you are getting its worth the investment.

(Update) - It has been a year from the time I've bought this headphones and now its having problem. The problem that I'm encountering is a common problem that a lot of owners seems to have come across. The headphones will self power on even when the power switch is in the off position, and as a result it drains the battery if its left unattended. The physical power switch is not loose and I have updated the headphones to the latest firmware, but the problem still persist. I have contacted BOSE support, but now I'm awaiting for their response. In the mean time I have figured out a temporary work around that drain less power. For the work around you will need the BOSE Connect app installed, so you can configured the headphones automatic shutoff timer and change it to the least amount of standby time before shutting off. Once that is configured just turn the headphones on and do not connect to the headphones, and after the standby time has been reached it will turned off by itself. If you want to turn it back on just slide the switch from the on position to the connect and let go of the switch."
388,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only real complaint I have with these is that the bluetooth range is pathetic!!!!!! If you connect to your phone and go 5 feet away and put a wall between you, you can forget about it. I have a pair of jaybird ear buds that I can go to all 3 floors of my house without issue. So as far as comfort and sound A+ but as far as bluetooth capability goes they just suck! Very disappointing when you consider the price and name behind them."
389,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading all these wonderful reviews, I thought this was a sure bet. They feel amazing on the ears. They sound amazing. The bluetooth connectivity just wasn't solid though. Even with my iPhone sitting right on my desk. Even connected to my computer, sitting right on my desk. I thought it was maybe signal interference, so I tried it at a coffee shop. Same thing. I tried these at the office. No dice.

For me, they just could never get through an entire song without a few ""blips"" of audio cutting out. Which, on noise cancelling headphones as good as these, is really jarring. Bummer!"
390,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Did a bit of research like most before making this purchase. Read through all of the comments and took the leap to get these. Hopefully this helps someone like me out there.

Why I needed these: I work from home in a busy and loud household. Anywhere I go inside my home I can hear the TV from other rooms, the noise from neighborhood landscaping businesses and occasionally the neighbors themselves. I need to focus to get things done and I'm very easily disturbed by any of the previous constant and erratic noises. I figured, noise cancelling headphones would help as I've learned that I can listen to non-lyrical music and maintain focus but the erratic noises listed before continued to pull me out of my work groove. Thus I thought the noise cancelling headphones would be worth a shot.

What I think of them: These were quite simple to pair to my phone that I use to play music. I listen to Amazon Unlimited and have my own growing playlist of non-lyrical music that I listen to. Everything has been great. I read before purchasing that people have experienced their music cutting out. I've had it happen to me a couple times but mainly because I venture away from my phone a bit too far. If it's in my pocket, on my desk or even within about 20ft of me, I don't have any music cutting out. Just 30minutes ago I was pairing them and just happened to drop my folder on the ground, the headset was synced and turned on with no music...It gives me the feeling of being in a quite room at the library. This was nuts to me so I decided to get on here perform this review while I fork over another $350 to get these for my girlfriend who is in PT school. I figured, if I am more efficient and get more work done, that makes me more productive and more able to do things that I want to later on. The price sucks but you are getting what you pay for. Granted I've only had these for about a week, I think I'll swear by them for now. If they turn against me i'll jump on here with an update. Hope this helps you."
391,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received what looked like Bose QC 35 headphones,but after trying them out, I was disappointed. When I tried to register them with Bose, the S/N was not recognized. After some research on the internet, I found out that I had been sold some counterfeit headphones, so I returned them. Did the seller know they sold me fakes? I don't know. Just be aware that there are counterfeit's out there and learn how to know the difference. I did buy some authentic Bose QC35II and love them!"
392,4.0 out of 5 stars,"All things considered, I think these are good headphones. The noise cancelling is an improvement over the QC15s (what I upgraded from), and the sound quality is good overall. Where I disagree with most people, however, is in the area of comfort. While there are no pressure points to speak of that lead to discomfort, I feel the combination of the weight and soft cushions contribute to these headphones fitting somewhat loosely on the head. If I shake my head from side to side, the headphones slop around, and when I lower my head, gravity pulls the headphones down a bit. I wish they fit more securely. I don't have a particularly small head either.

Another minor annoyance with these is that sharp bumps cause the noise cancelling to skip for a split second. I find that if I try and walk around with these on, the effect of my heel impacting the ground causes slight audio disturbances.

I am not sure if I would buy them again as I feel they are a bit overpriced at $350."
393,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these as soon as I heard they were out and I am so glad I did. They are comfortable, the blutooth is quick and easy, and the battery life is solid, and the build feels very high quality. But what sets them apart is their noise cancellation. I have never owned noise cancelling headphones before, so I can't compare to other brands, but I am very impressed with these headphones. The noise cancellation itself will block out almost all low to medium volume ambient noise like air vents, fans, and just everyday noises around the office and home. It doesn't really block out voices or other loud sounds, it just muffles them. However, with a little bit of music, you can't hear anything! It's fantastic. All I have to do at work to not hear a thing my coworkers say is put these guys on and play some background music at low volume. I highly recommend if you are willing to spend the money. You won't regret it."
394,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Convenient in that I'm not getting tangled in cords all the time. However, I am apparently really sensitive to the noise canceling because it makes me feel too much pressure on my ears. Thus, I'm always having to turn it off... which is what leads me to my biggest complaint (fixed in the series II model) - you can't adjust the noise cancelling/turn it off unless you open the app and click a few times. The new series has a button to do just that. Super annoying. I wish Bose would at least make it so that a user could choose what the headphones would automatically default to upon powering on. It always defaults to the high noise-cancelling setting, and I have to open the Bose app to turn it off Every.Single.Time. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't buy these again."
395,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing!!! The sound is great, noise cancelling superb, and comfort out of this world. You can wear them hours on end and not realize you're wearing them. I wear glasses and they are still super comfortable. Me one problem with them is that the cable that it does come with for wired listening is a different size on each end. On the side to plug into the headphones, its 2.5 mm jack and the other side is 3.5mm. Other than that they're great. If you travel a lot like I do, these are for you. While listening to music at a normal volume, it blocks out virtually all noise even people talking. Without music it silences most noises, though you can hear people talking, door slamming etc. this isn't a major detail, but I found this to be pretty important. The case is excellent. The headphones fold into the slim case. It has 2 pockets for your extra cables and chargers and fits very well into a backpack or briefcase. Bottom line. If your thinking about buying them and the price is holding you back, don't let it hold you back!"
396,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The QuitComfort 35 are the best noise cancelling headphones I have ever used. I really enjoy using them in the office as they remove any background noise and can be worn for a long period of time. My only piece of feedback would be that you cannot turn off the noise cancelling, which can be awkward when someone asks you a question. I have to lift the headset as opposed to hitting a button and say ""What?""

They also work well with Dragon Naturally Speaking which is a great benefit."
397,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These head phones are great but there's a lot more room for improvement.

- Overall the sound quality is good as long as you don't push it. It has been mentioned before, I believe, but the bass can get saturated quickly. I'm not a bass lover. I like to get good balance across the range. But the bass is a little weak. If that meant less battery life though I would rather keep it that way.
- The blue tooth isn't perfect. The quality itself works well. But pairing can be a little too much work at times when using across devices. The phone app doesn't always help as it competes with pairing sometime. Though I'd hate not having the app at the same time, which I find useful.
- The noise cancelling is very good. It works very well in the plane. But like a lot of noise canceling headphones I've tried, the high frequencies aren't all that well canceled. Also it does tend to give me a weird air pressure feel in the inner ear. The good news though is that it is mostly a discomfort when not listening to anything, in a relatively quiet room. I got use to it quickly but sometime it feels like your hear are about to pop after a plane decent. And last there is very little white noise when not listening to anything. That's a big plus in my opinion.
- I find the refinement of the design and form development quite nice up-close, but like a lot of Bose products, it's a bit too much on the safe side lacking excitement. I'm sure it's great from a sale perspective (not to offend or repulse anyone), but it does feel you spent all that cash. I which it didn't have that business man look. If it wasn't for the rest, I probably would not have bought something that looks this plain. Also, despite the attempt, plastic is plastic and these feel very plasticky. The good is that they still feel compact on ones ears, which is great.
- I'm obviously at the lower end of head size but I which it had just a little more pressure on my ears to avoid sound leakage. It's worse when wearing eye glasses.
- The battery life is just what's needed. Great job there. And the ability to know how much battery is left with the app is great too.
- I'm not a fan of the voice prompt. Too loud and not very pleasant. I turned it off and find the bip prompt a lot more tuned with listening to music.
- Sound controls are okay, but since I used it on many devices (some allowing adjustment, others not, some letting the main volume to be adjusted, some as a add on) it's not always easy to know if they work with X device. In other words, confusing.

Overall I'm very pleased with the headphones thus far, but I think there is a lot of room for improvement to give it a 5 star rating, and for the cost I would be happier with a little spice to the design. I bet the head designer would have been happy to do that too... loosen up Bose."
398,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife is bed bound, and is usually awake at night watching TV. We had previously used the Brookstone wireless headphones, which were adequate, but had the battery go bad after about a year, and couldn't be replaced. We then tried the Sennheiser wireless, and found that it had a ""roller"" control for the volume and Tone that rubbed against the pillow. This caused the tone to move off signal all the time. So, we bit the bullet, and went with a name we could trust. These puppies are really spendy, but so well worth it. She advised that they are extremely comfortable, not too hot on the ears, and have fabulous sound. They were easy to set up to the Bluetooth feature on both the Samsung UHD TV, as well as the Samsung Home Theater disc player."
399,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I might update the review after more time, but so far Id have to say these are not worth the 350 bucks. The issue is the paring, somethings pair ok others not so much. I own three pairs of the wired QC2 and QC15 Bose headsets (for drowning our crying babies on planes) that I started buying ten to fifteen years ago, plus I own two of the bose aviation headsets, so I always buy bose and respect their products. These seem flaky and seem to be in my mind something that will be updated and a new version available within a year, I'd wait and wish I had."
400,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Note: Read the entire review!

I've had this pair for about a week and I must say that these are some of the best headphones I've tried so far. They're comfy (even with glasses) and perform well. The package that it came in was aesthetically pleasing and easy to unpack. It looks appealing and feels comfortable on your head. Everything about this pair was perfect except for two points: the noise-cancelling and the price.

Now, the noise-cancelling isn't bad by any means. It gets the job done against light background noises. However, I see reviews commenting on how extraordinary it is and tell stories about how they can't hear dogs barking or toilets flushing. This will not block out those sounds. With the pair turned on and my music blasted close to full volume I could still hear traces of a TV on medium volume in the background. The noise-cancelling does do its job when you're in an airplane or studying in a room, but for general use (taking a walk, in a public setting, etc) the feature seems to be mundane. And considering that the noise-cancellation was half the point of this product, it seemed to take away from the value. Bose is definitely a great company and they executed the production of this pair of headphones very well, but it just wasn't up to snuff with both my daily usage and my expectations in relation to the price.

The price was the second portion. I will say that this pair is most certainly a premium pair of headphones. However, I just don't believe that $350 is an accurate price. The material, although aesthetically pleasing, seems rather tenuous and flimsy. I'm a rather strong individual, so I constantly struggle with the feeling that I might break them each time I fold them. Not only that, but the sound quality doesn't seem to meet the standards of $350. In general it sounds very nice and has some hefty volume, but the bass was lackluster. I'm not saying it was bad by any means. I just didn't feel enough punch. My ideal price would have been around $250-275.

One additional small issue I had was latency. It wasn't a consistent issue, but occasionally the headphones would stutter and/or there would be a lag in the playback of the sound. This ties into the price issue in that I don't believe a premium product priced this high should have these kinds of small issues. I do believe I purchased a brand new pair and the package and box didn't appear to be tampered with/damaged in any way.

I will most likely return these, but not because they were sub-par or bad. They don't seem to give me the value I expected from the price tag.

I only gave this product three stars because of the small issues I had with latency. Otherwise, it would have been four stars.

If you have a spare $350 to spend casually, go for this pair! But for me, the price-to-quality ratio just doesn't seem all too worth it."
401,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased these at Target because I was so excited after reading about them that I couldn't wait for shipping. Usually, I don't review things on Amazon unless I purchase from here. These were an exception that I just had to talk about to whoever would listen.

So the thing is, I've been buying headphones left and right trying to find the right ones. I could cover a wall with the headphones I've purchased in the last year, from earbuds to over the ears, wired and wireless. I've spent anywhere from $25 to $300 on them. I've never found one pair that just fits every need and sits comfortably on my head for 5-8 hours (while I work). As soon as I put these on my head, I fell in love. Here's why:

1. Battery life went from average of 5-7 hours to 20 hours, compared to my other wireless.
2. By far the most comfortable I've ever worn.
3. Includes jack for my devices that do not support bluetooth.
4. NO MORE RANGE OR INTERFERENCE ISSUES. This is huge to me. I have a bluetooth keyboard and mouse on my computer, my headphones always cut in and out. These? Not for a moment. I can get up and walk around the room, no more issues.
5. Amazing sound. There's just nothing missing there, I can't find a fault in it.

I'm done shopping. This is the pair. I found the perfect headphones."
402,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used Bose noise canceling headphones since their inception many years ago. I do like these new wireless headphones and have no problems mating my IPhone and IPad to them. I really like the flexibility of wearing these, connected to my IPhone's music library, when cutting the grass at my home. They have significantly cut down the noise generated from my riding lawnmower. All of my Bose headphones have always given me, and when I pass the older versions on to my son, outstanding reliability and service. My son travels extensively around the world and has never complained about a set of Bose headphones letting him down. He may have to replace the cushioned ear pads every few years due to wear and tear but other than that, me and him have nothing but praise for Bose noise cancelling headphones. The only minor gripe is that it would be nice if they included a small wall electrical charger to recharge the battery and a longer USB cord when charging the headphones from a wall charger or computer."
403,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! I've never owned an expensive pair of earphones before but I decided to indulge since my apartment complex is beyond noisy and I can't get anything done and I work from home. I like the over ear headphones because the buds and other types end up hurting eventually and I write 6+ hours a day. Anyway, I put these on and OMG. It's like being underwater. Everything seems very distant and muffled. I swear, I could hear my heart beat and it started to freak me out. No problem connecting this to my iPhone 8+. Very comfortable. I used the headset to talk to people but they hear everything. They think me washing my hands is a tornado. Haha. And, because we can't really hear ourselves, I think our voices are raised. Anyway, I'm definitely going to be using these a lot. So happy I got them so far!"
404,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've clocked up 50,000 miles with these and they are a life-saver for frequent fliers and those who share an office. Somehow, even if you are not sitting a few feet away from a jet engine, these phones can null out ambient sound. Switching them on creates a perceptible lack of sound. But what makes them great for 10 hour + wearing is the over-ear padding and balance. Overall, the lack of noise (think 747 or 737) really helps reduce the stress and strain of air travel.

The headphones come with a case that doubles as a place to stick your passport, wallet and other bits when your on the flight. The wire for plugging into the sound system is very useful and sometimes essential. The only issue I've had once or twice was where the Bluetooth pairing stopped working for some reason. It was fixed by sliding and holding the power switch to zap all the devices from the memory and then re-pairing with them. In terms of battery-life - it's a long time and it's easy to charge from any micro-usb cable (a short one comes in the pack). Now, if like me you're looking at the price and thinking - wow - that's a lot of money - let me help you decide - are you Star Alliance Gold or higher (or similar status)? If yes, buy it. Do you work in a shared office where you need to be able to concentrate? If yes, buy it. Some things cost a lot, but if you use them a lot, the price is not so high relatively speaking. Make your decision."
405,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
*Great sound cancellation
*Looks very sleek
*No technology problems
*Easy to use
*Amazing battery life

Cons:
*Feels unnatural

Unknown:
*Long term quality
*Customer support

Tips:
*If you are not in a public place, this is great to take off your ears, fold the ear pieces up, and listen like a miniature sound system. Very useful when walking around the house and wanting to listen to an audio book.

Summary:
I like this product and am happy I bought it, though I will say using it gives me a head ache. It's simply not a comfortable feeling- not the headphones themselves, but having something cover your ears. To be fair, I'm not sure if this is a product design default, or a limitation on the kind of product this is.

Overall, I'd buy it again."
406,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Oppo PM-3 are my main headphones for home listening pleasure. I wanted to get a pair of headphones that are more travel-friendly. I cannot say enough good things about the QC35 headphones! No, the sound quality isn't as good as my PM-3s, but here's where the QC35 shines:

Comfort: I just traveled from Denver to the UK and these phones were a life saver. I had these on most of my 16 hour travel day. They are very light and very comfortable. Only after about 7 hours did I have to take them off to give my ears a little bit of a break before fatigue kicked in. After about a 10-15 minute break, my ears were good to go for another few hours.

Sound: These aren't going to be the absolute best in terms of sound quality, but that's not why you buy these headphones. Don't get me wrong, though. They sound very good for my purpose which is mainly for when I'm traveling. I'm in my 40s and i don't like a lot of bass. What I really do like about the sound is how neutral sounding they are. I was also impressed with the sound stage. It was better than what I was expecting - a bit wider.

Performance: Ok now this is where these shine! The active noise cancelling is just insane! On the plane, I couldn't believe how well these cancelled out the sounds of the jets from the plane and especially the ambient noise in the cabin. You don't even necessarily need to be listening to anything for these to be effective, but if you are listening to anything, the ANC will allow you to focus on what you are listening to and removes any audio distractions outside of the headphones.

Bottom line: These are THE absolute best headphones for traveling. Very comfortable and light weight. The Active Noise Cancelling is just incredible! You will be blown away by how well these perform."
407,2.0 out of 5 stars,"You can't beat the noise cancelling. And very comfortable - can wear for hours. Bluetooth works reliably. Only issue is when multiple devices have been linked, it tries to say them all to you when powering on. It sounds like this when you power up ""Battery at 100%. Connected to Matt's Ipad and Zeni..."" it is like they only allow 3 seconds for it to talk, and if it can't get it all out, it just cuts it off. Whatever. It does the important stuff well. I also use it for phone calls. Only issue is, it does pick up nearby noise. Probably because it doesn't have a microphone that can be positioned in front of your mouth. So if two dudes are yappin in the office next to me, the people on the other end can hear it. Hey Bose - put an external mic on this will ya?!?"
408,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I seem to have lost my previous review part way..... I love these, been waiting for years for Bose Wireless Noise Cancelling! But the fit isn't working? I can only get a seal around my ear if I put them over a basecall cap. They are so loose they fall off if I tilt backwards or forwards to tie a shoe or lay back :(

I will try to reach Bose again to see if they have a suggestion for better fit, I am an adult woman with a normal sized head so I am pretty surprised to have this issue.

The sound is great once you can seal out the exterior noise, I could use them a bit louder but overall, phew finally something good :)"
409,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was initially hesitant to spend this much on a pair of headphones, but since I received them I've been using them almost every day. They work well enough with my computer that I actually put my desktop speakers in the closet to free up space because I felt I didn't need them anymore. I also use them in combination with a cheap audio cable adapter with boom mic when playing Xbox One and they've been great for that too. At work I use them to listen to music from my phone, so these headphones are pretty much always with me now.

Normally I get tired of wearing a headset pretty fast, but these headphones are surprisingly lightweight. I've been able to leave them on for hours at a time without feeling like I need to take them off. That's a huge plus for me. After 3-4 of using them the battery still seems to be at 80 or 90% also, so I doubt I'll ever have them run out of power on me unless I just forget to charge them for days at a time. If they did run out of power, they work fine when powered off and plugged in with a regular cable (which it comes with). I've used them that way on my handheld game systems that don't support Bluetooth.

The active noise cancelling works well. When powered on with music playing at a reasonable level it worked well enough to mostly cancel out a phone conversation that was happening right behind me at the office. In between songs I could just hear it faintly. It actually surprised me how much ambient noise there was at the office (like the drone of air conditioning units) that I didn't notice before, which suddenly sounds really loud after you take these headphones off. The relative silence is great for productivity. I haven't used it on a plane yet but I imagine it would be great for that also. So far everyone around me has said they couldn't hear my music leaking out either, even when I have it turned up.

I'm no audiophile so I can't say how perfect the sound quality is, but for me it sounds pretty good. There's a decent amount of bass, but it isn't overpowering. They are better than any of the cheaper headphones I've had in the past by far, which is all I have to compare them to.

I had some trouble getting them to pair with my computer at first (Windows 10) after I'd already paired them with my phone, but after temporarily disconnecting them from the phone they paired with the computer fine. Now it pairs with both automatically without any problems. The computer was originally seeing it as a Bluetooth device but not a headset, so after pairing I couldn't set it as a sound output device until I disconnected my phone first. A little glitchy at first but all is well now.

It's also worth noting that if you want to use them to watch movies or tv, I've noticed a very slight delay in the sound. It's slight enough that I can ignore it but it may bother some people. I don't notice it at all when gaming, and for music it obviously doesn't matter."
410,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, the bass is not as thunderous as I'd wish, but in terms of noise cancellation and ergonomic/comfort for travel, you can't beat these. I've purchased 3 so far (I lost one at the airport, grrr), and bought another one for a traveling companion on a flight to Tokyo. While I bought 2 black versions and the silver one -- the black version mars/scuffs very easily (revealing white), however. I knew this since the first one I bought (which I lost at the airport) and the second black one also quite easily marred/scratched, but I really can't wear the silver one at the office. If you don't need to appear for mundane and boring, I would go with the silver one. *** I'm a Mac user and this has no problems connecting to a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, or iPhone -- but this will absolutely NOT connect to a Kindle Fire (I had to get one as it was ridiculously cheap)."
411,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my, oh my, these are the real deal. When I finally clicked the checkout button I was anxious. That's a lot of money. They arrive fully charged. They feel good. I put them on and turn then on, pre-connecting to Bluetooth so pre-music and wonder if my power just went out. Did the aircon on the fan just turn off? What happened? I take them off and the familiar drone of moving air and outside noises resume. This is noise cancellation at its very best.

I pair and turn on the music and the audio is superb. I decide to push it further and play Streets Of Philadelphia by Springsteen to see how the bass is. It's lovely. It's rich. It's smooth. I am extremely impressed. I worried that I was paying for the brand but I was wrong. I paid for the best. These headphones are the bees knees.

Flight on Sunday. I'm excited to report back on how they cope with aircraft grade noise!"
412,5.0 out of 5 stars,"By far the best headphones I have ever owned. Battery life exceeds what the specs state, absolutely amazing sound quality and noise cancellation, and they are extremely comfortable. I've always known Bose has some of the best high end sound equipment, but this exceeded my expectations. In addition, they have the best Bluetooth technology I have ever worked with. If my Bluetooth is turned on for my phone, the second I turn the headphones on and put the switch on for Bluetooth, the headphones instantly pair with my phone. I have never had a Bluetooth device connect so flawlessly and effortlessly. Also, these are amazing for making phone calls. I rarely talk on my phone without them now! No one will ever say that they can't hear you while using them. I would recommend these headphones to EVERYONE. Also, the headphones are very sleek looking with very close attention to detail. Even the ear cups are made out of metal (I would assume aluminum but possible some other metal). They are very simplistic to use and very versatile. I can now focus on my work and cut out the distractions. I am always more efficient while using them. Also a great way to calm down if you are stressed out or feeling anxious. It puts you in your own little world where you can calm down and center yourself. I would give these a 10/5 if I could!"
413,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been looking for a good pair of wireless noise cancelling headphones for many years. I tried several brands, but I was never happy with them. I kept going back to my Bose QC-15 wired headphones. Thus, when I saw the QC-35's I was skeptical. However, I decided to try them, and now they are my favorite headphones.

Pros:
• They sound almost as good as the QC-15's
• They are almost as comfortable as the QC-15's
• Battery lasts for a long time
• Excellent voice feedback is given regarding pairing, and remaining battery
• The case is convenient and well made
• Pairs with multiple devices
• Pairing is quick and easy
• Controls are easy to understand
• Works great with my iPhone 6S, and two of my MacBook Pros
• The construction quality is great

Cons:
• There was one time when I had to unpair the headphones and re-pair them before they would work. I'm not sure what caused that, but it seemed to be a one-time glitch.

In short, if you like the QC-15's, but want to go wireless, then give these a try. I think you'll like them. I slightly prefer the sound quality and comfort of the QC-15's. However, after spending a few weeks with the QC-35's, I will never go back to the QC-15's. I'm hooked on wireless. Thank you for an excellent product Bose!"
414,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things actually cancel noise really well. It's really easy to pair with my devices (I use it on my Android phone and iPhone, as well as my MacBook) and they fit comfortably. The battery lasts a while and the voice prompts actually help.

I will say the sound quality is okay, I expected them to be better from $350 headphones, but I guess they make up for it in sound isolation and noise cancelling. I wish there was an option on the app to set EQ settings or amplify the sound--it can be on the quiet side sometimes.

They're not the most stylish things in the world, and they don't seem durable enough for the gym, especially with all the sweat. I mainly use it at my office and traveling on planes or trains.

Overall, I'd give it more of a 4.5, but these are amazing headphones and I don't regret purchasing them."
415,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a long time Bose customer; I've owned quite a few of their products stemming back to some of their first home audio components (handed down to me after a number of years), to the original QC, to car audio, and most recently with the QC 25 (for iOS). I was very excited to hear about Bose's plans to move their staple QCs to the wireless realm but didn't jump on them right out of the gates. I'll break my review down in parts: price, audio quality, Bluetooth/battery life, and appearance/build quality.

I'm sorry I waited. These headphones may be the best product Bose has ever put out.

At the price point, they're not completely out of range or overtly expensive for the sake of being expensive. I got that feeling with Parrot Ziks (among my other wireless considerations) and I just didn't get the same feeling with the Senheisers. The Senheisers are VERY good headphones and once I discovered the Ziks were garbage on battery, it took me a few more demos to really decide on the Bose. I ended up selling my QC 25s to a friend so I was able to offset the price a bit but I'd have been perfectly willing to pay full price. It used to be that Bose just carried a big price with little to show. Now they put out quality products with absolutely impeccable customer service. I've had the best experiences in-store, online, and over the phone. Bose's customer service is without question one of the main reasons I stick with them.

I'm no audiophile but I do appreciate quality sound and can tell the difference between cheap cans and better quality ones. I've owned and been very pleased with my QC 25. The sound quality between the two is very close if not exactly the same. The QC 35 may have slightly better noise cancelling at least in the few flights I've taken since my purchase but even then, the differences aren't noticeable unless you try both pairs back to back a few times in the same environment. THESE ARE NOT BEATS (thanks goodness) SO DON'T EXPECT TO BLOW YOUR DRUMS OUT WITH BASS. That said, the bass notes give a oddly satisfying yet barely noticeably tremble when at full volume; not a vibration, mind you. Rather a quality, powerful bass that doesn't drown lyrics, instruments, or other nuances of the song(s). In fact, I've even heard things in songs I'd never heard before which it brings a whole new dynamic to the music listening experience.

Bluetooth is obviously the reason you're interested in these headphones; at least one of the leading factors in most cases (I assume). The short assessment is: the Bluetooth range is fantastic. I can sync up to whatever device I want and roam between my office, kitchen, TV room, living room, and even to my back patio. I have yet to hear a single skip or break in connection even when pairing with multiple devices. I've paired mine with iPads (2, 3, Air, Pro), iPhones (6, 6s, 6 Plus, and 7), and my Apple TV (4th gen). If you have an Apple TV, do yourself a favor and watch your favorite show with the headphones on. You'll never be the same. The battery life is exceptional. I was able to use them on a flight from CA to NY and back (w/ limited use during the weekend) without them dying. It helps that there's a little reminder of where your battery is at every time you power them on. Charging is simple enough but make sure you rest them in the case or at least on a non-abrasive surface; more on that later.

I have the black colorway and am very happy. I considered silver but it just didn't suit my style. As far as I've seen, however, the silver set is pretty understated which I like. I've noticed myself wiping the face of each can more often than I expected. Fingerprints tend to show up pretty easily if you have even slightly oily/dirty hands so I try to make sure and wash them before I put the headphones on. I haven't scratched mine (yet) but I still do my best to keep them in the case whenever I'm not using them. I'm not about to test my theory, but I have a feeling the can face scuff pretty easily so be careful when setting them down. These headphones are VERY solid. They feel good in the case, in your hands, and on your head. The top band doesn't feel too heavy and doesn't stick to my hair. The ear pads feel like they were made for my ears/head and mine alone. They're literally the most comfortable thing I've ever put on my head. No question. Warm beanies and hats are fine but these feel incredibly soft on my head. The case is the same as the QC 25 for the most part; if I remember correctly the inner pocket had a horizontal seam while the new one has a diagonal seam going down from right to left. It easily fits the small cables that are included.

All in all these are the best headphones I've ever had. I'm not an audiophile, a DJ, or music snob. I like my music to sound good and the QC 35 accomplishes that and does so in far better fashion with far more functionality than I expected. Well done, Bose. Well done."
416,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Outstanding sound quality and noise cancelling! It's very worth the money. Initially I hesitated to spend a fortune to buy this Bose QC35 headphone as there are many ~$100 headphones out there that seem to offer similar features on spec. But I decided to give it a try after studying many reviews. After I get this headphone, I like it more and more as I use it. The build quality of Bose QC35 is certainly great but what makes it really stand out is its ""software"", the design and patents that make noise cancelling so effective and yet present excellent sound quality! The noise cancelling works so well and so smoothly that I didn't even realize that it's working until I took off the headphone and hear the surrounding noise and conversation. The bass of this headphone is not as strong as my previous cheaper headphone -- but don't be confused with sound quality and heavy bass. I must say the perceived sound quality is way much better. Less optimal headphones may mask noise by cranking up volume and bass, which would distort sound quality and hurt your hearing in the long run. But this Bose headphone works by smart design and algorithms. Anyway, highly recommend from an ordinary user."
417,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated: Previous review didn't factor in wired, active listening

Rating: 4.5 Stars (rounded down). There are several nit pick issues that prevent me from giving this a full 5-star review. Headphones are near perfect for my needs, but considering the price point -- I rounded down my star rating. This is based on using them for about two months (with three weeks of family vacation travel).

TL;DR (Summary):
Bose QC 35 are the best wireless noise canceling headphones I have personally tested and own, and so if that is your main need -- stop reading this review and buy the headphones. If you want to know why, keep reading.

Of course, a lot more stuff including podcasts and audio books

For audio quality comparisons, I use my ATH-M50x (~$150). I really wanted something in the same sound quality range but with smart phone integration, Bluetooth wireless ability but still with a wired option, and with excellent noise cancellation ability -- and they had to be comfortable for extended wearing sessions (think cross-country flight). I had a pair of Plantronics BlackBeat Pros (~$170) that someone stole when left in my car. The Plantronics were more functional with better controls, but the sound quality wasn't nearly a good and the noise cancellation was only acceptable -- they (Plantronics) were also a lot bigger and heavier (not as mobile/travel friendly).

The best settings (highest audio quality and most stable connection) is wired with the headphones turned on (with ANC enabled) -- seems a bit odd actually since ANC does degrade audio quality. Wired and powered, the Bose are on par with my ATH-M50x headphones with sound quality. This hasn't been true of other Bose models (to me) and I've often felt like Bose were overpriced compared to the audio quality delivered (granted, not nearly as bad as Beats or similar ""pop culture"" headphones). I find it strange that Bose refers to the audio cable as a ""backup"" since that might be my preferred way to listen when I'm not traveling. Seems like a missed opportunity. This is my favorite listening mode. Bose claims 40 hours of listening in this mode.

I do like the ability to optionally enable/disable ANC while wired. However, when you power off the headphones, while they do continue to work, the soundstage is greatly and negatively affected (especially bass). That means power does more than just power wireless and noise cancellation -- but also powers the headphones internal amplifier and EQ. In wired, powered off mode the highs and mids are still fine but bass is practically non-existent. This mode is good for podcasts or other voice performances and non-bass-heavy music (bluegrass, classical, etc). It is nice you can continue listening after your battery dies -- which makes up the lack of replaceable batteries. I wish there was a way to disable ANC and Wireless with the headphones powered on to see if that would yield even better sound performance.

Bluetooth audio is, at best, a compromise (lower sound quality for convenience and freedom). No matter how awesome the headphones, the limiting factor is normally Bluetooth. I've also had some connection reliability issues (like others) -- a bit of skipping or studdering. Rarely, the connection drops off entirely. This is both a problem of BT wireless in general and Bose, but other BT headphones I have seem more reliable. Sound quality with ANC and Wireless mode is surprising good considering both technologies actually work against sound quality. Yes, sound quality isn't nearly as good as the wired mode or my ATH-M50x -- but that's the trade off (which is great when you need it).

Noise cancellation is far better than anything I have ever tested. If I remember correctly, even besting the QC 15 I demoed in a big-box store. With ANC enabled, there is a slight feeling of pressure (like taking off in an airplane) but you soon get used to it. It's hard to tell the exact impact of ANC regarding sound quality since I don't think you can disable ANC without powering off the headphones entirely. With ANC enabled, it counters most constant background noises like in-flight airplane noise, air conditioning hum, and similar noises. ANC is less effective with non-constant noises like voices (office chatter), but the Bose QC 35 does a respectable job even under those circumstances (better than just passive isolation).

Headphones are very comfortable and lightweight. I had no problems listening to them the majority of multi-hour flights across the country, at the office, or doing chores. They might be heavier than previous QC headphones, but compared to other over-the-ear wireless and ANC headphones -- I thought they were very light. The headphones fold up very compactly and fit nicely in the included protective hard-shell case (the bag has pouches for the charging and audio cables).

To be honest, the weakest part of the headphones is the BT headset phone integration. Perhaps I don't know how to operate it (I'm a tech geek), but I've had mixed results so far. Sometimes the headphones pick up a call and sometimes not. This (along with other nit picks) is the main reason for a 1-star reduction or, at least, rounding down from 4.5 to 4 stars. At this price point, I expect better. Perhaps this can be addressed with a firmware update or better user manual.

Battery life has been excellent. Bose claims 20 hours in wireless and ANC mode and 40 hours in powered (with ANC) wired mode. While that is enough most of the time, I do carry a $25 charger battery pack which negates the lack of replaceable batteries -- I've never gotten 20 hours of service from a pair AAs. And, the headphones still work powered off (reduced sound quality).

My main complaints:
1. Wireless connection more unreliable than competition (Plantronics)
2. Controls a bit too subtle, requires a few seconds to find them (vs Plantronics)
3. No active mode without wireless and ANC (possible superior sound?)
4. Included audio cable is flimsy and does not have device controls on it -- Bose thinks it's just a backup ::sigh::
5. Hit or miss with phone integration (as a BT headset)
6. User manual is anemic, I found most stuff just playing around and perhaps several undocumented features

You can easily pay less for similar or better sounding headphones. The same is true for high quality wireless headphones or those with exceptional active noise cancellation (even from Bose). However, the Bose QC 35 is one of the few headphones that puts it all together in a single package for those willing to pay for it.

I got these when they were first released and paid full retail for them. I normally don't fall for the ""big brand"" marketing since you often pay more than half for marketing hype and brand awareness. However, Bose is known for noise cancellation with no close seconds. So, I paid dearly and Bose delivered. They have become my favorite headphones."
418,5.0 out of 5 stars,"""New"" on Amazon may not be ""New"": I had ordered a new Bose QC35 directly from Amazon. It came on time, but the actual headset packaging was opened, clearly used, and damaged. I have placed a return order immediately and will be buying physically as I cannot trust that Amazon will sell an actual new headset in the future.

I tried the Bose QC35 at an airport shop and liked the sound quality. The headphones were fairly lightweight, drowned out sound, and comfortable. While they may not be worth the full price, I have definitely seen headphones that were slightly cheaper yet vastly worse in quality. 4/5; while Bose does well in the areas of sound, comfort, and build, they are the not the ""best"" in any of them."
419,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All I can say is wow !! Let me give full disclosure by saying I am a Bose lover and have several of their headphones, ear buds and radio's. I have their products because they sound good and they have great customer service. The Quietcomfort 35's did not disappoint, they sound great and they eliminate outside noise. They work so good I would not recommend you wear them if you need to be aware of your surroundings. The sound is rich and the old saying ""Bose, no highs or lows"" does not apply here.. The sound rivals some very expensive headphones I have, almost as good, they just miss by a tad. The thing that separates them from the rest is the ability to block out outside noise. These use sophisticated electronics to eliminate outside ambient noise and block out sound they do. Just a great product that does what they say it will."
420,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have both the QC20 and this one. They are both fantastic and do the job amazingly well. QC20 form factor allows you to sleep with it on a bed and with a neck pillow on the plan. QC35 is great for the wireless feature with a wire option for use on an airplane.

Note that there is no way to have bluetooth and Active Noise Canceling (ANC) off. If you use wireless, ANC will have to be on as well. The only way to use the headphones without ANC is to plug it in via the wire."
421,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Best $$ I've ever spent, it's lightweight, sound quality is amazing, everything is intensely clear. Only thing I wish is more bass and volume, (don't get me wrong its got great quality bass that allows you to also hear the voice of the ) I like to listen to my music till my ears ring sometimes, especially for that last push on the treadmill and this headphone doesn't take it there, which is probably for the best. But if I had to buy new ones I'd buy these all over again. Totally worth the money...
another wish is that the spongy part around the ear didn't absorb so much sweat, there are tiny holes in the fabric that covers the ear that allows sweat to be absorbed, after a while that sponge in there gets soaked, I clean that now right after workouts by using a cleansing wipe, but in the future maybe that is something that can be improved on, still think its worth the purchase"
422,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise cancellation on these is a life-saver in an open-seating office. Works great, even without music playing.

That said, for the price, I wish the frequency response and general sound quality was better. I get that they have to make some trade-offs to get noise cancellation to work, but compared to my Sennheiser or Audio Technica headphones, the quality is really pretty lackluster."
423,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound isn't all that exciting. The sound profile is neither reference nor dynamic, just kind of adequate. Where the QB 35's make up ground is in noise canceling quality, style, usability, comfort, build quality.They've become part of my everyday carry on my daily NYC subway commute and they are great on planes as well.

I tend to charge mine at work, but I also used them on a flight from New York to Portugal (about 5-7 hours of actual use) and they still had plenty of power (I believe around 60 percent or so).

The only real critique I have about them is the sound quality, but I think the pros far outweigh the cons."
424,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always considered Bose overhyped and overpriced. However, I've recently started using the QC 35 and a pair of QC 25 (wired version) at work and I have to say the noise canceling capabilities are nothing short of amazing. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't really say much about how the sound quality compares to other headphones, but they do sound very good and with the noise cancellation, I can have the volume at a reasonable level and enjoy what I'm listening to so much more.

Even now, I'd say this are a splurge item, but if you can afford them, they are definitely worth the $$!"
425,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall super...But these 3 little things prevent a 5.
BAD/POOR:
Annoying auto turn off if you are using them and not connected or not using sound.
no battery replacement [ i took a 3 yr warranty to protect against battery fail]
no noise cancelling while charging.
GOOD/AWESOME
excellent noise cancelling.
nice balanced sound
more comfortable than the 25's.
great app for your devices.
long battery life [ i just did round trip to Tel Aviv ] - the battery got to 70% Austin-Madrid ! I topped up and did not recharge until I got home.
FAST RECHARGE! 10-15 minutes for 20-30% charge.
I believe the phone/mic works ok, I did however only use it once and failed to press right button 2nd time so not 100% it is sgood for the end user as I dont have lot of experience with it."
426,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these since I like listening to music while I'm at the gym, and for breaks at work to watch shows on my phone.

I haven't had the chance to use it at work, but at the gym holy cow. Several people near me on the tread mill and someone 30-40ft away dead lifting and I felt like I was in a sound proof booth.

Also, it works great to call people. I didn't know I could use it as a head set to talk on the phone. Everyone I've talked to using them so far has had no complaints of back ground noise it could pick up."
427,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They aren't my favorite music phones but the noise cancellation is extremely effective and the sound quality is very good. No problems with Bluetooth pairing - there are voice prompts. Although I can't usually wear large, over-the-ear headphones for long periods of time, these are surprisingly comfortable. They are expensive so I sure hope they last a long time! If the don't, I'll revisit this review. So far, so good!"
428,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not tech savvy AT ALL, but loved my wired Bose headphones and wanted my next pair to be wireless. They give you a really short 6"" maybe charging cable, and no block. I used a block I had, and charged them. It tooklessthan an hour for a full charge out of the box. There is a yellow light that blinks when charging and turns green when fully charged. I downloaded the Bose app, and followed the directions to pair the Bluetooth to my iPhone. Then you turn them on and they tell you in a female voice the percent of battery charge and which device it is paired with. On the side of the headphones is a volume up/ play pause/ and volume down. There is a wire you can use if you want to connect to something without Bluetooth. The noise-cancelling is superior with Bose. These work great, even on loud planes. The sound quality is awesome. I amvery pleased with them."
429,1.0 out of 5 stars,Due to the price I was very skeptical about investing so much money on this but I'm blown away at the noise cancelling ability. After unboxing I turned it on and put them on and WOW! I never realized the existence of a low hum of an a/c fan in my office because it cancelled it out completely. I'm totally sold on this product. It's very comfortable and the travel case is a very nice bonus. Highly recommended!
430,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
#1 Incredibly comfortable. I wear them all day without getting sweaty-ear. Also reasonably light; a measure better than any high-end headphone I've used.
#2 Delivers great audio range
#3 Easily allows multiple concurrent device connections, although two devices won't feed sound at the same instant.
#4 Excellent battery life
#5 Very good for conference calls when only one device is configured

Cons:
#1 $350 and there's no Windows app??
#2 Bluetooth cuts out on Skype calls because two different drivers are installed, and by default communications device and output device use different drivers. See Con #1
#3 No EQ. See #1
#4 You can't charge via the mini-USB port while using bluetooth connectivity. Really Bose?

Summary - The sound quality is not $350 better than a $30 pair of Sony wired headphones, but if you're highly mobile then they're hard to beat for comfort, durability, and design."
431,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product at a great price! Oh wait...the price is CRAZY....but...I was able to rest comfortably on a plane trip to New Zealand for a combined 36 hours in the air....well worth the price. I would not fly again without them.
432,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ride a public transport train which often screeches on the rails and these drown out the sound so much it's like I am in my own little bubble. Sound quality is decent enough for the streaming services I use and it works well paring with multiple devices. I can listen to music on my laptop and if a call comes in on my phone, it knows to switch over.

A few notes I have about them: each time it connects to a device, it will tell you, interrupting your music if it was already connected to one device, slightly annoying but a real minor issue. In windy environments you can get a bit of amplified wind in the headset. Nothing too loud or overpowering, but it is noticeable.

Overall these have transformed my commute. It's amazing how loud ambient environments are when turning these off after using them for a few hours. In the office it is the same story, the loud AC just fades away 100% when these are on."
433,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first set of noise canceling headphones that have not given me a terrible headache (including previous Bose QC models). Not sure what they did this time to get the noise cancelling right, but these are really really good. They are a little heavier than the other non-wireless QC models, but if you've never had the others--you'll never know. The only reason this gets 4 stars and not 5 is the mic is very subpar and there's no in-line mic on the analog connector. I wanted to use this for business calls via Skype/GoToMeeting, but the mic quality is not adequate for those professional environments.

One last folly is the bass response. If you like listening to well balance music and don't ascribe to the over-bass heavy theme of pop music--you'll never know or care that these headphones don't have the deepest bass. If you want thumping bass--these are not the headphones for you. The bass does distort when bumped up with an EQ. But as a audiophile--can appreciate these for what they are--a great noise-canceling bluetooth headset. These are not studio monitors."
434,4.0 out of 5 stars,"You can argue and have both issues and praise for these or any other headphones. If you are a Bose fan already then you get the quality and ANC standards you already love. If you are not a fan then yes you can overdrive these by trying to play your music as loud as you can and cause hearing loss. My point is these are great for those who love classical music, rock, and pop. If you are going for base or a studio sound then yes of course other headphones have the perfect concert sound. You buy these types of headphones for the noise cancellation first and sound second. These are the best sounding headphones I have heard from Bose however but I am not listening to the overly base heavy songs. For the price you can get DJ level headphones and have the perfect sound but no ANC. My point here is you can what if this to death. The main selling point here is wireless and save your money even $50 and go with the QC25 if wireless is not important to you. When I am on the plane I turn off the music and just use them to sleep so wireless is nice. These are the perfect in noise canceling given the current state of technology. Again if you want perfect base, tremble and the like then getting headphones that manipulate the sound the Bose way are not for you. Every headphone has a way of manipulating the sound and for pure sound many other companies do it purer but and again finally depends on what kind of music you listen to."
435,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely comfortable and the app works fairly well. I like that you can pair it with multiple devices simultaneously and the app meshes with spotify for going forward/backward. I use it for studying, music in busy settings as well as for 1-2 flights a month. Battery life has been phenomenal, and I've only had to charge it twice since purchasing it. It lasts for well over 10-14 hours (though admittedly, I don't have a way to measure the usage accurately). Phone calls aren't the worst, I've been able to walk my dog in fairly windy conditions and the other end appears to be able to comprehend what I'm saying. It works perfectly for phone calls in calmer/quiet conditions, I can leave my phone to charge and walk 25-30 feet away without losing signal.

I formerly owned the QC15s, and these are formidable replacements. Hopefully they last 8 years like my previous pair did. I'm also hoping that the battery is affordable to replace when it does in fact reach the end of its rechargeable lifespan, which is likely the only complaint I'll have if the headset fails to survive 4+ years."
436,5.0 out of 5 stars,"QC35 -vs- MDR1000X

+PACKAGING - SONY - (Obviously not particularly important, but if you're giving them as a gift...) Bose's packaging is tight and simple, I like it, but Sony's had a lot more thought put into it and creates the feeling you're opening something grand.

+ILLUSION OF QUALITY - SONY - The look and feel is far superior to the Bose as far as out of the package handling.

+CASE - SONY - While I really like the Bose case (especially the nifty little fabric tag which shows how the headphones fold into the case), they came with a bunch of little disposable foam pieces to protect them. Once those pieces are removed I can hear the ear cups shift against one another from time to time. The Sony case has an integrated fuzzy divider to prevent the ear cups from touching. (It also has a diagram for folding, but not as cool as the Bose diagram.)

+BLUETOOTH - BOSE - Both connect equally quick and effortless, but Bose allows you to connect to two devices.

+VOICE PROMPT - SONY - You may disagree, but I found the Bose voice prompts to be super cheesy. They do not sound like a $350 dollar pair of headphones. My $20 Plantronics earpiece as a much cleaner sounding voice prompt. Sony's sounds fantastic, but by necessity the Bose [try] to tell you specifically which device has been connected/disconnected. (I say ""try"" because it couldn't pronounce my device name.)

+ CONTROLS - SONY - Hands down Sony takes this. The touch controls on the ear cup rock. They're intuitive and work perfectly. Swipe forward/back to skip tracks or up/down to adjust volume. Tap to pause/play. The NFS is nice too. Tap or swipe your phone on the ear cup and it connects, then tap the ear cup with your finger to begin play of last track you were listening to. With my ZenFone I don't even need to unlock my phone for this.

Although I do prefer Bose's physical toggle switch for Power. I don't care for holding down and waiting for the Sony to turn on. And while the Bose phone app allows you to set timers if you plan to sleep w/ them on, I prefer the Sony auto shut-off after a few moments of no longer receiving a signal, especially as someone who is likely to set them down without turning them off.

+BATTERY LIFE - SONY - The Sony definitely keep going beyond what I'd expected. The Bose were pretty much what I'd expected, very good play time, but not quite as much.

+NOISE CANCELLATION - TIE - I know most believe the Bose to have better noise cancellation and at first I was inclined to agree, but after submersing myself in a degree of different environments I found they each seem to have strength over the other with certain tones. MAYBE the bose are a little better for a livingroom full of ""normal"" activity. Machine noise seemed to be a little less obvious with the Sony, but again it's so close it doesn't even matter.

+PHONE CALLS - TIE - No obvious advantage for me. Both are fine and far superior to most other products on the market.

+COMFORT - BOSE - NOTHING IS AS COMFORTABLE AS THESE. These are by far the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. They're lighter, the ""leather"" is softer, and they're not quite as snug on the head, but they don't slip.

+SOUND - SONY - More than half the music I listen to sounds significantly better through the Sony. The Bose sound great and are especially good at making some poor quality recordings sound pretty good, but ultimately the Sony sound more like studio headphones, true to sound. The Bose seem to excel with Bluegrass, Country, Classical, anything where a lot of midrange can be appreciated, but can really overwhelm some music such as Punk or Hardcore with too much of said midrange. That said, The Sony really deliver across the board. If you're listening to Hip Hop or Drum and Bass, you want the Sony. And just because the Bose seem to excel with Bluegrass and Classical, I'm not saying the sound quality is necessarily better than the Sony even in those categories. The Sony deliver.
_________________________

If you're going for comfort then there is absolutely no question; BOSE. Great for sleeping and traveling.

If you're going for sound and you plan to pump a lot of music through them; SONY. More music will sound really good on them and the battery will last a little longer. And if you have an Android, connection and control is simple while standing in a rickety subway train.

That said, I don't know that either of them are really worth the price. I have both, and I have a pair of Logitech 7.1 Dolby surround sound gaming headphones with USB dongle that sound incredible with movies (far better than 7.1 in a room, as the acoustics in the headphones are perfectly controlled, and far better than either of these), and they Cost a $160. Needless to say they're not Bluetooth (and they have a giant mic arm on them), but I have a hard time believing that you couldn't find something for less that half the price of these that would deliver nicely."
437,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the QC3 and the QC25 and both are really great products, but this is the best! The battery last very long time and I thought the quiality over bluetooth was going not to be good but is pretty descent, and the best of all no cables!"
438,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As much as I liked my Sony 200D noise cancelling headphones from many years ago, it was time to upgrade to some over-the-ear ones because after many hours on, my ears would get fatigued due to the pressure of the headphones. I travel on average once a week every month, often times internationally on long-haul flights. These are the perfect noise-cancelling travel headphones: compact in size, great battery life and excellent audio output. I feel sorry for my passengers who are left listening to the deafening cabin noise, baby cries and coughing on our flights. This is not to say, these are miraculous because you can still hear the crying at times but the difference of headache-inducing cabin noise with and without these is dramatic. I don't know how people don't get headaches. They are great for in-flight movies, too. Add a great memory foam neck pillow and silk eye mask and I manage to sleep just fine everytime."
439,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just bought these headphones yesterday and for the first 2-3 hours, I felt nauseated and had a slight headache. Then, I took it off and didn't wear it for a while, and wore it for 1-2 hours later on. Today, I have been wearing the Bose QC35 for the past 2 hours, and don't feel any issue at all. I believe its because my ears and body got accustomed to the noise-cancelling environment.

These headphones are HANDS DOWN THE BEST at noise-cancelling!!!
I seriously live in the loudest part of San Francisco: extremely thin walls all around with inconsiderate neighbors, neighbors that abuse each other and their kids, and the metro that goes by every 10-15 minutes.

When I have these headphones on, I no longer hear any of that noise. I have no doubt that these headphones will drown out airport/airplane noise as well. We all know how many obnoxious kids there are with parents that don't care about shutting them up in a confined space, so that everyone can enjoy their long flight ride.

If you're a programmer or anyone that loves music or quiet environments, then this headphone is for you!"
440,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent noise canceling. The sound quality is bland. these sound like low budget headphones. I always knew Bose was terrible for hi/fi as they are the dsp wizards fooling your ears with fancy digital algorithms to get decent sound from a potato, so I always skipped them. But for ANC headphones there's no choice with their patents, It was these guys or Sony and people say the Sonys headband cracks so I passed and got these. Anyways TLDR; great noise canceling but sound like a potato. Oh a plus they are light great battery life, and have cool digital features like announcing the bluetooth device albiet I just care about sound."
441,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands-down absolute best purchase I have ever made. Seriously puts me in my own world, and I have severe ptsd. Couldn't survive leaving the house without them. It really is a different world of music. I'm never one to believe brand-based hype, but I did a lot of research before buying these and I was impressed in every way. After one year of everyday, hard use, regularly storing them without their case in a bag, the power on and off switch stopped working. I can still use them in every way, except they just need to be plugged in to charge before I leave every time now because I cant turn them off to save attery. I have the warranty, just havent sent it in yet. It is extremely durable, I wear them out in the rain, no joke. Under heavy rain I pull up my hood and everything is fine. Sound quality is still fantastic. I literally cannot stand listening to music on laptop, cellphone, or earbud speakers anymore. It sounds like a pathetic, tinny impersonation of real music."
442,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have great qualities but lack of APT-X support (even via update) is a staggering oversight. For those that don't know what this is, it's the technology that makes video playback sync with sound, to avoid seeing people's lips move but not hearing them until about 1 full second later. Google ""Quiet Comfort 35 apt-x"" and you'll see forums littered with complaints about this embarrassing omission. Anyway, they're totally fine if you never plan to watch a video on your phone, tablet, computer, or television while using them."
443,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Echoing a previous comment that swayed me into buying this product: wow how did I live before my QC35? The sound cancelling is phenomenal. The fit is phenomenal. It's an amazing piece of engineering.

Sound cancelling: I recall when I first popped these on and I was listening to soft music when I went to microwave some food. I recall after starting up the microwave, I panicked. The microwave's display showed a countdown, but I couldn't hear any of the usual microwave humming! That was so bizarre, I had to remove my headphones to double check my microwave was indeed humming and not broken.

Fit: I can wear this for hours and hours (and I have, up to 4 hours I think, at the end of which I'd forgotten they were there).

Something to note is that there is no way to turn off the noise cancelling. This means that when I got a phone call over Bluetooth, it is a strange experience speaking to the other person over the phone through the noise cancelling. My voice sounded very strange and it's not the most pleasant experience for me. But hey, these guys aren't really made to optimize your phone call experience. So it's all good :)"
444,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Damn, these are good. Great sound from my iPhone (play with the EQs in the settings menu on your phone, and see what feels right). Wish the multifunction button was a little more obvious, but not a big deal. Cannot wait to take these on a plane and just use the noise-cancelling option. Hold on, I think my wife is yelling at me. I think... :-)

Update: These are also nice when it's real cold outside (keeping your ears warm). One caveat; I tried riding my bike with these on, but the outer microphones picked up a lot of wind noise, rendering them kind of useless. Probably shouldn't be riding with these on anyway. Be sure to get the Bose app for your phone or other device, and use it to update the firmware."
445,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really expected more out of these headphones. The sound quality is very good and the noise cancelling functionality works really well. The charging cord is woefully to small, I guess they did that to discourage people from listening to them while charging. The Bluetooth pairing is rather easy as you just have to move the power slider but it can be cumbersome to cycle through the Bluetooth hosts if you have a few. My power switch has gotten to the point where it will no longer completely turn off and so the battery discharges every night. Fortunately, it charges rather quickly. The sound level is pretty weak in my opinion, I could use a few more decibels on some TV shows and older movies."
446,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the first version of these years ago. While the tech was good the build quality was abysmal, and they self destructed in 12 months.

I bought two pairs of these for a trip and they are the gold standard in noise cancellation.

The sound is near audiophile, and the electronic noise reduction is second to none.

The pairing is simple, and adjustments are intuitive.

Battery life lasts days.

Super comfortable. Wore them non stop for eight hours with no hot spots or discomfort.

Even works for non aircraft uses. Loud rooms are instantly tamed. Crying babies are now seemingly far away. Amazing"
447,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After struggling with several other brand headphones, I finally ended up investing in Bose QC 35, and it turns out to be totally worth it!!

The quality is top notch, from the make, material, sound quality to noise cancelling. I was debating about the color, but I'm glad I chose the silver.

1. It's all metal-feeling body (not cheap plastic feeling), and very flexible as you could see from one of the review videos.
2. It's very light, and the cushion is so soft and comfortable! I had several different brands over-the-ear headphones, and they're all very tight and your ears would feel tired after a while. But with this pair, you feel nothing. Super comfy!!
3. Once you turn on the switch, the noise cancelling is automatically on, and the world would become so quiet! Love it. And once the music starts, you would totally flow into it.
4. It has built-in battery. When I first used it right out of the box, it had ~60%. It didn't take long to be fully charged. After 100% charging, I used the Bluetooth connection to my phone, and listened to the music for about 30 minutes, and the battery was still 100%.
[Update: I continuously used it the whole day, about 12 hours, and the battery level remained to 60% from 100%. With my normal work/life schedule, I can easily use it up to 3 days wirelessly without charging. Besides, you could wire it up if the battery runs out, without losing the high quality of sound.]
5. If you connect with the wire, it automatically turns off bluetooth conncection to save the energy, but noise canceling is still on. A great feature. (Actually, the moment you plug the smaller one into left ear jack, it turns off the bluetooth no matter whether the other side of the wire is connected to the phone/device or not.)
6. It can connect to two devices at the same time, and use the switch on the right to switch between devices. According to the manual, it could save up to 8 devices. This is awesome!
7. I didn't notice at first, but you could answer calls with this headphone. In fact, this pair has a very good quality dual mic that only focuses on vocal voice and filters out all noise. I didn't know it comes with a microphone until recently. When I talked with my friends on the phone connecting the headphone wirelessly, they said the sound was very clear.

I'm so excited about this pair, and I wish I could've written a more organized review, but I thought the list of the main points that I wondered when I researched this pair of headphones would give you a big picture and save your time to read a lengthy review. Hope this helps you decide."
448,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow. Great pair of noise cancelling cans. Setup was a breeze, was working in about 20 seconds, identified my phone/iPad immediately by name, and works well. Only gripe I have is that if I answer my phone normally and then put on my headphones and turn them on it doesn't transfer the call immediately to the headphones, but other than that picky little detail, I love them. Took them on a flight to another country and couldn't hear the engines, though I was sitting the next to last row on the Airbus A380. Arrived refreshed and ready to explore. I wouldn't recommend wearing while driving, but if you are a commuter, they'd allow you to enjoy your music in pretty good solitude. Build quality is nice. They are light, but feel well-made. The earcups are the softest material I've felt in a headphone and I've had literally dozens of predecessors to compare to them. Charging works great, you can use them with the noise cancelling turned off with your phone with a cable and they still sound amazing. Quality product all the way around."
449,3.0 out of 5 stars,"these are the best headphones ive ever used I wear them while moving my lawn on my zero turn mower, which is very load with the engine directly behind where I'm sitting. just putting them on is the same as my old plain headset which cuts the noise in half, then when you turn tn
he noise cancelling on the sound is reduced to a very low purr. then I synced my phone to it and listen to a good audio book and now l
mowing the lawn is a enjoyable experience. Then if I get a phone call I can answer it and some how the person I'm talking to cant hear the mower either using the sound canceling microphone built in. I couldn't be any happier with this purchase well worth the price."
450,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were the first noise cancelling headphones I had ever purchased, and I wasn't sure what to expect. How good was the noise cancelling going to be? I work from home and have small kids, so the answer *had* to be excellent. Well, I just got off a video call and was surprised to find that in the room next to me, there had been a pretty epic toddler tantrum... and I hadn't heard a word.

I'm absolutely in love with these things, I simply can't wait to put them on when I'm working — it feels like I'm in my own productivity bubble — completely free from distractions. When you're in a big room the background sounds get quieter. Soft sounds disappear, conversations become softer but are still audible. If someone asks you a question from a couple feel away, you'll know. But, if there's a wall between you and louder noises, everything disappears if you add the softest of music to the headphones."
451,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely a fantastic product. I honestly do not understand any of the negative feedback provided in other reviews. High quality product from how it looks, feels and operates. Noise reduction is the best I have ever experienced. Sound quality is top notch for both voice and music. Bluetooth reception is excellent - no disruption or crackle - maintains connection for well over 50 feet. Works very well for taking voice calls with microphone picking up normal speaking levels and able to clearly hear self in the NC earphones. Highly recommend this product. Bose hit a homer with this this one."
452,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of Bose noise canceling headphones but my first time trying wireless. I finally had to replace the old ones because I had wrecked them over the years. These are VERY comfortable on the ears and the sound is very very clear but the bass is a bit soft? If that's the right way to express it. I wish it had more ""punch"" to it but other than that I like them very much.

Side note: Please commendation to Amazon on this purchase. I bought these only to discover that when being packaged, someone replaced the Bose headphones with an inferior pair of Sony wireless ones. I panicked and called Amazon wondering if they would say ""too bad, so sad"" since I couldn't prove I was telling the truth. Once again, Amazon came through like a champ. A replacement pair was in the mail the next day! This time I got the correct item. I LOVE AMAZON AND ITS AAA CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
453,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Price-to-sound quality: Low. The performance is on par with some decent $90+ headphones. Serious diminishing returns on how good sound quality gets once you go past $90. For a gaming headset, the HyperX Clouds are almost the same sound quality, plus it has a great gaming mic.

So if you're looking for $350 sound quality -- actually not sure if it exists. I tried a different $350 headphone (Sennheiser 600 HD), and it was not good either. So... I really don't think headphones get any better beyond $90. Or my ears are just not very sensitive.

Comfort: HIGH. Most comfortable headphones I've worn.

Battery: GOOD. Excellent 24-48 hour batter life. Problem: the length of the USB recharger is only like 3 inches long, BOOO.

Appearance: GREAT.

Noise Cancellation: GOOD. Works much better for deep-pitched or mid-pitched sounds... but sharp or high-pitched sounds, it works mediocrely against those.

Overall, I actually returned these after a few weeks of using the, because I honestly couldn't feel good about the $350 price tag. What really killed it for me is that I'm a GAMER -- So I really wanted the mic to work. And the mic does NOT work for PC. I even got an audio splitter to try to get the mic to work with my PC -- and no. That really, really, really bothered me. PLEASE MAKE THE MIC WORK FOR PC! It's such a waste for the engineers to design this headphone with a decent microphone AND design get the microphone's blue-tooth to work with phones... and yet they can't just add support for PC (which really should be EXTREMELY easy.. just allow the signal to travel through the audio cable)"
454,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, I really like these headphones. In order to reduce noise, they emit sound waves that counter the noise outside. I'm sensitive to noise, so these sound waves produced put a little pressure on my ears.

Pros:
- works well to reduce noise
- still can have conversation with someone next to you with the headphones on.
- has a place to plug in devices that do not have bluetooth
- great carrying case
- long battery life
Cons:
-constantly tries to connect with a device even when it is not found, gets annoying especially on an airplane when devices are turned off.
- can not choose which device it connects with when there are multiple options
- design: wish the soft side turned towards you when placed around your neck"
455,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I've owned many Bose products over the years as well as competitor products. I currently have a Bose home sound system (my 3rd one), a Bose radio/cd player (have had this for probably 20 years), and just upgraded from my QuiteComfort 15 to the 35. I travel all the time so these are a crucial component to that. I really need the noise cancelling feature, and the comfort to wear the headphones for hours at a time. The QC15 were (and still are) awesome. Since wireless didn't exist when I got them, I did not mind the wires. I just got the QC35 yesterday and I can tell you that Bose improved on something I didn't think they could. These are extremely comfortable (I prefer over ear as opposed to on ear), and as I've come to learn over the years the Bose sound is vastly superior to almost all others. Combine that with this noise cancelling, I can't see any other headset beating this one. I was able to download their app and pair the device immediately with no issues. I probably did not need the app, but it was simple and worked well. It comes with a very nice and compact case that is smaller than the QC15's, so that it will slip into my backpack even easier. There's also a wired connection and an airplane adapter (2 prong) in case you need it. Lastly, they fold nicer than the QC15, and fit easily into the case. I'm looking forward to years of listening on these. Bose may be slightly higher priced than some others, but in my opinion, you can't beat them."
456,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing. The sound is incredible with accurate reproduction of tones, no artificial booming bass. Use them when walking and hiking with iphone in pocket....never experience skipping in signal. Battery life goes on for weeks with an announcement of remaining battery life to alert user at every startup. They are light and comfortable to wear, a noticeable improvement over my still amazing wired Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones."
457,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these!

I bought a pair of very good in-ear wireless headsets, and they worked fine, but I found them deeply uncomfortable. So I bought the bullet and bought these. I absolutely love them. They're amazingly comfortable, and the sound quality is fabulous.

I am at my computer far more than is healthy. I work as a computer programmer during the day and in the evenings, I write books. I wear headsets and listen to music for background to drown out other noises that tend to be more intrusive. And I pick my music more carefully when writing to help set the tone for the scene I'm working on. I've tried a variety of headsets over the years, but I've never had a pair that felt so good and produced such rich sound as these.

I'm on Mac. They work great both to my iMac and my MBP."
458,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all, I am longtime fan of Bose and have and do own many of their products. HOWEVER, the QC35 will NOT pair with my Dell Latitude E7470 laptop. I have spent a few hours on the phone with Dell and ensured all drivers etc. are up to date. Called Bose! My first time ever having to call them in fact and WOW - zero technical capabilities on the other end of the phone. I've been hung up on EVERY time I have called with no resolution. They simply have no infrastructure to handle a technical question. The laptop sees the QC35 headphones on the devices page, it simply wont connect. Error every time!

The headphones paired with my IPhone 7 easily and are fantastic. I actually love not having to have to carry or worry about batteries and the head phones charge very quickly. If you have a basic battery charger its more than enough to get you hours out of the headphones after roughly 30 mins. Sound quality is excellent and the noise cancellation is the best I've seen yet. Very comfortable headphones and so much more mobile now without the wires to worry about.

If you've been a Bose fan like me you'll have no issues with the headphones BUT if you have pairing difficulties with a laptop, you're not going to get any help from them. Such a disappointing revelation for me after years and years of brand loyalty. I have a cheap set of in-ear headphones that pair just fine with the laptop as a benchmark.

5 Stars for the headphones. 0 stars because it won’t pair to my laptop and that's why I wanted them. Negative stars for inept customer service support for a $350 pair of headphones. I hope this helps somebody. Have a great day!

Update Dec 2018. Power off button won’t power down the headphones. They constantly remain on. So I have to ensure they are connected to a battery pack prior to using them. Will contact Bose and update when I do."
459,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not sure if my personal setup is wrong, but i'm absolutely dreading trying to contact bose or apple to try to fix my problems. Walked into apple store and they had no idea and have been procrastinating fixing these since. At the very least TONS of headache for a ridiculously expensive $350 headset. I've been forced to resort to only using these when i'll be listening to music or doing something that will definitely not require using the mic or joinin a call

Cons:
- talking on any sort of call (bluetooth with phone, slack, join.me, gotomeeting, lync) sounds awful
- people can barely/not hear me when i take a call (bluetooth with phone, slack, join.me, gotomeeting, lync)
- when you start anything that uses the microphone, the great noise cancel goes to awful scratchy sound of playing back surrounding sounds your mic picks up through your headset, along with an intermittent beep
- very expensive
- very troublesome to attempt to fix the above issues (is it apple OS problem? iphone OS problem? headphone problem? config problem? contact amazon? contact bose? contact apple? Note i'm a software product manager and have built several PCs and would call myself 'tech savy'. these headphones are a nightmare)
- had to switch back to quietcomfort 20 buds for the workday because i take a lot of calls and these are completely useless for any call on any device or program (iphone 7 plus, macbook 12"" 2016, macbook pro 2013)

Pros
- extremely good noise cancellation (far better than the Bose earbuds (Quietcomfort 20)
- they fold up and fit nicely into a relatively small case
- i'm not audiophile but i like the sound quality of music (again assuming mic is disabled)"

Didnt buy from Amazon but cant explain here as per ""tips and guidlines"".

NOW FOR THE REVIEW: I was extremely skeptical at first seeing the price tag of $349.99. I did my research on other headphones below and above this price and decided since, you know, BOSE makes some of the best sound equipment around why not. These are amazing so far!

BLUETOOTH: I haven't had any issues so far with Bluetooth cutting out except when going through different rooms on the opposite side of the house. Other than that I have been as far as 12m away with no issues. This was a big concern when I was looking at the reviews and others complained about how short ranged they are, etc., etc..

BATTERY: I have been using these for 3 days (about 10 hours) and haven't had to charge other than initially out of the box.

DESIGN: These are sleek, good looking headphones. They feel heavier duty than other brands I have tested and are quite comfortable.

SOUND: Now while these aren't the BEST sounding I have heard, they are really good quality. The bass and treble seem tuned perfectly and none over power each other(although I may say I do my own tunings on my computer)."
461,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was initially skeptical about spending $350 on a pair of headphones, but the QC35's are worth every penny. I use them every weekday, probably for the majority of the day: during my ferry boat commute, on the muni train, and at my desk. They're extremely comfortable, do a great job of removing repetitive noise, and have a great wireless Bluetooth experience. The headphones are paired with my iPhone and my Apple Macbook laptop. I can easily pause playback on my phone and then start playback on my laptop without having to switch any settings on the headphones or devices; it truly just works. I can't recommend these headphones strongly enough!"
462,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like 'em alot.

I purchase th Sennheiser HD 4.40 first which have a sound quality that is as crisp and clean as the QC-35's for ~$150. The HD4.40's lacked acceptable volume amplification of Bluetooth audio for me personally so I sent them back and purchase the Bose QC-35's and glad I did. The HD-4.40's ,and I suppose the 4.50's (w/ noise cancellation) have a softer over ear fit than the QC-35's; But that softer fit is in comparison to the perfect over ear fit of the QC-35's.

I rated the crisp & clean volume level of the HD 4.40's a 7 out of 11. The Bose QC-35 reach a crisp volume level of 9 out of 11.

The 35's have a sturdy plastic articulating frame, quality clean sound with low BT latency, strong volume amplification gain the Bose QC-35's are over priced by $50 in my opinion @ ~$350. A premium I am glad to pay and recommend over comparable quality products like the Senheiser HD-4.50 @$199.95.

Tautronics BT hiccups: The QC-35 on off switch doubles as Bluetooth pair switch (hold two seconds) and forget all paired devices (hold 5 seconds). If you hold and clear QC-35 (5-sec) paired with the TT-BA07 you have to go cycle the TT-BA07 to receiver mode and pair with nothing to wipe the transmitter memory to re-pair with QC-35's. The TT-B09 Transmitter/receiver is a bit better and I did not encounter this problem. But I did have a problem with a Samsung smart TV. The Samsung Soundshare Bluetooth function hijacks the pairing and blocking QC-35's from pairing. The simple solution is to move their transmitter (usually battery powered) away from the Samsung TV, re-pair, then plug back in."
463,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Over the years I have owned Sennheiser, Klipsch, Etymonic, SONY, etc., headphones and earbuds. I have never had headphones that were this good. The sound far surpasses any I've ever had. Bose's wireless technology and battery life are significantly better than any others that I have used.
The weight, noise cancellation, comfort, ventilation, are unequaled.
I've never paid this much for headphones, I wouldn't hesitate to buy these Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless headphones again. They are worth it. Thank you Bose!"
464,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely the best head phones I've ever owned. I do have a few other high end head phones that are good--maybe 3-4 star, but this will be my only 5-star. Now...if I were rating the app for this device it would get a 1-star for useless. You don't need it so skip it.

Besides music, if you love nature sounds and recordings these are a must. You'll hear things you never knew were in those recordings.

Noise reduction--not cancellation. None are that I've tested. I can still hear my dog barking--but not as loud. These do greatly reduce airplane ambient background sounds. Not totally, but again, better then what else I have.

They are pricy...but I no longer buy corded hard wired accessories. Wireless is the only way to go. These stay connected where ever I go in my 1800 sq foot home."
465,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are expensive, was almost a deal breaker for me. However, the sound quality is great - they fit your ears perfectly - the dual Bluetooth pairing to a phone and something else is fantastic. The noise cancelation doesn't do much at all if the music isn't playing but when playing it can be at a much lower volume then most headphones to block out the ambient sounds. (or my downstairs neighbors dog...the reason for these)

These can not switch between wired and Bluetooth. So you can't have a wired connection to something like a tv and a Bluetooth paired at the same time (say a phone) and have them switch back and forth. That is the drawback I have found.

I would recommend these...with some luck this is a long term investment."
466,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for a long flight to Australia from NYC m. I am terrible on planes and get sick easily due to claustrophobia, motion sickness, and the noise. Flying is literally a nightmare for me. I splurged on these headphones hoping for the best and I will say that these are hands down the BEST thatt I have ever had!! I slept for a good 10 solid hours on the plane and had no issues with ear pain. They are comfortable and almost block out all of the noise (unless you’re like me and love loud music, then no sound at all). My fiancé was envious of my headphones. If you’re like me and struggle on planes, I highly recommend these...I didn’t get sick once with these! I’m going to Asia later this year and I’m actually not dreading the flight because of these headphones!! Thank you, BOSE!"
467,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since I have these, I tend to run around with them on my neck all day in the office. So much more convenient than the cable version I had before. And also smart bluetooth technology and a well made app to control it / install updates. I was impressed when it effortlessly connected to my iPhone and MacBook simultaneously and switched between playing Spotify from my Mac and receiving calls from my phone. Also nice: if the incoming number is recognized, the headphones tell you ""Call from John Smith"" instead of just ringing. Similarly, it tells you the battery charge when you switch it on, which device it connected to etc. Really well though through."
468,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Bose noise-cancellation headphones. I bought two of them in the past and have been happy with them. I can't say them same with the wireless ones. The first one I bought broke when the on/off switch on the side broke. Bose was nice enough to replace it and I appreciate them for that. A little over a year later, the right side is now sounding weird, making it sound like you have water in your ears. I know Bose is capable of great quality headphones but the problems I've had with their wireless version makes me very wary of buying from them again. I just ordered a new pair to replace these. They are not from Bose this time."
469,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I travel a good deal for work and have had NC headphones from day one, which makes air travel much more pleasant. My first pair were the Beats Studio, the sound quality was great, but if the battery died you had useless headphones that didn't work. This happened to me on a long flight and I had to resort to the cheap ones they give out on the plane. The Beats were also fairly heavy and were not comfortable for extended use. I kept them and use them in my office. My next pair were the Bose QC25. The NC on these were fantastic, it was like night and day compared to the Beats. They were also super light-weight which was great for extended wear. The QC25's didn't sound quite as good as the Beats but the ability to use them if the battery died and the fact that it used a AAA battery that was easy to replace made these my go-to traveling companion. With the removal of the headphone jack on my iPhone 7 I figured it was time to upgraded to Bluetooth. These QC35's did not disappoint! The sound quality is better than the QC25 and almost on par with the Beats, plus these are completely wireless. The battery seems to last forever on these things as well which is great. You also don't have to fear if the battery dies as they will still work with the included cord. The only downfall is you lose the active EQ and NC but that is expected with no battery. They are slightly heavier than the QC25 but not nearly as tiring as the Beats. They are a little expensive in comparison to some of the deals you can find on other bluetooth headphones but no-one can touch Bose when it comes to Active NC, its like being in your own private listening room!"
470,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great, I only have one major (and one minor) issue with them. The major issue is with the earpads which have ripped from normal usage after roughly a year. Bose does sell replacements, but from what I can tell they appear to be over-priced (yes, I'm aware of the irony of buying $300+ headphones and complaining about how expensive replacement earpads are.) This is an issue that Bose really needs to resolve as normal wear and tear i.e. removing and putting on headphones should not rip the stitch. The minor issue I have had with them is that in windy conditions, the wind noise is amplified causing a loud ""wooshing"" noise to be heard. I'm not sure if this is normal for all headphones or just these. Regardless, they manage to block out the sound of my classmates, wife, children, teachers, and others when I use them so I would recommend them."
471,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose has truly produced a product that inspires the word ""Awesome"". After getting the headphones, I placed them on my head and over my ears then just listened to the ambient noises that filterd thru... Even without turning them on, the ambient sounds in the room were nicely diminished... Not completely, but enough to be much less distracting... After a few moments I decided to switch them on and observe the noise cancelling. AWESOME, that is the only adequate word to describe the total silence that ensued. After that, I picked some nice music from iTunes to play and it was so very soothing with nothing but music...

I highly recommend these headphones to anyone who wants to escape the ambient noises of their life and be completely immersed in either music or videos or whatever sounds you truly want to hear... It is amazing."
472,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter, who rides the train to/from work an hour each way. She loves them! I tried them on Christmas Day and they are the best I've ever heard. I have the old original Bose noise cancelling headphones and I love them, but I have upgraded to the new QC35. Pricey but worth it. And I love Bose for their customer care; none better. No I don't work for them!"
473,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my Bose 35 cans today. I've tried soooo many headphones, some worth more than $1000. I purchased the Beats Solo 3's and sent them back because of the lack luster sound (sorry Apple). I am however using the Bose 35's with my Apple devices and they sound supernatural. They sound so beautiful, and over wireless! They connect in an instant. As others stated, the noise cancellation is second to none. I am very, very happy with them - I can't wait to see some of the extra things I can do via the downloadable App for these puppies. Thank you Bose!"
474,3.0 out of 5 stars,"One thing I find annoying is how it automatically switches between connected devices, even if I turn one off in the app. I have it connected to my TV and my iPhone, and occasionally I'll want to use my phone and hear that alone, so I switch off the TV device in the iPhone app. After a few seconds it will automatically turn on the TV device. I gave up on that route (one of the reasons I bought this) and just stopped using my phone. Other than that, it's nice quality headphones."
475,5.0 out of 5 stars,The noise cancellation seems to work at least as well as my older wired Bose headphones. These are my first wireless headphones. I use them pretty much all day at work (cubicle land) and I only charge them every few days. It seems like a lot of features you wouldn't think about before purchasing just do the right thing. Bluetooth pairing with multiple hosts works like a dream.
476,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound, as you would expect from any Bose product. Comfortable to wear, doesn't pinch ears or press glasses into side of head. Worn on international flights to help block out sounds, connected to in-flight entertainment without issue. Connects to my iPhone and iPad without issue. Quick charging, battery lasts a good long time. Secure on your head, so they can be used while gardening or using an elliptical.

I've found the mic picks up a little more background noise than a standard headphone mic; but not too bad."
477,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I replaced my older QC-15s with these . Hands down, these are the best noise cancellation-wireless headphones that money can buy. IMHO, there is no competition for these lovely headphones. Been using them for 4 days now. I haven't experienced any lag or drop yet. The bluetooth playback is amazing. The battery gave me close to 20 hours of play time as promised. Those who are worried about the battery can rest easy. The battery life is good! And once the battery was out, recharging it via the USB cable took close to 2 hours. No complaints there either. Absolutely loving it!
PS : I read in the manual that the battery can be easily replaced by the awesome people down there at any of the Bose service centers. I am guessing once the battery is dead for good, we can get it replaced. Would need a confirmation from Bose Customer Care though."
478,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Why didn't I buy these sooner?! I absolutely love these. I use them at the office, home, and the gym. Beautiful sound. I usually pair with a white noise app on my phone or music app. So comfortable. I was wary of their size but I really like how they fit. The wireless factor can't be beat. I've also paired these with my smart tv (using Bluetooth adaptor on TV) and can listen/watch TV without hearing neighbors, etc. Frankly, I thought it was ridiculous to pay hundreds of dollars for headphones, but I'm a total convert. Given how much I use these, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair if/when needed."
479,2.0 out of 5 stars,"No complaints from the husband who got this as a gift. He travels a lot for his work so this was one of the most non-romantic birthday gifts from me. It made me cringe to get this for him - dunno just seemed a bit corny, but I also knew he'd appreciate it. I also know he's really frugal - when it comes to getting anything for himself. So hence instead, I did. All this internal angst ;p and the money was worth the wonder and grin of a little kid of his face as he played with popping these on and off his head: ""wow! they are as cool as they claim they are!!"" and ""now I hear you, now I don't"" lol

I also purchased additional coverage for this based on other reviews regarding battery and such. So thank you to all those who took the time to inform and educate the rest of us."
480,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these headphones and I would buy them again, but there are a couple of problems (see below).

The pros: lightweight, comfortable and the noise reduction is amazing. I walk through city streets and it's amazing how much of the noise is removed. Also, the microphone works pretty well for phone calls. I was amazed how good it is.

The two problems:

1. Wind noise is significant, even with a light breeze. Note that if I turn either ear into the wind, there is little to no noise. So, it's only a head or tail wind that causes the noise.

2. Skips while playing music. I'd say in an hour walk I might hear 1 or 2 skips. The skip is a complete cessation of sound for just less than a second. I have a Nexus 5x. I had Beats (bluetooth) before the Bose and I never heard skips. My guess is the buffer is too small with the Bose. The weird thing is that I don't hear skips with podcasts, only music. That's why I think it's a buffering issue, since the podcasts probably use less bandwidth.

I contacted Bose about #2 and they replaced my headphones, but the new ones suffer the same problem, though not quite as much. (It's possible there was a problem upgrading the firmware on my original headphones, from 1.0.5 to 1.0.6. The process is a little confusing with the Android app and I might have screwed it up. The replacements had 1.0.6 already.)

Not having wires and having the noise reduction is an amazing plus!"
481,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for about 3 weeks. I got them to replace the Bose QuietComfort 20i, which I've had for 2 years, but at this point I am considering keeping both pairs. The problem I have with the 20i is that they are super uncomfortable for long-term use. They irritate the inside of my ear and I have to adjust them quite frequently to keep the seal tight so that they will block more external noise. The pros are obviously that the 20i is extremely portable.

The 35 (Series I) is big and bulky, but it is great not getting my arm tangled up in the cord. (I decided that I did not need the Series II functionality at this point, though time will tell.) But they fit comfortably and don't irritate my skin. At the moment, I am leaning toward keeping the 35 for using at the office, long plane rides (over 2 hours), and even while sleeping in hotels (I can't tolerate daily earplug usage, because again, the skin irritation is an issue for me). I intend to continue using the 20i for short walks and bus/train/airplane rides under 2 hours.

The only real problem with the 35 is the beeping notifications. It makes a very loud and annoying beep when it powers on, powers off, connects to your Bluetooth device, and when it disconnects from your Bluetooth device. I cannot figure out how to disable nor decrease the volume for this ""feature"". If anyone can share how to do that, please do and I would then increase the rating to 5 stars!"
482,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bluetooth works better than any other bluetooth headphones I've tried. Noise cancellation works well. However, the microphone for making calls is super sensitive and picks up every single surrounding noise, particularly any high end noise like clanking of plates or silverware. I got so many complaints about ambient noise when I was on calls that I had to return these. I'd also note that the over ear design makes for very hot ears."
483,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The absolute best headphones. I use them, on average, 12 hours a day. I use them to sleep, as they filter out my spouses snoring, and when I'm working at my computer. They work very very well at filtering out plane engine noise; so much so that you don't have to turn them all the way up to hear what you're watching like you would with just about every other headphone out there. They charge very quickly, and hold that charge for well over 24 hours of hard use. The ear cups show no signs of degrading after all of this use. The fit is perfect for my ears, and they're comfortable enough to lay your head on your pillow with them. I swear, iIm not a Bose shill, and in fact I'm not the biggest fan of a lot of their overpriced products, but these are definitely worth the money. If I could give them 20 stars I would."
484,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loads of glowing reviews on this, and I would be one of them except for the fact the little toggle switch that turns the headphones off and on and also tells them to connect to the bluetooth broke. The toggle at rest sits in a middle position. Pushing it right, against a tiny internal spring, turns it on and tells it to connect. Pushing it left, against a different spring, turns it off. There's no longer any resistance pushing it left and thus it's impossible to turn it off. Had it about a year and seven months, using it maybe average of 4 hours a week. Now I'll start looking at other brands."
485,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved, loved, LOVED these headphones. They were comfortable. They definitely are noise cancelling. I don't have to have the music loud at all and all I can hear is the music without any outside noise. The Bluetooth range isn't great. I would say if you go more than 20-30 feet away (so like in an adjacent room), the music starts to break up a bit. All of that was ok. I bought these July 2016. I've used them maybe a dozen times (2 dozen at the most). I use them more for when I travel on an airplane and I've only been on 4 or 5 flghts since them. I went to use them tonight while I was working and the on/off switch is BROKE!!! I cannot turn them on at all. Calling Bose tomorrow."
486,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't had a lot of headphones and don't know too much about sound engineering and technology, but these headphones are great and does exactly what I want them to. They block sound out very well (especially when music is playing), and the Bluetooth pairing process is quite easy.

I use these for long flights, and in noisy coffee shops and they hold up well. Battery life is superb, and it's very comfortable to wear (the padding goes around your ears, and not over it).

One thing though - I read recently that Bose actually collects information on what you listen to or what you say through its products (and I just saw an update to the Bose Connect app that allows you the option to opt out of this). If privacy is a concern it'll probably be good to look into those policies before purchasing."
487,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I agonized over this purchase for six months. I looked at reviews, I watched videos, I read tech specs, and did shot after shot of tequila crying into the night begging God to help me! Okay the first three are true. They arrived in one day in a really nice package. I have worn them on several bike rides and gym visits. I sweat like a whore in church and they stand up to the punishment. They have never fallen out. Even when I'm in full Rob Zombie metal thrash mode. I try to make them fall out and they will not.

The app is nice and works perfectly. Also, I use Runkeeper and now I get heart rate data in that app. The sound is amazing just like all Bose products.

I have Bose noise canceling headphones, a mini wireless speaker, and a Bose system in my car."
488,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried various inexpensive wireless earbuds / headphones over the last few years, and have never found a pair that beat out my good old-fashioned wired earbuds. Well, I recently had the opportunity to try out both Bose and Jaybird wireless buds. Both are similar in price, have gorgeous packaging, and have similar features. Here are the results.

SOUND
- Bose: 10 of 10. Absolutely astounding sound quality. Simply the best I have ever heard at any price, wired or wireless, period.
- Jaybird: 8 of 10. Solid sounds, fine for podcasts or casual music listening. Bass response is nowhere close to Bose, but with some equalizer settings on your device you can come closer. Competitive with most other nice earbuds I have tried.

FIT
- Bose: 7 of 10. Surprisingly good fit considering how HUGE the buds are. Seriously, these things are big. They apparently house the battery and electronics that power these (since they are wireless). But for their size, they fit fine with the included inner-ear pieces (several sizes included).
- Jaybird: 9 of 10. Excellent fit. Tiny compared to the Bose product. These also include many options for earbud size and inner ear inserts that hold them in place, but they remain comfortable after several hours of constant use while running.

FEATURES
- Bose: 9 of 10. These have the charging port directly in one of the earbuds, which works well. You can download the Bose app, and amazingly you can even read your pulse from the buds! This is a fun and useful feature for various types of training.
- Jaybird: 7 of 10. Has a separate little ""mini"" dock needed for charging. You can download an app for the device to adjust the sound and perform a few other ""minor"" functions, but I wound up deleting the app and just connecting normally via Bluetooth.

So do I have a favorite? For daily exercise use I am gravitating to the Jaybird mostly because I prefer the fit and just do not care for the giant bud size on the Bose. But for travelling or listening when I'm not active, the Bose wins out with superior sound.

In summary, the Bose is a great product - recommended!"
489,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Still the best bluetooth in-ear headphones of early 2017 (8/10). Let me explain.

Well, first, I cannot believe there are so many raving reviews claiming these headphones to be the ""best I have ever heard at any price, wired or wireless, period"". Um. Ignore Vine reviews. And then one-star reviews complaining about defective units -- well, every electronics is prone to defective units, and Bose has some of the best warranty policies, so please.

So you're thinking about wireless in-ear headphones. As of 2017, your two best options are Bose Soundsport Wireless and Jaybird X3. Here's how they compare:

SOUND (Bose: 8/10)
-- Very good and fun sound. Warm and slightly bass-heavy, although the lowest bass rumbles as well as harsh trebles are cut off (like most bluetooth headphones). I wish mids had more clarity, but I'm nit-picking here. These aren't replacing my wired headphones, but if I'm traveling, I can definitely enjoy music with these.
-- Jaybird X3 (7/10): These are slightly brighter-sounding headphones, with less bass impact but clearer mids and trebles. Still pretty good. These are closer to neutral, but high trebles are still rolled off. So it's up to personal preferences. I also think it depends on your ear fit, and if you can get a better seal than I did, then your experiences may vary (bass is the first thing to go with a poor seal).

COMFORT (Bose: 10/10)
-- I generally don't like to give perfect score to anything, but Bose really deserves a perfect ten here. This is the selling point of Bose. Despite the ugly bulky looks, the headphones are incredibly comfortable, and wires don't distract.
-- Jaybird X3 (8/10): These have average comfort, like most other in-ear headphones. Wings help a bit. Wires are heavy and tug on the ear pieces when I move around a lot. Overall, significantly less comfortable than Bose.

PRICE (Bose: $149)
-- Bose is pricey. They're known to be pricey/over-priced, and discounts are hard to find.
-- Jaybird X3 ($99). These are definitely a great deal, and you can often find cheaper deals.

OTHERS
-- Bose remote buttons feel weird to press. Buttons are big, not very clicky, and generally unpleasant to work with. Jaybirds feel better.
-- Battery life is fairly advertised at 6 hours. I get around 7 hours. I wish it lasted longer. Jaybirds are advertised at 8 hours but I get around 7, same as Bose.
-- Bose looks ugly, if you care about these things. Jaybirds look nicer. I personally don't care.
-- Bose provides a more useful case. Jaybird case's opening is too small and frustrating to use on the daily basis.

Overall, Bose Soundsport Wireless is extremely comfortable and sounds great. I wish the battery lasted longer, but I don't think any competition (as of 2017) provides a significantly better battery life, yet. Until then, Bose is still the bluetooth in-ear headphones to beat."
490,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, let me start by saying that I would love nothing more than to be able to give the Bose SoundSport headphones five stars. These are the most comfortable headphones I have even worn and the sound quality is excellent. The issue with these headphones is the build quality. I have used these headphones probably about 15 hours a week for the last 7 months and they are falling apart. For comparison, my wife has the Jaybird X3s and they feel like they could be run over and you wouldn't notice.

The photos I've attached show a couple of the places where the headphones are falling apart. The outside of each ear piece is a rubber peice that attaches to a harder plastic peice that faces the ear. The rubber on both the right and left ear bud is detaching from the harder plactic peice. I feel like they could have made the whole ear bud out of the harder plactic and attached the two halves more securely. All prices of the X3s are nicely molded together and don't look like they will fall apart.

Another thing that has come up is the rubber covering the control has separated from the body of the control. The buttons were always a little spongy, but now the volume down button is almost unusable with out moving the rubber cover into just the right alignment with both hands. The controls really should never been designed with a solid plastic body and a separate rubber cover. To compare to the X3s again, the controls on those headphones are a solid unit with individual buttons for volume up and down and play/pause.

There are other little things as well such as the included clip breaking with a week and rubber pices that cover where the wire enters the earbuds coming lose and sliding down the wire.

Given the durability issues with these headphones they cannot be recommended. I really hope Bose addresses these issues in the next version because these really are comfortable headphones with great sound, but until then I think I will continue to find myself stealing my wife's X3s as often as I can.

Update: A little plastic piece broke off from the loose volume down button (see pic) and I now have no way to decrease the volume from the headphones without using my phone."
491,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose passing off refurbished products as ""new"" on Amazon. I bought a pair of these a few months ago and decided to buy another pair for a family member as a gift because they seem to work well. I made sure to buy directly from Amazon and the product was listed as new. The box was sealed perfectly in plastic and looked brand new from the outside so it definitely was not amazon sending me a returned item. Upon opening and seeing the headphones I knew something was wrong because I had a pair already, they looked used and the battery was dead. All the accessories looked new but this was clearly a refurbished product. My fears were realized when I charged the headphones turned it on and it immediately started to try to pair to the previous owners devices. Every time it turned on it tried to connect to ""Lee"" and a ""Galaxy Note 2"". This product was clearly used and was a refurbished product and not a ""new"" item as described. I immediately returned the headphones to Amazon and will not be buying Bose products again."
492,5.0 out of 5 stars,"THIS IS THE AMENDED REVIEW
Less than a month after I began using the BOSE SoundSport Earbuds, the battery life has gone from 2 hours to no hours. After having the headphones plugged into my computer overnight, when I pressed the power button, nothing happened. The unit no longer holds a charge. I guess I'll have to stick with wires when listening at the gym.

And now the original review.

I purchased these Bose SoundSports to replace a different brand of blu-tooth earbuds that quit working a week after I purchased them. While the Bose headphones are a comfortable fit and do sound good while I am listening to either music or an audiobook when using the rowing machine or stationary bike at the gym, I am less impressed with the battery life. I have never had more than about 2 hours of battery life since the purchase. I won't go into the schematic of my workouts, but each last approximately an hour. At the end of the 2nd workout, the headphones register that the battery is near depletion. So much for the 6 hours of battery life Bose advertises.

Get these if fit and sound quality rather than battery life are what you are looking for."
493,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using wired Sennheiser earbuds for years that rock. Decided to change out for these for my workouts. I like them, but don't love them. So here's the pros:
1. They really are comfortable. The size and weight people pooh pooh on aren't really noticeable.
2. Sound quality is really good. They don't approach my Sennheiser's but I didn't expect them to. That being said, the bass reproduction which I'm a stickler on was crisp and sounded good at lower levels although at higher listening levels, it was weak IMO.
3. The HR monitor is awesome. I've been using a BT Polar HR monitor for years. This one is dead on accurate to that for my workouts. Better than my iWatch. So I use the HR monitor in these headphones for monitoring real workouts and my iWatch for everything else.
Now for the cons:
1. All the reviews about noise due to fit are dead on. They don't fit fully into the ear canal so you do get background noise. Decide whether that's important. My Sennheiser's do which is on the reasons the bass is so good.
2. They're not loud enough. Because they don't fit fully into my ear and with ambient noise, I find I have to listen with the volume at max. Whereas the in-ear headphones - I've never needed to get above 1/2.

Overall - I'm pleased with my purchase. I wanted headphones that let in ambient sounds when I bike ride. I wanted really good sound fidelity. These do it. I wanted the simplicity of an integrated and accurate HR monitor. Check. The only gripe I have - I just wished they would get a bit louder, but that's probably not a bad thing for my ears as I age."
494,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I go to the gym a lot and have been looking for a great sounding pair of wireless in ear headphones. I have tried several, from the original beats to the powerbeats and most recently the beats x. These blow them all away......big time. They fit in my ear very well (with the medium ear tips that come on the headphones) and had a small and a large size as well. From the moment you power them on they are (in my opinion) much better than beats. When turned on they tell you what device they are connected to and how much battery is left. Another great feature is the call feature. When you receive a call it tells you who is calling (if you have them as a contact) this way you don't have to take your phone out of your pocket to check who is calling before answering. The call quality was amazing, way better than on my beats.

Now, the sound quality, in my opinion is MUCH better...MUCH MUCH better, than the beats x. Deep bass, clear voice. and they are very comfortable as well for the duration of my home long workout.

For battery life, I have only used them once so far, but at the start of my workout they were 70%, and at the end (a little over 1 hour) they were at 60%. I listened to spotify the whole time and made one roughly 10 minute phone call, only losing 10% battery life.

For anyone shopping around, or debating on whether to purchase these headphones versus the beats in ear headphones, take it from someone who has tried them.......buy these BOSE soudnsport, you won't be disappointed"
495,5.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible battery life not to mention it's all over the place I can't tell if it's about to die or its at 100% if you put them on the charger even for about 10 minutes It'll say it's at 100% but after about 5 minutes of use it'll be telling you the battery is about to die it will annoyingly repeatedly tell you this at completely random intervals for anywhere from 5 minutes all the way up to 2hours before it finally dies!!!! I listen to podcasts and this is one the most annoying low battery notifications ever it doesn't pause your music and it cuts the audio off as it plays I have had to rewind numerous hours of audio because of this issue! If it weren't a 120 dollars pair of headphones I might be willing to ignore this issue but today I actually got frustrated Because I had to start a podcast over and over again almost a dozen times after the same exact phrase got blanked out by low battery notifications which shortly after actually hearing what I wanted after ten minutes of trying finally stopped and guess what? I got nearly half an hour of no interruptions before it died with not other warning.
496,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Junk. The rubber seal keeps coming off the volume buttons. I have had to return these inferior headphones three times. The forth set has failed again and I will not bother getting a fifth set. These may be a Bose product, but they are junk. Spend you hard earned money on another brand."
497,5.0 out of 5 stars,"best wireless headphones!!!!
I've been using these for almost a year now after they updated it again because of the water issue.

I sweat alot, do alot of cardio, resistance training, rowing, etc. I was one of the first people at the gym to have them.

Now, I see them everywhere. The connection range is insane too. I leave it next to my gym bag and fill up my water about 50+ feet away and I still have a strong signal. I only have some issues with a slight break in connection sometime when my friend has his phone right next to mine. He has the soundsport too but this rarely happens.

These are NOT waterproof but water resistant. You cannot swim in these. I've taken them in the steam sauna with no issues however.

Good battery life. I end up leaving the charge cable in my car connected to the cig outlet and I charge them after every use just in case.

Overall great sound quality for wireless headphones that stay in your ear."
498,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this item expecting a new unit, it definitely isn't. Accessory bags ripped open and ear wax on installed ear buds. Purchased directly from Amazon; wtf Amazon, this is gross.

Can't speak for the quality of the headphones since I'm going to need to clean then the day I received them.

What a let down..

Update: turned the unit on, instantly tried syncing to ""Debbie's iPhone""..."
499,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Bose fan! However, the last 2 Bose headsets Ive had were awful. Apparently Bose won't let their headphones get loud. The clarity was well but volume was lacking. The headphones stay in your ear so A+ on that whoever said they fallout alot, I would have to question them. The reason for a 1 star is due to volume and most importantly the spottiness of this device. It was spotty at times when listening to music and this headset was notorious for the bluetooth to shut off. I would be talking to people and all of a sudden the bluetooth would be off. This happened daily! I gave it several chances but it kept doing it. Very awful product Bose!"
500,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these in 2016 to use while at one of my clients office due to how loud it gets in there. When not in use, they're in their case clipped to a ring in my purse. In other words, they aren't abused in any way.
The button that turns them on/off has now broken. See pics. $149 may not be a lot of money for some people but I spent the money on these because I knew they'd be comfortable and high quality.....I'm really disappointed that they've started falling apart already...especially since I take such good care of them. When I can get them turned on, they're awesome."
501,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've worn these headphones at the gym for up to 4 hours at a time and they cause no ear fatigue at all. I attribute this to the fact that they do not go very far into your ear canal, but rather rest on the outside of it. The special winglet wedges itself into your ear and will not move around. I've lifted weights, biked aggressively, and run multiple miles at a time without these headphones moving at all.

The sound quality is great compared to other ""sport"" headphones I've used. Very clear vocals and decent base.

The battery life is better than is stated by Bose. 3 hours of constant use on mine only lowers the battery to 80% (according to the Bose app).

The pairing, as with all other Bose products i've tried, was extremely easy for the iPhone SE. You do it once and never have to mess with it again.

However, these headphones will NOT block out ambient noise at all. Since they do not go very far into your ear canal, you'll still be able to hear 20-30% of the noise around you (especially at a crowded gym). I like this though, since it allows me to still be aware of my surroundings.

Overall: these headphones fit amazingly, don't cause my ears to hurt during/after prolonged use, have better than advertised battery life, have excellent sound quality, and are solidly built. Totally worth the $150.00 and would recommend to friends/family."
502,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones almost a year ago - February of 2017. I am about to return them for a replacement for the second time. The quality and audio performance are top notch but the problem I have been having has to do with the volume controls. The rubber around the volume controls pops out and there is no obvious way to ""pop"" it back in without potentially voiding your warranty. I contacted Bose directly within six months of purchasing them for the first time this occurred. Bose support is great and they set up a warranty replacement for me rather quickly and without a lot of trouble. This morning, I noticed that my headphones are doing the same thing again. I tried looking for some reviews that described this problem but haven't been able to find anything other than some ""sweat"" problem from 2016.

I doubt my issue is related to sweat. I do use my headset daily and it often just hangs around my neck. I don't understand how this occurs but sweat is not the issue.

If you're a power user and want trouble-free headphones, this may not be the unit for you. Granted, Bose is going to provide you with great customer service but Bose is supposed to be a solid name in audio technology. Their audio quality is definitely high-bar. But this issue is annoying and should be investigated and corrected."
503,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would love to rate these 5 stars but these will not stay in my ears with any of the 3 different sizes of earbuds included. If I were to run they would easily fall out of my ears within a few seconds. I am extremely disappointed a company like Bose couldn't do better research and provide earbuds that actually fit different peoples ears. Obviously, the S/M/L system doesn't work for everyone. It really sucks to pay for these and import into my country to find out they won't even work. A complete waste of money I can't even begin to say how disappointed I am in this purchase. Normally I am a Bose fan and have several Bose products. These are a complete FAIL."
504,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love them 😍. I'm in the when I have my bose in my ear..
505,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We are having to exchange the set we bought. They have a short in them somewhere and one bud goes in and out. They haven't even been used a whole month and they are having problems. I hope this is just a fluke because the husband really likes them.

I bought these on advice from my son for my husbands Christmas gift. After opening them he tried them out and said they block out the outside sounds better than our gun range ear protection. He runs every morning and we have been looking for a decent pair of wireless head ear buds for working out. He came back from his run today and said the are great. They are comfortable and don’t fall out as well as ha big really good sound. He wants to get me a pair but I am skeptical they will fit my tiny ears but I will give it a try. If I like you them as much as he does I will be back to buy another set."
506,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally found a wireless option to use with (not entirely replace) my wired Bose SoundSport earbuds. I first tried the Jaybird X3s but had to send them back because they kept falling out of my ears. Even the Comply ear tips kept coming out, and when they were in, I didn't like the earplug-like removal from outside sounds. I was hesitant to switch over to wireless because of battery life issues, but the Boses have proven to last plenty long on one charge so far, and the wireless convenience is well worth having to charge them every once in a while. I read countless reviews on the Jaybird X3s and these Bose SoundSports (and have tried both) and, at least for me, Bose win easily. Well worth the additional $40."
507,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are NOT sweat resistant unless you do light exercising. I tend to workout daily at the gym and after a week of sweating with the headphones on, the multi function button got stuck because of the sweat and the headphones became unusable. 100% would NOT recommend spending $150 on headphones that are advertised specifically for sports and cannot stand actual exercising. The description actually says ""Sweat and weather resistance for reliability while exercising"". IT'S NOT TRUE! I'm really disappointed in this product."
508,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these about less than a year ago. Sound quality unsurprisingly is great, however I think Bose failed when attempting to make a ""water resistant/sweat proof"" product. All the rubbery pieces are stretching out and coming apart. Volume buttons went first, then the rubber black casing sound the earpieces. The rubber plug for the charging port has also swollen to the point it will not stay in the port. One of the Bose badges on the earpiece has fallen off as well. Looking at the photos it may seem that they have been abused or not taken care of, I assure you that is not the case. I do use them a lot but not in extremely active situations or in the elements. I use them indoors and during work for maybe 2-3 hrs a day. I will continue use these as long as they keep working (haven't had a single technical issue) but I will definitely not replace them for another pair."
509,5.0 out of 5 stars,"1/15/18 UPDATE: I have been keeping a record of my use of these ear buds and am amazed. I am finding that the battery is lasting for close to 10 hours....... I currently have used 8 hours and still have 20 % off of a full charge. These are the best earbuds on the market. I not only use them to listen to my music, but when I can't sleep I listen to the TV with them thru my phone. Really fantastic.... and so easily paired with devices. GET THEM THEY WILL BE THE LAST ONES YOU EVER NEED TO BUY......

The best ear buds I have ever had. I have very small ears and I have a very hard time finding ones that stay in my ears and no not hurt them after a time of usage. I thought I would try these because I am a Bose person. They are FANTASTIC.... very very comfortable and no matter what I do they do not come out of my ears. I wore them for 6 hours straight and never even felt them in. The sound is Bose quality. Not like my Noise cancelling new ones, but extremely close to the sound quality (-) the noise cancellation.
The small fit perfect in my tiny ears
Even shaking my head."
510,5.0 out of 5 stars,"*****BACK WITH AN UPDATE*****
So I contacted BOSE and they replaced my
wirless soundsport citron with a brand new set. BOSE customer service emailed me a UPS shipping label that I had to print and take to the closest UPS store front where the shipping package was provided. It was shipped and in less than 2 weeks a brand new unit arrived at my home - Thats Right Brand New. In addition, BOSE restarted the warranty for the new set I recieved - So if these malfunction they are covered - NOT from the purchase time of the original - but from the replacement time of the new set. BOSE - GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE IN SUPPORTING YOUR PRODUCT.
Today i am enjoying that great quality again thanks to the BOSE customer service commitment.

6 months into using my BOSE citron soundsport wireless headphones I have to report some things. SOUND - amazing (its BOSE), BATTERY - when I charge to 100% the charge has lasted and currently still lasts as advertised, FUNCTION - WIRELESS CONNECTION AND FUNCTION -
SO FAR SO GOOD, VERY COMFORTABLE (again its BOSE), CONSTRUCTION - VERY POOR NOT BOSE QUALITY - VERY DISAPPOINTED. eventually the internal components will be exposed and consequently deteriorate way before they should during normal use due to poorly designed construction. See Pics."
511,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very, very good headphones. I had purchased (and then returned) multiple sets of headphones in the last several months. I kept these. I am very picky with audio. I'm not saying I know what I'm talking about, from a technical point of view. I'm saying that I refuse to use headphones that don't make my music sound good. These headphones make my music sound great. The bass is sufficiently, but not overly, bassy. They're very clear.

Oh, and they work as a phenomenal headset for phone calls. I have a Pixel XL and folks seem to prefer to hear me talk on these Bose headphones than to hear me right on the Pixel XL built-in mic (even when not in speakerphone mode). You can't hear yourself quite so clearly (because these earbuds plug your ears and your speaking doesn't necessarily get funneled back into your ears over the phone), so you might need to work to get used to using them as a phone headset for phone conversations. Once you do, though, you will love it.

I don't love the tap=pause, 2x tap=advance, 3x tap=reverse button. I would have preferred them be on three separate buttons instead. But I'll get over that. I don't think joining those three features into a single button saved them enough space/parts for it to be worth it, especially when a double-tap sometimes gets misunderstood as a single-tap. And vice versa. It's pretty annoying for the music to pause instead of advance to the next track. Or, worse, the opposite."
512,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, these headphones get the job done and are satisfactory. That said, as others have stated, there are a few things that they got wrong that much cheaper competitors got right making this a poor choice. I have had 3 sets of wireless headphones recently including this pair. My favorite ones (Q22 sound peats) were a quarter of the price of these. I will admit, the Bose had the best sound quality but that was the only win for Bose. The headphones are clunky and feel awkward. These were supposedly designed for running but they fall out of my ear if I run any faster than about an 8:30 mile pace which is barely running for me (I consider 9min+ miles a jog for me). The off/on button was hard to press. It's hard to switch tracks while running (I had a pair from another brand that had dedicated skip buttons making it easy). And lastly, MY BIGGEST GRIPE... Why is the volume so f'n low on these? It sounded 25-30% lower volume than its competitors. I also didn't like that people around me could here the music as well since it doesn't seal to your ear orifice. I couldn't justify owning these and the sound peats so I returned these."
513,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really wanted to like these but I just cannot give them a good review for one primary reason - they fall out of my ears very easily regardless of which ear adapter I use (tried all three). I would also add that the large footprint of these on either side of your head makes you look like a goof. Sound quality, although good is not measurably better than a $39 set. Bluetooth connectivity and the Bose app are both stellar but does not justify the lofty price given the design flaws. Since sport earbuds tend to fail pretty easily, it would be hard to recommend these at this price.
Update: Received a refund and purchased a $35 set of no-name earbuds with hooks. Sound just as good as the Bose and never fall off. You really do not need to spend over $50 to get a good set. Even if these cheapies only last a year, it is better than having a $130 set that only last a year."
514,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this product based on good reviews online and they sure are right. It has balanced sound from low to high frequencies, with an emphasis on the bass, but it's tight and not too boomy. Overall sound is very well engineered by Bose. I did think the highs could be a bit harsh or piercing at high volume though. When it comes to sound stage, it is not that great. But that's common with earbuds. Overall for the $99 price I paid, considering this is Bluetooth technology, the sound is not bad at all. I don't know how Bose does it without utilizing the AptX/HD codec.

I like it that the earpieces don't need to be inserted completely into the ear canal to achieve a tight seal to have good bass response. This makes it more comfortable to wear compared to other in-ear headphones. The earpieces stay very secure and feels comfortable. Kudos to the engineers! The earpieces protrude a lot but I guess that's needed to house the drivers. Personally I prefer a cable between the two earpieces so that they are less likely to be lost.

Can't quite comment on the batter life yet. I ordered it yesterday morning and received it around 8 pm, and charged it for about 30 minutes while the battery indicator is still flashing yellow, then I hooked it up with my LG G6, and the Bose Connect app says the battery level is 100%. After that I have been listening to music for maybe about 2-3 hours, and the app reported the battery level to be 80%. The rated battery life is around 6 hours, and likely everyone else, I do wish it could be longer, like maybe 12 hours. But these days, we are all used to charging devices daily. If only these earphones can be charged wirelessly like the Apple charging pad.

Manufacturers are ditching the 3.5 mm audio jack on mobile devices these days, and I am glad that wireless technologies are finally catching up on sound quality that makes this move more acceptable and also more importantly affordable by consumers. This set of headphones are overall a great product and will be my daily headphones from now on. Time to get rid some of my other wired headphones and move on I guess."
515,5.0 out of 5 stars,"***Update after owning these for a month*** - The clip broke. All I did with it was clip it to my collar as it is intended to be used. Now I have no clip. They still work, but at this price, I expect perfection. I am dropping my review to three stars because of this defective important part. See photos.

The sound quality is outstanding. The comfortable fit is nice. I have gone through at least half a dozen Bluetooth ear phones in the past two months and this set is so much better than the rest. You pay for the quality, but if you are like me and use them everyday, 200 bucks is a fair enough price to pay for quality and reliability."
516,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For starters, I've always been a big fan of Bose products. We have a 5.1 surround sound system in the house, I have noise cancelling headphones I use for travel, etc.
I was given these as a Christmas gift in 2016. The product worked flawlessly for about a year. Evidently there is a 1-year warranty on the product, and of course just after Christmas 2017 the product started having issues. It won't hold a charge, will shut down suddenly, etc. For a Bose product, especially given the cost, I would expect much more."
517,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Now that I have had these headphones for a few months I can tell you that although they sound great, they have two major flaws and are definitively not work $150.
First the bad. Number one is the battery life, they advertise it as lasting six hours on one charge, I'm lucky if I get three on mine, I'm not lying when I tell you this. Number two, is total volume output, they are not very loud at all. If I'm running on a treadmill and can still hear noise around me and find myself craving more volume, then it's not me, it's the product. I don't even think I listen to music that loud. I mostly listen to Jazz, Latin, and Flamenco music, no noisy volume greedy Rock or Hip Hop, etc. The earpieces are bulky and a little heavy, they hurt after about one and a half hour.
Now the good, sound definition is great and the bass response and clarity is the best I've ever heard on headphones this size."
518,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Short version: Even Bose bluetooth still can't match a high end wired set for pure sound quality/volume, but these are by far the best wireless buds out there.

Long version:

To start with, these are insanely comfortable. Like, wear them from 6am to 6pm and totally forget they're there (taking them out to charge at lunch) comfortable. And they do not fall out, period.

Audio profile is quintessential Bose. Warm and full with decent bass, accurate mids and clear highs. The volume will go high enough to hurt without distortion or digital squeal, and the person next to you won't hear a thing. Low volume performance is also good, allowing just enough outside noise in for situational awareness without muddling the source audio.

Call quality is fantastic on both ends and the bluetooth connection is rock solid with my S7 whether I'm sitting next to a Server/UPS room in a building chock-full of wireless signals, or driving under power lines that would make my Gear IconX cut out every time.

Battery life is as good as it gets without adding bulk or sacrificing sound quality/volume, and recharging takes no time. A full charge over night and a 1/2 hour at lunch will keep them going through heavy, all day use.

The buds come with small, medium and large tips, and finding the right combination is key to getting the best experience. Try each matching set and start with the one that gives the fullest sound, then adjust individually as needed. Upsize if they feel loose or sound weak, and downsize if you experience any ear fatigue throughout the day. I ended up with the large in my left ear, and the medium in my left. Perfection...

These can't quite match a good set of wired buds with foam tips for pure isolation and quality, but for daily drivers, they're hard to beat."
519,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these to replace Jaybird X Sport headphones that were a couple of years old and finally stopped working... Compared Bose to the new version of the Jaybird, and sound of the Bose is better, no doubt. So, returned the Jaybirds and kept the Bose. But found they will not hold a charge. Twice after being fully charged and ""100% battery"" reported, I would use them for 40 -60 minutes and then turn the off. When I went to use them a few days later, NO CHARGE AT ALL. My old Jaybirds held a charge for a few weeks easily. I know Bose sells a charging case, but I really don't think you should have to keep charging them at all times. After reading some of the prior 1 star reviews, I decided best to return during the 30 day period in which Amazon will accept them back. Not taking a chance. Too bad, because good sound and fit. Reordered the Jaybirds..."
520,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These replaced my wired Bose in-ear buds. I've been a Bose fan for many years and own over the ear QC2's, MIE2's, a sound bar and other Bose devices that I enjoy. I like the sound of the wired MIE2 but I wanted to cut the cord for more freedom while wearing my ear buds. These do exactly what I had hoped. The ""stay hear+"" tips are a definite improvement over the older version. I insert them into my ear and twist the bud gently rearward to provide a solid hold. These buds are NOT noise cancelling but the design of the tips keeps out quite a bit more noise than the older design. Pairing to my MacBook, iPad, iPhone and smart tv was simple. The best part is the sound. Both voice and music are pleasantly balanced across the frequency range. I had a cheap pair of wireless I bought last year (<$30) and the sound on those is like listening through a tin can. I did like the freedom of wireless though. What a difference the SoundSports are. Many have noted the size of the bud being large. It is a bit big but that really doesn't detract from the design or comfort. My only concern would be the interference you might get trying to wear them inside a bike or cycle helmet. Haven't tried that yet. The on/off and pairing control mounted on the right bud is easy to find but maybe a bit ""mushy"" to the touch. The inline control for volume and phone response is easily accessible and intuitive but also a bit soft. Not a serious issue by any means but be aware. The alligator clip to secure the headphones to your shirt is an improvement over the old style but still can pull off the cord fairly easily. Despite these few minor flaws I give these Bose SoundSport headphones a full five star rating. You won't be disappointed."
521,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones fit well into my ear and stay in through hard running, but since I first received them, and over the entire 6 months of use, they have been really hard to charge. I use the included charger, and about 4 days out of 7, the battery dies within 10-30 minutes of my turning them on, even when I've charged overnight. I'm not sure if I got a lemon or not, but I am going to try to return these. The longest charge I've ever gotten is about 60 minutes. I would not recommend these."
522,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the sound of my Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones. For a ""sport"" headphone though, the physical quality of the product is cheap. I've had these for 5 months and the rubber around the product, where the on/off button and charging ports are, is coming apart. For a product from BOSE who prides itself on great, quality and expensive products, this is disappointing. That being said, the replacement procedure is painless - even if I have to return at my own expense.
As compared to Bowers and Wilkins wired headphones, the sound quality is right up there with B&W. I have absolutely no complaints on how they sound. The APP for these is also sub-par, doesn't really enhance the headphones in any way. I really love these for what they're intended for and am hopeful that with a replacement, I may not have the same physical appearance issues that really make this product look cheaply made.

**edited 11/27/2017 - Customer service quality is great, no questions asked my earphones were exchanged and what I thought would be at my own expense for the return turned out to be postage paid by BOSE, the sent me a return label later, I just hadn't seen it in my e-mail when this review was written."
523,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I have to say that I'm a Bose loyalist. For the price, there is nothing better. Pay more and you may get something marginally better. Pay less and you will definitely get less. I have been waiting for Bose to come out with a set of Bluetooth earbuds for years, so when I saw these I grabbed them in a hurry. The earpieces are fantastic. They stay in your ear and fit nice and snug. The new design takes some getting used to but it is worth it. The sound from these earbuds is great. They perform almost as well as my wired ones. They just down turn up as loud. They are a great gym headphone. I sweat like a pig in a bacon farm but these haven't missed a beat.

Now for the bad part. The battery life is abismal. After less than 6 weeks of use, the battery might last 2-3 hours. I charged them all night last night, unplugged them at 6:45 and when I turned them on at 7:20 the nice voice said ""connected to your phone. Battery at 60%"". 60%? I haven't turned them on. How did I use 40% of the battery? These are going to be returned and I'll continue to use my LG tonepro which sounds terrible in comparison, but who's battery lasts for 2 days of normal use. That is, until Bose can figure out how to match their battery quality to their sound quality.

Edit: So I decided to not return them and give these headphones one more chance. I should have returned them while I could. I dropped my review to 1 star. The battery has just gotten worse. I charged them all night with the plug and cable that they came with. I unplugged them and turned them on. 100%. I immediately turned them off and then immediately back on. 80%. I repeated the power cycle. 50%. In the span of 15 seconds, they went from 100% to 50%. I went to the gym and I got less than 2 hours from the battery. How does a battery end up crapping out like this in 3.5 months? Save your $150 and find a better pair of headphones. If not you will regret it 3 months later."
524,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to wait on reviewing these until I had a significant amount of use, as I've had other headsets in the past which either didn't hold up physically, or had rapidly diminishing battery performance. I'm pleased to report that the SoundSport headphones are still going strong, after months of near-daily use. I've worn them in a variety of activities, including running, biking, and just taking long walks, and the headphones never dislodged from my ears. Battery life is good - I've averaged 6+ hours of listening to music on a full charge. I've never had a phone call last more than 2 hours, but I would expect similar performance. Although the fit felt a little odd initially (they are larger than most earbud-style models I've worn), after a few sessions I became completely comfortable with them. The rocker control under the right earbud is a bit tricky, as you can't see it when you're wearing them and the contours of the buttons are not so distinctive that you can tell by touch alone if you're on the right button. Sound quality is excellent! Low range comes through with good depth and little distortion, even at high volumes. Voice performance is also great, and other callers are able to hear your voice clearly. One issue is that the microphone can be overwhelmed by wind when outdoors...but that's been my experience with every phone headset (wired & wireless), so I wouldn't consider it a knock on these. Charging is fast and easy with the mini-USB connector, and pairing to the phone (Android in my case) is simple - and the Bluetooth range before connection is lost is surprisingly good. Although these are more expensive than most other models I looked at, I'm confident the extra money was worth it. I definitely prefer them to the Plantronics BackBeat, which are similar in style & size.

Pros
- Great sound!
- Solid battery life
- Well-constructed & durable
- Remains in-place, even during intense exercise

Cons
- Larger earbud size than most models
- Some initial ""awkwardness"" in feel
- Rocker control could use more distinctive button textures"
525,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had them for two days, but I'm really happy I got them. Read all the reviews of these and others, weighed the pros and cons. I was on the fence, knowing the sound quality of my old wired version and if I wanted to upgrade. But it comes down to this for those that had the wired sound sports before, of all headphones I've had, shure, etymonics, the Bose are the most comfortable. They are not sound isolating, but they are fantastic for runs and long wear time. That considered, and any difference in sound, these are so comfortable and the perfect step from my prior wired versions. Might get the sound true for when I need quiet, but these are great and and fantastic (maybe not a good as my old shure's)."
526,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned or tried about a dozen different bluetooth earbuds, and this Bose product is the best sounding by a huge margin. I've been a part-time musician for several decades in addition to doing vintage instrument restorations; I also own specialized sound equipment and am pretty particular (probably to a fault!) about all sound reproduction equipment.

In my opinion these earbuds have the most clear, balanced response of any I have tried. They work especially well with any unit that has multi-band equalization or even simple tone controls. the treble response is never harsh; the mids are clear without any sort of ""honk"" or hollowness; and there is a ton of bass on tap - *if* you want it. The bass is never overpowering - Ive tried it with iPhones, Android devices, Macs, PC's and other gear, including a couple of sub-$10 mp3 players and it worked well with all of them. The sound quality reflects the quality of whatever is driving them, although it improves the sound of cheaper mp3 (and similar) players more than other higher-end units I've tried.

And there's one other feature that I found totally surprising - I generally get from 8-12 hours or use listening to music, watching videos etc out of a charge. I've never found anything else that worked for more than 6 or 7 hours. I also like the fact that they shut off if they aren't receiving any input for about 10 minutes or so (I haven't timed it).

They come with 3 different size earpieces. The medium ones fit me just fine and seem secure - I can't really judge them as far as use for exercise as I don't use them that way.

I don't normally write long, detailed reviews about anything - but I feel this Bose product is SO good - and more than worth the price - that I felt it important enough to review."
527,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pairing:
Pairing was great. I used them with an Android Pixel XL and no problem. Plus you can also use NFC to pair them which is a great plus.
This said, I downloaded the app and it was useless as I could not initially pair my headphones to it – it kept telling me to put them in pairing mode, which I would, but it still would not pair. I use these w/o the mobile app.

Sound:
Sound was EASILY the best of the bunch – I tried 5 headsets (see other reviews). The bass is deep. Maybe this is possible because they are so huge in your ear!

Fit:
Fit excellent once on the ear – also the best of all I tried. Super fast and easy to put in and out and I love the clip on the back to ensure you don’t loose them. I lost my last set (Epic 2s) because although they were wrapped over my neck, I forgot about them and they fell off. Use the clip!

These are HUGE buds though. Silly Huge. But the trade off is the great sound i guess.

Call Quality:
I know its not their primary function but call quality (on receiver end) was terrible. It seems there is no mic function at all I have to hold the phone up to my face, which defeats the purpose of hands free.

Overall, of all the sets I tried, these were the ones I picked. As a bonus I got a cyber Monday deal and got them for $99!

My only complaint (other than call quality) is I wish they were slightly smaller, and the battery lasted longer. It seems to drain much faster than all the others I tried.

I have also tried Apple Airpods, Bose Soundsport, Epic 2 BT, and the LG HBS730, and Jaba Elite. See other reviews, but the bose were my final choice with the Epic a close second."
528,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd try at some decent running/working out headphones. I originally bought Plantronics waterproof at Costco and I just couldn't really hear above the other noises in the gym. The product wouldn't go loud enough. Returned those to Costco and bought Jayhawks bluetooth when they were $50 off. Those sounded tweetish even with all the different sound modes on the app, it hurt my ears, returned them. We have Bose speakers/home theater system so I decided to try the wireless Soundsport headphones. What a relief! They are loud enough, they have clear sound with adequate bass. They are not noise cancelling, but I don't hear anything else when I'm at the gym. They do the job very well with all kinds of music. I am happy!"
529,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the sound. I have other Bose products and I am a big Bose fan. But these do not stay in the ear sufficiently on long runs. They come with three different size earpieces and none work for me, although my wired Bose earbuds have never slipped once in the couple years I have had them. Additionally- WOW the Bluetooth is weak!!! Just google the Bluetooth problems with these headphones- it is even well documented on Bose’ support website. The Bluetooth receiver is on the right side so if you phone/watch is on the left- good luck. Good luck even if it was next to the right earbud!"
530,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Used these for over 2 months now.
Sound: Good enough for me. Not a sound junkie. Block out a good enough noise but not all. You can hear wind while running outside.
Connection: No issues with iPhone 6S, iPad Gen 3, and Macbook Pro.
Fit: Fit in ears well when not exercising. Sweat makes them slip out a bit when I run. Only complaint.
Battery: I think I get about 5-6 hours. Never use more than 1 hour at a time. Usually charge 1x a week.
Phone calls: Clear. person on other end hears a lot of noise on my end.

Overall: good headphones. $150 may be a little too much for these considering they slip out of my ears while running. May want to look else where if you plan to run in these."
531,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had these SoundSports for a week or so and so far so good. The sound is excellent and true with a good amount of bass coming through. The seal afforded by the ""ear wings"" add the thump and seal the outside ambient noises out. I do wish they were smaller but its something I can live with. Tried Apples' Air Pods but these are BOSE and definitely sound better... Love all things BOSE.. they never disappoint!! RG"
532,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE THESE! Let me count the ways: I went on CNET.com to find the BEST headphones (after being disappointed with a crappy pair that I bought here trying to save $). These SOUND AMAZING. And they FIT in my ears a completely new way: they sit in my ear, snugly, without feeling like my finger is stuck deep in my ear (if that makes sense). But I can still have a conversation at the gym; ideal. I LOVE them being cordless -- omg, to be on a spin bike and not worried about the distance from my phone, lol. And... HEART-RATE MONITOR -- I thought that would be a tedious set-up and I would never use it? Wrong -- I'm pedaling along looking at my heart-rate go up and down in real time! And get this: even the little pouch it comes with is perfect: it's flexible so you can jam the headphones back in, and even has a carabeaner to attach it to my backpack! IF YOU""VE READ THIS FAR, you're a weirdo like me, who actually reads a lot of reviews before choosing. BUT THESE NOW! :)"
533,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound really good considering they are wireless, the bass reproduction is fantastic compared to other in-ear wireless earphones. The hardware layout is similar to other Bose products, all manual controls are on the right side, which is great if you're already accustomed to Bose. Unfortunately these do not have noise isolation or noise cancelling. Although the StayHear gel plugs have no guarantee of noise isolation they are very comfortable and stay stationary in your ear. The product itself doesn't come with a charging case which is available for another 50 dollars, so you'd need to make sure these are charged before going out for your day. These headphones support the standard (and universal) USB Type Micro-B charging.

These awesome earphones can also be paired with Bose Connect mobile app which can update the earphones to the latest firmware. But what I love the most is that the app works with other Bose products as well, such as the Bose QuietComfort 35. Unlike the Apple owned Beats brand, these headphones support reporting of battery level with supported Android devices and voice prompt of the battery during boot of the earphones. These earphones also support the AAC codec which can provide high quality audio with Apple and Android devices (if supported). If there are bluetooth inconsistencies a quick-fire way of fixing this issue would be to clear and re-pair both devices, fortunately these earphones rock an NFC pairing tag.

If you're concerned about looks... Well, these headphones are quite big but not ugly, definitely still comfortable."
534,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using these headphones every day for almost 5 months now and they work just as well as the day I received them. Making the switch to the iPhone 7, I didn't want to have to carry around the lightning to 3.5mm headphone dongle everywhere if I lost the Apple lightning headphones so I decided to make the jump and purchase some wireless headphones. I never liked the idea of the fully wireless ones (i.e. those that look like Bluetooth earpieces) so these were perfect for me.

I work a desk job that allows me to listen to music while I work so these are in my ears all day every day. They are very comfortable; I've used some headphones that have irritated my ears after a few hours but I'll wear these at work and again when I'm working out. They stay in place even while running - I think is thanks to the design of the ear pieces. While at work I'll use one side at a time and leave the other side draped over my shoulder. There are no issues with this as long as you use the provided clip that connect directly to cord. I recently broke this clip due to my own clumsiness and every once in awhile I need to adjust how it is draped so that it does not pull too tightly but it isn't anything that isn't manageable.

Battery life is exactly what I would expect for Bluetooth headphones. I get approximately 3-5 days use between charges. That is with me using these headphones for about 9 hours every day. I did not purchase the pair with the charging case so these charge via USB. I'll plug them in when I get down to about 30% battery life (which the headphones conveniently tell you in-ear when you turn them on) and I'll have a full charge in about an hour or so. They also come with a small case that is perfect to throw in your bag when you're on the go.

The microphone/volume adjust also works very well. I use the microphone daily for phone calls and the person on the other end never has any complaints about the sound. I was told that the sound is clear and it amplifies so that you can be heard.

I definitely recommend these headphone for anyone that doesn't want to be tethered to their device! The sound is excellent and they are very comfortable.

Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones, Aqua"
535,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got these in yesterday so I can’t write a great review YET.
First, I can’t believe I spent $200 on a pair of headphones but I do use my headphones a LOT so I was able to justify the splurge.
This is the first pair of “high end” headphones that I’ve bought so my experience is limited. I’m comparing mostly to LG HBS850.
The first thing I noticed was how big the ear pieces are. They are pretty large and protrude out of your ears quite a bit. The LG ear piece is tiny in comparison(see image). I thought there would be no way the things were staying in my ears, however, they are MUCH more comfortable than the LG ear pieces. I didn’t even realize how uncomfortable the LGs were. The Bose ear piece doesn’t actually go inside your ear canal like the LG does. With this type of earpiece, the Bose is not quite noise canceling(nor is it supposed to be).
Some of the reviews say the Bose don’t get loud enough. Since they don’t actually go inside the ear canal and create a seal like the LGs and other internal earbuds do, it does seem like they don’t get quite as loud, however, they do get plenty loud. They just don’t get so loud that it hurts. If you want that, youu probably should go with the Beats.
They connected to my iPhone 7 effortlessly. A mere click( we’ll more of a mushy push) of the power button and voila there it was on my phone.
Then came the sound test. Oh my goodness!! They sound amazing. I can’t believe the difference in the sound quality between these and the LGs.
It’s like the difference in monaural and stereophonic sound. The bass is very strong. I’m no techy person so I can’t really go into detail about how great the sound is but it is amazing.
So that’s about all I can say for now. I will update more about the quality after I’ve used them for a while."
536,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a very loyal Bose buyer. I've found that their quality is always really great, and their customer service is always helpful in trying to make things right. But the battery life on these headphones is so bad. I don't know that I can listen to them on the way to work, turn them off, and have enough battery to make it home at the end of the day. Even after leaving it at a full charge over night, when I remove them from the charger, it says I have a charge of 90%. I just removed them from the charger after 7-10 hours. Another really annoying feature is when you are listening to anything, the automatic voice will chime in to let you know you've connected to another device -- or has disconnected. It's just a bumbling interface with very poor battery life. I should have just gotten the AirPods."
537,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound: 5
Design/Use: 2
Battery: 1

I have the wired sound sport model but upgraded because my new iPhone doesn’t accept the audio plug without an adapter.

Sound:
As I would expect from Bose, the sound is full and fantastic!

Use:
It feels bulky in the ears, much heavier than the wired version, and easily falls out unless wedged in well. I wear the buds around my neck so it has support (and so it won’t fall to the ground if it falls out of my ears) but it often gets caught, pulls, then falls out of the ears—especially with only one in the ear.

The earbuds also have a general Bluetooth issue, where it doesn’t always ring in the ear with an incoming call and often requires me to click my iPhone audio button and select “Bose soundsport” when accepting calls. I don’t know whether this issue stems from poor Bluetooth protocol implementation by Bose or by Apple, but it defeats the purpose of “hands free.”

Battery:
A couple months in and the battery dies after three to four hours, which, in my opinion, isn’t heavy use . This disappoints me the most out of its issues."
538,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the headphones over six months now and i love them, they have great sound and they fit my ears really well and there is no irritation even after all day use. I am currently on my second pair after my other pair went nuclear, I answered the phone one day with the headphones and they went haywire. I had what sounded like Morris code in my left ear and they refused to charge. I contacted Bose, by email, and after 24hrs i received a response. I tried all of their recommendations for fixes and none of them worked so they sent me a new pair. All of this took about a week. Their customer service was excellent.

The only complaint that i have is the clip that attaches to your shirt, which is extremely necessary if you do not have both earpieces in, is easy to loose. I have already lost the new one i got a month ago. It really needs to be permanently attached to the headphones some how.

I have had other brands of wireless headphones before and they have all fallen apart after a year (literally fallen apart). The Bose headphones have been able to handle my work environment,contractor and house remodel-or, with little to no problem."
539,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are (almost) absolutely perfect. They sound better than my Jaybirds BlueBuds X and my old wired pair of Bose headphones. They are SUPER comfortable. Easy to use. They're super light in my ear and I never worry about them falling out. The SoundTrue tips from my old Bose headphones fit and worked perfectly, but made the sound a bit tinny, which is fine because I found these new SoundSport tips that came with the headphones to be more comfortable and sound better, but they do block out more noise. They aren't noise cancelling but don't expect to be able to have a conversation while wearing these. The wire is a bit thin so time will tell how it'll be hold up to wear and tear, and the volume/play buttons are a bit mushy, which isn't a complaint, I just prefer something more clicky. I'm guessing it's mushy because it's rubber for the water resistance. My biggest complaint, which is still a small one, is that the 6 hour battery life seems a bit short. They probably would've had to do something like the LG Tones do for more battery, so I'm okay with how they did it.
All in all, I'm VERY happy with these. The thing that matters most is that they sound good, and they sound amazing."
540,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I come from an era where earbuds were supposed to be annoying. If you didn't feel them plugging your ear, they needed to be shoved in so they were that much more uncomfortable. That's why I thought these Bose SoundSports didn't fit me! Sure, I heard my podcasts better than ever (as well as any noises that walkers of dogs in the early morning should be aware of), but I kept trying to push them into my ear. Why? Because they were too comfortable!

When I finally figured out they they weren't going to fall out, I realized they were SUPPOSED to be comfortable and began to enjoy these little beauties. And enjoy them I do!

I often forget that I have earbuds in my ears, which makes me wonder where the voices are coming from! No, really, these earbuds are light, comfortable, and completely secure as they rest in your ear. (Please note that I am almost 60 years old and do not engage in anything more strenuous than walking uphill at a brisk clip. I cannot attest to their stick-in-your-ear-persistence if your thing is doing backflips on a trampoline. Just saying...).

As for sound quality, features, and the like, again, I'm from the era of transistor radios and VHS tapes. All I can say is that the sound is great and even I figured out how to use them with no help from anyone (including Google). Bose has, once again, lived up to it's well-deserved reputation."
541,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these 5mos ago and gave an initial 5 ☆ rating. Mostly for sound. Bose has superior sound no two ways about it.
What Bose does not have is the ability to build a pair of head phones that last longer than 6mos. This is the 2nd pair (last pair was wired) of head phones from Bose that I've paid at least $100 for to take a dump on me within the 1st 6mos of use.
The rubber around the right earbud separated from the hard plastic housing, causing the power button to no longer turn off the unit.
The play button on the in-line control, squishy at best to start with, became completely useless. Also the molding cup on the left earbud wire, where the wire enters the speaker housing came loose and slipped down the wire. ANNOYING!
The clothing clip, which they only provide one, broke within the 1st 2wks. Then they expect you to pay another $12 for a replacement!
For $149.00 before tax or S&H this is completely unacceptable. Bose should do better.

While I'd like to NOT recommend these, I cannot. The sound, comfort of fit and ability to remain in-ear no matter what, makes up for the other short comings.

I do however recommend the purchase of the Asurion 4yr protection plan for another $12. Trust me, it will come in handy! Just filed a claim yesterday, and will receive my new pair today! All thanks to Asurion, not Bose, mind."
542,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones provide very good sound quality. The bluetooth link to my computer usually maintains a decent connection even when out of line-of-sight. The only real complaint I have is that the rubber ear inserts begin to hurt my ears after an hour. Otherwise, I would rate them 5 stars.

Problem: I ordered the Bose SoundSports on December 6, 2016, and toward the end of October the rubber seal that covers the on/off switch and usb charging port pulled away from the headphone. Consequently, I was unable to turn the headphones off or on without pulling the rubber seal out of the way to depress the on/off switch.

Bose Customer Support: On November 6, 2017 I contact Bose customer support and the rep stated that they would replace my expensive headphones free of charge, shipping label to be sent, and I will return the defective headphones to Bose. Once they receive the headphones, the new replacement will be sent to me.

Problem Solved: Since I had the headphones under a year, I was hopeful that I could get a replacement and Bose did not disappoint. Thank you, Bose. Excellent support."
543,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd have to agree with a lot of more detailed reviewers: Sound is awesome, bass is not overpowering but does leave you wanting more volume. Fit was fine for me but did note the cable tends to pull to the side of the controller (right)...fixed by using the clip at the back of your shirt. I returned mine due to the choppy BT signal (while jogging/running) when pulling my iPod Nano out of my pocket. Just that short distance caused the spotty BT connection until returned to my pocket. I expected better from Bose. So until a more solid wireless BT product comes to market, I'll continue to use my ""wired"" Bose headphones."
544,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to setup, apps work great, auto firmware update worked just fine. I'm an ""audiophile"" and the $39 set of wireless waterproof bt earbuds were just *terrible* so I decided to fetch these (and return the others). The Bose pair have the added advantage of heart rate monitor, which is perfect for me on my bike commute to work (although there's a saftey concern of not hearing what's around you, so I will likely keep the volume down).

Overall have been listening for an hour and am really enjoying this even at my desk (instead of my $600 headphone amp plus magnaplanar headphones). Lots of detail, lots of bass, and pretty good sound for in ear monitors. Impressed.

Highly recommended thus far."
545,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My review is going to be brief for now but this was one of the best audio-related purchases I've made in recent years. I was having a hard time deciding between the Jaybird X3s and the Bose SoundSports but I'm glad I went with the SoundSports instead. The battery life on the X3s is one hour better than the SoundSports however ability to charge the SoundSports with any micro-USB cable is a huge plus. I don't have to worry about remembering to bring an adapter everywhere I go

As for sound, these definitely have the quality I've come to expect from Bose. I have some very expensive Sennheiser open and closed over-ear headphones at home (that cost $250 or more) and while the SoundSports may not sound as good as those I was very impressed at the audio quality with them being wireless.

I decided to include a SquareTrade 4-year warranty when I purchased these due to some of the durability concerns I've seen so only time will tell how they fare in that regard."
546,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are outstanding. I upgraded from my other Bose headphones (with the connection wire) when my phone's headphone jack broke and I could not be more pleased with the results. In addition to the convenience of being wireless, these do a better job of blocking out outside noises - a huge issue for me as a commuter on noisey public transit.

I docked one star only because of the battery length. The headphones alert you what the % of battery is left, which is helpful, but I don't think the 6 hours is very long, especially for travelers.

It arrives in a pretty swanky box, adjustable ear inserts of various sizes, a carrying case, and suggests you download a mobile app for various connectivity benefits. I am unsure of what those are at the moment, but did so in the event of software updates (Don't want to get burned in the future!), Which took 20 minutes, but was very easy."
547,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is very good, but there was no way I could keep these snugly in my ears with any reasonable amount of movement. Tried all three sizes of the ear things, and none worked for me.

I admittedly have an ear shape that is apparently hard to fit, so this issue probably doesn’t exist for most people.

The main issue is the weight. The Bluetooth technology is housed in the earbuds themselves, which makes them fairly heavy...hence the issue.

The search continued for good quality wireless earbuds that I can actually use. Until then, I’ll have to stick with my wired Bose earbuds."
548,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are definitely far more comfortable than the Jaybird X2 I purchased them to replace. The silicone is soft, fits nicely in my ear, and stays put for the duration of my workouts. Although it is not featured in any of the photos, nor mentioned in the manufacturer info, there is a small clip that's attached to the cord and allows you to connect it to your shirt. This keeps the cord centered, and prevents an excess of cord on either side from pulling the ear piece. This tiny feature is worth its weight in gold.

The only problem I have with the SoundSport wireless is the power button. It is extremely finicky, and often I'm unable to turn it on and off on the first attempt. Beyond that one annoyance, these are my favorite headphones for working out. The sound is good, they don't let in much ambient noise (considering they are not intended to block incoming noise), and are really, really comfortable. I recommend them!

Just remember to charge them between workouts and you'll be pleased. I can get through almost 100 miles of cycling on the same charge."
549,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These babies sound AWESOME. I recently used the Powerbeats2, but after a little over a year, they died on me. Amazon was nice enough to refund me, and I decided (from reading multiple reviews), that the Bose SoundSport were a good choice for me. I am very satisfied that I went with them! Their sound, especially the bass, is by far better than the Powerbeats2. The fit is also really nice, considering I have glasses, so the Powerbeats were a bit annoying. The SoundSport fit nicely in my small ears, and do not shift at all. I will definitely recommend to anyone looking for wireless headphones for every day life or working out!"
550,5.0 out of 5 stars,"where to begin? these things suck, the sound is alright but the battery isn't worth a good god damn. after you charge them on your computer for a while and put them in your ear to turn them on it will tell you ""battery 100 percent"" ok great right? so turn them off then go to the gym but when you step on the treadmill and put them in your ear and turn them on it will tell you ""battery 70 percent"" well how in the F did i lose 30 percent of the battery while they were turned off and not being used? they will also fall out of your ears if you are sweating profusely or working out really hard and fast, i should have stuck with the beats by dre that malfunctioned after about a year of having them i never had a problem with those until they all the sudden stopped working at around the 1 year mark. so in closing dont buy these headphones, the battery sucks and doesnt EVER hold a charge and its hard to get them to stay in your ears."
551,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for Bluetooth earbuds to use with my new iPhone (that doesn't have a headphone jack), and considered several options that are less expensive and all have great reviews. However, I have had two pairs of wired Bose earbuds in the past and they always have GREAT sound and have lasted a LONG time. I had to go with my instinct and pay more for a pair of Bose again, and I'm not disappointed. The other brands would have probably been fine, but Bose has the best sound and quality, and that does cost a little bit more! These are comfortable, don't fall out of my ears, the sound is outstanding both for my music and phone calls (as well as for the people on the other end of the call). People usually don't even realize that I'm using headphones! My recommendation...spend a little bit more on your earbuds! These are worth the investment, and you won't need to replace the cheaper ones in six months."
552,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
*Good sound - Seem balanced to my ears, and I’ve been called fussy.
*Comfortable - almost as though they aren’t there.
*Secure - Ran 4 miles, got sweaty, and the headphones didnt move around.
*Adequate battery life - 3 hours took them down to 40% battery
*Seem well-built
*Intuitive controls
*Was told my voice came through clearly on multiple calls

Cons:
*Wish isolation was better.
*Comply does not make replacement tips
*Not inexpensive (but they are good)
*Kind of big - others can’t miss seeing them if I’m wearing them!

Needed a pair to go running with and to use at work and around the house. Will never be confused with my Sennheiser HD650 or other full-sizes cans (or even my nice Audio Technica earphones), for sound quality, but a very pleasant and accessible sound signature. I like them a lot!"
553,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good:

- Connectivity is solid. Much better than similar Jaybirds and Beats.
- Sound is slightly above average Beats, way way way higher than Jaybirds.
- Carrying case is small and zippered, unlike competitors that have embarrassingly large and useless cases (Jaybird) or open and rubbery cases (Beats)

Bad:

- Extremely loud and annoying beeps every time you connect or reach max volume. The Bose Connect app lets you turn off annoying voice feedback but the beeps remain.

- The fit is terrible -- much worse than competitors. This is in part due to the extra bulk of the headphones. But it could've been solved with offering customers more sizes for the rubber inserts. Right now, there's a huge jump between medium and large sizes so there's no real way to get a good fit that doesn't leak a ton. Both my girlfriend and my brother can't use this for the exact same reason -- so I know it's not just my idiosyncratic ears."
554,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After 9 months of frustrating use, finally died over this past weekend. Every couple weeks it would start buzzing and only stop when plugging into charger to reset it. On/off button had become harder to push because the rubber cover seems to have shifted to the side and I can't put it back in place. Now doesn't work at all because for some reason is not recognized by my multiple devices (so its the headphones, not my device). For $200 I expect them to work longer than 9 months. Other less important issues: they talk too much! when turning on to pick up a call, it says several words which means you can't hear the other person, rubber cover on the volume switch popped off and can't fix, pulse isn't taken unless the app is open and active which means no analytics/graphs - you have to be looking at the app to get info - no ability to set a target HB range while exercising. DO NOT BUY THESE - ZERO STARS."
555,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In spite of Bose's reputation, I was a bit skeptical of these headphones, not for any specific reason, but perhaps only because a link over Bluetooth did not inspire confidence in the final sound quality. Looking at the photos of the headphones, too, made me somewhat concerned that these would be a bit uncomfortable in my ear due to their design and due to my pretty sensitive ears.

Well, I was proven wrong on both counts the minute I tried these headphones. Without a doubt, these are the best earbud-style headphones I have ever heard. From the moment I started testing them out, I was extremely impressed with their clarity, dynamic range, ""presence,"" and, yes, even comfort. Most earbuds I have used over the years require a few days of use before they start to ""break in"" (and, yes, I know there is controversy about this issue, but I have experienced it myself on multiple brands of headphones at all price levels), but these sounded wonderful right from the first moment of play.

If it is helpful, let me be clear and say that I am pairing these with an iPhone X and using high-resolution (24-bit, 192kHz) files, and so some might attribute my reaction to those factors. And there is, of course, a sonic improvement with high-resolution files, and the iPhone X certainly has a good sound system. But after those initial trials, I switched to lossless rips of CD's (16-bit, 44kHz), and then, finally, to mp3 files (128 bps). Although I could certainly hear the sound quality reduce as I went ""down the chain,"" the earphones themselves continued to sound wonderful, bringing new life to even those relatively low-quality mp3 files.

All of this led me to conclude that these headphones sound so good, and are so comfortable to wear, that they are certainly best-in-class. Sure, you can spend over $1,000 on a set of earbuds, but I wonder if there might be a great diminishing of returns, where the tiniest incremental increase in sound quality carried with it a hefty, NON-incremental price hike. The sound is rich, easily covers the range from the lowest bass to the highest highs, have an exceptional presence, add no noticeable noise from the Bluetooth connection, and having a natural sonic quality that truly makes the headphones ""disappear,"" leaving only the sound. I must say again, I was deeply impressed, so much so that I will now plan to use these with many of my audio players, not just my phone.

Some of the information that is easily available in the product section I will briefly cover. The length of the cord, which goes around the back of the neck, is just about the right size so that, when you take the phones out of your ears, they hang in front of your chest, but don't go so far down that they become a nuisance. A nicely-placed small clip attaches to the back of your collar to further secure the headphones (and is easy to attach, remove, even when reaching behind you!) A very intuitive and easily-accessible volume and microphone control are on the right side of the cord in a single housing (see the photos), and a single button for on/off, paring, and charging indication are almost invisible on the one ear housing, but still easily accessible without having to look. Charging is accomplished but pulling a discreet rubber panel open on the earphone body and plugging in a micro USB cable (supplied, but perhaps too short for a lot of situations: you might want to use a different cable). Battery length is rated at about eight hours, although I have not yet been able to verify this value as of yet.

The photos of the earbuds which led me to wonder if they would be uncomfortable in my ear (the skin of my ears, including my ears themselves, are sensitive, making many earphones uncomfortable for me to wear. Bose here has done a magnificent job of developing a form fit that is both comfortable AND secure. The curved plastic you see in the photos by the earbud is actually not plastic at all, but a very flexible and gentle silicone composition. You simply put the earbud near your ear, press in and twist a little back and forth, and the curved silicone piece goes into the outer ear with just enough ""grip"" (for lack of better word) to very securely hold the earbud in place but are almost unnoticeable. In fact, since this curved silicone piece bears some of the body's weight, it turns out, unbelievably, that these are actually more comfortable than most all of my traditional earbuds which have nothing but the ear canal components (and which I have used for years because on-the-ear headphones hurt my ears in just a matter of minutes).

All I can say is that, after testing these out, I thought to myself that there is a reason that Bose has built a reputation as it has. I do not have any other Bose equipment (I did have some of their speakers back in the 1980's), so I cannot speak at all to their other devices, either good or bad. But I CAN say that these headphones have easily won me over, and I am truly impressed with their ability to put our truly good sound. Looking a bit expensive when I ordered them, I now view them as a ""bargain"" of sorts, due to their sound reproductions. Truly an EASY Five Stars, and well worth your consideration, fully understanding that headphones are a very personal choice. But I recommend you try them out if you have not already, because they truly are amazing, particularly at this price point."
556,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Needless to say the sound is just perfect. this is my 4th pair of earbuds from BOSE. I purchased this item on March 24, 2017, 40 days ago, and the earpiece started to fell apart. I am treating the headphone like a jewel (because BOSE craft jewels), I am not taking it to any gym or outdoors, just in my office or inside my home. I am kind of worry now with this purchase and I don't know how to get this resolved.

UPDATE AUGUST 24, 2017
Exactly 5 months later, happened what I supposed it will happen... No longer working!!! My humble by ACCURATE recommendation is ""AVOID THIS PRODUCT"" way too expensive to last 5 months only, at this point is my worst BOSE ever, you can consider this purchase as a scam. Very disappointed"
557,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hey, First off i love the sound that this product outputs what bose could have done better was with the appearance of this product the bulkiness of the product and with long periods of time in my ears it started to feel a bit uncomfortable they could have also reduced the weight a little bit but we can only hope for those improvements with the second generation. But other wise the headphones does well with many generes of music crisp sound with very nice bass not to overpowering out of respect the product is also great on battery life sometimes it has a hard time of staying in my ears dont know if its the weight of the product or the shape of my ears but i tend to have to fix them too many times while taking a jog or while taking a simple but for everyday i had to put these down because of it being uncomfortable but if i were you i would still give the product a chance it may work for you and not for me not every product is for everyone and i wish everyone the best ✔️"
558,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I admit to being a bit of a Bose addict and have used the noise canceling earphones for years when I workout (or travel, or need to ignore the snoring at night). I want to be able to use spotify on my phone instead of the ipod so gave these a try after trying to maneuver my phone with the wired ones and finding it cumbersome and annoying. I gave these a try and have now used them several times. Because so many reviews said the cover for the charging port fell off I tried to be very careful but I was not surprised when it popped off about two weeks in.

They fit well and are consistent with other Bose ear buds. They stay in through push ups, sit ups, cardio. The sound is great though the noise canceling buds obviously sound better.

They work.great with my Samsung and I use them in the car and at work for talking. They charge very fast and lose charge pretty quicky too but they tell you how charged they are with an easy push of a button.

They are more bulky than I anticipated, and look pretty dorky. I would have ordered the black if I realized how far they stick out.

I think the technology just has to catch up to the fashion and function--smaller Bluetooth which I'm sure is coming-- and these will be great and look great too!"
559,5.0 out of 5 stars," I bought the headphones just over a year ago, since a couple of weeks ago, when running I was able to hear some static noise just for a brief while.
Today with a charge of 40%, the earphones started emitting a high pitched buzz, even after I turned off the earphones it still could be heard.

Watch out with the Play/Skip/Rewind button, after some months it stopped responding to gentle presses and required more pressure to properly work. Also the volume down button was difficult to press, I guess the inner rubber contact mask displaced,

My next steps are going to be:
Let the battery drain so the phones can completely reset and see if the noise continues.
I was able to get a recording of the high pitched sound and attached as a video.

Edit 1:
The headphones are dead, they don't even turn on now :(

Edit 2:
Got in touch with Bose and they answered promptly, after running some more tests I was asked to return the unit and I received a new one completely free of charge. Kudos to the Bose Support team. Changing my review to 3 stars due to the fact that the new unit works perfectly and the controls feel a lot more solid than the previous ones. Will update again after 6 months of use on the new unit.

Cheers"
560,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I took off one star, only because they look a little clunky in the ear. They sound fantastic right out of the box, and are the most comfortable wireless earbuds I have found. I returned Jaybird X3's because they sounded lousy (even with the sound adjustment app), and they hurt my ears no matter what size end I used. These are much better, and much less fussy. These also stay in my ear during my workouts with zero adjustments. Wish they were made in white with gold or silver accents....these are a little more masculine in look."
561,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
- Sound quality is good
- Very comfortable
- Easy volume control, pause/play.
I listen to audio books at the gym and while biking and enjoy the comfort and sound quality.

Cons:

- No volume control for the turn on message ""BATTERY AT X PERCENT, CONNECTED TO Y DEVICE"" screaming in my ear at max volume

- Battery seems a little weak. I guess because they are so light-weight? I've only had these a few weeks and several times I go to use them and it's completely dead. Maybe 6-10 hours usage kills them?

- No rewind function. I have another bluetooth headphone w/ a forward/reverse button, I really wish these had that. Only pause/play and vol controls. No way to skip back 30s like the other brand headphones."
562,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Summery:
The thing I love about Bose products is they don't compromise on quality. There are no junk Bose products and these headphones are no exemption but don't kid yourself you pay for that quality. I'm sure there are better (or as good) headphones on the market at a better price but you'll end up spending more buying different ones until you find the perfect ones. Just buy these and be done with it.

Pros:
- The bass, my god the bass is so deep and high quality.
- Bose does all sorts of magic to make them sound great
- Heres one I didn't expect, the app is great. They didn't try and add links to facebook or other BS you don't want or need. The app updates and controls the buds. Also has some cool share music with feature but I haven't tried it.
- My ears are dysfunctional and none of the apple ones (or any other buds I've tried) will stay in my ears. These do, I can goto the gym, run or lift and they stay put.
- Super comfortable. The three ear inserts will get you the right size so you can wear them all day.
- Did I mention the bass and sound quality is 10/10

Cons:
- Battery life. It's adequate, I can get thru a day no problem but you're gonna have to charge it all the time. Welcome to our modern world of charging everything every night. The price we pay for cutting the cord.
- Bose...Why didn't you USB-C so I don't have to fight to charge the darn things.

Just buy them you will not regret it.

Picture: My good old QC15's are still kicking and I love them too"
563,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sit firmly in the ear without causing pain. A lot of earbuds can make my inner ear ache, maybe it's a moisture thing I don't know...but that doesn't happen with these. Sound quality is great. Use it mostly with my iPhone SE and have no problems, aside from it being a little frustrating to disconnect the bluetooth without turning it off in the settings (but maybe I'm missing something in the very terse manual). I mostly use them for commuting and haven't tried them with intensive exercise yet, but I have no reason to believe there'd be a problem. Has a great range -- didn't disconnect from my phone until I walked across my apartment and up the stairs. Jesus I can't believe it's taken me this long to get bluetooth headphones. So so so so worth it. Glad I was a penny wise and not a dollar foolish this time."
564,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these in early May and was very happy with them, but after a couple months of average, mostly indoor use I have noticed the rubber surrounding the power button is separating from the plastic. The sound quality remains unchanged (it's excellent), but I have owned Bose products before and I expect high quality craftsmanship from them, so I'm disappointed to see this happen and just hope it doesn't get worse. I really hate to think Amazon sold me a knock off here.

UPDATE 12/13/2017: The case kept coming apart to the point where I had to call Bose to check on the warranty. Bose's customer service was excellent and immediately sent me a replacement pair that definitely feels like the quality I would expect from Bose. This new pair feels sturdier, and a little heavier. Even the carrying pouch feels stiffer. I have seen many reviews also showing the casing come apart and it seems Amazon might've received a bad lot, so if you are having this problem, call up Bose if you are still under the warranty period."
565,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for my fiancee for Christmas. She uses them for the gym. At first I was worried they would be too big for her. They are medium sized and do stick out of the ear a bit. She actually likes that because others can see she is listening to music; a lower profile headphone might mean others would go up and start talking to her without realizing she isn't listening.

She likes the wire, as she can let them hang when she needs to - can't do that with two wireless buds. Also there isn't the issue of one bud having music and the other not having anything.

She has not reported any issues with them falling out while running or other moving exercises. I wouldn't wear these to something like Ju-Jitsu though.

This set also includes a microphone so she can talk on her phone to others. It's a nice feature but realistically not used very often.

As far as the sound goes, she says it's very clear and sounds great. I've listened to them a few times and they sound very nice. Like all headphones they lack bass; let's be honest with ourselves here - realisticallly you're not going to get that without a subwoofer.

Charge time is minimal. It has a decent battery life. She goes to the gym most weekdays and only charges it every week or so.

They are a bit pricey, but they are great quailty."
566,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can take the liberty to say that these are at par withBeats Solo 2 headphones but easy to handle and use. Beats Solo2 headphones cannot be really used for workouts as we swear a lot and that sweat stank remain on it. Secondly earphones are better than headphones but very very few earphones give you that satisfaction of pure music with bass. Bose for me will always remain the king in headphones, earphones and speakers. Nothing can match them yet. My five stars to this product. I have actually bought one more for my wife too. Value for money :)"
567,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was pretty excited about this headphone set after hearing some positive reviews from friends. However, once I got the phone I found it quite disappointing. For one thing, when you wear the headphones outdoors (i'm definitely wearing it properly and followed the instructions on how to put them on) and there's wind outside, you'll experiencing a wooshing sound created by the wind in the gap of the headphones and your ears. Makes it near impossible to wear them while going for a run.

Besides the above which is merely an inconvenience, the headphones seem fairly buggy. They drop connection every once in a while, and sometimes it will say it lost connection, interrupting the music, but it actually is still connected. That's also just an annoyance but it shouldn't be happening with headphones that cost $150.

The sound quality is pretty great, as would be expected from Bose. I'm just disappointed by their execution of bluetooth technology."
568,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been waiting for Bose to make these ever since my first wireless headphone set. They do not disappoint. I wore them for 10hrs (with a break for lunch), my ears never noticed the weight unlike my other set; which is noticeable after about 4hrs with my ears starting to ache. The battery life, comfort, and sound quality are spot on. I also like the little voice giving you a battery % update when you come back from say, lunch. For my normal 12-14hr work days, I can see buying a second pair without hesitation."
569,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound as all Bose products have, but they quit working just over three months in and won't power on at all. Customer support is good (register your product w/ Bose.com and buy cheap Amazon insurance, is I were you...) and I'm getting replacement pair. STILL, that sucks since I've barely put them through anything tough other than some running and typical workouts. They also are used while I bike in the cold but w/ facemask. No reason they should fail like that. Now, I'm stuck w/o good headphones for 2 weeks so that I can return the broken ones and get new ones. I'll update this after more time with the new ones (which come with new warranty at least). Bottom line: Bluetooth earbuds are just hit or miss and aren't the best technology at this point. Maybe in 5 years...for now, unreliable.

I've also had occasionally cutting out of Bluetooth connectivity if they are across my body in my left pocket. That's not a long distance as you can imagine. Finally, they are bigger and heavier than you'd think so can fall out under heavy stress w/ sweat combination. All of this is rare and the fit can depend on your ear, but it is an issue on occasion."
570,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones were on the brink of being returned by me. But after some tweaks to the sound source, these worked like a charm.
I had expected these headphones to have good bass with straight out of the factory settings. But the sound does need to be equalized based on your preferences. The bluetooth pairing and battery life are pretty decent and perform as per product description.
I use them at the gym and never once felt they would come out during any of my cardio or workout sessions. So far liking them.
Do they justify the price I paid.. well that is always subject to the brand value and they do seem a bit overpriced. Given the other choices I had like Jaybird and the other likes, the Bose SS do stand out.

Overall a good product."
571,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The absolute Best Bluetooth headphones I have owned to date

Pros:
• Very Comfortable
• Very Secure even in extreme movement once you choose the correct buds for your ear
• Spectacular Rich Sound
• Long Battery Life
• Work Well even during Very Sweaty workouts
• Good weight, almost unnoticeable
• Spectacular microphone for making phone calls.

Cons:
• Will sometimes unpair for no reason with the IPhone X
• I believe this next problem is due to the most resent apple iPhone update. but Since that update if my headphones unpair with my iPhone the will no longer aloe me to use the headphones as a headset until I reset my iPhone. I hope this is fixed by a software update from Apple or Bose"
572,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. I love em so much I bought a second pair and a pair for my brother. I had gone through dozens of the cheaper headphones and couldn't find anything I liked. They either didn't sound good, didn't fit right, or just plain didn't work. But I tried these on at the Bose store and instantly fell in love with them. First, the sound quality is great. Everything sounds so rich and so clear. Second, the fit is just right. The previous headphones I had would always wiggle themselves out of my right ear during a run or while I was lifting. These ones stay right where they are meant to be even during the most vigorous workouts. And lastly, they tell you how much battery power they have left when you turn them on. That may not be a selling point for some people but for me, it helped to know just how much juice I had left before I started my workout. The regret I have is that I didn't spend the money on them sooner."
573,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good and typical of what you might expect from Bose. Audiophiles might complain and say that they can get same/better sound quality for lower prices but as a layman, the Bose SoundSport Pulse headphones sound pretty good.

One complaint is that there is virtually no noise cancellation. I wasn't expecting any active noise cancellation, but there is almost no passive noise cancellation either. This can be useful for some people, like runners who need to pay attention to their surroundings. But I usually work out at the gym, where it's a bit noisy and I have to crank up the sound a bit.

The biggest negative is the heartrate monitor. It's almost worthless. I have an Android phone and tried many apps to find one that could connect to the Bose SoundSport Pulse. None connected reliably. Either they refused to connect at all (I tried many settings), or the connection was very flimsy or had other usability issues. Bose has their own app that can show the heartrate, but the app itself is feature poor with no recording or stats. I later upgraded my phone to an S8 and also didn't have much success. Eventually, I just gave up and use the SoundSport Pulse as a regular headphone.

If I had listened to the other reviewers experiencing the same issues, I would have just saved the $50 and gotten the Bose SoundSport. If you want a wireless Bose headphones for $150, go with the regular SoundSport. If you're ok with forking over $300, then I recommend the QC30. I prefer the QC30 for most uses as the added noise cancellation is makes quite a difference in noisy environments."
574,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had originally tried a pair of these that my girlfriend had. She had the small set of rubber plugs on her pair. I did not like the sound or the bass. Both were unimpressive. I then got mine in the mail. I put the large fittings on and the sound and the bass were completely different. Much much much better. As with all those products Bose offer, a solid bass and wonderful highs and mids."
575,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best headphones/earbuds purchase I’ve made in a long time. Going wireless is a big advantage for working out at the gym. These also sound fantastic. They are not “brite” sounding, rather they are warm and bassy and I like that. The fit is spot on, much like other versions of earbuds from Bose. Charging is made easy with the micro usb cable. Battery life is tough to gauge because these are my first wireless earbuds. Some people complain about the life per charge but what can you realistically expect from such a compact battery? Tip: you don’t have to plug them into a computer to charge. You can use an Apple wall adapter that comes with iPhones to charge the earbuds. It’s much faster. My only complaint which has nothing to do with the product is the ridiculously over engineered packaging and presentation. Companies know this hooks people into buying their product but I just roll my eyes. The box is oversized and indestructible. There must be $20 worth of box, packaging, graphics, etc. I’d rather see a simple box and a lower retail price. Then Bose saves money and puts the money back into research."
576,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical that these would stay in my ears given that they are larger (and I am a petite woman). However, they sit very comfortably, and stay in place during my full run without me needing to fiddle with them. The sound quality is wonderful, and makes it more enjoyable to run and listen to music without having to crank the volume to try and hear the full sound picture. They are not noise cancelling, but I wanted that for running so I can hear cars/bikers/pedestrians coming up behind me. I would recommend these to anyone - deducted one star because the battery life is not as long as some other bluetooth headphones I have (around 6 hours on average), but they charge fairly quickly so it's not a problem."
577,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best headphones I've ever owned. I'm not a massive audophile but I do prefer better sound quality and wanted something similar to my Audio Technica headphones (but wireless!) These are the perfect choice. They fit comfortably in my ears and I can wear them for hours. I travel a lot via train and flying so I make sure to charge these bad boys and bring them along with me for each journey.

I deducted a star only because of the clip on the back. It comes off very easily... Unfortunately the clip disconnected from the headphones after my flight so I lost them somewhere at the airport. I love these so much that I bought a new pair and have been very careful ever since. Keep an eye out if you take these along with you while you run or travel."
578,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The design of the packaging was simple yet refined. One way to describe it is like unboxing an Apple product. It seems modern and sleek and just a pleasure to unwrap to see what treasure lies beneath. The packaging wasn’t cumbersome; you did not have to untie a million plastic/metal ties or separate plastic to unleash the awaiting prize. The package included the ear phones, a set of small and large ear tips to go with the medium ones already on the device along with a carrying case.
At first glance these Bluetooth wireless buds looked to be bulky to include the in-line mic/volume device and heavy like a pair of cheap knockoffs I had previously ordered off of Amazon. One note on the knockoff QY7’s is that the sound quality and battery life were really not that bad, especially for the very little money that they were purchased for. The QY7’s felt bulky, heavy and made my ears hurt and feel tired after about 30 min.
I picked them up and surprisingly they felt very light albeit still bulky comparted to the Jaybird Bluebuds that I have and use as well. I left the original size medium ear tips on and placed them into my ears. They are the MOST COMFORTABLE ear buds that I have ever worn. I have used these for 2 months now. I work out 6-7 days a week doing Crossfit and training for marathons. So, I can say that I have spent many hours a week with these in my ears and they have never given me that hurting or “heavy” feeling all the other Bluetooth earbuds have in the past. On caveat that is a drawback for me is that when I work out especially in the winter; I wear a microfiber beanie hat. With these in my ears the bulkiness of them becomes a drawback leading to uncomfortableness from size if these pushing on my inner ear from the beanie. I have the Jaybirds that have a smaller form factor and do not do this when I wear the beanie. I also want to note that these NEVER fall out of my ears and I NEVER have to readjust them during exercise which is a HUGE plus for me. Just a side note; the apple earbuds DO NOT stay in my ears at all!! I have to mess with them the whole time when exercising, in fact, if they are the only ones in my gym bag I go WITHOUT!!
The material seems to be hard plastic and soft rubbery plastic that overall feels top end and has given me no issues thus far. I sweat profusely and have had no issues with sweat altering the performance of these headphones. The added clip to attach them to your shirt seems to work as intended but for me most of the time it pulls from the wire and stays on my shirt if I do not get a good grip on the actual clip.
The in-line mic and volume button has worked flawlessly for me to this point. The negative for is that it is extremely bulky as if there were a separate battery stored in there or something. I find that because of its size and heaviness it swings back and forth when I run and it can get super annoying on long runs. I don’t really notice it when doing Crossfit or lifting. The structure has held up fine with no malfunctioning parts or rips or tears as of yet. The reported sound quality of the mic from people that I have called has seemed to be good even when I am running or in the car with windows down.
Connecting these headphones to my devices was easy and painless. You can be connected to 2 devices at one time which is pretty cool. The other plus for me is that the range is outstanding. When in the gym this is awesome thing. It makes it so I don’t have to take my phone around the gym with me. I have a gym with a track around it and I can go do a lap and come back and never lose a connection. I bet it is over a 100ft away at the far end of the track.
The battery life is probably on the low end of average. You would think with the size of the earbuds and in-line mice with volume controls it would be at least 8 hours if not 10. I can almost get 4 days out of one charge, if I don’t watch Netflix or anything like that at night. One feature on the battery is that when you turn them on they have a voice that tells you how much battery life you have remaining and it is always rounded to the nearest 10%. So, if you actually had 96% battery life it would say; you have 90% battery life remaining. To some it may not be annoying but for me I want to know exactly.
Sound quality is as to be expected by Bose. It is very clear and even feeling. The highs are not too high and mids are perfectly balanced and the base is not super bassy (is that even a word). I think that someone that likes a lot of bass might be disappointed but for me it is perfect. A couple things to note is that these are not noise cancelling and are not marketed to be. These seem to have the perfect balance of passive noise meaning that when I’m running I am totally immersed into the music but when a car comes near I can still hear it. Which I find amazing!! Another thing to note is that the volume doesn’t get overly loud. What I mean by that is that it does get loud but you cannot make it SUPER loud, like it has a limit or cap on how loud you can make it. For me it seems to be just ok but I would like to have the option to make it a little louder. One last thing on sound I would like to mention is that when I’m home relaxing and I watch TV on my Ipad with my children running around I like to leave one earphone out so I can make sure I can hear everything in the house incase I’m needed. So, with that said with one earphone in the Bose experience diminishes and is less than average on the sound quality. There is some kind of “magic” that happens when both ear pieces are in but with only one the “magic” is simply gone.
Conclusions: Finally, Bose has entered the sporty Bluetooth headphone world!! Overall not bad but Bose has a lot of work to do especially at this price point. Almost wish I would have waited for the second version.
The Good: Probably the best pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones I own. The sound is amazing. Fits and stays in my ear. Super easy to pair with my other devices. The Bluetooth range is outstanding. Super lightweight although looks bulky.
The Bad: The price is on the high side for what you get compared to the current competition. Not so comfortable when wearing a beanie hat. Super bulky ear pieces and in-line mic. With only one earpiece in the sound is not that great! The Bose app really doesn’t really do anything. The battery life is marginal for this price point."
579,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are looking for a wireless headphone to use while you work out or running, stop searching further. This is it. Just for context, I own a Bose QC 35 II, a Beats 3 and a couple of other in-ear head phones. While the larger over ear headphones like the QC35 and the Beats 3 provide excellent sound quality and noise cancellation, if feel like they are big to wear, specially while working out. Some times they slide of your head while doing a bench press. The Beats is my least favorite because of the pressure it creates on my skin. When using other in hear headphones, I can still hear outside noise and the overall sound quality is average. The Bose SoundSport stands heads and shoulder above any in-ear headphones I've used in terms of audio quality. Even though noise cancellation is not a product feature, because of how these headphone sit inside your ear, they effectively block out all outside noise. They are very comfortable to wear - they come with 3 adapters that you can choose from to suit the size of you ear opening. So, it is not a one size fits all scenario. The sweat absorption is superb and it stays securely fit at all times. The charging levels last me for at least 3 gym sessions of 2 hour each and I still have some left for a weekend run. So, very practical as well. I absolutely love this headphone and is my preferred one to use when it comes to working out."
580,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel unfair giving it anything less than 5 stars because it is an awesome product and produces amazing sound. However, personal preference gives way here. My Beats in ear sport headphones broke and I purchased a protection plan from Amazon. Come to find out, Amazon no longer sold beats headphones (that I wanted) so I got these instead. Sound is clear and loud. Personally, I am a fan of heavier bass than treble. These Bose headphones do pack a powerful bass, but I never heard a quality bass like those in the Beats. I am keeping these Bose headphones and have no issues with them while out and about. When I get home though, I put my wired beats on. (don't even have to actually wear them, you can hang them around your neck and the sound can be heard rooms over)."
581,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these new on Amazon. After charging my new SoundSports, I attempted to pair to my iPhone 6 Plus. My phone, which has successfully paired to many other Bluetooth devices, does not see the SoundSports headphones unless I reboot my phone first. Really annoying. Sending them back for a refund."
582,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these! The sound is fantastic. I'm sitting at the gym using them for the first time- I haven't done my HIIT yet so that will be the true test to see if they stay in. I have small ears but the small fitting seem to feel secure. My only negative- they stick out so far!! I actually noticed someone else with them at the gym (a man) and the reason I could identify them was bc they stuck out from his head too! They def have more substance than small ear buds- you can't see the ""stick out "" that great in this picture but I don't sit at the gym and take 20 selfies! Will update after I do cardio about how well they stay in"
583,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to like these since they had good reviews, and I love the Bose IE2 headphones I've been using for 5 years.
I got these to go with my Pixel 2, which has no headphone jack.
Complaints:
* The fit somehow amplifies some sounds when music is off, e.g. I can feel a pressure difference with every step I take, and I hear myself breathing in a weird way
* They take forever to connect to my phone sometimes. One day it's fast, another day I power cycle them 3x and wait ~10s each time with no music
* They stick out too far, and the pressure change is disconcerting if you touch them. Bumping them on something would be unpleasant"
584,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones were easy to connect to the galaxy phone i have. The bose software easily recognized the headphones and connected. I won't make it too technical as im not an avid audiophile. The comfort is very nice and adjustable since it comes with the different size earbuds. I have run up to 8miles with the headphones on and they did not shift or become uncomfortable. The battery power has not completely depleted during any of my runs. I have used it 4 times a week for about an hour each time and it worked great each time. The controls are pretty easy to use and strategically located on the cord for easy reach. It's a great sports headphone for the intermediate workout enthusiast. The sound quality is great, the base and mid-tones allow for the wide range of sound to be enjoyed during your workout and the design , while not noise cancelling, produce a nice seal to keep out noise."
585,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones from Bose are comfortable and stay in my ear unlike many others, but also the trick is to wash your ears and dry them before you put them in, it's also good for your hygiene! However, battery lasts like few hours. I got replacement for the first one as it kept loosing connection with the phone. They look kind of bulky but who cares if they function mostly well and are comfortable."
586,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The best feature of Bose in-ear headphones continue to be the (StayHear) tips. They're by far the most comfortable on the market and lock headphones into your ears for an amazing fit. I personally can't stand regular earbuds that are just inserted into your ear canal.

Very easy Bluetooth pairing and they sound great. The medium buds were the best fit for me. I can see where sweat can loosen the fit if you sweat a lot, but the silicone ear locks do a great job of keeping these buds in your head. The neck band / cord is shorter than a lot of neck buds, but I'd rather have less cord hanging than not. Plus, these buds look reasonably sporty and not tacky.

Overall very satisfied with the product. Small complaint is microphone tech still isn't the best for price. Wish it came with a charging case for added convenience - it does come with a cloth case."
587,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have never purchased a Bose product I have not liked. The quality is there, the look is nice and they work. Maybe it is the fit but these are the best! Plus I like to have some control through the app. The only thing I would like to see improved is the flap that goes over the charging port can be a little difficult to open and I always feel like I am going to rip it off - even though I never have."
588,5.0 out of 5 stars,Been using these everyday for a year now and I'm glad to have headphones that can actually withstand sweat/water. I was stupid enough to buy 2 sets of beats wireless headphones before these (I replaced what I thought was just a bad unit). Beats are worthless because they break after maybe a month of gym use. Never again.
589,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for my fiancé because the mic on his iphone is damaged and he had been coveting my wireless VModa Crossfades. He needs to be able to multitask and talk for his day job in real estate- but as a DJ he also requires beautiful clear, crisp, balanced sound when casually listening to music. Enter these.
He has very fancy wired headphones, but he needed to replace older earbuds. We live in nyc where portability is key, and he's thoroughly impressed by their comfort, compact style and usability. They fit his needs perfectly and he couldn't be more pleased. The bluetooth receiver is strong, he can hear calls clearly and he was surprised by the clarity of sound wirelessly."
590,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fine. I struggle with headphones in this style because I have very small ears. Jaybirds were a fail for me so I used a pair of cheapo TaoTronics wireless headphones with the over hear hooks which worked really well. I wanted better quality headphones so I went with these. The smallest ear tips work ok, but they don't feel super secure. They work fine for my purposes but I wish they fit better. Also, the sound is great but it's not loud at all. Unsure if this is a safety feature or what, but it is loud at the gym and these headphones don't block out the noise. I'm keeping them, but my cheap TaoTronics are better. Oh well."
591,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Long battery life, awesome sound, seamless Bluetooth connecting with excellent range
Cons: Initial setup required some troubleshooting to get the volume right, see my review for the solution

These wireless headphones have exceeded my expectations. I use these in an ""open"" office, so half cubicle walls, with everyone's voice being audible from across the room. Working in IT, I need an isolated feel to focus on my work, these headphones do that job very well. I had some initial trouble with the volume, as have several others who have purchased them recently, but there's an easy fix for it. The Bose has an independant volume control from your phone that you wouldn't expect. So upon initial connecting, the volume will sound very low, just use the manual volume up buttons on the wire itself and raise the volume. Suddenly you have the best sounding wireless headphones on the market, with good passive noise cancellation. Even unpowered they muffle surrounding noise sources enough that I can't make out speech. Battery life runs about 4.5 - 5 hours, with about a 1 hour charge, time, not bad at all. The headset is also excellent for calls, and connects seamlessly to both my laptop, and my phone. As stated initially I use these for office use primarily, however I also take occasional walks while wearing to stretch my legs. They stay firmly placed in your ear, and I can definitely see these working for running. Overall I'd highly recommend these, they sound excellent, are very comfortable and stay in place. I can wear them for 3 hours straight without any comfort issues."
592,1.0 out of 5 stars,"AWESOME! Just opened the box hit one button nice voice said 50% charged connected to my phone and was testing the sound with the who ""imminent front"" and WOW. sound was better than concert and clean, perfect bass.... tried jayz 99prob... better than i could have imagined.. wort every dollar.. Cant wait to wear them training hard at the gym tomr..
I tried many before and tested many in stores but these to me atlest kicked my ass. love these.. also the quality, packaging etc like your getting a Roll Royce. Bose nailed it! I would buy more if i had more heads haha"
593,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are top-notch. I highly recommend that you purchase these. Don't worry about those Jaybirds.

I bought the Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones about 3 months ago, and I have thus far had no issues with it. I use these headphones every single day for about 3-4 hours, as I use them for working out as well as entertainment video watching. The headphones are indeed water-resistant; I sweat like a waterfall during the two hour sessions in the gym. The build is rugged, and the cord is nice and thick. Based off of my experience, the battery lasts about 6 hours on a full charge.

As to my knowledge, the Bose SoundSport Wireless headphones are the best headphones in the market - the only reported downside being the fact that it is somewhat bulky. I retort that argument with the question: why does one even care? These headphones are the best in the market, and no one in the gym is going to care that the headphones are large; in fact, I perceive many people sporting the exact same headphones all around.

These headphones ARE NOT for any activity that may cause excessive wind (biking downhill, downhill skating, etc.). The wind will prevail over the audio dispersing from the headphones. However, if conditions are safe, one can turn their head to either side and the music can then be heard.

All in all, purchasing these headphones is a no-brainer. There is top quality, build, and sound. What else could one ask for?

Best,
Jerry.

I will update this review during the coming few months."
594,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, they are bigger than other bluetooth earbuds, but once you put these in your ears you won't care if they had rainbow disco balls on the ends. The sound is INCREDIBLE, and that's likely due to their size.

PROS:
- THE SOUND
- Comfortable
- Lightweight
- Sturdy mic/remote
- Pairs quickly
- Has an on/off/pair button (can't tell you how the lack of such a button frustrated me with my last bluetooth headphones)

CONS:
- A little bulky for earbuds
- Can't use them all day without charging (battery lasts most of a work day)

The cons are so minor as to be negligible though. Did I mention they sound amazing?"
595,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great!! The middle size ear things fit just right in my ears. They rest there in the front part of my ears and just blow that Bose speaker sound into my head! I have no problem working out with them on. I have never had them slip. First I had the over ear blue tooth bose but they weren't right for the beach and didn't fit well on the plane with a cap on (bald head). The buds solved all of that. People tell me the microphone sounds good on calls and they control my old ipod nano and my android phone. Not noise cancelling but the ear thing and the bose speaker sound makes them seem like it. Easy to pair with voice prompts. That little clip on the back helps too.
596,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these beauties in Citron (Cyber Monday for $99, now $129 thru 12.30.17 and then back up to $149) and so glad I did! I am a jogger and live in Phoenix, AZ so not much humidity but I do sweat and these are truly sweat proof The last 3 pair of headphones were Plantronics BackBeat Fit and while they louder and have more bass I didn't notice how heavy they were until I got the Bose. The Plantronics are great at $89 but these are a splurge at $149 The Bose SoundSport are very clear and have more accuracy but not as loud. They will not fall out of your ears and I have very small ears. They come with 3 sizes of earpieces S, M & L. I am using the Small. If the price is stopping you I highly recommend the Plantronics they are the best kept secret for $80 everyday and they are fantastic. Hope this review helps with your decision.

597,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Only knocking 1 star off right now for changing the style of the ear piece. I loved the Bose SoudSport in-ear headphones for Samsung & Android that I purchased last year. They came with 3 different sized rubber ear pieces but I didn't have to try the L or S. The mediums worked great.

Now Bose made BT so I decided to go wireless. I can't comment on the battery life or how it really sounds with a phone call. But I can review the connecting to devices, comfort, and sound listening to music.

Connecting to my Samsung Galaxy s7 was simple once you download the Bose Connect app.
Music is pretty much all treble or highs. No bass or lows can be heard at all to me but that is expected with headphones.

Biggest gripe is the comfort. Bose changed the style of the ear pieces. I used the medium (M) sized piece that were already on them. They stayed in my ear perfectly but after maybe 20-30 mins of listening to music, my ears were bothering me. I had my wired Bose headphones with me so I decided to see if those ear pieces would fit on the BT before I tried the S or L sized that came with them.

As you can see in the pictures attached, the white ear pieces from the wired set fit just fine on the BT. I then put the S black ear pieces on my wired headphones but noticed that the S is a little loose in my ears compared to the M sized pieces.

I may update later with further review but these will never get 5 stars b/c the style of the ear pieces were changed. Hopefully I won't have to subtract any stars either."
598,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth every penny. Just do it. Stop wasting your time debating if it's worth the $$. YES. It is. I googled it, read all the reviews, slept on it and now with product in hand it seriously puts a smile on my face hearing the music quality. If you love music and love getting lost in the sound this is worth it. The set is secure in your ear, it even has a clip if you're a runner. It comes with 3 size ear pieces so you'll get the custom fit. It's hard for me to spend money on things like this but I'm sold. The sound is amazing. Get lost in the sound!"
599,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying I have small ears. Not like abnormally small but the apple earbuds don't fit in my ears, they just fall out small. I purchased The Beats sport earbuds and these to see which I liked better. The Bose were superior in every way that mattered to me. First, the sound was superior, the Bose have a rich full sound and the Beats were hollow. Second, the fit. The Beats had a seam on the earbud that was very irritating to my ear, the over ear part was also too large. The Bose fit very comfortably and stay put no matter how much I am sweating. The battery lasts forever as long as you remember to turn them off again when you're done. These are the best headphones I've ever had by far."
600,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far these seem to have a very good battery life after reaching full charge. I like the volume controls built into the cord. It also comes with 3 different ear piece adapters should you have rather large or small ear canals making it work for anyone. The only thing I don't like is that I've had other brands that are 40% cheaper but have similar sound quality. Bose has always been overpriced but I went ahead and got them hoping their overall quality and craftsmanship will keep them working longer than the cheaper brands. Sound quality difference is zero in my opinion.
601,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because I was a big fan of the Bose wired headphones. These headphones have decent sound quality, but are very bulky and the weight constantly pulls the headphones out of my ear. Additionally, I have connection problems ALL THE TIME. All of my other bluetooth headphones connect with no problem; however these never seem to connect. After turning my phone and the headphones on and off dozens of time, it eventually connects at random.

Overall, these are okay, but there are much better options out there for a fraction of the price."
602,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Updating my rating to 1 star. Used one time and now they won't turn on even though fully charged.

Heart Rate vs Chest Strap Heart Rating Monitor: I compared the accuracy of these headphones against the accuracy of a heart rate chest strap (I was using the Wahoo Tickr) monitor. Here is what I found: during a 50 minute elliptical workout the heart rates either matched exactly or were one beat off (for example 161 vs 160). But at the end of the workout the average heart rates MATCHED EXACTLY. this gives me confidence that I'm getting an accurate read.

I'm going with 4 starts as the volume tops out even when I woudl like to turn them up a bit higher.

Also, I'm using the medium size tips and they are just not all that comfortable. I know I have them in vs just forgetting that I have headphones in"
603,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Skeptical at first, although I'm not sure why I was, Bose makes quality products and the Powerbeats 3 were getting bad reviews. These are wonderful! Sound is clear, and if you pick the correct in ear size of tip, they WILL NOT move during whatever workout you are doing! I run 2 miles + a day in these, and even with sweat in my ear, they stay in place and I can hear great. I also run next to a busy highway and I don't hear the cars either. These are great quality, the ONLY thing I'll say is that the outer ear bud sticks out slightly from your ear, if you like a flatter side, then you may be slightly saddened with these, but the quality and sound make up for it! Thanks Bose!"
604,2.0 out of 5 stars,"To those who don't think this is not the bose sound, I would say, at beginning, it wasn't even 10% of the bose sound quality I expected, I almost returned it but heisted. as many may know, audio products needs some time running before it can get into the good state, headphones usually takes total 96 hours to start perform better, it is a tough job for a battery operated one, so it took me almost a month listening to the bad sound now and then before I started to realize it is producing the bose sound eventually

While it is still not the best-bose-sound, I'd agree it worthies $100+ probably, and giving the rest of $50 to the bose name,
I wished at the beginning to give the rest $50 to the umbrella design but it didn't work for me, it puts a lot of pressure in the ear tunnel so that it feels bad if I wear it for long, so 4 starts"
605,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I'd say I'm pretty disappointed. The headphones are just ok- I love cycling and these headphones are fine while sitting at my desk at work, but during active outings like running or cycling the wind greatly affects the sound quality. Sometimes I feel like I can barely hear my music. I kept them for a couple months hoping my overall opinion would change, but it hasn't and I wish I could return them. I've always used Bose products (even my Audi SUV has Bose surround sound) but there aren't worth the money. Also- you can't take calls on these-I'll be selling these and purchasing the Apple AirPods."
606,3.0 out of 5 stars,"compared to jaybird..it was more comfortable. But given I live in cold weather I need to put a hat on when I'm out. A lot of time headphone falls off. That why I took one star off.

The battery is pretty good. I used three days without charging. (commute about 2 hours every day)

After three months usage:
I only use 2hours, three four days out of a week. the battery isn't last for a day without charging.
Jaybird I've never had this problem...I'm going to contact the company and see what they can do for this product.

I will be posting once I receive any response from Bose"
607,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds sound great, and are quite comfortable. Since I have hair that goes past my ears, the large size doesn't matter. They don't show at all. I often wear these while riding my bicycle, and like to use them to use map guidance. They work great for that, and because there is no cord, I can leave my phone (iPhone) safely tucked into my bike bag. I like the clip that attaches the cord to my shirt. I've never lost the earbuds, but this gives it a bit more security. The only thing that would be better, is if the battery were a little more long lasting. I will have to look into acquiring the battery case to deal with that issue."
608,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the SoundSport for 10 months on and off now and they are already falling appart. I would say that the use I have put on these unit has been low, and the rubber on both the right and left ear bud is already detaching from the harder plactic peice. Also, the rubber covering the control has separated from the body of the control. The buttons were always a little spongy, but now the volume down button is almost unusable with out moving the rubber cover into just the right alignment with both hands. the sound quality on the unit is great but I'm very disappointed with the material qulity. For the price I paid for the unit I expect a lot more when it comes to a product made by bose."
609,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After agonizing over which of these to buy for my boyfriend, I settled on Bose, which is a brand we know and trust. Well worth the money so far. Clear sound, great volume for his workouts or just to put them in to ignore me around the house lol. Loud but I can't really hear them sitting close. My bf is a runner and hasn't taken them for a full spin yet. Very happy so far. Can't wait to get the charging case (when I recuperate from the $$$ of these headphones). Great instructions. He has an iPhone (8 or something...I'm not an Apple person) and it took 5 min to sync. Highly recommenfed."
610,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is great, but bluetooth connection with my iPhone 6 plus is not the best. I've had these for a couple days. Use them when I walk the dog. I listen to pandora, with the SoundSports connected to my iPhone bluetooth, starting pandora from my apple watch. My iPhone is in my pant pocket. I get blanks in music that is annoying as I walk briskly. If I move the phone to my shirt pocket problem resolves.

I gave the headphones a 2 because these are designed for activity. Sound quality is good except when it disconnects from music. Great sound poor connectivity."
611,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these earphones! Previously I only used wired headphones, but thought I would upgrade to these and haven't looked back since! Here are my pros and cons of the earphones:
Pros
-Amazing sound, highs-mids-lows are very well balanced as well as fantastic bass.
-Battery lasts a long time, forgot what the exact hours are but Ive never had a problem of them dying too quickly.
-Listened to them almost everyday for almost a whole year, and still work just as good as they did on day 1
-Easily connects to devices, and can even switch devices with the push of the button.
-Stays in ear very well, never falls out or feels uncomfortable.
-High quality build, doesn't feet cheap or plasticy.

Cons:

-The little clip to attach to your shirt would become detached every once in a while, if I turned too much or took them off without unclipping it first.
-Easy to lose clip if not put on properly, but you honestly dont need it unless youre doing something really intense and are rolling on the ground...
-Will sometimes have problems with being connected to two devices at once, like music playing on one with totally shut out the other, even when music is paused.

Thats about it! Definitely recommend these earphones, superior build and sound quality for a great price!"
612,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
Uses a regular micro usb
Very light weight
Headphones tell you the battery life upon power on
Good quality sound
Upgradeable firmware with the Bose Connect phone App
Very easy to feel your way across the buttons
Buttons actually work with android (amazon music, spotify, google play)
7hr battery life
1yr warranty thru bose
Extremely water/sweat resistant

Cons:
Connecting cable is long (for me)
Buttons are a little firm
Expensive"
613,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After a ton of research, I went with Bose. Top competitors were the Jaybird X3's, which I have not tried. I've never written an Amazon review before but since competition is so steep with these products I thought I'd try and be helpful for you guys. I got these on Cyber Monday sale for $99 a few weeks ago.

I've known and loved Bose products for a long time now, and while my decision wasn't pure brand loyalty I knew these would be solid. They are. I use them for NYC commuting, at work, and in the gym. Great performance in all uses.

PROS:
-Sound quality is excellent. Music sounds great. No surprise there. Clear, punchy, true. Really enjoyable. Enormous step up from the stock iPhone buds I upgraded from, and assume most reading this review will be making the same step. No comparison. Treat yourself.
-Call quality: this was a big one for me as I wanted to use these for work (sales, lots of calls.) Everyone I've asked has told me that the receiving end of a call on these is clear, as long as the mic is in the right position on my face. The wire can be positioned in front or back of your head; calls don't work as well if they're tucked back, though it is nice to do that and clip them to your collar while on the move.
-Fit: i'm happy wearing these for a while with the out-of-the-box earpieces; they're comfortable but they also come with multiple other options to adjust the fit. I am a rock climber and they don't fall out at any angle.
-Battery: while these have an objectively lower battery life than the competitors, I find that they still get me through a full work day as long as I stay on top of turning them on/off as I use them. I commute to work in NYC, listen to them on the train and use them for calls and music at work. They're still going when I walk in the door at the end of the day, and are easy enough to charge overnight.

CONS:
-Size. These suckers are big. If you'd like to wear earmuffs in the winter or a hat over them, you're not going to have much luck. They stick out enough to preclude most headgear, though visually they're not cramping your style much. I don't really care because they sound great, but my ears are cold.
-Connectivity - they cut in and out a good bit, with music and calls skipping. I was surprised at how often this happens. You often have to juggle what they're connected to. Between a work phone, personal phone, work computer and personal computer they often get confused and connect / disconnect at random. They can be connected to only two things at once. This is completely fine as long as you're deliberate about what they're hooked up to. But they also drop a half-second of music or phone call every now and then, which is disappointing.

Overall I'm happy with my purchase, but am open to trying the competitors in the future. I highly recommend them for causal and professional use."
614,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My God, these headphones are absolutely the BEST!!! Bose never fails to live up to their reputation. The sound is superior and it took only 5 minutes to set up (after watching the video on their site.) I charged them via my laptop and it took only 2 hours. Love that they included 3 sets of earpieces (small & large -- medium are already attached.) I love R&B, Pop and Classical music and these headphones really brought the music alive. Love them. Wish I could afford to purchase another pair for my sister - oh well :)"
615,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these with high expectations. The sound quality is amazing, the remote that is on the wire is very handy. it pairs very easily with my iphone and apple watch. As soon as I turn them on, it pairs. They stay in my ears and never slip or fall out. I wear them while working out and basically 6 + hours while working. Now for the down sides, they take about 2 hours to charge and the battery lasts about 6 hours. so if you are going to wear them all day be prepared to go without for a couple of hours. Also, I have only had them for about 6 months and they are starting to fall apart. there are some cylinder pieces around the cord where it attaches to the ear buds its self, that the glue has worn off and those cylinders now move up and down on the cord(I think they are there to keep the cord from fraying, so not a huge deal besides aesthetics) also there is a piece of rubber or some other material where the power button is that has also lost the adhesive of the glue. I wrote an email to product support and got the generic reply that it would be answered in 2 business days. I didn't get a response for a whole month. I don't know if they are planning on replacing them or what."
616,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Bose product, and must say, I love it. The sound quality is too good, with literally everything. The best part, you don't need to work on an app to customize it, Bose does it for you. Full marks to Bose for the sound quality.
I love the looks, durability and the fit. I had some issues initially making it stay in my ears, but now it works great. Battery lasts for around 7 hours, and the charging is fast. Best part, it connects to iPhone as well as my Mac, and I can take the call while pausing video on Mac, without the need to switch every time.

Pricey. yes, but Bose is worth it."
617,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones for working out. Much better than the Jaybirds X2 and Powerbeats2 I had previously. They stay in the ear and are very comfortable. The sounds is awesome for bluetooth workout headphones. Enough bass for Rap/R&B and rich mids for rock and pop. You may have a hard time with the tips if you have small ears. They come with multiple sizes,but the small may not be small enough for some."
618,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't understand the negative reviews posted. These fit in the ear better than any other earpods that I have used. And believe me I have tried many. The sound is fantastic. I use them with my Apple watch when exercising. That way I don't have to carry my phone with me. As far as how well they hold up, only time will tell."
619,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Huge Bose fan and have *many* Bose products including their high end home theater systems. This is the first negative review i've ever written for Bose product. I guess if you only wear them for 30 - 60 mins per day for a work out they are OK. However, voice quality on these headphones is truly a mystery -- sounds like everyone is talking through a sock. Very muffled audio for phone calls. I use(d) these a lot for conference call and similar while on travel and they just stink ... period. So now i use these on the treadmill in the AM and back to using my old Soundsport in-ear wired headphones that are falling apart b/c they sound so so much better for phone calls."
620,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice sound and feel, clean simple light and well balanced feel and sound, I've been using the Samsung level pro which I like the battery life but sound was not what I needed so I tried the BOSE and what a difference in base and clarity but not the battery life but I'm willing to give up some battery life for a much better sound quality.
I had originally given this a 5 star rating but due the the control buttons falling apart and having BOSE tell me that they'll do me a favor to exchange it although it's under 1 year old. Thanks BOSE."
621,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones. I'm basically married to them, use them constantly and adore them. The sound quality is incredible, the range is great, and the bulkiness is not as big of an issue as the reviewers imply. The battery life is totally reasonable and they charge incredibly quickly. I HIGHLY recommend these headphones, they're life changing. Another win for Bose."
622,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bottom line, they sound good, for the price. Caveat: When they work.

Mine worked flawless, for about 6 weeks. I used them to train (running) 3-5 times a week, in 45-80 minutes at a time. Used them at the gym for 30-60 minutes at a time. No issues, at all. Great battery life, decent seal, good enough audio quality.

Then, I ran my first half marathon (first organized race). Around mile 10, they lost sync, and would not reconnect. I didn't think much of it, but I was frustrated, as now I couldn't get my pace/time updates, and I wasn't in position, nor did I want to hold my phone in my hand. I spent the money on these for several reasons. Tempo playlist, updates from the Runkeeper app, reliability.

Now, they will randomly power on and off without prompt. I must charge them overnight, take them straight to the gym, as they power on and off the whole way, then re-pair them with my phone when I get there. Once paired, they seem reliable. Still, they power on and off, without prompt. Update firmware? Can't. The unit won't stay powered on long enough to complete it. Sometimes it makes it 60%. Sometimes its 90%. Never completes.

So tell me, would you spend $150, get 6 weeks of flawless function, fail when you needed it, and be glitch since, and have a decent taste in your mouth? I don't.

Audio quality? Decent... This isn't entirely due to the drivers, but more so to the seal. I use Westone triple and quad drivers for monitoring on stage, and casual listening, when being wired is feasible. I'm not expecting these to sound amazing, and unfortunately, I think the drivers actually sound great. The issue is the seal, or lack thereof. The three size options they have, don't quite fit my ear canal, but they are proprietary, so it is what it is. If they could utilize the Comply Foam tips used for most in-ear monitoring systems, these things could have GREAT potential in audio quality. Want tight, clear bass? The seal is what makes that happen.

All in all, I'm rather disappointed, and its frustrating. We'll see if I can manage a replacement pair, or if I'm stuck with these, and the frustration of it all, because I truly wanted to love them. I've been through several low-end BT earbuds, and these are definitely the best. May resort to apple airpods, if this situation goes unresolved."
623,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose quality is second to none. These earbuds are very comfortable and being a Bose product, the sound quality is great. It comes with 3 different earbud sizes so you can get the perfect fit. It is also very easy to sync via bluetooth. I bought a pair and gave them to my son going off to college and I immediately bought another pair for myself."
624,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound from these small earbuds. They twist in easily and are super comfortable for my small ears. I have tried numerous earbuds and never found a good fit. I use these running on the trail, in the gym, or around the house. They are not noise canceling, but they will drown out just about everything. Several rubber ear pieces to fit any size ear too. Great product for the price, and stays charged longer than the product reviews state. Carrying case comes in very handy for gym goers like myself."
625,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality: Great, not comparable with soundlink but as good as the previous wire version of soundsport.

Fit and look: horrible. This is the first item that disappointed me from Bose. It’s bulky and heavy on the ear.
Will return and look for a wireless alternative."
626,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Bose! Been waiting since I was a teen to buy Bose. This are superb! Great fit, build quality, connection to my PC took a little work....but now is fine. The sound quality is what I expected, and more...one almost drawback is that they are so perfectly clear if your music is of a lower quality you will hear every hiss and crack. Bass is sharp, crisp, and can rumble with the best. Mids are clear, and highs are equally as good. Its true the Bose software is basic, but I believe there are no enhancements because A: this sounds great! B: perhaps its is to protect the speakers.

Love you Bose!"
627,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. They sound great. They're very comfortable to wear. They have never fallen out, and I've never had any connection issues. I use these both while at the office and when I'm outside with my dog, playing fetch, running around or walking a few miles. The battery life isn't as impressive as some other brands, but I've never had a problem with them dying - a quick recharge during lunch and they're ready to go for the rest of the afternoon, if I want to wear them all day at work.

The two drawbacks are definitely the size and battery life. Everything else is great. The size isn't an issue as far as comfort or security - they are extremely comfortable and have never been close to falling out. They just stick out of your ears more than some brands. The battery life has still been plenty sufficient for me, but I'm a rechargeaholic so pretty conscientious about keeping things charged. If you're not, you may see some benefit in a different pair with better battery life."
628,5.0 out of 5 stars,They sound great. They stay in my ears very well after learning to twist slightly after inserting them. The two things I do not like about them is that the bluetooth signal is too weak. The signal will not cross my body. I normally wear a music player on my left arm and the right ear piece is what controls everything on these so the bluetooth receiver is in the right ear piece. It will lose reception occasionally. I put the player on my right arm and everything is fine. I have read this is an issue many times. Bose needs to up their bluetooth signal.
629,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose SoundSport Headphones

Who are they for?
The Bose SoundSport Headphones are designed for the active user in mind. They are headphones that are connected via bluetooth making them wireless. This eliminates the annoying cable problem that comes with most headphones when working out. They are perfect for anyone who is regularly active and on the go.

Sound:
Bose is known for providing exceptional sound quality with their products. The Bose SoundSports continue to hold this high pedigree. They produce highly detailed sound, with great punchy bass. This allows you to better focus on your workout, and get better results. Also I found them great for watching movies or TV.

Comfort:
These headphones are in ear headphones, meaning they rest inside your ear. The design features a fin that wraps around your ear. Thanks to this design, they are always secure no matter what you’re doing. They also come with three different sizes so you can find what’s best for you. These headphones are so comfortable that I often forget that I have them in.

Durability:
The Bose SoundSports are water and sweat resistant. So you can wear them when it’s raining, or when you are doing cardio.

Features:
These headphones have the latest bluetooth technology, providing great connectivity to your device. There is also an app just for these headphones that makes connecting even easier. They also feature an inline remote that allows you to pause, skip, and adjust volume of your music.

Battery:
The headphones have a battery life of around 6 to 7 hours of use per charge. For me that was about 3 days of use, which I found to be great. This meant I didn’t need to charge them constantly."
630,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried a few sport headphones but none were like these. This was the most comfortable fit in my ear, with great sound clarity. It is supposed to let a little outside sound in due to them being for sport, yet they let in just enough so can gear a car or someone talking, but not enough that you will be disturbed. Battery life is decent as I wear them to the gym and use for about an hour and a half and use between 20-30% of the battery each time, and they are very fast to recharge, so if they die, you can plug them in for a quick boost and will have enough for a quick workout. Some parts seem they could be fragile, but I try to be gentle with everything and after a dew months, they still look new!"
631,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these about two months now and I do like them, but I hate the loose cord on them. I come from using wireless bluetooth headphones for my athletic stuff that fits tighter to my neck. The only reason I notice this is my long hair is typically up in a ponytail in the gym and i'm constantly having to pull the cord a little to adjust it so it's not pulling the bud out of my ear, or has it feeling like it's going to. The combination of long hair, ponytails and the weight of the hair with this cord is pretty much lame in my world. I can see I'll save these for more of the noise cancelling action like flights and travels and probably pick up a cheap pair of bluetooth for the gym so I'm not thinking about my headphones when I'm trying to focus on my muscles and performance."
632,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried a cheaper pair of $40 wireless headphones first, and the fit was bad and sound was tinny. I decided to invest a bit and these are amazing. Perfect fit, you can feel them lock in as you turn them back a little. They are big but that's ok because they don't wiggle at all. The sound is great, deep bass, clear and as loud as I'd like. I was able to pair them with my Apple Watch (took a little while to figure that out - I had to walk away from my phone until the headphones released that bluetooth connection, now it pairs immediately with both my phone and my watch). I'm able to go for a long walk with my wireless headphones and I don't have to bring my phone along. Amazing freedom! They have a long battery life and I like that when you turn on it tells you the battery percentage and what it's connected to. Love these headphones!"
633,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are good, used them so far on two long bike rides, close to 5 hours pumping music and the battery was around 60%-65%.

Sound isolation was good but I could still talk with others and stay sharp for cars coming from behind etc.

The music reproduction skipped several times but after I moved my phone to the right back pocket from the jersey it got better, felt weird eating stuff from my left pocket hahahaha."
634,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them. Fit perfectly and extremely comfortable. I sit in front of my computer for long periods of time and also run and workout, so I wanted a pair of wireless headphones that were comfortable but also fit in a way that would allow me to workout & run in them. These have answered the mail AND THEN SOME! The setup was super easy and as soon as you turn them on they connect to multiple devices IMMEDIATELY! When running they stay securely fit in my ear, the cord lays nice behind my head (or under my chin, depending on the way you have them in), and the sound is great. I know they do appear more bulky than some of the other options in this price point, but as a person who has done a ton of research and tested out multiple pairs I want to tell you that you will not regret going with this pair of headphones....if....you are looking for a pair of headphones that: you can wear for long periods of time, you can workout (& run) in, offers superior sound no matter what you are doing, does not completely completely get rid of ambient noises."
635,3.0 out of 5 stars,These are amazing. I usually buy Bose products for the superb sound and I'm very satisfied with these. They stay firmly in my ear (using the large earpieces for me). And obviously the sound quality is amazing. To keep them in the ear the secret is to twist them backwards in the ear so that the top plastic end is tilted backwards. The best thing about these headphones is that they connect instantly to my phone. My other Bluetooth devices take anywhere from 5 to 15 seconds to connect. This connects in less than a second. Plus it tells you what its charge level is when you turn it on. These are super-nice - I have taken them on many runs and have not had a single problem.
636,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound amazing. I had the jabra sports and the bose are far superior. Worth every penny. The comfort is unreal, and more secure than it feels. I can run and lift at the gym with no problems. After 30-45 min the jabra in ear starts to hurt, but the Bose I can wear for hours. Yes it lacks the seal of a true in ear but it doesn't bother me at all. The sound quality and bass is perfect. Your not just paying for the name , it truly is quality. Others I've tried include skullcandy, beats on ear, apple buds, sennheiser, and shure."
637,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Bose. The sound quality on these are amazing for a wireless headset. But the design has clear flaws: (1) the wire is quite thick and so if you turn your head, you can feel the wire pulling on the ear buds. Thankfully the earbuds fit really well for me so they do not fall out, but the wire protrudes at a weird angle and it takes getting used to. (2) Other people talk about how the buds stick out of your ear and look weird. They are correct. They reallllly stick out of your ear and look super funny. But I only wear them at the gym so I don't care what other people think.

tl;dr - Amazing sound, ugly design, wire can pull on earbuds sometimes."
638,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love not needing to deal with a regular cord. It doesn't get caught on anything.

Occasionally, the bluetooth or sound quality act up. The best solution I found is to forget/unpair the device completely and set it back up from scratch through the pairing process. One time that solution didn't fix it, but it was working after I charged it and left it alone for the night.

The sound quality isn't as good as wired earphones, but that doesn't matter much to me. For me, the convenience drastically outweighs the cut in sound quality. Not for my dad - he'll stick with wired Bose earphones for now.

The Bose Connect app is handy. You'll want to use it to update the firmware on these earphones as soon as you get them."
639,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own three sets of Bose earphones and satisfied with all of them. Bought these for a Christmas gift to my wife. Soundwise they are Bose. Designwise they are not acceptable. She tried them and they would not stay in the ear. So, I took them over. I tried all sizes provided in the box, and not one would keep stay MY ears. And we were not moving around. In my personal experience and opinion...Very poor design. I returned them."
640,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased my Bose SoundSport Wireless headphones about 6 months ago. When I first got them, they were great. The sound quality on them is very good. It's very well balanced, with good bass that does not distort at higher volume levels. The cord has a good thickness to it. The actual tips are very comfortable and I have no problem with them falling out of my ears, no matter what I am doing.

The issues I ran into have to do with the remote and the cover for the charging port. The buttons are covered by one piece of formed rubber. After about 2 1/2 months of use, the rubber began to deform on the pause/play button, and then began lifting off around the edge. Thinking I had a defective remote, I called Bose customer service (who by the way, were awesome), and I sent them back for a new pair.

I received them about 2 weeks later. I began using them again and now 3 months later, I am having the same issue, I have attached a photo. Additionally, the cover for the usb charger no longer stays flush, and keeps on popping open.

In all fairness I understand these were made for exercising. I use these as my everyday headphones, so maybe I am putting more wear and tear on them than they were made for.

If you are using these just for exercise, then they are great. As I said it has good sound quality, and once you put them in your ears, you will be hard pressed to get them to fall out. As an everyday pair of headphones they do not stand up to constant use, at least in my case."
641,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite having a relatively large profile and sticking out of the ear quite a ways, this is the first set of bluetooth earphones I've owned that boast good enough sound quality for my ears. I tried the Jaybirds, I tried the Jabras, and honestly they sounded like I would expect bluetooth headphones would sound: lifeless with anemic bass and uninteresting signature.
While these are by no means reference-quality sound, they have a fun signature, a surprising amount of bass, and they get loud enough to keep your music audible over a noisy environment. The only downside is that they're not completely closed, so there is some sound leak, and that may not lend itself to a quiet office environment, for example.
Note: If you're trying to decide between these and their completely wireless brethren, know that the wireless ones cut out if you turn your head too much with your phone in your pocket."
642,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I adore my Bose Soundwave. I thought these would be a logical choice. They are well built and have decent battery life. However, I literally had to crank these up to 90%+ volume when I went outside, that was on a non-windy day. As soon as I started moving, the sound of wind was all I could hear. They have the Bose sound quality, when it's quiet. All of my other headphones I can hear really well at 30%-40%, I rarely have to crank them past 50% volume.
These had potential, the sound quality is there, if you can hear it."
643,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I have had these one year now and thought I would write a review about them now for those wondering if they hold up. First off these are excellent headphones in terms of quality of sound and ease of use. They fit comfortably in your ears and using them with your cellphone is great.

My use of them has been constant but light. I work in front of a computer and don't use them for anything other than music, games and hands free for my phone. Again I will state the sound quality is excellent. After one year though they are starting to come apart. From the second I got them the rubber piece that covers the charge port didn't really fit correctly and kept popping open. I didn't really mind because I wasn't putting them in environments that they were getting wet in so no big deal. As the time has worn on the plastic that covers the ear bud has started separating and has come to the point of not sticking around the power button on top. Also the little rubber pieces that sit up against the ear piece and the go around the wire, eventually slid away from the ear piece. Given the price I was hoping they would hold together a bit better. The above mentioned flaws do not affect the products functionality yet but they do look like they are cheap and falling apart.

Pros:
-Great Sound
-Easy Connectivity

Cons
-Longevity"
644,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are awesome. I have owned the PowerBeats2, LG Tone Infinims, and the Bose corded earbuds as well. These sound 10 times better than the PowerBeats2. These have such clear crisp sound, and amazing bass...I was shocked getting such quality from a bluetooth earbud set. They also stay in your ear very well. I have used them at the gym and for yardwork and never had a problem with them falling out. The only thing I don't like is how large they are and how they stick out of your ear so far. Looks a little ridiculous, but the smaller they get the less sound quality and power they will have, so its a wash."
645,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second pair of these earphones I have owned, which I bought to replace a lost pair. I wear them to run and workout. The sound is/was great, but the durability is terrible. I have had this pair for just under 10 months and the left earphone stopped working about 2 weeks ago, leaving sound only from the right side. The problem seems to be in the wiring, since occasionally sound ""flickers"" from the left side. I sweat a lot when I run, but I thought Bose had taken care of this issue a year ago. I do not want to spend $150 every 10 months on earphones, so I will start looking for a more durable product. Sorry, Bose."
646,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Weird problems.
I really enjoy the other Bose products I have, so got these headphones hoping for great quality, even though they are kind of a sticky-outy and awkward form factor.

My two main issues are: on phone calls (not a problem for music or podcasts) the voice of the person i am talking to goes in and out (sounds muffled), I've experimented, and this does not happen on the same call with other headphones; second, the charging can be weird. Just now I've been trying to charge them but they keep spontaneously connecting to my computer's bluetooth and preventing me from using my wired headphones that I am actually trying to use with my computer.

Good things: Once I found the right size they stay in well, charges super fast, the case works well and has a nice carabiner, the jacket clip has not fallen off yet despite its seemingly precarious attachment, sound is good, playback time is long enough

Nit-picky 'i-took-a-design-class' issues: my hair catches on the ear 'buds' (more accurately the ear blossoms) all the time (brief rant: does user testing for joined wireless headphones not include people with long hair??? i see the same issues in a lot of headphones. why do you think it's so great to have a wire that goes around the back of my neck, and then plan for how i will drape it over my shoulders when not in use? I won't use it that way because that is where my hair is. Similarly, the surface finish on these headphones grabs my hair all of the time); the weight of the ear bud is pretty far away from my ear socket, meaning a light touch creates a large enough moment for the earbud to seem insecure in my ear, even though they tend not to fall out, this is more just annoying; they stick out really far and look ridiculous, again this makes me think they user-tested mostly men, because these headphones look kind of ridiculous with smaller ears, but then again who cares"
647,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Bose sound as expected! Because they are bluetooth, they don't have the best battery life, but if you're only using them for workouts, they will last a week or so. I really like them. Good fit. I got a mophie charging case for them which I would HIGHLY recommend!"
648,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones. They have great sound quality, are comfortable and indeed to stay in place while you're moving about. Cons: First -
battery life is only around 3 hours, so don't forget to bring the charger. Second - in windy conditions, the sound of the wind rushing over the ear bud drowns out whatever I'm listening to. I'm guessing this is because most of the headset sticks so far outside the ear. Recommended if you are not a speed runner or would be using where it's very windy."
649,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After having a terrible experience with Powerbeats 3 I was skeptical that any bluetooth workout headphones were worth buying. I had to return my Beats 4x in 2 months and some of the reviews for the Bose Soundsport wireless sounded similar. Having had a positive experience before with Bose I gave them a shot and it has been excellent. The battery life and sound quality aren't quite as good as the Beats but they are definitely sweat proof and can easily handle a 2+ hr workout. You can skip a few days between charges too. I also noticed some comments about them staying in ears. I have never had an issue with them falling out. All in all, they've been awesome.

If you're a frequent gym goer tired of wires on your headphones these are great."
650,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sadly, I will be returning these. The sound is as expected from a Bose product. However, the volume has a lot to be desired. Everyone who knows YouTube knows the volume of the videos vary greatly. Most headphones can compensate for that. These did not. With the volume all the way up, some videos were still not up to par. Also, the fit of these were lacking. They were not secure and I couldn't run with them because they would shake right out with about 100 yards. I tried the larger and smaller ear pieces with the same result and a lot of discomfort. This was very frustrating and disappointing especially considering the cost. I've had better earphones that cost a fraction of what these did. Sooooo Bose if you're reading this... Do better."
651,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is incredible! These also have the longest range of any bluetooth device I've ever used. I'm amazed how far they will stay connected. I've used Jaybird Bluetooth earbuds for a couple years and I like them a lot, but the Bose sound better. Jaybirds stay in ear a little better while being active, but the Bose do a pretty decent job of staying in, and you don't have to compress them. They are a little bulky but manageable. For the difference in sound quality, I use the Bose now for everything. They let in some ambient sound but not as much as Bose wired earbuds. The Jaybirds block our ambient sound the best."
652,4.0 out of 5 stars,After reading many reviews I settled on these headphones and I’m so glad I did. I bought them to replace a set of Powerbeats headphones that I had lost recently. I was loathe to spend more money on headphones especially since my last pair was only “ok”. But I couldn’t be happier!! I primarily use them at the gym and it was important that they sound great and not fall out while running or doing any other activity. So far I am thrilled! The ear pieces fit perfectly and the sound quality is great. Who would have thought I’d end up glad that I lost the others?
653,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Was a gift for my husband and he really likes them! Mostly he uses them when he is out walking with the dog. We walk 5-8 miles at a time and sometimes in traffic. He says these wireless headphones are comfortable, stay put in his ears and have good sound quality and block out some, but not all traffic noise. I worried the wire loop around the back of the neck might be bothersome but he doesn’t mind it at all. Had considered getting him the Apple wireless buds since he has an iPhone and they are supposed to pair so easily but my hubby says these Bose SoundSports pair easily and the app is easy to use."
654,4.0 out of 5 stars,"these sound great, fit well and stay in my ears. They also fit my wife's ears well and stay in as well. She has a really hard time finding ones that will and we've settled on the Bose design because of that alone. Built well, light enough, and the controls on the wire are easy to get to and use and really come in handy. Also, the phone audio quality is WAY better than my iPhone 6.. so , there's that too."
655,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall the headphones work great via bluetooth. However, I purchased these headphones for the HR functionality, and it DOES NOT work. I thought perhaps I had a defective set, and the support I received from Bose was outstanding. They even sent me a second pair. I'm having the same issue, though. If you're looking for a great set of bluetooth headphones, I recommend purchasing the cheaper model."
656,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall a great sound quality and long lasting battery. When I was looking for wireless headphones I was looking for some that would produce a quality sound even with quieter music, like classical instrumental music. As a classical musician, I'm always listening to softer music in loud spaces (like the train or an airplane), and these do a pretty good job of projecting the music over the ambient noise. If you are hoping to only listen to classical music, I would recommend getting some real headphones (over the ear types) as those would do a much better job of cancelling out any external noise. I went with these because I knew that I also wanted to use them when I work out, which would not have been doable with some larger over the ear wireless headphones."
657,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i had recently ordered a pair of POWER BEATS, they were absolute garbage. they felt cheap they had a flimsily built quality and after 1 good workout they started to malfunction. the Bose SOUNDSPORT are nothing short of fantastic so far, they look great, feel great, and work magnificently! this morning i accidentally even split a little coffee in one earbud and it continued to work flawlessly."
658,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for this product because I wanted the heart rate monitor, liked the idea that it was more accurate and convenient than the iWatch. That may be true in theory but the reality it it constantly missed my heart rate, just told me to insert into my ear because it was not detecting beat. But it was already in my ear canal, what was I supposed to do, drive it into my skull? I suppose Bose would prefer that as opposed to me returning but return I did. Thank God for Amazon's return policy on pricey products such as this that do not deliver. Oh and by the way, it was constantly dropping the Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 7 Plus. What a disappointment. Back to Amazon it goes."
659,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are hands down the most amazing pair of headphones I ever use. I always used to use my Bose AE2i's to listen to music with clarity and detail, and a cheap pair of earbuds to listen on the go. However, I found that I prefer the earbud style headphones, and used the low quality ones more. These sound incredible, are extremely comfortable (I routinely wear them for multiple hours a day), and have decent battery life. For the next generation, I would like to maybe see smaller earbuds (if they don't sound any worse) and a bigger battery. I wouldn't mind a bump like the remote control on the other side to provide more battery. Overall, I have nothing but positive things to say about this product, and I highly recommend it."
660,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones and they deliver as promised. I tried cheaper wireless headphones in the past which surprisingly had great reviews - those were fraught with poor performance, sound quality, and style. These Bose wireless headphones however are of excellent build and quality. The music sounds very nice, the fit is very comfortable, the appearance of the headphones is stylish, and they remain in place during moderately vigorous workouts. I'm not a runner and I don't do CrossFit, so I can't comment on how these headphones would perform in such situations. But for everyday gym use, they are great."
661,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for my mom for Christmas to allow her to roam wirelessly on conference calls and/or when she wants to dance around singing ABBA or Shania. So far she LOVES them and I think she will get a lot of use out of them in all sorts of ways.

Bose truely has the BEST headphones and sound. I am a profession audio technician and I give Bose headphones an A++. I generally go towards JBL in the way of speakers, but Bose Headphones for the win!"
662,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands down these are still the best earbuds I've found.

The ear bud is BY FAR the most comfortable I've ever found, and they stay put! The silicone is super soft and the sound quality is great. I also own the wired version and have bought multiple as gifts for people, all who have been very happy with them.

I do prefer the wired version's silicone tips vs these. These have a double wall style that are more noise canceling, but the great thing is the standard silicone tips fit these so I just bought a 2 pack and swapped them out."
663,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. So glad I went wireless. I've had them for one month. They are comfortable and the carrying case is convenient and hangs outside my backpack. It tells me what percentage is charged every time I turn them on. I can still hear my environment when I wear them, but I also hear my music. The connector on the back was nice to have; it connects them to my shirt so they won't fall on the ground if I take them out of my ears. However, the connector fell off and got lost."
664,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose sound quality is great. It is really nice that when you turn it on it tells you which device it is connected to and how much battery life is left. Controls are excellent and feel solid and robust, yet light and easy to wear. Very comfortable.

Unfortunately, it did not meet my needs because I was hoping for non-isolating headphones like the wired Bose IE2, and these are partially sound isolating. Another issue is I tend to have ringing ears after wearing them, even at reasonable volumes (volume that would not cause ringing with my other headphones); I have a theory that it is related to the excellent fit which is quite snug and well sealed (although quite comfortable)."
665,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am surprised by these headphones. The charge does not last longer than a few hours. I just pulled it off of the charger about 2 hrs ago after the light was green, I went to turn them on and only 90% battery. I have not used them since taking them off the charger. This is very disappointing considering the price tag. I am not sure why these headphones suck the battery life down to nothing so quickly. They will last only half a day."
666,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is good, to be a bose, honestly could be better.. takes a while to get used to, they stay put good so far.. haven’t taken them for a spin, but will
Update how they hold under sweat. I Like the interaction with the phone and app for control."
667,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very comfortable and have a decent battery life. Only reason I am taking off a start is because the headphones has a feature which announces the phone number that is calling you. It's fine if it happens when you are listening to something random, but causes lots of issues if you are already on a call, because the call will get interrupted and the headphones will start reading out the phone number and/or contact name causing issues with the conversation. This is an annoying issue if you are primarily using it for phone calls, which is the case with me."
668,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great buds. Stay in well while running. Doesn't have the best sound quality on the microphone though. Thought for this price and brand it would have noise reduction. First time we used/tested it my kids were playing in an adjacent room and it sounded like he was in an airport terminal, they were so loud. :(
Also had my order stolen(?) from the padded envelope it was shipped in somewhere in transit. Envelope arrived empty. :( Amazon was great though and sent a replacement immediately."
669,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good, battery is anywhere about 4hrs of continous us. The best part is the warranty and service that Bose offers. My unit started losing its charge after 6 months of good hard use (Gym, work, biking, hiking, yard work). Called Blse support, they had me ship my old unit free of charge abd they shipped me a new unit! The best oart is my warranty started all over again!! Awesome!!"
670,4.0 out of 5 stars,"On the first use of these headphones the volume clearly doesn't work. First, the product made several loud beeps and then proceeded to operate at high volume with the control not functioning. I tried turning them off, back on, charging them, etc to no avail. Terrible product, defective from the offset."
671,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The good thing is that they dont wrap around the ear like Beats. When charging, the app does not show battery status- WHY Mr. Bose?
The 1st one failed in less than a month. Just died all of a sudden during the middle of being used. Lets see how long the 2nd one will last.
Wont automatically connect with iPHone during incoming call. Have to select from the screen after accepting the call. Sound is good, but these days most wireless headphones have pretty good sound. Battery not so good."
672,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Really love these. I got them to use with my Apple watch for running. It's really great to be untethered from wires and the sound is amazing for how small they are--very rich, deep and what you'd expect from anything made by Bose. They kind of feel like they're going to fall out a lot, but it's just a feeling, they're really pretty snug fitting and I've never had one fall out."
673,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Positives: Good sound. Stay in ears securely. The Heart Rate monitor works flawlessly and is a great bonus.
Negatives: For some reasons I have lower volume in LEFT ear. I tried two of them the same. It is not my ear - I have wired Bose to compare.
Also, the HR sensor creates pressure point in the ear - so after a long time it kind of hurt a little.
Sound is not as good as my Bose wired in-year headphones.

I wish they were smaller and had a longer battery life.

In comparison to other alternatives - they a great overall"
674,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good. Wish the sound had a bit more range, and the volume controls aren't particularly responsive or consistent that I have seen. Sound is decent quality along with bass. These are not active noise cancelling (which I did not want) so you can still hear external noise if you wish. Battery life is good so far. Its really nice that there is no big hard plastic bulge at the back of your neck like some others. Ear fit is great for me, and three sizes of plug inserts (pairs) are included, and you can rock different sizes on each ear. Apple ear-bud type is NG for me and these fit snug without pain and don't come out accidentally."
675,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always had major problems with in ear headphones actually staying in my ear when I move around... forget them staying in when I run. These are awesome!!! I don't really use the heart rate monitor that is built into them (my watch handles that) and it's a good thing because it seems to be unable to detect my hear rate quite often.. I dunno.. maybe I'm dying repeatedly while I run.. kinda feels like it sometimes. However, if I am dying I'm doing so while enjoying the superb sound quality that you expect from something with the Bose name on it."
676,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Before buying these headphones I bought 3 cheap ones, so they did have a thousands almost 5 star reviews, the sound was not great, the fit was uncomfortable, one had a constant high frequency buzz, making them completely unusable. I gave up, and bought Bose.. and they are wonderful, very comfortable, sound is amazing, the battery last forever. Should not have wasted money, and bought Bose in the first place."
677,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I think the sound on these headphones is a 5/10 compared to my wired Soundsport at 8/10. If you have to compromise that much on sound quality, it's definitely not worth going wireless. The comfort was fine. You look like Frankenstein because they stick out so much, but it didn't bother me that much. Really disappointed with the sound quality, so I returned them."
678,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best sounding wireless headphones that I have ever owned.. I use them when I go to the gym and when hiking and they stay put in my ears. You just have to make sure that you put the right fitting ear rubber mounts on the headphones. It comes with three different sizes . They are a little bit bulky and stick out of the ears more than other wireless headphones that I have owned but once you put them on and use them you don't even notice the difference. I would definitely purchase these again and Bose sound is amazing.
679,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The good: these headphone connect and reconnect flawlessly with Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Ipod), which make them a pleasure to use. The mediocre: presumably because of the bandwidth limitation of Bluetooth compared to a wired connection, these headphones do not have the same sound quality that the wired SoundSport headphones provide. Specifically, when listening to a high quality ALAC file, the sound quality is reduced to about that of a medium quality MP3 file. Also, as expected, these are larger and heavier than the wired versions. The ugly: the associated phone app provides a few important features, such as providing a mechanism for firmware updates. However, the penalty is the default setting that apparently sends Bose information that they don't need about your content (!). They provide an option, after the initial installation, to change the privacy settings and one should do so. In summary, these headphones are exactly what they claim to be and work exactly as expected."
680,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been looking for bluetooth headphones for the gym for YEARS and I decided to make the purchase and have absolutely zero regrets. Bose is well known for their high-quality products, but damn was I blown away. The packaging, the distinct high/lows, the booming bass, the lightweightness, the functionality (doesn't come out of the ears easily), and for this cheap of a price. Hands down the best investment I've made on electronics, period. Don't look any further."
681,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have wasted a lot of money buying so many ear plugs to find them shorting out in a few months , reason is I am a runner and I sweat a lot running and also working out in the gym,I tried Beats and it took only a few months before they shorted out, these Bose ear plugs are the best for people who sweat a lot ,quality of sound is also very good and if you are a person who sweats like crazy running or working out ...this is the best money can buy , forget the rest !"
682,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Throw out your Beats and get these buds. I've had three sets of Beats earbuds and they've all broke for no reason and I'm not sure why I've been a repeat buyer. This was the last straw and I switch to the Bose, but I was concerned by the design and how they fit. Total surprise and amazement. The fit is like they aren't even in your ear. I did a jumping workout that the bose stayed in the ears without issue. Now let's talk about the sound. The sound is 10times better than the beats...the base is so so noticeable. My wife then tried them and literally went onto Amazon to order them right away...note she also has Beats held together with tape. The fact that Beats can even sell that product for over $100 when there is a product out there that is 10X better. I'm not kidding as I will tell everyone I see to get this earbud."
683,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love these headphones. They were delivered very quickly and are holding up amazingly over the past three months. It's like they are still brand new. I sweat a lot and these are so easy to clean. I love that they fit securely into your ears so no matter how muchyou move they stay in place. I have small ears and these do not hurt me in any way. They are not even a little bit uncomfortable. The sound quality is awesome and the battery lasts for quite a bit. Don't usually have to charge them until about the third or fourth day, (I use them a lot mind you). Would definitely recommend these for anybody looking for headphones who lives an active lifestyle. Perfect and definitely worth the price. 👌🏼"
684,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My Bose wireless headphones, not even after a month of using, the glue between the rubber cover and the blue plastic body just give up and these two parts are disconnected now, I used this headphones very carefully. But now since it couldn't even hold up for a month, I have to return it and ask for a refund.
You can see in the picture down below, the light is leaking from the gap that is not suppose be there at all."
685,5.0 out of 5 stars,I primarily use my ear buds at the gym. They fit my ears good and stay in while running on the treadmill. The sound is great and the volume is loud enough considering that the music is very clear. The only thing I don't like is the power button. You have to hold it really long to get them to power on. Battery life is decent but not great. 4-5 hours. Overall great wireless ear buds.
686,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love these and wonder how I ever lived without them! Whenever I used to use headphones with a cord, I would always get so frustrated because I would pull them out accidently.

I do have to say that the ear piece is a little difficult to put in when you first try these. I am getting better at getting them in. They are definitely comfortable - they do not hurt your ears during extended wear like the apple ear buds do."
687,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For several years now, Bose headphones have been a staple in our household. It began with the Bose QC15 over-ear noise canceling headphones. That purchase made us spoiled by great sound and discontent with any lesser pair of speakers of any type. So, could Bose duplicate their incredibly high audio standard on a small pair of wireless and rugged in-ear headphones? The answer is, absolutely! That said, the Bose SoundSport Wireless may not be for everyone. There are trade-offs that you should know about before you buy. I have had my pair for a couple of weeks now. Here are the details of my experience with the headphones...

SOUND QUALITY

The sound quality is absolutely fantastic. To describe it with just one word, the sound is RICH! There is a quality depth and warmth to the music that is better than I have ever heard on Bluetooth in-ear headphones. The music also comes across very detailed and dynamic. The high notes on a guitar tickle my ears while a deep bass line has more than enough punch to get me jiving. If you are new to Bose, you will be thrilled with the sound quality. If you already own other Bose speakers, then you will appreciate that the company's rich sound signature has not been lost on this wireless pair of sport headphones.

FIT & COMFORT

The Stay Hear ear tips do an amazing job of, well, actually staying in your ears. I also have a pair of Bose QC20 headphones with the same type of tips. With nearly two years of use, the ear pieces have NEVER fallen out with the QC20's. Not even when the wire is caught and tugged. Thus far, my experience has been the same with the new SoundSport. They have never fallen out. Plus there is no tethered wire to worry about getting caught on something. Perfect for activity. While jogging, washing the car and other various activities the headphones just stay in with no adjustment.

The silicon tips are also very comfortable though not as soft as those on the QC20. I assume that the extra heft is to hold the additional weight that the SoundSport earpieces have. Understandable as the earpieces house a battery, Bluetooth antenna, buttons and other electronics. It is surprising that they still feel as comfortable and natural in the ear as they do.

BLUETOOTH

Pairing was straight-forward on my iPhone, iPad and iMac. I love that they are NFC enabled.

The Bluetooth range is fairly great. I can leave my phone in one place and walk anywhere in our two story 2500 sq foot home without a dropout. When listening away from home (phone in a pocket), I also have never experienced even a hiccup in the connection.

My only difficulty with the Bluetooth turned out to be something I appreciate. Let me explain.... once paired, the headphones automatically connect to the last two devices they were paired with. When you first power on the headphones, if one of those two devices is not in range, then the headphones find and reconnect to any other previously paired device. This is great, but for me it worked almost too well. One time I powered on the headphones to listen to music on my iPhone only to find music playing from the iMac that my wife was using. So, my wife wondered why her music was no longer audible on her computer and I was confounded by the mystery music on my headset. This type of scenario happened a couple of times and became very annoying until we downloaded the Bose connect App. With the App, we can now easily tell the headphones which device we want connected. Presently, I have grown to appreciate how ""sticky"" the Bluetooth pairing is. I have never had to re-pair anything and I can easily switch between devices using the Connect App. By the way, the App also automatically updates the firmware on the headphones when needed. Nice!

DURABILITY

I read several older reviews where people had faulty units with a malfunctioning earpiece overtime. I also read somewhere that Bose found the issue and fixed the problem in its latest production. I have had no issue with my pair. Everything feels solid and built for abuse. By the way, the included neoprene case feels incredibly seamless and protects the headphones very well.

BATTERY LIFE

Bose states that the headphones get up to six hours battery life per charge. I have found this to be fairly accurate. The battery has never died on me mid-workout. Neither have I ever been surprised when they do need charging because of the voice prompt that announces the battery with each power on. Still, consider that they are yet another thing to charge. For me, a welcome concession to be able to exercise wire free.

CONCLUSION

In the end, I am very happy with the Bose SoundSport Wireless. The bottom-line is that they sound fantastic, are comfortable, they stay in place and keep a reliable Bluetooth connection. If you are in the market for workout ready headphones - I highly recommend the SoundSport Wireless. I expect to enjoy mine for years to come."
688,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Received my bose wireless earphone today.
Cyber monday deal - 99 plus tax and One day free shipping. Can’t beat that. This is my 3rd Bose Product. This is way better than beats or other similar wireless earphones.

About the earphone-
Pretty good first impression. Good sound quality. Fits in my ears very comfortably. Does not fall off during workouts. Integrates very well with my iphone.
My only concern would be the battery life is only 6 hours and it takes a long time to charge.

But over all considering the price at which I got this, it’s a great deal."
689,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gosh, these look bulky! That was my first reaction on seeing these and I had almost made up my mind to return them. Thankfully I held on for one more day and tried them out. The sound quality from Bose SoundSport wireless is incredible. I generally am a fan of the 'Bose sound' and these are packed full of it. You get the sense that they really wanted to get the sound right, even if it meant compromising on the looks. After listening to them, they seem more like miniaturized version of over-ear head sets and less like oversized earbuds.
Am also happy to report these are quite comfortable to wear for a good length of time."
690,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm very happy with my Bose earbuds. The fit is perfect and they never fall out of my ears even when bouncing around on the mower. They are very light and comfortable. The sound quality is amazing. I have a wired pair of Klipsch that I thought were the best until I purchased these. The battery last a long time and they are easy to charge. I use the carry case all the time and it is holding up nicely. The only complaint I have is that I wish I could turn them up louder. I wear them in the mower all the time and need more volume. This seems to be the case with all Bluetooth headphones I've had. The wired ones are much louder. I would recommend these to everyone because overall I love them. I hope they last.
691,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing. I love Bose headphones. This was my second pair of Bose.

The Good:
The sound is unmatched. You get great, deep bass from these little in-ear buds. They are very convenient by being wireless and sync effortlessly via Bluetooth. They are great for commuting or working out. I left my phone in my locker at the gym and played basketball with these and was probably 30-60 feet away from my phone and I experienced no issues with playback. These headphones allow you to make and take calls, which is very convenient. A computerized voice will tell you how much battery life you have remaining upon turning on the device or if the device got to about 20% life.

The Not-So-Good:
This is likely a personal preference, but I found the joint cord to be a bit annoying. Sometimes it would flop to one side or the other. Rarely, the sound would also cut out for a split second, though it never really bothered me too much. The phones did not seem to hold a charge as long as I expected. After 2 hours at the gym, I would go from 100% charge to about 30%. Perhaps distance from the phone affects battery life?

Overall, I highly recommend these. The only real reason why I left 4 stars is because I want to upgrade to the completely wireless Bose SoundSport phones and not deal with a connecting cord at all. Great product, Bose!!!"
692,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are exceptional earphones. The sound is amazing. I originally purchased the jaybird freedoms, and my ears were aching after several minutes. The fit just wasn't right. Returned them right away and ordered these. The sound difference is quite an amazing jump. This has a way more full sound and bass. (The others were suboptimal.) I'm glad I made the choice for Bose instead. The fit is just right."
693,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So at first, I was like, cool, these are pretty nifty! Even though the rubber tore immediately, no biggie. The clip on the back broke within 6 months and Bose sent me a new clip, cool. 15 months in to ownership, they stopped working all together. Now I know what they say about reviews, everyone has one, but I am very careful with my stuff. Still have the very first receiver I purchased with my first job 25 years ago!
I never used these in water, treated them poorly, threw them, dropped them etc. Just like that, no more worky. That's very poor quality for a brand name like Bose and $150 price point. I would understand if they were one of these new cheap quality no name companies popping up all over, but they aren't. Rubbish! Rubbish I tell you.
If that doesn't deter you, it's cool, the sound quality is great, there is no interference and the mic works very well too. All worthless if it doesn't work."
694,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the most comfortable earbuds that fit in my ears - the silicone bud cover and hook is very soft. Comes with a clip to clip on your clothes. Nice carrying case with a snap carabiner. Sound is good quality for both music and podcasts, though not the best for its price. Bluetooth connection is maybe 15 to 20 yards. Shorter playtime (6 hours) compared to some other earbuds, but comfort for long wear time was my main concern. The earbud profile sticks out of your ears so it's a little trickier using them lying in a bed or couch."
695,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Almost seems redundant to other reviews, but I have to report these are great headphones. Gave a set to both my wife (whose age will not be reported) and my twenty-five year old son for Christmas. They both loved them. I don't think my son has ever heard sound that good out of headphones. They also stay firmly attached to their ears when they are using them. Highly recommended!"
696,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very impressed. I love Bose products and wasn’t hesitant about buying these. I didn’t buy them for working out, just travel, and they are great. Sound is perfect and stay in my ears. The ONLY thing I would like even more is if the cord between the buds was longer. Felt a little short to me and makes the volume access awkward so high up by my right ear. Also I have long hair so I like the clip in the back so I can hook it to my necklace or shirt to stop it from falling out when I move/flip my hair."
697,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros - good sound quality; fit very well and they do not fall out when I exercise, running, weight lifting, HIIT training, jumping and sprinting, etc.; water proof, they handle sweat really well, long wearing hours (4-5 hours no problem when fully charged). Cons - the sound volume is little low and you have to increase volume often. If you listen to classical music a lot and like to hear more details in the music, these headphones are not your best choice. Overall, I use them mainly for sports and they work great for that!"
698,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After just over 6 months the button controls on these headphones have begun to fall apart. I wear the earbuds literally every day for approximately four hours each day. After the first 3 months the volume (+) button completely depressed into the casing and shortly afterwards broke off. At the six-month mark the power button depressed into the casing. The sound quality is great, but I must now use my phone to increase the volume and a pen tip to poke into the casing to turn the headphones on. The buttons and casing are not well made. I would not buy these headphones again.
Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones, Black"
699,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Love great sound.
It stick out little too much (funny looking) but as long as sound is ok, I like it.
I set timer 5 minutes. However, I listen music about 10 hours a day but still have 20% battery.

I give 4 stars because I can not hear my voice when I call.
It has microphone already. Why in the world they not make I can hear when I talk on the phone.
Feel like, I can hear some other side of phone but I need to guess what I talk.
Feel this way, because it block my ears.

It fit tight but easy to come out when I move a lot.

Regardless, all this complain I can still give 4 stars because of battery life and great sound."
700,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sounding earbuds. The rarely cut out because of loss of Bluetooth connection. When I first got them, I took the clip off that clamps down on your shirt to hold the cord in place. I didn’t think I was going to need it. After using them every day for a month, I wish I kept the clip. When you sweat, sometimes the cord sticks to your neck and can pull on the earbud. There’s obviously a reason they included it. I wanted these over the truely wireless ones because I was afraid of losing them if they weren’t connected. The zipper case they come with is a little small, so I put them in a sun glasses case I had laying around. Definitely not a deal breaker. You don’t buy Bose for the case, you buy it for the excellent sound quality, and that’s what these deliver. The battery life is great too. I only charge them once a week and I use them every day for at least 30-60 minutes. The stay hear tips work well enough. They stay in my ears when I’m doing high intensity exercises. I would buy them again."
701,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones sound great. I use the frequently not only for working out but also for phone calls, I have had great clarity both speaking and listening in on work calls while multitasking. I was worried about the earbud portion sitting well in my ear but found not only were they comfortable, but also stayed well positioned. I have to say they may be the most comfortable earbud I’ve ever had. The range on them is decent as well, I’ve definitely walked away from my phone and covered pretty good distances within my apartment 20ft+ with walls and doors in between and didn’t lose signal.

My biggest gripe is the durability. After about 8 months the nose logo sticker on the sides of the earbud fell off and disappeared. After about a year of owning them the glue on any plastic/rubber/tpe piece has gotten really loose. The triangular rubber that holds the bud onto the inset of the earlobe started breaking after a little over a year. The microphone and volumer control button has become exposed and I’m worried about the buttons falling off. I’m worried about them breaking down further in rain or elements as all of the plastic rubber covering is literally falling apart.

They are great headphones while they have lasted, but for $150+, I’d expect them to last a lot longer than a year. To be fair, they are still functional at a year and a half of use, but are falling apart and I worry that the next failure will be catastrophic."
702,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Would put 5 stars but I'm extremely disappointed! , have had bose for years never had an issue with several of their products I have purchased until now , I've barely had these earphones a few months and all of a sudden they aren't working well only one side works and u can barely hear the sound and other side is even lower !. Haven't dropped or stepped on them nothing , I barely use them and hour a day at most !"
703,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose continues to provide great products. I have been a Bose audiophile for decades and have not been disappointed yet. These headphones received great reviews - and are deserving of them. Easy setup, GREAT sound, quick charge. They fit nicely, and although they are not noise-cancelling they still provide great sound in an active environment, which would provide safety runners in noisy environments. I would have given 5 stars but I have had three occasions over the numerous hours of use where there was loss of activity for a few seconds, with recovery by the system without any interaction. Not sure what caused it since I was not moving at the time. Higher priced than many on the market, but the Bose sound quality is what I wanted - and received."
704,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound great and are very comfortable in my ears. The on-off is immediate, it tells you the battery %, and if already connected by bluetooth. I use them for about 1 hour per day and that uses upwards to 10% of the battery. Thus I recharge them about every 10 days which is not bad. I also like the litle alligator clip which you can use to clip the wire onto your collar at the back of your neck. Even though they have never fallen out of my ears I like the extra security."
705,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are decent. They produce good quality sound at times and do stay in the ears well when exercising. However, I have started to notice that the connection gets very choppy at random times. The distance cannot be the issue because it occurs when I am sitting right by my laptop/phone. For the price/Bose ""quality"" I am pretty disappointed. I will try to get a different brand during Black Friday if I see some good deals.

Update: Headphones have completely stopped working six months after purchase. Won't turn on at all. There has been no damage to them whatsoever. I'll make sure to not get Bose products again, and I would definitely recommend that you don't get these headphones. The same issue happened to a friend of mine as well. Absolutely disappointing."
706,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a gift for myself for my birthday. I have only used them a handful of times. I fully charged them last night and by the time I walked to my gym around the corner, it was already at 80%. When I got out from the gym an hour later, it was already at 30%. I just recharged them so they should have been at 100%, but again, they were at 80% to start. I've only had them for four months and I'm so disappointed because the sound quality is excellent, but I'd expect them to last longer for the price I paid."
707,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have been a Bose owner of headphones for nine or so years. I started with the wired about three sets and now I am using the SoundSport!! These bad boys are awesome. The fact that they are wireless they can connect with multiple devices i.e. my IPhone and my laptop at the same time. When I get a call the headphones adjust so I can answer while I am talking the laptop stands by until my phone call is done. Then it will pick up the movie from the laptop again and I am all good. I suggest anyone who wants wireless to try these out. Of course the quality is unsurpassed since it is Bose.
708,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Does not disappoint! I have always been a huge fan of Bose products, and these headphones are definitely worthy of their name! The sound is excellent, there are 3 different ear pieces to choose from for the right fit. The ones I chose fit my ears perfectly! No more falling out or sound loss, due to not fitting. They tell you when you turn them on how much battery power is left and what they are connecting to. An added bonus, you can connect them to your iPhone and iPad at the same time. I can watch a movie on my iPad and if my phone rings, it will pause the movie on my iPad and allow me to answer the phone call. They are definitely worth the money and as far as I am concerned Bose again has exceeded my expectations."
709,3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't seem to stay in while running. Maybe it is too large. Also when on the phone the quality is poor. Can't use.
710,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried too many headphones to remember them all, in the past all wired, and the last few years all BT. These are the best BT headphones I've used, ever. The connection is bullet-proof, and never drops. The sound is as good as you could hope for in this kind of product. And they never come loose in the ear. I'm a high-mileage runner, many hours per week, and I was nervous about that... but they stay in place better than any set I've had, including the kind with the over-ear ""hanger"". I tried these because I was impressed with some Bose ""full size"" BT headphones, and figured I had nothing to lose since they can be returned. I rarely write reviews, but these headphones are highly recommended."
711,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have recently purchased myself a pair of Bose Soundsport Wireless Headphones and am nothing less than impressed. For individuals that enjoy athletic activities such as: going to the gym, golfing, or going for a run, the Soundsport Headphones are a great accessory to all of these activities.

One problem someone may come across when working out is that their headphones may fall out when doing certain exercises, but not with the Soundsport Headphones from Bose. The shape of the headphone is well contoured to the shape of your ear and the headphones have been proven to not fall out during physical activities. To fight the chances of the headphone falling out even more the Soundsport Headphones are equipped with a shirt clip that offers even more protection to falling out of your ear.

The Bose Soundsport Wireless headphones have the redeeming quality of excellent bluetooth connectivity. This is a great feature for activities such as a leisure game of golf or if you are in a smaller home gym. The reason this is so great is that you are able to leave your phone or primary music device either on a counter in a gym or in your golfbag and still listen to your music with no problems. There is a range where the wireless headphones will not connect to the individual's music device, which is a fact true for any bluetooth device.

The Bose Soundsport Wireless Headphones give you great control over your music without needing your phone or primary music listening device. Connected to the wire that connects your two earbuds together is a control center for your music listening needs. The control center offers the listener the ability to control the volume of the song as well as move through tracks on your designated playlist. The control center also acts as a receiver if you were to get a phone call while wearing your Soundsport Headphones.

As a shopper for wireless headphones it would be of your utmost interest to make the investment into the Soundsport Wireless Headphones from Bose."
712,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these headphones about 7 months ago and they work great. The sound is good and they're pretty comfy for wearing for long stretches of time. The charge lasts maybe 6-7 hours, which is awesome. My only complaint is that the in-ear part doesn't seem to stay very well when I move around a lot. Like, if I wear these while exercising, I feel like I'm constantly pushing the left ear back in because it comes out a bit. It's a little annoying but not a huge deal.

I used to go through a new pair of headphones every 6 months or so, but these are holding up really well. I like them a lot. Hopefully they'll last a long time, and I would definitely buy another pair if these went out."
713,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was talked into buying a pair of Beats wireless headphones...the quality didn’t even come close to these Bose. The sound quality is Bose is absolutely beautiful! As someone who has studied music extensively, these are the only pair of headphones to listen to music with. I hear instruments with these that I didn’t even realize were there. These make me want to listen to music all day!"
714,2.0 out of 5 stars,These wireless headphones are by far the best Bluetooth headphones I have ever purchased. I've literally gone through 8 different brands of wireless headphones over the past year seeking high quality and powerful output but no other brand has compared to the bose soundsport yet! Bass is amazing. Bose unique wing design looks funny out of the ear but once in SO comfortable and secure in your ear. I train hard in the gym 6 days a week and these headphones he the job done so well and I never have to worry about them falling out or losing an air right seal in my ear canal. Battery life is only 6 hours but who needs to listen to music for more than 6 hours straight? Not me. If you like beats wireless headphones..throw them in the trash and buy a pair of bose soundsport.
715,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality when they work! Both earbuds would suddenly go static and I will no longer be able to hear anything beside a high pitch whistle. The headphones won't even turn off for few minutes before they switch off on their own few minutes later.

Update:
Bose exchanged them for me with the same color, and it was the same problem again, so I returned them. Then I went to a Bose store and got the same color, the store told me it might've been a bad batch on Amazon, anyway now a little over a month later, they're workimg perfectly. I think all the gray ones are defective, I got a black pair from Amazon before and I had no problem at all."
716,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I rarely write product reviews, but these headphones are well worth the effort.
I got them a few days ago and used them a couple of times already. The sound quality and in-ear fit is the best I ever had. It produces an unusually warm and deep sound compared to my previous in-ear bluetooth headphones in the same and even higher price range (see below). My use of bluetooth headphones is almost exclusively in the gym, where I’m listening mostly to trance and house music on them, though I’ve also tested classical music on these with great results. What really blew my mind was the deep and powerful bass this little beast can produce, way beyond any other in-ear headphone I ever owned. It actually sounds as good as a high quality over-ear headphone. The volume is on the higher end, enough to block out external noises such as the annoying low-quality pop sound track playing in the fitness center. Bluetooth and management seem to work well so far, no issues with multiple devices.

I have previously owned for the same use -
Jaybird Bluebuds X Bluetooth ($130) for about a year - it got to very high volumes, but the sounds were shallow, flat bass and the in ear fit was horrible.
Bang and Olufsen (B&O) Beoplay H5 ($250) for another year - The biggest disappointment and worst investment I ever made, weak volume, short battery life, flat bass and the dumbest bluetooth device management. In ear fit was mediocre.

The Bose SoundSport is absolutely the best bluetooth in-ear sport headphones in the $100-250 range I owned, highly recommended.
(this review is not sponsored by Bose in any way)"
717,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These replaced a pair of Bose (wired) SoundSport earphones that conked out after two years of abuse. The sound quality of these wireless earphones is definitely superior. I also own a pair of (wired) Bose QC20i noise cancelling earphones and the sound quality of these wireless earphones is near or equal to that of the QC20i. (These reports used an iPhone or iPod as sources playing either pre-recorded music or Pandora.) I was skeptical given past experiences and the bandwidth constraints of Bluetooth but it looks like the Bose engineers got their compression algorithms and equalizers down pat.

I also tested the heart rate monitor alongside the reliable and accurate Polar brand chest strap wireless heart rate monitor that came with my exercise machine and the two matched almost perfectly throughout a 45-minute workout."
718,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a grown woman with slightly smaller than average ears and these do not fit well. Very uncomfortable. I traded the original earbuds out for the smallest ones and even those don't fit and something plastic was digging into one of my ears. The eaebuds tips tend to fall off a lot as well. The sound is good and I like the case. But I would not recommend these on a comfort standpoint
719,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic sound quality with both music and phone calls. Microphone works great and these little buggers stay in well. I must, however, comment on the size. They are not discreet. Every time I catch a glimpse of myself while wearing them I realize why people having been giving me absurd looks all day. You know how the first ever cell phone was like the size of a brick? It seems as though these have a long way to go in their evolution too. But luckily I’ve found a great solution to this problem! Throw on some T-lake “sexy back” and envision youself on a catwalk. I mean really play into this, you’re strutting your stuff hardcore. Before you know it you’re turning heads simply because you’re so damn fierce. Trust me, it works every time."
720,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing. I've bought numerous pairs of bluetooth wireless headphones. Amazon seems to always have a decent cheap pair for $20 or $30 as a deal that I've always stuck to but they just don't sound that great. I decided to bite the bullet and spend the extra money on Bose for the ""Sound Excellence"". And man I'm glad I did! These sound amazing. All acoustics are in range. A lot of bass, great mid-range, and just enough treble. Perfect set of wireless headphones."
721,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this product 2 weeks so far so I will see how they hold up but so far I love them.. They stay in my ear which is nice since I use them mainly for running and working out and come with three different sizes of ear buds in case you have small or large ears and need something other than the standard size. They paired easily with my phone.. I did download an app for that, and I can go quite a distance away from my phone and still hear the music."
722,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never been a fan of using headphones while I lift weights, but these looked like they wouldn't get in my way, so I thought I'd give them a try. I used them once and was hooked! The Bose sound is great and they're so comfortable!! You might have to watch them if you're exercising laying down, but it's just a quick check to make sure you aren't laying on the wire... but seriously, not a big deal. Overall, I am happy with everything about them and am very happy with my purchase!!"
723,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't have a great ear for sound quality but believe these to be pretty good. Honestly, I can't tell the difference between them and headphones that are $10. They are however comfortable and have a decent battery life. They look a bit Frankensteiny, as they stick out of the ears but I'm an ugly bastard anyway."
724,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these bose and I am totally satisfied with my purchase, the battery is long lasting, they come with a customizable ear size (feels weird at first but then are extremely confy) , and are very easy to use.They fit to the ear so perfectly, and the sound is so amazing, when I returned to use the apple earpids they felt like utter trash, very loose, falling out of my ear, and the sound quality being so much worse than bose.Also, they are fully compatible with my IPhone 6s, showing the battery on the top right of my screen, and the app is truly amazing.The only problem is a buzzing sound when getting these on.Its just a lil buzz, and as soon as you connect to some sort of audio it goes away.Yet, they are still amazing, no regrets"
725,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love, love Bose products. The earbuds were encased in a lovely Bose box; it was like opening a gift. The use the earbuds on my daily walk and the sound quality is excellent. It is comfortable to wear and stays charged for a couple to days. I was hesitant to spend over a $100 for a pair of earbuds but I am so happy I did."
726,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife LOVES these headphones and takes them everywhere with her. She bought a charging case for these (I believe Bose brand from Best Buy), and it was the best complementary purchase for these headphones. The sound on these holds up to everything you've ever heard about Bose, the Bluetooth connection is rock solid, and they fit the ear canal very well."
727,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m a huge fan of Bose and wanted these headphones for a long time, unfortunately they didn’t work out for me. First, they wouldn’t stay in my ears regardless of the insert size I tried. They stick out quite far which adds weight and caused them to fall out regularly. Also, I couldn’t figure out the best way to deal with the cord as someone with long hair. Under/over the hair, nothing felt right. Not an issue for men/short-haired people I suppose."
728,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is great, and connects to bluetooth very fast. I love that.
But I am really having trouble with the plastic control buttons. They plastic cover for them is losoe and although I tried to put it back it just looks like the picture attached.
Also you can see that the cap near the earphone is also loose. That happened on both sides I guess that cap is there to protect the wire from stress, which makes me worried that the wire will eventually break..
I am still a big fan of the electronics, but unfortunately the packaging is undoing a great product and a great brand."
729,5.0 out of 5 stars,I never thought that I would write a poor review for a Bose product. I purchased these earbuds in August of 2017. It is not even the end of December 2017 and they will not completely charge nor hold a charge for any acceptable length of time even close to when I first got them. I am quite proficient in usages and charging of devices like these as I depend on them for work as well as personal use. I have never been so disappointed in a device that should have been better quality.
730,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always been a huge fan of Bose products as I feel they have superior sound quality for the best price and they have done it again. I highly anticipated getting these for my husband who absolutely loves them. He uses them while working out, biking, helping with the baby, cleaning...work calls also! I told him he has to get me a pair because they are so cool! Great if you have a kid and go for walks. The sound is awesome, feels like you're surrounded by music. Love love love them."
731,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is honestly the first time I have not loved a Bose product. The two hour battery time, and bluetooth features are great for exercising. In that regard this product shines, that is exactly what they were designed for. However, Im ready to throw these in the trash. The longer i use these, the more frequently they drop offline. After about 30 minutes of solid use, they will lose the connection with my phone roughly once every 3 minutes. So far the only way to avoid this loss of connection is to turn the earphones off, then back on. This will give roughly 15 minutes of uninterrupted play before the disconnections resume. Even after performing the update that the companion app had for me has done nothing to fix the reliability of these earphones. I know I'm not the most tech savvy person, and my style is a little old school, but the day i have to troubleshoot earphones and perform updates is the day that the utility is surpassed by the annoyance factor. I couldn't honestly recommend these to a friend, or even a stranger. Save your money, and look for alternatives."
732,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good battery life as advertised. Probably lasts me 3-4 workouts. These are NO noise cancelling, which I like; they do not completely seal your ear canal so you can still hear around them. Good range; I can leave my phone in my gym locker and shuffle through my playlist with just the built-in button. Nice design. Only con is I wish they felt more secure, the small clip that allows it to attach to you shirt is easily lost and can come off with light handling. the clip is important in keeping them from bouncing or pulling out of your ears but you can definitely get by without it."
733,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been purchasing LG Tones for years and every so often deviate --- for maybe a week or two to try a different bluetooth earbud headphone --- but always end up buying another LG Tone. Until now...

The Bose SoundSports are great! They are incredibly comfortable --- which is the primary reason I have been looking for something new. In addition to music (as expected, better than LG Tones), I can easily hear podcasts (remarkably clearer and louder than LG Tones) and phone calls (as well as LG Tones). Most importantly, what I'm NOT hearing is complaints from whomever I'm talking to. Other than when using LG Tones, that is a first!"
734,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is great but in 10 months they are falling apart. They have also started to turn on by themselves with no one touching them. Headphones are in one room and I am not using them and all of a sudden the audio on my computer or phone audio goes off and it is because the headphones have come on. This is especially great when you are on a call...
735,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I've tested FIVE separate pairs of the DSR7BT headphones (2 from Amazon, 2 from Best Buy, 1 from B&H Photo) and ALL of them have an audible hissing present when using a bluetooth connection to play audio.
That's pretty unacceptable for a $300 pair of headphones.
(The hissing is not present when using a wired connection)

I've tested the headphones on different audio devices to the same result. I've tried a different (and much cheaper) model of bluetooth headphones from Audio Technica and no hissing was present.
Not sure what went wrong with the QC on this model. I've been a huge fan of Audio Technica and I use the ATH-M50x on a daily basis but this experience kinda left a bad taste.

Hissing issues aside, the build quality is great and is aesthetically pleasing."
736,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones.

These are wireless and splendid.

1. What's in the box?: You receive the headphones and some instructions.

2. Set-up?: Absolutely easy. I turned these one and was connected and playing music within seconds actually. The bluetooth connection was excellent and never disrupted.

3.. Aesthetic and feel?: These are definitely premium headphones. The overall padding os very nice. The padding around the ears is great. The top of the headphones are also similarly padded and with that faux leather that feels great.

The cans are comfortable over the ear for me, though someone with larger ears may find these too small. But I can wear these easily for a long time, so I have no complaints in this regard.

Sound? Excellent. This brand has excellent sound. These are not sound canceling headphones however, so there is no active white nice blocking. But with music or podcasts going, the external sound is blocked almost totally. I found the sound to be excellent with these. It is not noticeable that these are wireless at all. The bluetooth connection has not been lost in my experience.

Overall: Excellent. Very well worth the money because of the premium feel and excellent sound. Wireless is the way to go."
737,3.0 out of 5 stars,"To my ears the ATH-DSR7BT are pretty true to the music, considering how does a person know what the recording process is meant to portray, or want a person to hear and then you have personal preferences which are different for everyone. Listening to these compared to another headset that I have high regards for (Plantronics BB Pro2) which also uses aptX. Going back and forth on a particular recording the ATH-DSR7BT sounded crystal clear and the bass, midrange and highs were where I like to hear them (pretty important, my preference). The BB Pro2's with noise reduction off had a more rounded bass compared to the ATH's. With noise reduction on they were pretty close across the board to my ears, while the ATH's seemed to be a little more accurate. Details were very close with the two with my ears. I also had the Bose QC35 which I returned after comparing them to the BB Pro2's. Both, the ATH's and the BB Pro2's are keepers for me. One advantage the BB Pro2's have is noise reduction which allows me to use them while I'm mowing my lawn. I'm using a Samsung Note8 primarily but use LG G5 for running and working out. The LG G5 is aptX HD compatible while the other one is just plain aptX. I really enjoy listening to music using both phones as well as both headphones."
738,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are wonderful wireless headphones. They are comfortable and sound absolutely excellent, when playing 24 bit audio files they sound better than any other wireless headphones I have put on. Definitely more detailed and natural in the mid and upper ranges than anything from Sony, Bose or B&W.

Appearance: They really look great, clean charcoal and black with stainless accents looks very sharp. 9/10

Build Quality: They feel very well put together, solid and of good quality materials. The only complaint is that they can have a tiny bit of noise between parts when adjusting the on my head, which has not been an issue on my previous Audio-Technica headphones. 9/10

Sound Quality: Mid ranges and uppers are totally natural, these are damn near perfect for female vocalists, guitars, strings or intricate percussion, all of the minutia is immediately apparent. Treble never seems to get shrill even at volume. Bass is somewhat restrained, typical with Audio-Technica so they are not ideal for hip hop but still decent, especially if you can adjust the equalizer on the playback device. The soundstage is definitely smaller than my AD-900's (which is just huge, but those are open-back 53mm headphones designed to do just that) however for 45mm closed back cans they better than I was expecting. Soundstage is better than the Sony WH-1000s and much better than Bose QC35s or B&W P7s. They can definitely pump the volume too. 9/10

Isolation: These are not active noise cancelling, but are closed back that seal around the ear very well and isolate outside noises more than adequately. 6/10

Comfort: The fit is a little tight for me, but I have a large head. Otherwise comfort is great for mobile headphones, they are padded with memory foam wrapped in a very supple leather/leatherette and are very comfortable for a couple hours of continuous listening. 9/10

Connectivity: Bluetooth works flawlessly from my cell phone or computer to about 40 feet away. These definitely sound better on a device that supports APTX-HD (24 bit) but still sound good on APTX (16 bit), but they definitely lose a little bit. They sound excellent on a USB connection to a computer too. Its weird not having a 3.5mm or 6.3mm cable, but it really has not an issue. NFC pairing works great too. 9/10

Battery Life: Advertised as 15 hrs, I have been averaging about 13.5 hrs on a charge, so not quite as good as Bose, Sennheiser or Bowers & Wilkins but these definitely sound better and are cheaper. 7/10

Overall: Excellent. Unless you need active noise cancellation or listen mostly to hip hop these are hard to beat. 9/10"
739,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Audible hiss. I went through 3 pairs (1 from Amazon, 2 at Best Buy), all of them had the same audible hiss. If you listen to Ke$ha, you won't hear it (at all), but classical or slower-paced music will always have that hiss over bluetooth.

They sound great wired (no hiss over USB). But you should wait until they fix the hiss (I'm convinced that all pairs of this on the market hiss). Don't assume you'll be able to get them 'fixed' either - Audio Technica customer service is absolutely terrible. I've sent them 3 e-mails, 2 got no response and 1 got a response after 4 days (which was not helpful). And they are impossible to reach over the phone - I've been sent to voicemail every time I've tried. By now, it's too late to return them.

If you're buying these to use as wired headphones, and only use them wireless for fast-paced workout music, they'll be just fine. If you want to listen to classical music or anything slower-paced on the go, find something else."
740,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I think the headphones look and sound great. Out of the box they are very well made with soft ear cups and very sturdy band. I had them on for hours and I didn't need a break from it. The highs and mids are fantastic. Very well balanced bass. Bluetooth connectivity was great and it synced easily. They make my Beats Solo 2 sound cheap. The issues I had with the headphones:

- the buttons were oddly placed. They were placed toward the back of the ear which takes getting use to. The on/off is a switch, the play/pause is a touch sensor and the volume is a spring switch.
- the headphones were very comfortable but the head band on top leaned forward when the headphone were straight on your head. It felt a little off.
- on the headphone, where you plug in the micro USB, the charging port is indented. Meaning you can't use any of your micro usb charger for it will not reach the port, but you can only use the one it came with.
- in between or when the music was paused, there was this hissing sound that drove me crazy. They said it was a malfunction on the headphones so I had them replace but the same thing happened to the replacement ones.

I loved them so much in terms of sound quality, but at the end I had them returned because of the cons."
741,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When you pay that much for a Bluetooth headphones, you expect a really good sound. I had to return those after a week... On the very first day that i got them, I started hearing a very annoying hiss noise without having any music playing. Also when you start playing music, the hiss is still there. Honestly after a week i just couldn't take it anymore, I returned those and got a cheaper headphones with no hiss. Disappointing A-T"
742,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this product using amazon prime and received the product a day later than the expected delivery day. Furthermore disappointed when I tested the item and it was throwing a hissing sound which was very noticeable. The hissing sound wasn't just during music. When on a call it was more consistent throughout the conversation.
I ended up returning the product the very same day. Will be looking for other options."
743,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounding headphones with a lot of range and depth. But only reason I’m giving 2 stars is this hissing noise immediately after pressing play and then 3 seconds after you press pause it’s goes away till you play more music, then it just will start again. There has been a few reviews and questions with this problem so it’s common enough and I’m still trying to get mine fixed."
744,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So far experience is really good. I love the sound quality, not a professional in audio but when I listen to them they are very very good. Reason for 4 star is because of having same complaints as other have about position of controls a bit odd. Also bass is not too heavy as in Sennheiser headphones but it's still pretty decent. I don't have any complaints. It does not have active noice cancellation but still lot of outside noice because of over ear cups.
So far a good purchase."

749,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Audible hiss. I went through 3 pairs (1 from Amazon, 2 at Best Buy), all of them had the same audible hiss. If you listen to Ke$ha, you won't hear it (at all), but classical or slower-paced music will always have that hiss over bluetooth.

They sound great wired (no hiss over USB). But you should wait until they fix the hiss (I'm convinced that all pairs of this on the market hiss). Don't assume you'll be able to get them 'fixed' either - Audio Technica customer service is absolutely terrible. I've sent them 3 e-mails, 2 got no response and 1 got a response after 4 days (which was not helpful). And they are impossible to reach over the phone - I've been sent to voicemail every time I've tried. By now, it's too late to return them.

If you're buying these to use as wired headphones, and only use them wireless for fast-paced workout music, they'll be just fine. If you want to listen to classical music or anything slower-paced on the go, find something else."
750,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I think the headphones look and sound great. Out of the box they are very well made with soft ear cups and very sturdy band. I had them on for hours and I didn't need a break from it. The highs and mids are fantastic. Very well balanced bass. Bluetooth connectivity was great and it synced easily. They make my Beats Solo 2 sound cheap. The issues I had with the headphones:

- the buttons were oddly placed. They were placed toward the back of the ear which takes getting use to. The on/off is a switch, the play/pause is a touch sensor and the volume is a spring switch.
- the headphones were very comfortable but the head band on top leaned forward when the headphone were straight on your head. It felt a little off.
- on the headphone, where you plug in the micro USB, the charging port is indented. Meaning you can't use any of your micro usb charger for it will not reach the port, but you can only use the one it came with.
- in between or when the music was paused, there was this hissing sound that drove me crazy. They said it was a malfunction on the headphones so I had them replace but the same thing happened to the replacement ones.

I loved them so much in terms of sound quality, but at the end I had them returned because of the cons."
751,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When you pay that much for a Bluetooth headphones, you expect a really good sound. I had to return those after a week... On the very first day that i got them, I started hearing a very annoying hiss noise without having any music playing. Also when you start playing music, the hiss is still there. Honestly after a week i just couldn't take it anymore, I returned those and got a cheaper headphones with no hiss. Disappointing A-T"
752,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this product using amazon prime and received the product a day later than the expected delivery day. Furthermore disappointed when I tested the item and it was throwing a hissing sound which was very noticeable. The hissing sound wasn't just during music. When on a call it was more consistent throughout the conversation.
I ended up returning the product the very same day. Will be looking for other options."
753,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounding headphones with a lot of range and depth. But only reason I’m giving 2 stars is this hissing noise immediately after pressing play and then 3 seconds after you press pause it’s goes away till you play more music, then it just will start again. There has been a few reviews and questions with this problem so it’s common enough and I’m still trying to get mine fixed."
754,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far experience is really good. I love the sound quality, not a professional in audio but when I listen to them they are very very good. Reason for 4 star is because of having same complaints as other have about position of controls a bit odd. Also bass is not too heavy as in Sennheiser headphones but it's still pretty decent. I don't have any complaints. It does not have active noice cancellation but still lot of outside noice because of over ear cups.
So far a good purchase."
755,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using headphones of various brands for 20 years with my brands of choice being Audio-Technica, AKG and Sennheiser. My preference is for a balanced and clear sound leaning towards the highs more than heavy bass, but with enough bass to balance the sound out well.

The look and build quality of these headphones is very nice. The don't feel cheap or too plastic and the overall size is nice for on ear headphones. I find them very comfortable with enough padding on both the ears and the top band. I never typically wear headphones more than an hour or two and have never had any discomfort for that time period. I know that people often complain that headphones often don't fit larger heads very well and I would be likely to agree that these would not be comfortable if that were the case. They fit my average size head well, but if they clamped any harder I think wearing them for more than about half an hour might be a problem.

The blue tooth connectivity has been easy and reliable on an ipod, ipad and macbook air. I sometimes have to tell the laptop to connect twice, but once it connects I've never had a problem with a reliable connection. The battery life has been amazing. I use them daily for both phone calls and music and the headphones have lasted at least a couple weeks on a charge at 1-2 hours use per day. The bluetooth technology of pausing, advancing and changing the volume has worked flawlessly.

I am very particular about the quality of sound I get from my headphones and am quick to return any headphones that don't measure up. That's not the case here at all. The sound quality is phenomenal with a fantastic balance between the bass, mid-tones and highs. They measure up to any headphones I've ever owned and it's a pleasure to listen to any of the huge spectrum of music I enjoy. The sound quality of the mic for phone calls has also been good based on the people I've asked.

If I lost these I would order another pair without hesitation and can highly recommend these for their amazing sound quality, build and functionality. Best headphone purchase I've made in years..."
756,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones, which are my first Bluetooth ones. I read lots of reviews of different brands and tried out the Bose SoundLink on-ear model (similar size and price) at Costco. The Bose phones cost about $40 more and last half as long per charge (15 hours vs 30 hours for these Audio Technicas). The Bose headphones sounded quite good, but these sound better! I'm not sure why Audio Technica headphones don't get reviewed as often as some other brands, or why they don't get as much ""love"", but frankly, as a professional musician they are my favorite brand! I've been using ATH-50's for years to record and mix music and they are fantastic! I also have a pair of ATH-40x phones that are excellent. If you like ""hyped"" sound, they are probably not for you, but if you want flat, true sound reproduction, Audio Technicas are great. I was a little worried these phones might be bass-heavy, but they are quite balanced. They do have nice full, deep bass as advertised, but it doesn't feel hyped to me. What I'm enjoying is that when you turn the volume down, the bass doesn't go away! I am loving these phones and highly recommend them!!"
757,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an owner of ath-m50x's, Audio-Technica's professional studio monitor headphones for my streaming and gaming scene, I needed something to take on the go with my iPhone 7 (yes I know I screwed up there). These fit the bill and the budget, which is exactly what AT was trying to hit. They really are great headphones, hold up fairly well and sound.... well, ok. Treble and mids sound great, bass and the lows sound crisp, just dont use heavy bass boosters when listening through bluetooth. Overall great headphones. I would recommend to anyone looking for some quality bluetooth headphones from a respected brand. The battery life is wonderful, lasting a few weeks listening to a few hours each day, which is just great

Ps: buy a case, these wont take any hard hits

EDIT: the sound issues that i described were only over bluetooth, while listening to them when wired into my phone i had no issues. And while i would still recommend a case anyways, they ended up being sturdier than i expected. +rep"
758,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a collector of bluetooth headphones! I'm not an audiophile but I am a professional musician and know what I like as far as sound. The quick and dirty on these: The sound is very clear, detailed sound. The mids are perfect. The highs are very crisp but not too much so that it's bothersome. The bass is nice and has good warmth but could be fuller sounding. The sound overall is precise which I like - but it's a bit dry - meaning it could resonate a bit more and open up. These are not bass-heavy but they do not disappoint when listening to EDM or rap/hip-hop. I am a bit of a bass-head so I wish there was more emphasis on the bass. These are better suited for orchestral music/film music/instrumental/acoustic. Controls are nice and battery life is excellent. Comfort is also excellent. These are on-ear headphones. They have enough clamp to stay put on your head but without causing any fatigue or pain. Overall, I really like these."
759,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This Audio-Technica ATH-AR3BTBK SonicFuel Wireless On-Ear Headphones with Mic & Control, Black is the third set of Bluetooth headphones I have been offered.

All in all, they are the best of the three I own. I'll tell you why.

The first one I got was this Francois et Mimi VT006 Active Noise Canceling Over-Ear Headphones which are quite inexpensive. (Actually what I got was labelled VT104; I cannot find that item here on Amazon and I do not what difference, if any, there is between the two models.)

The second one I got was this Sony XB950B1 Extra Bass Wireless Headphones with App Control, Blue (2017 model) which are much more expensive (and much more expensive than the Audio-Technica ones under review here).

Now these first two headphones both produce excellent sound quality when listening to music, as does this third one. But, as with all things, all three have some advantages and some disadvantages.

The Francois et Mimi phones do not have an effective built-in microphone so they cannot be used for making cell-phone calls (my experience with making such calls was disappointing). They also do not hold their charge for really long periods. But you CAN use them plugged into the AC power as they're recharging. And, of course, you can use them plugged into an auxiliary (3.5mm) socket on your phone, computer, or stereo amplifier, no battery usage being necessary. They are 'around the ear' type and are quite comfortable for me. They do not come with a carrying case but I found this Lightning Power - Universal Water Proof Headphone Protection Pouch Bag 11 x 9.25 in Metallic Gray Color which is inexpensive and satisfactory.

The Sony phones DO have a very efectivef built-in microphone so they are eminently suitable for making telephone calls with your cell phone. As a matter of fact, of the three Bluetooth headphones I own, these Sonys are the best for making phone calls; this is according to people whom I've called with all three of these headphones. They hold their charge for quite a long time and, of course, can be used with an auxiliary 3.5mm cable, even if the battery has gone flat. But they CANNOT be used while plugged into the AC and charging. They too are around the ear type and I find them to be quite comfortable. Again no case is offered but this Hard EVA Travel Blue Case for Sony MDRXB950BT/B MDRXB950BT/L MDRXB950BT/R Extra Bass Bluetooth Headphones by Hermitshell is a perfect fit and its price won't 'break the bank.'

However, in my opinion, these Audio-Technicas are the best of the bunch. They are 'on-ear' type and, at least for me, they are the most comfortable Bluetooth headphones I own. They too have an effective built-in microphone, and though cell-phone calls are not quite as clear as those made with the Sony headphones, the sound quality is adequate. They are claimed to hold their charge for 30 hours (I have not yet verified that claim). They also CANNOT be used while charging. (I should mention here that I charge all of these headphones with this Pwr+ Extra Long 6.5 Ft 2.1A Rapid Tablet-Wall-Charger for Google-Nexus 7, 9, 10 Tablet Tab; Samsung-Galaxy Tab 3, 4 7.0, Note 8.0; Nexus S Phone ; Asus-Transformer Book T100 Memo Pad 7, 8, 10 Hd FHD Smart; Galaxy S2, S3, S4, S6, S7 Edge; HTC One A9 M7 M8 M9, Desire; BLU Advance, Studio 5.0 5.5 6.0 7.0, One X Plus, Win HD, Life Play, Vivo Air, PURE XL, LIFE ONE X2 Phone; Motorola Moto G, RAZR M, X Pure; Huawei Honor 5X; BlackBerry DTEK50; Anker Battery Cell Phone-Power-Cord which is superb.) As with the other two, they can be used with an auxiliary 3.5mm cable and they do not come with a carrying case.

I ordered this Khanka Headphone Hard Case for Audio-Technica ATH M50-M40, Sony, Panasonic, Xo Vision, Behringer, Maxell, Bose, Photive, Philips, Beats and More - Black. It's a little large for these headphones (see photograph below and, if you're interested, please read my review of the case) but it does easily hold the phones, the accessory cables, and the fairly large charger I use.

But it is their sound quality when playing music that moves these Audio-Technica headphones to the top of the heap. Even though the Sony has an extra-bass setting, and its sound quality is excellent, the sound quality of this Audio-Techica, which has no special bass setting, beats it as well as the Francois et Mimi headphones hands down.

I use my Bluetooth headphones primarily for listening to classical music Internet Radio stations. There is one, Audiophile Classical (and one of its sisters Audiophile Baroque) which transmit at 320 kbps. Their sound is exemplary. And through the Audio-Technica headphones, you really hear what they're transmitting.

I have to say that the soundstage and apparent imaging through these phones is remarkable, the best I have heard through ANY headphones, Bluetooth or not. Music sounds almost as if the orchestra, group, or soloist(s) are right in front of you rather than being in the middle of your head.

And the imaging is such that I can visualize exactly where the instruments or soloist(s) are placed.

The effect is uncanny and I have never heard its like before through headphones. They really have to be experienced to be believed.

In my reviews of those other headphones, I highly recommended them - and I still do.

But I give this Audio-Technica ATH-AR3BTBK SonicFuel Wireless On-Ear Headphones with Mic & Control, Black the highest possible recommendation that I can give.

I do thank you for reading this and for considering my opinions.

760,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I live in NYC, use the subway everyday where people are constantly screaming for an hour twice a day & I work in an open space. I work in digital communications and sit through tons of social video footage daily. I have big Sony wireless, noise cancellation ones for the office but I needed lighter & portable ones for the subway ride. These hurt after prolonged wear because they sit on your ears and could be just a little bigger. The plastic part to adjust the headphones to fit well around the head isn’t as smooth as a Sony or Bose.

But I❤️ these. Pros: great sound quality plugged in & on WiFi. No static or any of the drama that accompanies Bose wireless headphones like static problems in the left earphone & static with Apple products. I have been ordering and returning Bose wireless headphones from Amazon because of the static problem for three months now so I was really really happy when these arrived and worked perfectly. No static. Really great bass and no distortion. Vibrant sound. These are for music lovers who need good portable, wireless headphones at this price range.

Cons: the design could be improved. Since it sits on top of ears and the plastic headphone doesn’t fit as well, you have to press on the earphones when the whole thing moves on your head & ears. For comfort, Bose wireless headphones are better. The illustrated instructions for adjusting volumes were confusing—I had to go to the online manual to understand the difference between fast forwarding and increasing the volume—-slide normally and release vs slide and hold for 2 secs to fast forward to the next song."
761,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm going to give this 4 stars because I think not everyone might complain what about my issues, but personally for me these are 3-stars. My breakdown:

Pros:
- Relatively comfortable
- Great folding
- Look pretty good
- Great battery
- Pretty sturdy

Cons:
- Sound is okay, not great, not even through aux. Again, not BAD but not great if youre looking for sound quality above all else
- Interface is a little clunky. Not super easy to flick the little buttons when the headphones are on your head, and real easy to do it accidentally
- Doesn't lock with iOS/Mac volume, so essentially you end up working with two volumes, one on the headset and one on your device. I like to have a balanced sound output and its hard to know where the baseline for the levels on the headphones are."
762,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first good quality bluetooth headphone; other BT headphones were cheap, throw away ones that did not last very long. This one is compact but offers sound clarity that is comparable to my (non BT) AKG K240, which is my reference. It is not bass heavy but quite neutral which is what I like. It pairs with everything very easy; no experience with any connection drop so far. I used in on trans-continental and long over-seas flights, excellent so far.

My only complaint is that the cable that comes with the phone is very bad. The sound is harsh and no sound stage at all. Substituting that with another cable and the situation changed entirely. If you are not satisfied with the sound using the cable, consider switching to a different one before returning the phone."
763,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first pair audio technica headphones and I couldn't be happier with them. I'm not an audiophile but an average user, however I must say that these headphones sound amazing. The sound is clear, and well balanced, the bass is not too strong and you can really appreciate the music. I love the sleek, low profile/minimalistic design of the headphones and the gold accent gives them a nice touch. Build quality is incredible and they are very sturdy, specially the hinges. What impresses me the most is the battery life, I've had them for about 3 weeks now and have only charged them once though it should be noted that I use them for a couple of hours a day so your mileage may vary, but the 30hr listening and 1000hrs standby times do seem accurate to me. Definitely recommended, specially for the price. Audio Technica makes amazing products and I'm very pleased with these headphones."
764,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first foray into blue tooth headphones and they have not disappointed me at all. I wear them to the gym to lift weights all the time, with no issues of falling off or excessive heat and sweating (and I do plenty of sweating). I have worn them mowing my lawn, operating power tools, and the typical listening sessions. I prefer them for activity listening as opposed to the headphones I will wear at my desk (I have other headphones I prefer for that). Sound wise they are pretty accurate, with a slight V shaped sound to them which I find good for a broader music range without sacrificing accuracy or losing the mids. I have compared them to some of my other headphones and sure there is a difference between these and my other larger headphones (HD 558, ATH M50x, Momentums), but these are also cordless, on ear, and cheaper and by no means lacking anywhere near enough to not justify their price or purchase. Battery life is solid, and quality wise they feel pretty good. They are plastic over metal and vinyl (no different than Beats in that regard) and priced accordingly. Some have expressed doubts about durability, I don't have those doubts, and any adult that doesn't abuse or neglect their stuff shouldn't have a problem."
765,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these head phones. I'm no expert on headphones or music but I travel a lot and they are exactly what I wanted. They are comfy, store easily, great sound, and though they arent noise cancelling everything outside is muted. Great battery life and dont hurt my ears (even when I leave my piercings in). Overall great value and would highly recommend!"
766,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound and design. Sound is better than Beats Solo2 which I also own. Ear pads are not quite as large and comfortable as Beats but they are still more than sufficient. They are good for working out and do not come off running on treadmill and weightlifting. Excellent value, don't overpay for the name of a product."
767,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the sound quality! It does the job; I'm learning how to mix and sample. This is worth its price, and the design/logo is cute!!"
768,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is great. I have owned a few pairs of headphones in this price range and these are by far the best. Everything sounds clear even at high volumes. There is only one problem I have with them and that is the build quality. They feel like they are made from the cheapest materials possible (as they probably were to bring such great sound to budget headphones) and every time I put them on it feels like they are going to break. However if you aren't going to be working out or anything with them then I definitely recommend.
769,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones overall are great. But I have a great deal of great cans. I am always looking for those gems. The Ath Sr line is blahh. The soundstage is so direct. Pretty flat on the mids but overstated in the high end. As with all audio Technica your going to get true to sound equalizer sound qualities but I guess I expected more. Thinking about the bt adapter for my mx50s but trying out a Sennheiser pair for the next month. Letcha know...
770,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like everything about these headphones except one thing, they really hurt my ears after a few minutes and family members agree. Most likely returning them."

It is a pleasure to be able to turn the volume down and my husband still can hear at his preferred volume!

All in all we are both very happy with the headphones and would highly recommend them."

778,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great sounding. Not real loud on bluetooth mode but excellent quality. Wired mode does not require power BTW.

781,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect! I mainly use them for the gym and they do not bother me at all. (Except for when I do abs, the fall off which is normal)."
782,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones. I had been using Beats and at first these headphones sounded flat and lacking bass. I listened to the AR3BT for a full day and started to hear nuances in my music that I hadn't heard in a long time. I realized I liked this sound profile better. I was able to get the Audio Technical for $80 and at that price point, there's nothing that compares. My one big gripe is that the volume controls on the headset and my phone operate independently of each other. It would have been preferable if the volume was synced on both devices. This is not a deal breaker for me but something that should be noted."

787,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have a new television that has a Bluetooth speaker. This headset pairs with the Bluetooth speaker and delivers great sound wirelessly. Now I can watch TV late at night and not bother anyone. The quality of the sound from the headset is really better than the TV speaker itself. The headset battery is supposed to last about 5 hours and then It has to be charged with a USB cable. It does not take it long to charge. I am really happy that I bought these headphones.
788,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is very low. I had my volume up all the way and it's still at a very low volume. It is louder without the headphone. The quality of the sound is decent, honesty just another pair of headphones. The cuffs are way too small and the headphone itself is too small and too cheap. Definitely not worth the $100 price tag, more of a cheap $30-$50."

It seems like everything is going BlueTooth these days, from one's iPhone to your tablet, so I thought it best to check-out Bluetooth headphones. These by Audio-Technica are well thought-out. With Bluetooth speakers, it seems most manufacturers can't quite get how to handle volume and going to the next song, or going back a song, from the speaker, making the listener having to toggle between two or three switches, but Audio Technica has just two switches on it. On the right side is the Bluetooth on-off switch, and on the left side is a toggle switch that handles volume and going backwards or forwards on a CD, Stream, or iTune-type music program. Pushing the left toggle forward and holding it makes music go back to the beginning of the tune or the previous tune. Pushing the left toggle forward and letting it go reduces the volume a notch. Pushing the left toggle backwards and holding it makes the music go to the next tune. Pushing the left toggle backwards and letting it go increases the volume a notch.

You can also answer telephone calls with the Audio-Technica headphones. You can use the microphone built into the left cushion. Pressing the jog switch on the left cushion answers a call coming into your phone if you are using your phone is connected via Bluetooth to the headphones. Pressing and holding the jog switch rejects a call. Once you have started talking via the built-in microphone, or the one attached in the detachable cable supplied for smartphones, you can end a call by pressing the jog switch. Pressing and holding he job switch for two seconds, you switch the call to your mobile phone or to the headphones.

I have used a number of great wired headphones from Koss's Pro4A and Pro4AA Studio and HV/A1 models back in the 1970's to some recent high-end Phillips models, and they gave me clear sound. While I found the Audio-Technica ATH-AR3BTBK's to be very well made, solid plastic pieces with metal at any joints, the tonal quality is good in clarity, the manufacturer's specs say the range is from 5-35,000 Hz, and this is using the same tablet that I played Bose Resolve+ and B+O through and got exceptional sound. I paired the Audio-Technica with a couple of other music sources and iTunes from my MacBook Pro, and the sound was good from all.

These headphones folded-up nicely, and their ear cushions were soft, with the sewn together pieces being away from where they might receive stress from ones ears, unlike another manufacturer's, which came apart just past the one-year warranty. I have a larger head than most folks, and these fit snug, but comfortable, on me.

Unlike some headphones that don't give you everything needed, in addition to the micro USB charging cable, these come with a 52-inch, double plugged, 4 pin 1/8th inch/3.5mm plug, cord for playing these as ""wire"" headphones in airplanes, etc. This cord has a switch for answering the telephone.

Overall, I liked these headphones, they are easy to use with your music and you don't have to worry about getting the wires tangled-up everywhere. The battery takes a while to charge, just under 4 hours for the first charge, but you get a couple of days of continuous use before they need recharging."
793,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve only been using these Audio-Technica headphones for about a week so I may update this review later. So far I’m relatively happy. The sound is good. There could be a bit more bottom but overall I’m very satisfied with the sound.

At first I found these to be very comfortable, but not so much after 30 minutes. They began to feel too snug and I was looking forward to giving my ears a rest. I’m thinking they could have used a bit more padding.

The toggle on the headphone controls the volume, skips songs forward and reverse, plays and pauses music and performs phone functions. I admit I kept mixing things up. It’s going to take a bit of getting used to but I think they’ll be a breeze to use as I use them more often.

The directions say they have the ability to connect to up to 8 devices, but until you ""forget"" the one it's attached to, it doesn't even show up for another device. I tried them on my phone and ipad.

So aside from a few quibbles, I’m very happy so far. Best Bluetooth headphones I’ve ever owned."
794,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to admit that after purchasing several ear bud type bluetooth headphones, I was never satisfied enough to make the switch from wired. My two main gripes were that, with no place for a battery, the charge always seemed to die when I needed them most and second the audio fidelity was nothing to get excited about. So, I tended to always go back to my Bose Noise Cancelling headphones that use a single AAA battery incorporated and offered sound quality more than enough for my needs (plus the obvious quiet when especially on noisy flights) or my Denon or Shure wired ear buds that both offer incredible sound, though with the restrictions of their cords. The obvious drawbacks for those are the risk of snagging the cord if I'm doing some other activity while listening or if it's plugged into my laptop, needing to just take them off if I need to retrieve something away from my desk or wherever I'm working. So I thought I'd give this Audia-Technica product a try. While it might seem superficial, and I never understood the allure of unboxing videos, it can be predictive that if a manufacturer gave noticeable thought to designing the external packaging well, they must have an eye for detail and refinement in the product design. The box this comes in has an interesting tactile feel that's more than just laminated cardboard. More appreciated was the small details when opening the box. like the half moon open recess that allows your thumb to slide back the flange that holds the top securely shut. Any part of the simplified packaging that requires you to pull something apart or open has an easy tab there making everything obvious. Inside the box you'll find the headset, the USB charging cable and a cord with a control along it's length in case you want to use these as a corded headset, if you neglected to charge them. I might mention that the usage time is stated as around 30 hours a charge which seemed very generous to me, but it's great to have the cord as a backup. There's also a full sized actual manual in 10 different languages that very clearly details the functions without needing to get a magnifying glass for some tiny paper some manufacturers seem to include these days or needing to download a pdf file for your instructions.The headset is minimalistic but well made. The two ear pieces are hinged so that they fold into the main arc to minimize the size for storage or transport. The arched headband expands easily to adjust for head size. The ear cups have soft inserts that make them very comfortable over your ears. The right side has the on off switch The left has the micro-USB opening for charging, the opening for the cord if you need to use it, and between them a switch that serves 3 purposes. Move it forward or backward for 2 seconds to raise or lower the volume, or push it either way for just a second to advance to the next song or go back to the previous. If you receive a phone call you can push quickly to receive it or hold 2 seconds to reject the call. Conveniently, I received a call while writing the review and the caller was clear and easy to hear. The music automatically mutes. I asked the caller how I sounded to them and they said clear and understandable though it did should like I was talking on a microphone. Instructions are given as to how to pair it with your device, and it allows pairing with up to 8 different devices. That left ear cup also has a small letter ""N"" which allows you to use it to pair with NFC equipped android devices. I touched my android phone to the N and it instantly made the pairing. I disconnected that connection and immediately went to pair it with the MacBook Pro I had in front of me. It was recognized immediately and again, did the pairing. I opened the SiriusXM app and started streaming to get a first idea of the sound quality. What I heard seemed at first a bit muted and flat, until I realized that the EQ app it deferred to by default was set to a flat setting. I experimented with other preferences and could hear the range the headphones were capable of. For the next 3 hours I went from different music genres to listening to talk radio, to watching a TV episode streamed via the laptop. The seal of the ear cups sealed out noise so well, I really felt I had noise cancelling headphones on. Also, the weight was so light, I almost forgot I was wearing them even after 3 hours. I still need to experiment further with the sound, but so far I would say the phones favor midrange and higher frequencies without neglecting base, though base isn't emphasized or boomy. As for range, the manual says the bluetooth range is about 33'. I didn't do actual measuring, but walking between rooms, there was no lag or cutoffs at all. I've only had these a short time, but can say they easily exceed any other wireless headsets I've tried to date and frankly, for the price, exceeded my expectations. While I have a constant flow of new electronics passing through my house with different degrees of usefulness, I can sincerely say that the utility, freedom and function of these headsets, so far, make it the most appreciated device I've gotten in some time. The only small negative, is that no case, not even a simple fabric storage holder was included for storage and transport; especially since it will be easy for, especially the included wired cord to get separated or lost. It seems the cost of inclusion would have been very minimal. I hope that 30 hour charge duration holds true, and I'll need to report back about that, but so far very impressed and can highly recommend these if you're shopping for a good quality, reasonably priced bluetooth headphone."
795,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I already have a set of headphones I use for listening to music, and they are much more expensive than these. Comparing the two would be unfair, especially since these have a microphone, which the others do not. A definite plus to these! But I have to agree with another reviewer that the mid range has a slightly ""muddy"" sound to it.

I got these headphones because I wanted blue tooth headphones with a microphone to make calls on Skype on my tablet. I was able to successfully pair these and place a call using Skype, and my friend's voice was loud and clear. He also heard me well. The problem is that these are not comfortable for me, especially when I'm wearing glasses. There's just too much pressure against my ears, and I cannot wear these for long because the ear pieces are a little too small with insufficient padding. I'll have to go back to some sort of Logitech headset."
796,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I start every headphone review with the same line: I own about 25 pairs of wireless, wired, and studio headphones. I find the audio reproduction on these to be quiet, reserved, dark. There is no hiss that my ears can detect, none. I've been using these to have quiet time at my desk, not even in recordings I know have hiss. This leads me to believe there is some (probably intentional) attention of higher frequencies. Bass is neither under nor over-represented. I find them lacking warmth overall, but was also surprised by the good Bluetooth performance with iOS (both range and audio quality). The headphones are comfortable overall, they're a little too small to cover my big ears entirely. Overall, their performance is commiserate with their price. They're a good travel pair of phones, and I pick them up when I need some peace and quiet :)"
797,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After having tested probably a dozen or more Bluetooth headphones by now, these Audio-Technica headphones rate near the top, but definitely would not be my first choice for a variety of reasons.

First, I'll go over some of the better aspects of these headphones. The 40mm drivers are absolutely first-rate, delivering a very punchy sound that doesn't skimp on bass response. Although they do not include the noise-cancelling type of isolation that over-ear headphones deliver, the sound is very clear and distinct at higher levels. At lower levels you can definitely hear some background noise creep in though.

Bluetooth connectivity is flawless. The older Bluetooth headphones were a pain to get paired and working. By contrast, these are the easiest (and fastest) Bluetooth headphones I have ever used when pairing them to my computer. I have never once had them drop a connection, despite pushing Bluetooth range to its limits (about 30 feet). Battery time seems to be right up to specs as well.

The biggest downside to these headphones is inherent in their design, unfortunately. On ear headphones compromise sound quality and comfort at the expense of convenience and portability. These are no different. While they initially go on pretty comfortably, I can't imagine wearing them for hours on end. Every time you move your head you end up needing to adjust them to keep from blocking the sound, which makes them a bad fit (literally) for sports or any activity where you are moving around a lot. As I also mentioned, the lack of a solid fit AROUND the ears brings in background noise from the outside, no matter how tight the fit. For on-ear headphones these are really good, but even modest over-ear headphones will outperform them.

With many excellent over-ear headphones selling in the same price range, I would not opt for these. If you HAVE to use on-ear headphones for whatever reason though, these are an excellent choice compared to most."
798,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones offer really good sound quality for music and talk with the full sound of rock songs coming through solidly. There seems to be a good mix of bass and beat. At the price range, I can't imagine this not meeting expectations for sound. Although they are not noise cancelling, you can turn the music up plenty loud enough to cancel outside noises. They are on-ear headphones rather than over-ear. They rest on my ears and after a while they become uncomfortable. I would probably describe myself as having a slightly larger than average head, so they are a bit tight even though they extend to fit. They could use some more padding. If these were sized, I would place them as a medium. I need a large.

The controls are easy to use. Bluetooth pairing is no problem. They have a unique volume and forward/backward control stick that is easy to find and use compared to buttons. That is a nice feature. The speakers fold in to the headband for storage; however, they do not come with any sort of bag or case -- that would be another nice value-added feature.

For the price range, I think these are pretty good and reasonable."
799,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Having used a few bluetooth headphones, these are one of my favorites. The pairing process was super simple, and the battery life is excellent (stated to be 30 hours, I generally get a bit less but still great). The headphones are very lightweight, which is good and bad. It's good for wearing around the house (which I do, while doing chores), but means that the earpieces feel slightly small on my ears and don't do a fabulous job of cancelling out ambient noise. Then again, they aren't billed as ""noise cancelling"", so you really can't hold them to that standard. My only other ""nit"" is that the controls for on/off and track changes are super tiny. Like elf finger tiny. So while I don't have a problem turning them on when the headphones aren't yet on my head, it is a bit hard to use the buttons while you're wearing the set. Given how great the sound and battery life is, and how relatively minor the annoyance of small buttons, still 5 stars!"
800,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I think these are a good pair of headphones. The sound is good but not extraordinarily good. There was not any issues with skipping that is normal with a lot of bluetooth headphones. I like the physical buttons. And visually they are an appealing retro styling.

The only problem with them is that they are small. Fit with headphones is particular to the person. So these probably are great for many people. But they are too small for me. I have a pretty normal sized head, but the cuffs are too small to fit around my ears and to bit sit comfortably on my ears. And the arm is shaped too narrowly. The cuffs extend to my ears, but the arms pull them in too tightly. My wife thinks they fit fine so I am not going to return them or anything."
801,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable. Easy to use controls. I've had the BOSE noise-cancelling headphones, my favorite, forever. But....there's a cord. I was looking for something cordless and just couldn't cough up the $$$ for the expensive headphones like this. Now that I have them, I'm a bit annoyed that I didn't get them sooner. I can't compare them to other similar headphones, but I can compare them to my BOSE headphones and earbuds. I like it just as well. No noise-cancelling, of course, but that's okay; I'm not on an airplane. The controls to answer a call when connected to my iphone are very easy. The controls aren't tiny; I can see them without putting on my reading glasses! So far, so good. Easy. Good sound. Good phone call reception. I can be heard by the other person. Recommend."
802,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Look great, (more importantly) sound great. Very easy to pair with my iPhone 6s. The manual seems to imply that there is a built-in microphone for use in phone calls, but my brief attempt to use them that way didn't seem to work. There is an optional cord that definitely has a mic, which can be used instead of a bluetooth connection if your battery dies (a very good feature, I think), but it's great to have a true wireless connection to your phone for listening to music.

I have a very large head (I rarely wear hats but when I do they have to be at least size 8) but these headphones are very comfortable and plenty big enough (an issue with some other headphones I've tried)."
803,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality for the price. They sound great, comfortable, and easy to fold up and store in your carry on. I will confirm the longevity of the stand by battery and useagr battery. Amazing! Very easy to connect to your Bluetooth. No complaints!"
804,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been looking for inexpensive headphones and these are great! Ok, not like Boise quality, but for the price they are fantastic. I can go out for a 2 hour walk and they don't run out of power. I can use them on the elliptical at the gym and they stay in place. Very comfortable and not big huge. Fully adjustable and easy to switch to the next song. Synced right away to my iPhone 6+. Great product, love it!!!"
805,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have become quite picky about my headphones over the years, and I can honestly say that these are the best Bluetooth headphones I have ever purchased or use. I love them! I use them every day for music, audio-books, and phone calls from my smartphone. It connects quickly and reliably, and I have never lost connection accidentally. I’ve also never had a sputtering connection, except at long distances…say 20 feet or more. They are well constructed, and phone conversations work well with the embedded microphone. Highly recommended!"
806,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Audio-Technica ATH-AR3BTBK SonicFuel Wireless headphones saved me on a recent overseas trip, which gave me a chance to really use them and decide what I like and don't like about them.
I charged them up at home, which didn't take very long (nice!). Paired them with my laptop, phone, and iPod, a very easy process. At home the sound was clear with a good range, and while they are not noise cancelling, using this type of headphone does get rid of some of the ambient noise. They offer a richer sound than my iPod headphones (and probably all bud style ear phones.)
After my initial experimenting, I ventured overseas on a 15 hour flight. Yay! Lots of movies! Plugged it in using the enclosed cord. But I only got sound if I continued gripping the volume button on the cord. How annoying. Gave up and used my iPod buds. Didn't need them until the return trip, plugged them in and poof! Glorious clear rich sound, no matter what I wanted to watch. I ended up watching a TV series that was 6 episodes long and they only started bugging me on the last episode. So I got almost 6 hours of continuous use, battery was fine, sound was consistent, and the whole trip was made more comfortable. While they didn't deaden all outside noise, they did help.
Pros: good range with deep base and clear treble. Short charging time. Good battery life. Ease of use. Compact when not in use.
Cons: none that I can think of, except for some slight ear discomfort after several hours of use.
I don't have any other headphones, so full disclaimer: I'm comparing these to the crappy airline ones and to my iPod buds. I have tried the very nice Bose noise cancelling headphones and would choose those in a minute over these. But they are not even designed for the same kind of use and cost more than 3 times as much. I've heard these compared unfavorably to Beats but I can't speak to that.
The price point is reasonable, and the headphones are solid and will give you a good listening experience. Highly recommended."
807,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been wearing these for 3 months now, and they are very comfortable and easy to use. My favorite thing about them is that even when left on, the battery doesn't drain quickly. I typically use them for about 45 minutes every day, and always forget to turn them off. Nonetheless, after a month, the battery was still 70% charged. This does not happen with my other bluetooth speaker headphones.

Using the volume setting required me to look up the manual, but I got the hang of it soon enough."
808,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable headphones with lots of adjustments for size. Controls seem small and hard to find. Sound is very clear even when turned up loud. Would like the bass to be stronger. Bonus points for wired connection still working when software and battery have inevitably failed.

These are perfect to link to Roku for personal listening while your mate is asleep.

And they fold up to be fairly compact."
809,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a great set of on ear compact wireless headphones.
I love that you can also use them wired and that the cord has controls on it.
My favorite headphones are my ATH-M50X's. They sound truly incredible. However with iPhones no longer having a headphone jack and everything going wireless it is nice to have a bluetooth pair.
I do detect a slight hissing sound when nothing is playing at times. It is barely noticeable. For critical listening I will stick with wired headphones if possible. However for the cord free experience these are great.
I like the compact size and folding storage position that also keeps them protected better.
These sound very good from the low end to the high end. They are comfortable for an on the ear pair. I would give them a couple of hours before they start to hurt a little.
Great Audio Technica quality. Pairs easily and fast via Bluetooth.
I would recommend them."
810,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Audio-Technica has been turning out a top-notch product for year, and I would put them in my top 3 for value/sound (if you prefer a well-rounded sound. They don't specialize in bass-heavy sound). These days I having been opting for wireless headphones for the convenience and because Apple took away my headphone jack for no real reason. These are a great option for everyday listening when I want an on-ear headphone and not earbuds.

First things first, these don't feel like a cheap, plastic cans. They have a nice heft and smooth hinging, which may not sound like it matters terribly, but it does when you are looking for longevity and comfort. I have listened to these for hours without problems and they fit my head just fine. The toggle on the headphone itself lets you control volume and skip/pause/reverse.

They come with a built-in microphone for phone calls - I don't use that feature, but if you do, I can confirm that it works great. The Bluetooth connection is smooth and reliable. It is easy to connect (both the first time and subsequently) and they have a good range (I can walk around my small house without losing signal). I have tried to test out the battery, and so far I've come up with close to (and once longer than) the manufacturer's promised 30 hours of use.

All importantly, the sound quality is very good. It is clear and punchy, with ample but not overdone bass. Some definition is lacking in the mid-range, but the high and lows sound very dynamic and full. That's nit-picking, because unless you are looking for a studio-quality headphone, you will never notice it.

Overall, a very nice pair of headphones."
811,5.0 out of 5 stars,"lightweight, comfortable, stylish, with incredible sound that has a lot of dimension!"
812,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to connect to iPad/iPhone.

These headphones offer great sound quality and connect easily. We basically use them for online videos and listening to music or talk radio. Very happy with them and would recommend to a friend."
813,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones for travel but keep in mind they are not noise cancelling. They fit on the ears, not around so you can hear anything going on around you. The sound quality is good, not studio quality but that's not what these are intended for. The Bluetooth function worked well with no connectivity issues. The cord that comes with is not very long so if you need to use these for both BT and corded, you'll want to keep that in mind.

Comfort is okay. I can't see using these for hours at time without substantial breaks. The headphones I usually use are more expensive, noise cancelling and fit around my ear. For the price, these are a good secondary pair. I liked using them when traveling since I don't use headphones for hours at a time when traveling. I would say the best thing about these is the BT function."
814,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. I didnt give it a 5 star because it hirts your ears when wearing for over an hour
815,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like most: That they are wireless. I love that the microphone is in the headphones. I think that is cool, it works pretty good a little muffled. I like that we can move from one system to another but also connect to another device. I did like that there was controls to play and move forward on the headphones but that could have been where the volume went instead. Charged quickly.
Like Least: These are not for listening to music There is no volume button on the headphones. I do not like the fit ( the ear pieces are a little small and did not fit onto my ears) I had to keep pushing them onto my ears."
816,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is very good! Unfortunately, the band does not expand well enough to a hat size of 7 3/4 or larger."
817,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using Bose SoundSport Wireless and Jabra Move. I definitely appreciate Audio-Technica AR3BTBK's range. I hear more details in the low and high ends. Overall, the output feels warm and natural. My one gripe is that baritone vocal range is somewhat drowned by instruments. On the other hand, pop music and female vocals sound great. Unfortunately, I don't see a reliable equalizer option on my iphone. Also, AR3BTBK does not pair with multiple devices like Bose. But, that's a minor issue. After all, AR3BTBK is a good bluetooth headphone for the price."
818,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first thing I noticed when opening the box is the small size of the headphone cushions (for some reason I was imagining they would be larger like studio headphones). These fit on top of the ear instead of surrounding the ear. The fit is nice for kids and females, but if you are a larger male, you will pull the head band out to the max extension.

As a former musician and audiophile, I'm picky about speakers and headphones. I played several songs that I'm very familiar with so I can tell the slightest differences how they sound across various equipment. I found that these headphones have decent highs; but the clarity, fullness, dynamic range, and definition is missing in the mids where the vocals are, and in the frequencies just above the vocal range. In other words, the mid frequencies sound flat (and muddy at times).

That being said, most people who never listened to real studio headphones or high-end models will never know the difference.

The bass is ok considering that these are compact headphones. I like the volume and forward/reverse buttons just below the earmuff. Overall, I wouldn't recommend these for critical listening if you want to hear every detail; but they are fine for casual use."
819,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The are very uncomfortable, I can't stand more than 30 minutes using them, my ears get red and it hurts. The cushion is way too small and thin..."
820,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got them as a birthday present. Which they were bought 3 weeks before by my wife. A week after using them they can't connect to anything and we have to go through audio techniqua because it's over 30 days. Real gems and I can't even get a refund to get a different pair. Great service!
821,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent Audiophile Bluetooth headphones when used with AptX HD capable player. In my case, the WM1Z with firmware 2.0, a brief comparison to DX200 which only offers SBC on this Bluetooth headphones , and the quality/performances of the sound suffered obviously.

This review and my needs are all Wireless Audio performances, and nothing about making phone calls as I don’t need those

AptX HD is real, and how it is so good with this Headphones is probably the efficiency of the direct Digital Drive technology which is better than traditional DAC and Amp on such little circuitry for Bluetooth headphones. Not to mention the 15 hours continous playback.

Noises isolation: yes, you get some outside noises attenuated out as the 9BT is closed back Headphones but not Noise Canceling, and for me, this is perfect. I can’t deal with NC as those constant sub-harmonic keep bombarding my ears

Sound signature: References, balanced, transparent, could be a bit sibilant with 1Z aptX HD at loud volume, but I love it at lower volume, good details retrieving, high fidelity, great layering and separation.

Soundstage: Depth is more than senses of widths, cues of left and right separations, instruments layering are vivid

Bass: excellent speed, textures, nicely balanced extensions, Plenty of deep sub bass that don’t bleed or overwhelming the rest of the low spectrum or muddy or veil up the mid spectrum. Mid bass is tight, explosive, snappy and punchy. In EDM, the rippling sub bass and rumbles are clean, pronounced and enjoyable. Ofcourse, due to the closed back design, the sub bass is much more pronounced than opened back designs but trade off for the closed atmosphere and smaller soundstage. However, the sub bass perform very nicely, and I enjoy it tremendously. Bass is very clean, speedy, dive deep.

Vocal: very clean, transparent, a lot of air, only lacking a little of the sweetness/fluidity of the inner details fidelity, but nicely expressing the vocal reverberate and vibratos

Mid: very good fidelity through and through with excellent layering and separations. There are a lot of details to enjoy, especially where multiple of the same type of instruments being played and rhythm together, it can be expressed with full of details and spaces in Ballads and Instruments genres.

High: Airy, a bit Sharp with details and with some records that has the famous digital glares, it may be a bit glaring. However, the problem is only happening with Wm1Z and AptX HD. It is still very enjoyable at lower volume listening level, which I recommend to preserve your own hearing with closed back Headphones. People tends to crank up closed back Headphones ways louder than they should.

Anyways, back to the high spectrum, very airy and of great extensions with a bit leaning toward brighter signature. It is awesome for people who love references sound signature.

I have been in the hobby for years, and having Utopia, SA 5000, Sr009 and T2....etc...etc....experienced with many other Audiophile Headphones, Bluetooth headphones have always pulled my interests, but regardless of how good they got rated, I could never ever enjoy any of them...including the newer Sony 1000X. Until now, most of the Bluetooth I had tried in the pass had major faults, Flat Dead on the soundstage (boring), not enough treble retrieval details, veiled up presentations from the layering....all in all, horrible. Once again, AptX HD and Direct Digital Drive with it efficiency have pulled my interests, and let me say this “welcome to my world ATH DSR9BT, as the first Audiophile worthy Wireless Headphones”

This technology is fairly new, and I am not sure of what devices that are capable of AptX HD to recommend to you, Wm1Z and 2.0 Firmware is awesome with this, so I can recommend WM1A and 2.0 Firmware. Until now I am unsure of any other Smartphones or DAP which are touted to be capable of AptX HD, but would their Music play back App be up to notch ? I can not say so. But from what I have witnessed from AAC and SBC , AptX, on this 9BT across IPad, IPhone , HTC10, DX200. Only Wm1Z stands out with it AptX HD connectivity, so I totally recommend 1Z/A to go with this Headphones. If you are into this hobby, I suspect you alread have it. You only need to give this Bluetooth headphones a try, and be surprised as much as I am"
822,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have several headphones and these really don't compare to any other I have. That's good and bad. These are excellent cans that have a crystal clear sound to them. Not boomy and not bright. Very nuetral. But nothing like say AKG K701s nuetral. I will say if you are looking for ATH MSR 7 or 9's sound in a BT format these cans will disappoint you they don't sound like the 7's or 9's. They do sound great though. I've noticed that there is no noise floor with these cans. A pause in the music when you would hear that hiss of nothingness... its gone! Which allows you to hear the nuances of the music a lot easier and clearer without having expensive DACs and power amps to drive HQ headphones. They are easy to pair and quick to connect to your device.

The bad. The controls aren't easy to use and take a lot of getting used to. I've used them now exclusively for over a month and still accidentally pause the music when going to reach the volume control. And the volume control is clunky at best and the control just doesn't feel expensive like you would expect from a 500 dollar set of cans. Also they have no NC feature which is fine but don't use them in a noisy environment because you will soon find that they won't be loud enough to drown out the din around you. Also the lack of a 3.5mm jack is a pain but they are meant to be wireless cans so i can't knock them for that Because of those two issues, No NC and the controls. I can't give them 5 stars
Overall I'm pleased with sound the look fit and finish of the cans. If you are looking for the best sounding BT cans out their you'll be hard pressed to find a better set than this. AT just needs to improve the controls on it and it will be a must have 5 star set of cans."
823,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all I will say that I am not an audiophile by any means. While I have owned some decent Sony headphones these are a big step up.
With that said I have really enjoyed these. I am primarily listening in aptx hd bluetooth coming from a LG G6 phone. If I listen to the Beach Boys Surfs Up album all of the complex harmonies and instrumentation really come through. I will say that everything is very clear but genres such as hip hop might feel a little light on the bass but then again I really have been enjoying Kanye's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy album on these.

I am listening to these mainly in a quiet office environment and feel like they done leak too much sound. They are very comfortable though my ears and head can get tired after a couple hours but nothing out of the ordinary for me.

Lastly for me but maybe more important to others these are really nice looking. Even the status lights on the side are well thought out."
824,5.0 out of 5 stars,"***Edit 18/7/2017: I decided to try using these in wired mode while attached to my laptop (which unfortunately doesn't support neither aptx or aptx-hd). The micro-usb wire it came with is oddly thick and adds some ""pull"" to the left side of the headphone but otherwise it doesn't bother too much. The main thing I should note here is that the volume settings from bluetooth do not stay. I thought the sound output was oddly mediocre so I was about to remove another star from this review, but I plugged them back in and hit the volume button and this fixed the issue for me.

---Original Review---

Paired these bad boys with my LG V20 for the sweet APT-X HD audio quality. These cans blow every other bluetooth headphone set I've owned up to now out of the water. I can hear more than I would when I compare them to my BeoPlay H7s.

I really want to love these headphones but AudioTechnica did a huge no-no when it comes to making these headphones, and there are a couple other minor inconveniences.

+++What I like about these headphones: The sound is great. Though it kills the 3.5mm jack for pure digital drive, I find it totally understandable in this case.

+The three LED lights that serve as a battery life indicator. Very useful.
+IT TELLS ME IF I'M USING APTX-HD OR JUST APT-X. I can't tell you how many headphones (or paired devices) with APT-X do not actually indicate whether or not you're connected using the higher audio standard. You can tell by the quality of the sound, yes, but it is annoying for some that you don't know for sure whether or not you're connected using APT-X.
+It at least comes with a hard leather case.

*Something to note. The volume rocker, micro-usb port, and multi-function button are both located on the left side earphone. The power switch is on the right. I'm right handed so I would have preferred the volume and multi-function button on my right side but that's just a personal preference.

---The BIG turnoff: The recessed Micro USB charging port. Seriously, the only cable that fits in these things is the one supplied with these headphones. Lose those? Can't charge or plug in with any other cable. What went into this decision? The only reason I can think of would be that their cable has something special that allows it to stream audio into the headphones, otherwise I can't wrap my head around it.

-It's $550 for plastic. Why did they make it out of plastic instead of metal like other premium headphones? There's some minor squeaking as the plastic rubs against each other when you turn your head while you have these on.
-Touch-based multi function button. This is placed in an odd spot right next to the volume switch(?). I've accidentally tapped on it and caused my music to pause when adjusting volume. Very annoying. If you went with physical buttons for everything else why not just keep this physical? Especially with the odd position."
825,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I can hear more detail in the my favorite songs. I can now hear the moments wear a artist clothes will shuffle around during a recording. I can also hear the buzzing noise/hum from the amp in Spanish Sahara by Foals. You'll also hear the static or white noise in some songs because of the quality of the song. I recommend the you set the volume maxed out on the headphones and control the volume with your PC to hear these extra details in music. My phone(Nexus 6p) only supports SBC which is a poor Bluetooth Codec for listening to music in terms of quality but with these headphones it still sounds better than wired HD 598-SE via 3.5 mm headphone jack. Truly astonishing!

There's a little rattle coming from the power slider when you're shaking around and you'll may have to tape it if this bothers you. I couldn't get the headphones microphone to hear me on my PC but I do not need it because my intentions of buying this was purely to listen to music wirelessly. I recommend this product for audiophiles that want a wireless solution not recommended for a person that wants to use this for communication."
826,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this , the sound is great . It looks much more better than the Bose Quite comfort ( which i own too) which is in my opinion very cheap plastic looking headphones for that price."
827,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Who made the design decision that you were going to make your own proprietary micro USB? It's not like you even improved it, you just changed the plastic shell around the connector so that it's smaller than normal at the end and none of my various other micro USB cables will work with the headphones.

The sound quality is great, no complaints there, just like every other Audio Technica headset I've owned.

I'll be returning them."
828,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound good, no wires. The on/off switch is a little plasticky loose and sometimes clicks when you move your head."
829,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These really aren't as good as you'd expect from ATH, almost constantly there's a lack of valuable polish and consideration for the features. The buttons are badly fitting rattle when you move your head, the action button (pause, calls) is for some inexplicable reason touch sensitive which means you activate it constantly when you don't mean to, the microphone is unusably insensitive unless you like screaming, the battery life seems reasonable but you can't use them while charging (despite them including a long enough cable to do so). The pairing process is pretty nasty, it'll jump to a random device it's paired with with no option for putting it back in discovery mode other than manually disconnecting all of the other devices and restarting them.There's janky bluetooth products, and then there's stuff that's just has no attention given to fit and finish like the DSR9BT.

The packaging is what you'd expect from ATH, it's very well presented and comes with a nice, if slightly on the large side hard case.

They sound quite pleasant and look nice, but I wouldn't buy them again."
830,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I pre-ordered these as soon as the US version was available from Amazon, but cancelled that order after they became available on May 22 from another retailer, with no definite shipping date from Amazon. Received my pair on May 23.
They paired easily with both my smartphones the first time. I had some difficulty re-establishing a connection with the LGV20 when I switched back. from the Samsung S6 Edge+. Could not make a NFC connection When directly connected through USB, they were not recognized by my home built Windows 10 computer.

I am using the Player Pro and Neutron apps- paid versions. Some FLAC tracks, but mostly MP3s ripped from WMA by dbpoweramp software at the better quality end of the gamut..
Sound quality is very good, easily superior to the Bose Soundlink wireless cans they replaced. (Not a fair comparison),
The quality is dependent on the device with which they are paired. I am getting better sound quality out of my LG V20 (even though its DAC is obviously bypassed) than out of the Samsung G6 Edge+. A typical difference from the Bose I observed was clearly hearing Bob Weir's rhythm guitar on All Along the Watchtower (the Dylan and the Dead version) rather than it simply being part of the soupy mix. All Your Life, a recording of Beatles tunes by guitarist Al DIMeola was amazing through these cans. I recommend it for a demo. Mark Knopfler's well recorded albums had a bit more air and space that I was used to from other cans.
Overall, they seem neutral in presentation and transparent. Acoustic guitar records are exceptionally clean, older rock tracks are grungy.

It's very subjective but I think the materials could have been more luxurious for the price. Build quality will be determined over time. Hard to say whether you receiving your $549 worth. pending extended use.

I think you will be pleased with these headphones if you compare them with our wireless options such as the B&Ws or the Sonys. I would not expect them to replace a high end wired headphone paired with a top quality DAC.

I wish there was a user replaceable battery. Battery longevity over recharge cycles is likely to be their Achilles heel. I hope Audio-Technica makes batteries available for replacement by repair techs.
."
831,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color me unimpressed. I'm going to hang on to these but I'm not happy as first impression leaves me unhappy with maximum volume on board and lack on sound isolation compared to my two year old SONY MDR-1ABT. Playback has been through an LGV20 and Onkyo DP-X1A. Also the controls (volume and playback) are hardly worthy of the cost of these wireless cans.
832,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This item sold by ""AUDIOLAB - Since 1958"" that I received has a sticker over the barcode that reads ""Japan Import *NO WARRANTY*"" however is sold without any such indicate at full MSRP. Be forewarned when purchasing from this retailer that they ether have loose stock handling protocols or are attempting to let go of product they were selling at a premium when these phones were no yet sold in the US or are attempting to get there now worth much less than MSRP phones sold at MSRP prices through nondisclosure and false advertising. No on is expecting that they are loosing a 2 year warranty without this being plastered prominently on the as (currently there is zero indication of this device not having a warranty). I hope it is incompetence and not avariciousness that caused this, regardless I don't think I'll be buying from AUDIOLAB in the future.

As for the headphones themselves I liked them very much, though had to EQ some bass in for my taste and I felt they are over priced for the value, lets call it 4 stars. I'll also echo the dismay over the USB cable, these were released in 2016... why no USB C connector much less a proprietary cable?"
833,1.0 out of 5 stars,"There's a lot to like here and a few things I think aren't very good for such an expensive headphone.

Build Quality: Not shabby, but it is a bit of a step down from what I'm used to (V-moda Crossfade 2 Wireless). What's most noticable about these is that, when you have them on and are moving about, you will hear creaking and slight rattling as the loosely fit plastic sliders move and the plastic bends as your head moves. This is a bit of a miss, I hope Audio Technica steps their game up in this regard and tightens up the tolerances. I also wouldn't be against seeing some more aluminum/stainless steel in the build.

Noise Isolation: Not very good. It does attenuate sound to some degree, but it is less isolation than the CF2W (that headphone attenuates around -10dB from the mid range and high range, hope that gives you an idea). It's not a huge deal for a regular commute as music will drown out most of the leaking sound, but these will probably do you no good in a plane ride or a work environment that has loud droning noises. If noisy commutes are a big problem for you, look on to other options, these are not the right cans for you.

Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.2 makes sure that these headphones work well and save power over time. I have no issues with the wireless capability. Only big problem I have here is with the annoying habit high end headphone manufacturers have with trying to make their cables and connectors proprietary. The wires aren't proprietary per se, but AT decided to recess the port rather deep into the headphone which means you have to modify existing cables or use their provided cable. This is certainly not ideal, but at least they didn't go all the way and make an entirely proprietary USB port and cable. If you are on the hunt for a replacement cable and aren't fond of AT's cable, make sure that the cable you find is not a power only cable if you plan on using it as your desktop/laptop/other direct USB audio solution.

Sound Quality: Excellent audio quality both wired and wireless. I'm very impressed with the technology present in these headphones and how that technology renders sound in such a clean and detailed manner. There seems to be a significant dip in the frequency response between 300Hz and 330Hz and a small spike around the 8kHz from what I can measure with a logarithmic sweep, and the effect this has on audio seems to lead to a clean separation between the low end and the mid range with a clear high range while somehow managing to not be sibilant (unlike the ATH-M50X, I really didn't like those headphones because of that). However, due to the big dip at 330 Hz, very deep male vocals will sound subdued, and the overall feel of the sound pushes on the cold and slightly hollow side (Audio-Technica HPs generally sound like this, so not surprising that they'd tune the 9BT like that). The sound stage is not amazingly wide, but it is definitely very good for closed cans, and definitely wider than the CF2W. Imaging is excellent; it's very easy to discern the layers of sound and pick out specific sounds in the mix (This is in wireless, very impressive fidelity for the format).
I definitely have to talk about one difference between Wired and Wireless, and that's when you are playing 24bit/96k audio files. While these files do sound good wireless, playing the audio over direct USB adds another dimension to the soundstage and separation (just as we'd expect from such files). While it's not the best out there due to the incompatibility with dedicated DACs like the Jotunheim, it's definitely very high quality audio in a polite format to your roommates/spouse (open back headphones have a superior soundstage, but leak like hell, as I'm sure you know).
(Edit: Fair word of warning, problems with an audio file's mastering will quite clearly show up while using these. I found some tracks deeper in my library that really don't play well with the 9BT that were just fine on the CF2W.)

Portability: Not very good here. The earcups do swivel so that they can lay flat on your chest when around your neck, but the cups are so large that they constrict your throat rather uncomfortably, so that method of carriage is not ideal. They don't fold down like the CF2W does, so they're going to take up quite a bit of space in your bag/backpack. Unless you are going to wear it for most of the day, I'd say these aren't very good on the portability front.

Comfort: Good comfort here. The headband is soft and easy on your head, the earcups are sufficiently deep to house your ears without touching them (for most, unless you have dumbo ears you should be fine), and they are pretty wide and tall. While they are troublesome to store, when worn they are comfortable. Note that these tend to be a bit light on the clamping pressure, as these have shifted on my relatively large head when I was tilting back or looking down.

Mic: I have encountered no real issues with the mic paired up with my V20 yet. I have seen some worrying reports on the mic reliability and quality, which thankfully I have yet to notice in my particular specimen.

While I have some gripes about some design choices, they look nice and they sound great. These are probably the pinnacle of wireless audio quality as of the end of 2017.

As a side note, if you do decide to drop the money for these headphones, consider buying Brainwavz Angled Memory Foam Earpad - Suitable For Large Over The Ear Headphones - AKG, HifiMan, ATH, Philips, Fostex. While comfort is decent with the stock pads, these earpads really push the comfort factor up (they feel like pillows on my head) and do some complementary things to the sound (in my opinion, of course). The low end fills out, the 8kHz peak is mitigated a bit, and the soundstage gets a little wider (making it quite excellent in this regard). While these already have enough low end to render just about any genre very competently, giving the low end the extra bit of fullness really adds to the punch of modern electronic music."
834,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is one of the best of about 10 different high end headphones I recently tested. Very crisp with great stereo separation. Unfortunately the controls are very touchy and if you ever need to make a phone call these are not the right phones for you. The microphone might as well not exist
835,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I currently own Sennheiser HD-800s, Oppo PM-1withe high end dac and amplification. Listening through it's included cable on my MacBook was floored by how great they sounded. Might actually prefer he sound over any other can I've heard.
Easy to pair with my iPad and iPhone 6 Plus and again sounded awesome. Using Bluetooth which I didn't have high aspirations but they sounded as good as anything wired unless maybe you buy some Stax. Very open sound with incredible detail without being hard or bright. Vocals were rich and fleshed out.
Bass was tight, balanced and punchy.
Very comfortable and look cool in Grey.

Yes, it does use a proprietary End on the USB B mini side."
836,2.0 out of 5 stars,I liked the audio quality and aesthetic design of the headphones but I had them replaced every month because the battery would die after a month of use. REPLACED 5 OF THESE IN 2 MONTHS!!!!
837,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Amazing sound, louder and crisper than the Sony 1000XM2, which I use for travel.
Cons: Controls on the headphones for volume, play, stop, next is very poor. Sony's are much more intuitive. The deviation from standard USB Micro is annoying."
838,4.0 out of 5 stars,The cans make squeaky noises from plastic rubbing on plastic when you move the ear cups. A hundred years old ship makes same noise.
839,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:

i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very ""clean"" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as ""calming"". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.

ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don't expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.

iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.

iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.

v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.) than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn't play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can't connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.

Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.

vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.

I hope this helps..."
840,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.

1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.

2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.

Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.

Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's."
841,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a ""9"" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.

Phone performance:
I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.

Sound quality
The Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you're playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn't do very much at all. It does let you ""find your headset"" similar to the ""find my phone"" app, and it will apply firmware. (I'm hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)

Noise cancellation
The Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.

Controls
The Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don't think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.

Comfort
The Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it's less annoying on the top of the head. (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I'm familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.

Style
The Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.

Conclusion
Even though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose."
842,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing and Bose is great! I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities. I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted. I don't even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department. I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients. The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well. Battery life is extremely good. I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset. It comes with an 1/8"" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead. An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time. This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.

After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device. It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn't function. Bose support was difficult to deal with. At first the support technician didn't think there was anything wrong with the headset. After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer. This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks. The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall. I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there. After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set. No other questions asked. He just said ""We like to take care of our customers"". I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out."
843,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.

When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it's important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.

For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer's fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I'm using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.

In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.

So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I've tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they're even on.

What's also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.

The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don't own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can't really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that ""cabin-like pressure"" and it doesn't bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it's important to test whether or not this might apply to you.

Pros:
Incredibly lightweight and comfortable
Completely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your ears
ANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises
20-hour battery life

Cons:
""Cabin-like pressure"" that may cause headaches for some users
Sound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)

TLDR:
If comfort is your top priority and you're not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose."
844,3.0 out of 5 stars,"OVERALL OPINION:
These headphones are amazing! I might have been perfectly satisfied with the first version of the QC35s, but I luckily stumbled on the second generation which includes the Google Assistant integration. I initially thought it would be a small bonus, but I totally underestimated how powerful and convenient this could be. It's more than just a trigger for voice commands. It's a surprisingly flawless implementation that allows Google Assistant to turn you into much more productive multi-tasker.

GOOGLE ASSISTANT VOICE COMMANDS:
You start by connecting the headphones to your phone via the 'Bose Connect' app. Now, all you have to do is press and hold the button on the left side and speak your voice command. This is a lot easier and less tedious than having to precede every command with ""OK Google"", but this isn't even the best part of this integration.

GOOGLE ASSISTANT NOTIFICATIONS:
The best feature of the Google Assistant integration is the ability to receive voice notifications! Whenever you receive a notification on your phone, it is automatically spoken to you on your headphones. When text messages are received, not only can you have the message read to you with a single click of the left button, but you're also presented with an immediate opportunity to send a voice-to-text response by holding the left button while speaking. This allows you to multitask like no other. The Bose Connect app allows you to choose between temporarily pausing your audio during the notification (so you don't miss a second of that podcast you were listening to) or just reducing its volume while the notification is played. You can double press the left button to shut Google Assistant up mid-notification if you ever wish to as well. It's an excellent experience.

I tried smartwatches in the past, but they never seemed to deliver a convenience above and beyond what a phone could do on its own. The hands-free and vision-free experience these headphones enable fills the void we all hoped smartwatches would.

CONNECTING TO TWO DEVICES:
Speaking of multitasking, these headphones can be connected to two devices at a time without the fumbling and confusion that comes along with other Bluetooth headphones offering similar functionality. I’ve got mine connected to my Android phone and my Windows PC. Start playing media from either device and it’s streamed right to your headphones. To play from the opposite device, just pause the current media on the first device and then play the new media on the second device. It’s that simple. But to receive the notifications I mentioned, your current connection must be with your phone.

FIT, FORM, & FUNCTION:
Lastly, you might be wondering how these headphones perform as headphones. The answer is great! Check out all the reviews of the first generation for the details as I don’t think much has changed there. They’re very comfortable, lightweight, and they don’t make your ears sweat or hurt over long periods of continual usage. I explained the left button for interacting with Google Assistant in depth, but the media controls on the right are just as useful and intuitive. Double-click the play/pause button to skip to the next track and triple-click it to go back a track. The wireless range, the sound quality, and the battery life (20 hours) is all top notch for such a portable package. I haven’t tested the mic quality during a call yet, but even if it’s not the greatest, this headset has already exceeded my expectations in so many ways - I couldn’t be happier with the design."
845,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I narrowed down my hunt to upgrade my exercise music experience to three higher end headphones and couldn't narrow it further so decided to get all three to find out in side by side comparisons which would be the best for me.

[1] Bose QuietComfort 35 (Series II) Wireless Headphones, Noise Cancelling ($349.00)

[2] Beats Studio3 Wireless Headphones ($298.99)

[3] Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless Bluetooth ($348.00)

I put on the Beats and the heaviness and fit gave me the sense of an impending headache the instant I put them on. That, and the sound was empty and flat compared with either Sony or Bose. What was most surprising to me was they didn't have strong bass, which I had thought they were known for.

I put on the Sony and they were bigger but somewhat better fitting, not a lot lighter, but with more of a clear and full range from high to low.

I put on the Bose and it was surprisingly and significantly lighter and better fitting than either of the others and the sound was basically perfect. Good bass, full range of highs and lows. I have to admit that I had to switch back and forth between the Sony and the Bose about 10 times to determine if I *really* preferred the Bose to the Sony, and they were actually pretty darn close. The final point that won out for Bose was they were so much lighter and better fitting.

In addition to all of the above, as I've continued to use the Bose for 'everything' - I was most surprised when on a whim I decided to see if I could place a call with them; and my two initial callers both exlaimed that this was the BEST and clearest sound talking to me they had yet experienced (For years I've tried their patience through testing calls with 10-15 different best rated wired and wireless headpeices, ear buds et al). The rave reviews of the recipients of my calls carried from inside to outside walking the streets of NYC with all the usual sirens and traffic noise.

But most important of all, I can listen to my music in full head-filling gorgeous energizing glory when I'm exercising."
846,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This review would be 5 stars if not for one very bad flaw in these headphones. The moment you make a call, the noise canceling turns off and you (and whoever you're calling) will hear everything around you – amplified – while you're on the phone. It's so bad that I have to use my old QC25 wired headphones for calls (which work perfectly for this), and only use the QC35-S2's for wireless listening to music/podcasts/tv while doing other things. This is beyond ridiculous for headphones of this price.

As for their performance purely as listening devices, the noise canceling is slightly (but only slightly) better than the wired QC25's, but the tonal range is slightly worse in the base tones. Their ability to connect to multiple devices is great, but suffers from a tendency for them to want to connect to multiple devices AT ONCE (iphone + something else, for instance), which about half the time causes no audio to be played through them at all, even though the source is muted when they're selected. You then have to remove them from each device you've paired them to, and start over to get sound back."
847,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was not sure what direction I wanted to go with travel headphones so I tried a couple of different ones. I tried these Bose QuietComfort 35 II, the QuietComfort 20 in ear, and the Sennheiser HD1. The in-ear are not for me just because of the shape and size of my ears. :( I liked them and for what they were the noise cancellation was pretty good. With the HD1 and the QC 35 the biggest difference is price. I would say the HD1 was a bit louder and I could hear some ""cooler"" things that I couldn't hear with any other headset, but the biggest problem with it was there was an obvious defect in the unit I received. I sent them back. But to the point of this review.

The QuietComfort 35 are scary good. The sound quality is amazing. Even the bass was great given that Bose doesn't have the biggest reputation for bass in their headphones. The noise cancellation is especially scary. It is amazing the technology that is able to allow for so much around a person to be blocked. I absolutely love it when flying. A little darkness, shut eye and I am totally zoned out. I feel like I am in an Epsom salt spa with complete silence other than the music I am listening to. They are truly unbelievable and I would recommend them even without the Google Assistant integration. To that point, Google Assistant works very well. I have a Pixel 2 phone so it works especially well with the Bose headphones. I can text, listen to texts, and ask all sorts of questions. The greatest part is I can talk in a normal voice and hear myself fine through the headphones to ensure that I indeed do NOT start yelling because of the noise cancellation. Bose thinks of nearly everything. great headphones!"
848,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used virtually every model of Bose NC headphones since Dr. Bose first invented the NC technology- everything from the original $1000 pilot headset with battery pack, to the in-ear version. Most of the time, like many others, I use the NC headphones inflight (“never board an air[liane without them”). Along with the other promising features, the QC35 SII promises 40 hours run time in wired mode. While I would not look forward to testing that claim on a marathon series of flights, that’s impressive. Bose technology is still the uncompromising best, unless you prefer distorted sound and superfluous controls.
The bells and whistles have been well covered by other reviewers and should prove useful over time for those who make the effort to master them.
After millions of miles of inflight use, I can vouch for the “comfort” aspect of the over the ear models. My only disappointment is that Bose no longer supports its very reasonable replacement program for QC ear cups on older or discontinued models. They do deteriorate over time and the otherwise functioning unit cannot be salvaged.
I also noticed that the permanently affixed line wires for the in-ear models are flimsy and eventually fail from wear, and cannot be replaced. When I took advantage of the “discount” Bose offered to upgrade to a new in-ear set, it shipped without case or accessories and appeared to be refurbished. Why not use a double-ended line plug as supplied with the new QC35, at least that can be replaced, and an extra set should be included on the site or offered as an accessory. They will get lost or worn over time. Let’s just hope that Boise policy and service will live up to the high standards of their technology and their past commitment to support. I’m giving them 5 stars on performance, in anticipation that at today’s prices, the service will still be there."
849,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good sound quality and I am pleased with the comfort, but only four stars for three reasons: no charging adapter included - seriously at this price point? The ""customizable"" button can only be assigned to a few things. The last reason is the charging seems slow and then the power drops down to 70 percent very soon after you start using it. It is too soon to tell if it has a defective battery."
850,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved my Bose QC2's from way back when, and was really excited to order this pair since I have been saving up to go wireless for some time down.

I am disappointed. Not in the sound quality or noise cancellation at all, as of course Bose is the top of the line.

It is the bluetooth software. These things cannot stay connected to my devices (2016 13"" Macbook Pro and iPhone X). I bought these to use in a business setting as I work from home and have video conferences with my colleagues everyday. I have had nothing but issues so far. I want SO desperately to like these, as when they are paired to a single device and not being used for phone calls, they are magnificent. But that is not the function as advertised, and its not what I expect from the top of the line headphones that cost $350.

I have been in meetings with clients where my audio completely stops working and I need to exit the Google Meet window and completely restart Chrome. Not to mention, when connected to two devices, if one of the other devices makes a sound of any type (notification sounds, music playing) the audio lags and drops out, then comes back sped up and then drops out again, rinse repeat. There are even times when I have my phone in my hand, and the headphones will just randomly unpair with them. At this point, I have owned them for 2 weeks and I am bitterly disappointed.

If I got a lemon pair, I'd love to hear from Bose to explain the situation, but from what I can see from forums online, this is not an isolated incident. If I cannot figure out how to make these work more consistently, I will be returning them and looking for an alternate brand. For shame, Bose. I am a huge fan and these are a disgrace."
851,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are excellent if you're looking for noise-cancelation. I've owned half a dozen Bose headphones, they last for years with everyday use, and these don't disappoint.

PROs: Perfect-for-me levels of highs and lows. Noise cancellation is fantastic as long as you're not dealing with a high pitch. Easy sync with 2 devices, and easy to switch between diff ones. Buttons are great; I use the optional button to switch between level of noise cancellation which I love. I don't use Google Assistant or calling, so no opinion on that.

CONS: These are heavy. Not good for aerobics and can take some getting used to if you plan to wear them all day like me while you work."
852,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like many of you, I was torn between the Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. The decision is going to come down to your priorities. Sony's headphones overall sound better, especially with dance or bass-heavy music. If you have FLAC or ALAC tracks, you'll notice the Sony sounding better since they support the LDAC Bluetooth codec, which is more advanced and uses higher bandwidth than Bose,

However, if you're heavily invested in the Android ecosystem and need the headphones to travel, the Bose are more comfortable and have better controls as the touch controls on the Sony are hit and miss. The built-in Google Assistant is actually very helpful once you learn it's capabilities.

So overall I give 4/5 stars since the sound technology is not as advanced as the Sony's but overall the best choice if you need a good home/work/travel solution."
853,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ehhhhh
Its over $300 and doesn't do Apt X Codec for bluetooth audio or Apt X HD
It only does AAC I think?

If you want to use a standard 3.5 inch to 3.5-inch stereo cable to listen to an audio source, you can't--for some reason, this has a 2.5-inch input....in 2018. Huh?

I wanted to try this as I heard it was more comfortable than the Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2
The sony has a bunch of Bluetooth codecs Aptx Aptx HD AAC LDAC and includes a good 3.5 inch stereo cable if you want to use a wired input--plus it has better noise canceling and battery life than the bose QC 35

I checked a lot of reviews on youtube and online, nobody mentioned the lack of Apt X codecs. For $350 it should do a better job."
854,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife bought these for me as a gift. I'd never spend this kind of money on myself for headphones. I usually buy $10 ones and am pretty happy. Not any more. Once I used these for a few days, it's a pain going back to anything else. The kids didn't believe me when I said I couldn't hear what they were saying when I had the noise cancelling feature enabled. Heck, I didn't even know they were talking!

I bought another pair of noise canceling headphones for 1/7th the price during a Cyber Monday sale I found on slickdeals. But I returned that other pair after 2 days. What a piece of junk. My old $10 headphones are better than the wireless noise canceling headphones in the $50-$70 range. Now I want another pair of the Bose for home (I took them to work). Ugh, I guess I'll just have to shell out the cash or wait for my birthday. I'm tired of cords catching on things anyway, or forgetting I'm wearing headphones and stepping away from the desk with them on. With the wireless ones, that's not a problem.

Sound quality is excellent. Music and videos sound great. Even with nothing playing, you can use the noise canceling feature, combined with having something over your ears, to block out a good percentage of sound. I often put them on and forget to play music because I can focus really well without music when I wear these."
855,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Unbelievably happy with this product. I cannot live without out my Bose QC 35 II's (even considering a second one to keep at work). It is empowering to put these on and all the noise pollution just goes away. I bought them for home and hadn't planned on taking them to my large open floor office. I put them on and suddenly realized there was a very low and loud humm coming from the ceiling (air blowers I assume). Now gone. I sit there in my cubicle and feel sorry for everyone else because they don't have a pair of these.

I tried other brands, but they were simply not properly engineered. Once you get the pairing ""dialed in"" it is seamless. I have a Mac and iPhone but bought the new model (with Google voice button). I use the button's alternate function of turning on/off noise cancellation -- just for fun to remind me how great this product works. But remember.. this technology is not going to isolate voices - it is designed to remove motor noises (plane, furnace blower, road, engine, etc)."
856,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having tested the Song MX1000x for a long while in Bestbuy and these at the next booth over, it was clear in that moment which I liked better - but i cant help but wonder if the MX1000x had just focused more on comfort what this review would look like instead.

Bose is all about comfort, as the name suggests it is built around the policy of supreme comfort, a factor that the MX1000x can't even come close too. Within 30 seconds of wearing the sonys in bestbuy, my ears began to burn and felt the nauseating sensation of a headache growing... and that was only after 30 seconds of listening. Bose on the other hand, even in those few seconds of testing at BestBuy - I could barely tell that I had a pair of headphones on my head.

So Bose wins comfort, and i think everyone can agree on this... but that's really about it. Sony has far better noise canceling, you should have seen my face when I pressed the calibration button in BestBuy (and as loud and busy at it was, and i didn't even have music playing) it was dead silent. And dead silent in a way, where even my own excited squeals of laughter were invisible. It was truly like being deaf, unable to hear a thing and nothing was even playing yet. Upon turning on the tunes though, aside form the neddle-like precision of notes, I felt something was missing from them. It was a strange feeling, and I think its the fact that the MX1000x are so good at separating sounds from one another, that music sounds sort of hollow when you really listen to something. It can turn a symphony into a bland practice session, because it's so good at separating notes.

QC35 on the other hand, left something to be desired on the noise canceling ability. The loud roar and chatter of bestbuy, became a dull to silent roar, with most sounds around me muffled out. With all music and sounds turned off I would rate the BOSE as more a ""Sound Dampening"" headphone, than a true noise cancelling headphone (at least when compared to the technology of Sony). Still when turning on the music the sound felt full. My face was shocked at the clarity of the notes produced by these headphones. music had feeling with these on, tension, emotion - something I felt the precision of the Sony's sort of took away. The music sounded more like a symphony, than a audiophile picking apart every single note and separating them so you could hear it individually (as the sony's did). This lead me to hear that the BOSE produced better sound to my ears with the test tracks provided. However using truely uncompressed audio, you will be able to hear much more notes and instruments with the MX1000x.

Reviewers constantly raved about how the Bass on the MX1000x was much better than the QC35, but to be completely honest I don't really hear that at all. I've ramped up my QC35 against a friends MX1000, and I prefer the Bass tones of my Bose over his, every time (even with uncompressed audio). Even the sound quality of the Bose I sort of prefer, even with the clarity that Sony produces.

In the end Bose wins in comfort hands down, there is absolutely no equal in this regard and really the QC35's shining quality. As far as bass and music quality go... its really a toss up on what you prefer. Sony hands down has the best noise cancelling possible, but are extremely uncomfortable and will give you a headache from how close they placed the speakers to your ears so they get squished!

If i were placed in the same position again of buying either, I don't think there's any change I would have changed my purchase. However if the MX1000x had been as comfortable, I would own a pair of sony's instead."
857,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome for cutting out daily noise, like city traffic or dogs barking.

I noticed that I had difficulty pairing and connecting these with Windows 7 and 10, until I purchased an ASUS USB-BT400 Bluetooth adaptor.
The very moment I plug-in the adapter the headphones connect.
I think that the ASUS bluetooth adapter should come with the headphones since so many people give up on these headphones just because of the bluetooth issue.

Hope you all enjoy your pair as much as I do, because these things practically live on my head.
And these are perfect for meditation."
858,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It looks like a new firmware update was released today for the Bose QC35-ii wireless bluetooth headphones. Some great features that I will never use have been added, such as using Bose's app to share music with your friends. Why anyone would do this instead of using a more universal method like social media is completely beyond me.

Anyway, it looks like Bose has completely ignored the feedback from its customers. We still have some huge problems with the device functionality that are specifically due to Bose firmware.

Here are the main issues:

Most users report the active noise cancellation feels like being submerged under 35 feet of water and would like to disable the functionality. The utterly broken Bose Connect app allows you to do this after crashing every other time you run it and failing to connect to the headphones, however it is somewhat ridiculous to have to spend several minutes waiting for the app to connect to the headphones (which are already connected to a mobile device bia bluetooth) *just* to disable this irritating ""feature."" Due to the fact that the Bose firmware defaults to maximum active noise cancellation each time you turn the headset on, a lot of time is wasted. A $350 pair of headphones should pair seamlessly and should actually retain the users settings. Saving user data to NVRAM on a device like this is so trivial from a developer / engineering standpoint that I cannot fathom why customers pleas have been ignored for so long regarding this matter.

Issue #2:

The headphones do not work with Skype. I personally have Skype meetings almost every day for my job as an engineer. The fact that I can use the headphones to listen to music, take regular phone calls, use google assistant etc is great! However Bose claims that this is Skype's fault - not theirs, as Skype audio requires decryption. Explain to me why, then, so many other (and cheaper) wireless headphones work flawlessly with Skype? Based off of the amount of time Bose's firmware team has ignored the glaring issues with this product, I assume the real reason is that the engineering team just doesn't want to implement support for Skype in their firmware.

Issue #3:

Are these headphones supposed to be compatible with Windows 10? Because compatibility is extremely spotty and when it does actually connect the sound cuts out constantly whenever I move my head. Might be an issue inherent with bluetooth. Might just be bad bluetooth on my PC. Honestly issues 1 and 2 bother me exponentially more than issue 3.

I would really like to hear from the Bose team regarding this. And preferably not the same ""Thank you for your feedback we will pass this on to the engineering team,"" as we've seen that response across the board without any real results. As someone who works with firmware, I could fix these issues myself is the engineers at Bose are unable to. And I want to see these issues resolved because I love everything else about the QC-35 ii headphones. They are ultra comfortable, have great battery life and great audio quality."
859,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a headphones and Hi-Fi enthusiast or audiophile if you will. This review is for casual and audiophile users.

Sound:
Very good sound 4/5 stars. Extended tight bass (that can be dialled down via the app at will), good definition, good musicality. Voices and single instruments don't sound ""real"" but music comes out with great enjoyment and overall rhythm and warm pleasant tones. You can listen to music for hours in these. They never sound like ""you're really there at a live venue"" - like better and more expensive headphones do - but 99% of people don't care and won't notice. You buy these headphones because they do everything rather well, and have active noise cancelling. Tip: If you really want the best sounding headphones around this price and you MUST have noise cancelling check-out the Shure 535 in-ear headphones which have far superior sound in every way and better (alas passive) noise-cancelling. Bottom line: these headphones are best value, just before diminishing returns where more money buys you fine improvements, whereas less money buys you significantly worst headphones.

My experience: Music and Hi-Fi fanatic for 20 years. Own multiple DAC's all the way up to $2000 devices, multiple $500+ headphones which I used to compare these headphones against streaming both Spotify as well as lossless Tidal.

Comfort:
These truly are the most comfortable over-ear headphones you can buy. They are light, fit beautifully with materials that feel soft and welcome to your head. Hours of easy listening await you. If comfort and noise cancelling is a priority for you look no further.

Noise Cancelling:
Myth buster first: You don't need active noise-cancelling. Passive in-ear headphones have better passive noise cancelling. The reason why you buy active noise-cancelling is either because you prefer to have on-ear rather than in-ear headphones, OR because you like to turn the noise-cancelling off some times. If you don't mind smaller and more travel-friendly in-ear headphones and don't mind having passive noise-cancelling on at all times. Do try a pair of Shure 535's before committing to on-ear headphones. All that said, Noise-cancelling on the bose is Very good 8/10.

Other:
Battery, connectivity, features, functionality are all top notch. You will not find better.

Overall I give these 5/5 stars not because they are the best headphones in the world - they are not. But they are the best on-ear noise-cancelling headphones in the world, and if you don't care for ""astoundingly clear audiophile grade sound"" - these are best value for the price.

Should you buy them? Yes. You will not regret it. You either know what professional and audiophile headphones and DACs sound like, in which case you wouldn't be looking at these headphones OR you don't know that you need better headphones yet, so these are the best headphones you can currently appreciate, and a great way to step into the world of great sound."
860,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After doing a lot of research, it ultimately came down to the Bose QC 35 and Sony 1000XM2. I tried them both for several days but in the end, the Bose QC 35 was my choice, which wasn't an easy one to make. You can't go wrong with either pair as they are both very nice headphones. The final decision for me was whether I wanted a little better quality (Sony) or better fit/comfort (Bose). I chose comfort and the Bose 1000XM2. Here are some other things I noticed...

SOUND QUALITY:
No question at all, the Sony 1000Xm2 are better sounding headphones. Don't get me wrong, the Bose are still very good. However, I really liked and preferred the bass response of the Sony over the Bose. Bose are the brighter sounding headphones but the biggest difference was how they sound with bass, which Sony does better.

FIT / COMFORT:
The Bose gets the edge on fit/comfort. They are VERY comfortable and light! The Sony 1000xm2 are fine but they fit a bit more snug than Bose. At first, I actually preferred the Sony fit. However, after having them on for an hour or longer, that's where I noticed the biggest difference... ear fatigue. Much less ear fatigue with the Bose. That all being said, what is more comfortable to me might be less comfortable to you. You just have to try them on, ideally for extended periods of time. I bought these particularly when I fly where I plan to wear them for hours at a time. Even though I prefer the sound quality of the Sony, I just couldn't get over the incredibly comfortable fit of the Bose.

BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY:
Both do a fine job here but the Bose were the more reliable in establishing a connection without having to fiddle around with settings. When comparing the Sony and the Bose, I often went back and forth trying when trying out the headphones. Every time that I went back to the Bose, it was fast and easy. With the Sony pair, I had to go into my Bluetooth settings a few times in order to get a connection. It really wasn't a big deal but the Bose gets the edge here because it is painless and works more reliably.

DURABILITY:
I won't give either pair the edge here because I only had them for a week BUT do keep in mind that the Sony 1000xm1 had issues with the headband cracking. Because Sony hasn't clearly stated whether they resolved the issue with the xm2's, it's anyone's guess. This alone probably wouldn't keep me from going with the XM2's but it is something to consider.

CONTROLS:
I like them both and consider this a toss up. With the Sony pair, you just swipe the headphones to control the music and volume while the Bose has hard buttons. At first, I definitely preferred the hard buttons that are on the Bose. However, after getting used to swiping on the Sony's, I found it easy enough to do. Which do I prefer? Probably the hard buttons because they are a bit more reliable than the swiping. This is very subjective though and I could see some preferring the swiping while others preferring the hard buttons. It just depends on what you like. For me, I found both to work fine. The Sony does have a feature where you can put you hand over the right headphone and it will allow you to hear outside noise without having to take them off. Cool feature? Maybe for some but for me, I didn't see any use for it. If someone approaches me while wearing big headphones like these, I'm going to take them off my head rather than keeping them on with my hand cupping the right headphone. It just seems a bit rude not to do so.

FEATURES:
They both have their pluses and minuses here. It really depends on what is most important to you. I really like how the Sony 1000XM2 allows you to customize the sound (including equalizer). It also has the ability to modify you settings depending on where you are listening to them by simply pressing a button. I don't really no what impact that has though because I only tried this a couple of times. The fact of the matter is that Sony provides a bit more customization which I like! The Bose has google assistant which I found to be a cool feature. I could live without this but it is a nice feature. The feature that I found VERY useful on the Bose is the ability to play text messages through the headphones. I was on a flight recently where we were waiting for our turn to take off. While listening to my music, I was notified that I had a text message. Instead of having to reach for my phone (Sony) the Bose pair allowed me to just push the action button to hear the text. I found this awesome. Sony does not have this feature. What headphones gets the edge? For me, it's another toss up. I really like the customization of the Sony but the Bose are very cool with being able to read my text messages (and google assistant).

LOOKS:
They both look great! I had the gold/beige Sony's and the silver Bose. I might give a slight edge to Bose as I like the silver look and the Bose logo on each headphone. However, this is very subjective.

SUMMARY:
This is one of those times where you just can't go wrong with either pair. They both have their pros and cons but in the end, for me, I prefer the Bose QC 35 by a very small margin."
861,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was in the market for a new set of premium headphones and I agonized for days over whether I should choose the QC35s, the Sony WH1000XM2s and the Sennheiser P550s. They all had their strong points. I finally broke the logjam by selecting according to what I wanted in a set, versus cool but unnecessary features that I would probably seldom use or need. And as you can probably guess, I ended up selecting the Bose QC35s.

I recieved my QC35s within 48 hours or ordering from Amazon. Upon opening the package I was both pleased and underwhelmed with a few features. Let's talk about something good first. The semi-hard case really rocks. -Well-built and padded to keep the QCs relatively safe. However, the provided USB charging cable was ridiculously short. Without measuring, I guess-timate the cord to be a out 8 to 10 inches. The included headphone cable was less short but still a bit underwhelming in length. Bose is a premium company, and for the price of entry to purchase these headphones, there is no reason why they could not include cables that are at least a serviceable length. Without checking, but having owned many Sony and Sennheiser headphones over the course of my lifetime, I'm willing to bet they would not make such a remedial mistake.

Fortunately, the QC35s made up for the cable issue with outstanding sound characteristics and excellent noise-cancelling capabilities. The sound stage of these headphones is expansive. I can hear separation between instruments that sounded muddled and undefined in my previously award-winning Plantronics. In fact, I would say that you probably would be hard-pressed to make a pair of headphones that were siginificantly better using a Bluetooth connection. And that's just because you get to a point in sound quality that is really only limited by the Bluetooth standard.
As for the claims that I've seen in other reviews that these don't have any bass response, I will tell you that anyone that thinks these headphones don't have bass needs to immediately get their hearing checked. And anyone who needs more bass than these are capable of producing are probably causing themselves some real hearing damage.
In terms of sound quality, will these compete with my wired Sennheiser HD 380 pros? No way. Not even close. In fact, any Bluetooth headphones I've ever tried, no matter how much money you throw at them will get stomped by a decent set of wired headphones. And that's just the reality of Bluetooth, until a new technology takes its place.

BUT what you're getting here is an excellent portable set of headphones that sound pretty sweet and have excellent noise reduction. I ride the Washington DC Metro (subway) to work every day, and once I set the ANC and turn on the music, I never hear another sound other than the music. They're also reasonably comfortable and actually fit my big ears and head very well too. Bose claims 20 hours of use from a single full charge and I am inclined to believe that figure. I can charge them on Monday, and by week's end, I have ridden the train a combined 15 hours, and have plenty of juice left. If you've owned a decent set of Bluetooth headphones before, these probably won't blow you away, but they certainly won't disappoint either. Bose gets it right here, and I'd wholeheartedly recommend these to anyone looking for premium set of headphones."
862,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the original Bose Noise suppressing headphones for years and absolutely loved them. I thought that by now the wireless version would be excellent too. I was wrong. I installed the apps for my laptop and my iPhone 6 and paired the headphones to both. I think I'll be returning them.
Good:
• Comfortable
• Light weight
• Announces battery strength and paired devices when you turn them on
• Microphone works very well for calls in both my home office and a very busy client site.
• Extremely easy to pair to a device
Bad:
• Garbled music! Music from Laptop is very often garbled and the overall sound quality is bad.
• They seem cheaper. Not that they are, they are very well built, but I think in their striving for light weight they made them feel a bit cheaper.
• While on a call on the laptop (Skype usually) other desktop alerts or any iPhone activity interrupts the call for at least 10 seconds or more. I've had to ask people to repeat the couple minutes of a discussion because of this. It should just mute the call by 20% and overlay the alert message so I don't miss anything.
• Continuously announces that the iPhone is paired when it has a message like a text that you have not dismissed yet.
• The blue tooth connection just stops working. While listening to music from YouTube on the laptop, it will just stop working. I have to turn them off and wait several minutes for the paired devices to time out before they will reconnect.
• The Google Assist isn't very useful. Hopefully it will get better over time."
863,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, these are amazing! I can't hear a single thing when I turn these on. I was looking for headphones that canceled out noise in the background even when I wasn't listening to music (I'm a med student and need constant quiet while studying), and these work really well. Here are some details about the features:

Features: On the right headphone, there are 3 buttons aligned vertically, the volume-up button, the pause button, and the volume-down button. This is also where the On button is. On the left headphone, there is a button for Google Assistant, which I highly recommend. Just get the Bose app for headphones and the Google Assistant app and it'll help you through the set-up. You can even use them on multiple devices at the same time. I use it on my Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Just turn on Bluetooth for all your devices and turn on the headphones and it should connect automatically. Google Assistant is like Siri. These also allow you to speak into them as it has a mic, so if someone calls you are able to talk through these without picking up your phone.

Noice-Canceling Feature Only (No music): If someone in the background is cooking or cleaning I can't hear a thing with these turned on. With just the noise cancelation and no music, I can't hear the dishwasher or even certain levels of music playing in the background. I can hear conversation but really low which doesn't bother all that much. The noise canceling is really good.

Noice-Canceling Feature WITH Music/Video/Sound On: I can't hear a thing! People have to scream if they need to talk to me. Not only does it cancel out all noice in the background, you don't need to turn the volume up all the way and kill your ears in order to hear the sound playing. It's like being in a movie theater. The sound is outstanding and clear!

Overall great headphones that do the job right! I feel like I'm in my own world when studying, and even watching shows/movies."
864,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Sony headphones and the Bose QuietComfort 35 (Series II) set because the reviews were so close and I wasn't sure which ones I would like better. While the Bose were definitely more comfortable and the case was large enough to fit the charging cord and headphone jack, the sound did not quite measure up. I did like the on/off switch of the Bose headphones better and the Bose app, but I love the Sony headphones for the following reasons. The sound is phenomenal...it's transforming. I took them on a recent flight and it was like being in another world...no noisy discussions or engine noise, just a beautiful series of sounds that volleyed from one ear to the next. It's easy to change tracks, adjust volume, or stop play by simply swiping or tapping the outside of the right earpiece. The Sony app is fairly easy to use, too, including a way to adjust if your connection cuts in and out. I didn't experience that with the Sony, but did with the Bose. If I could have chosen the comfort of the Bose with the sound of the Sony (and the convenient swipe feature) I would never take them off!"

866,5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is best head phone I have ever owned..... Light and very user friendly
you will love them. it works flawlessly

I searched the internet and have seen various prices My only disappointment with the 35ii is that the audio jack is not the standard 3.5 mm (1/8 inch) style that we have known and loved for about 50 years. Instead, the phones have a 2.5 mm jack. I did not see this noted in any of the many reviews that I read---they all mention a standard audio connection. The phones come with a cable that plugs into the 2.5 mm jack and provides a standard 3.5 mm plug on the other end. But for the life of me I cannot even guess why a 3.5 mm wasn't used on the phones themselves so that any standard cable could be used. So if wired connection is important to you be advised that you may wantto buy an additional (more robust and longer) adapter cable, and I do see some on Amazon. Apparently the smaller jack is used on other headphones as well. But why? Makes no sense to me."
867,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the headphones you want to go for if you're interested in something with a great deal of bass (Beats for bass). These have an even sound to them. The noise cancellation is AMAZING to say the least, and the overall quality is great. I was able to turn the bass up on my phone so they sound great with the bass, but the music is so clear and sounds just so good. The build of the headphones are also great. I bought the SoundTrue wired headphones about 4 years ago, and those were also built wonderfully. I'm not a die-hard Bose fan, but I will say that the quality of their headphones is superb. I hope to see their continued success!"
868,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Update after continuous using of a couple weeks.
Still love it. The quality is good. Battery charging speed improves if you use high speed cable and plug.

The headphone somehow getting loose.. if I lay down or look down by tilting my head, it will fall. It also tangled hair easily, esp if you have long hair, when taking off.

Noise canceling is amazing.
Very comfortable.
Useful App and micro adjustable sound volume.

The only complaint would be the battery... I've charged for two days and it's never full.. not sure if it's broken."
869,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These Bose are the best headphones on the market! After having a Beats Studio Pro headphones for 5 years, they served me well but needed a new set that was noise cancelling. The Beats sound was very base heavy, not balanced amd no noise cancellation at all. These Bose are literally in a different league above Beats. Only thing I wouls improve is if Bose gave a charging plug with them. I only use Apple products and had to buy a generic Andriod plug to charge the headset, very surpised that Bose did not include a plug in the box!"
870,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable and lightweight with excellent sound and great noise cancellation. Used on air flights with very satisfying results listening to music on my phone and watching movies on my iPad with jet engine noise virtually eliminated. I have also used the wired connection to airliner video/audio entertainment equipment with excellent sound results. The headphones made the flights so much more enjoyable without ear fatigue in comparison to having regular ear buds that did not have noise cancellation. Excellent materials and build quality. Using Google Assistant for cell phone notifications, stock market prices and walking directions. Linking to my Samsung Galaxy S 8+ was easy. I compared these Bose headphones to the Sony WH1000XM2 Headphones prior to purchase at a local retail store before selecting the Bose. My use to date indicates I made the right decision."
871,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you prize comfort these are the headphones for you but it will come at the (small) cost of sound quality.

I decided to pick up some ANC headphones after getting tired of the in ear buds I had been using for years. I desired a better range but also needed something with supreme comfort as I listen for hours on end while studying. A lot of people have been comparing these to a couple other sets so I will leave my thoughts around those as well.

QCII: Best comfort. Well-rounded sound. Great build quality (glass fiber reinforced nylon, or so I have read). User replaceable ear pads. One thing to note is the good but uninspiring sound. It is far from poor but it has sort of a muted feel. I suppose this allows them to have good marks across a wide range of genres. Can't blame them for that. I'm satisfied with the sound as they are definitely an improvement from the hf5 buds I had been using. Google assistant is cool but I don't care about it. I have that button set to adjust ANC (high, low or off). Where is the airplane adapter? Stupid to leave it out. Also to consider - there are massive issues with Bluetooth pairing in Windows 7. It can be argued that this is not their responsibility but it's still frustrating. For those having issues search up Toshiba Bluetooth drivers for Bose - this workaround solved the issue for me. Also note that this issue is not specific to Bose. The Win7 Bluetooth stack is just garbage so you may have issues pairing with any modern wireless device.

Sony WH-1000XM2: Definitely wins in the features category. Superior battery life, more lively sound, great equalizer customization in the app, touch controls and LDAC support. I kept finding myself wanting to listen to these more than the QCII. However, I could not overlook the build quality issues with reports of headband cracking. Unacceptable and not worth the risk for me. Also, I have larger ears and they were less comfortable with noticeable heating. The QCII have more space within the ear cups. The pads also got quite thin at the base of the ear during wear. This didn't compromise the seal but after removal it stayed flat and did not readily go back to a plush conformation. This may seem like a very particular critique but longevity is a concern for me and I could not help but think how long the cushioning would last. Add on top the fact that you cannot replace the ear pads and I had to rule them out.

B&W PX: Amazing sound and superb sound stage. Unfortunately, too many negatives. They are heavy and caused a hot spot at the top of my head after less than an hour of use. The build quality was amazing and they looked fantastic but it was just too much weight. Sound quality takes a big hit with ANC enabled. You also cannot use them passively without battery power. They also do not collapse for easy storage. It's a shame since they sounded so good but I could not live with these downsides. Maybe the next version will fix some of these issues. I've read the P7 is a good option for those not requiring ANC.

Ultimately it depends what you value. The combination of comfort and build quality with above average sound is what sold me. I hate to compromise but that's what you need to do at this price point. An ideal product would incorporate the Bose comfort, B&W sound and Sony features."
872,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You know I think the biggest problem Bose is having right now is updating their headphones. I had the first QC 35 and when I got them the sound cancelling was outstanding. Then as the updates started rolling in the noise cancelling went south and the sound suffered. I didn't update this pair. And they seemed ok,, noise cancelling not as good as my sony wh 1000xm2 and the sound out of the Sonys are far superior in my opinion. The bose need to be turned up about 75% for good listening volume and sometimes the sound to me can be on the tinny side. The comfort and build of these are the best you can get right now and I have tried many headphones. The Sonys if adjusted right are very comfortable but make the ears a little warmer than the Bose."
873,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought this for use with a Samsung smart TV. It works after jumping through some hoops (on the Samsung side of things). The sound is excellent, but the range is not that great. I'm not sure if it's the headset's fault or the TV's, but I can't walk out of the living room into the kitchen without the headset loosing connection. It works great as long as I'm on the couch."
874,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The overall comfort, sound, and battery life are good. I like the Google integration. An occasional crackle when using Bluetooth, but no major problems in that area. (Could be my phone, too.. you know how pesky/tricky Bluetooth problems are)

I find the sound a bit muffled/soft in comparison to competitors, but that's sort of Bose's ""sound"" so you know what you are going to get. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad in any way, it's like a square edged table that's had it's corners sanded round so you can't hurt yourself, lol.

The reason I did not give this a 5 is because they are designed to fit a ""standard"" head. They are too big for my head and hang too low, causing jaw pain after an hour. I have to put a wad of material under the headband to keep them sitting high enough on my head. Yes, that's as lovely as you are imagining it is, lol. Looking at the design, Bose could have opted to make these fit more heads quite easily. I think they were just lazy and didn't want to deviate from some 'standard' they've been using forever. Main competitor (Sony) actually fit worse and were less comfy.

Noise cancellation is good. As others have pointed out, don't expect it to block out *everything*, just certain kinds of white-noise sounds such as airplane. That aside, they are still quieter than headphones without noise cancellation. I can barely here myself typing this review on my desktop keyboard, for example, so that's good."
875,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First pair of noise cancelling headphones. My use case is everyday office wear, light music, and using them without music to dampen office sounds. Comfort - Nice fit, without feeling like suction cups. I've worn them everyday for a couple weeks at work with no problem. My ears sometimes get a little sore after 3+ hours of consecutive use.
Sound - These sound very good, especially at low volumes. Bose just does good speakers.
Noise Cancelling - It took me a day or two to get used to not being able to hear people come in and out of the office! Naturally, the class of sounds that are most easily cancelled are droning noises, so distant conversations, the sounds of people walking down hallways, and air vents are all gone. Two types of sounds do still come through: The first, is that I use a mechanical keyboard, so the sharp click of my keys pierces through. The next, is that deeper voices have a little bit more difficultly being filtered.

Overall, this noise cancelling is great, and I often use the headphones for this without music. It was between this pair and the Sony WH1000XM2. I went with the Bose for a couple reasons: My love of the last pair their headphones I owned (they sounded so good) vs. the current Sony headphones I have of the same type, the reviews stating the Sony NC headphones are uncomfortable and a little hot sometimes, and that the Sony pair requires you to have something actively playing for noise cancelling to be on.

So far, I've been very satisfied with this purchase, and I believe its increased my productivity by isolating me a little bit from my environment. The one thing I would make a little better is comfort into hour 4. I highly recommend these headphones."
876,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately discovered that they don't work properly a week after the Amazon return period expired. I've owned 5 previous pairs of Bose noise cancelling headphones (all of which eventually broke after 2-3yrs)... the noise cancelling tech works the best but they have always had weak construction. These just don't work... the noise cancellation yes but on 3 different flights, I realized that they wouldn't provide audio/sound from the airline entertainment system... well actually it ranged from nothing to nasty static. I switched to free airbuds each time and the problem was not with the entertainment system. Also, the headphones seem to freak out if they don't find the device that you have to pair these headphones to when you first pull them out of the box.
As to Bose ""customer service""... forget about it. You'll get the run around and I'm still dealing with trying to get them ""fixed""... ultimately it clear that they are going to be a $350 throw away mistake.
Good luck... just don't say you weren't warned."
877,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I also own the Sennheiser MOMENTUM 2 wireless noise cancelling headphones, which I think look much nicer (especially white version) and sound amazing, but they're unfortunately just not as comfortable. The Bose are FAR more comfortable, so ultimately they're the ones I prefer just because they're so much more comfortable to wear for extended periods. Both have great sound and noise cancelling for my tastes, though I'd say the Sennheisers sound a bit better overall. The differences there are not nearly as dramatic in the differences in comfort, though. If the Sennheisers improved their comfort I would pick them over the Bose, but until then I'd rather have something that doesn't make my ears and head hurt."
878,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a long-time Bose QC 25 user, so I'm used to good noise cancelling. Because I wear them while doing chores, however, the wire invariably catches and yanks. So after years' of my beloved QC 25, I took the plunge. The QC 35 II Wireless has topped even those high expectations!

I wear headphones to help me concentrate at work and to listen to music, so have been wearing this pair an average 6-8 hours a day, and they are by far the most comfortable pair I've ever owned. The noise cancelling is awesome, and being wireless is especially liberating. I was concerned, however, after reading reviews of pairing issues. Out of the box I paired my phones with my iPhone 8, my iPad Air 2 and my Lenova laptop, all without a hitch. I have not had ANY issues with connectivity.

I have not found any reviews on the phone's performance while making calls, so I wanted to highlight that I can receive, and to my relief, everyone reports they can hear me loud and clear: on a bus, in the wind, it makes no difference. I love my QC 25 II."
879,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I selected the Bose 35ii after extensive research and am very pleased with comfort, audio quality, and performance. A key aspect of my selection was the wired connection that I often need, as with in-flight entertainment systems. (I would have bought the Bose 30 earbud design but, amazingly, it lacks a wired connection). My only disappointment with the 35ii is that the audio jack is not the standard 3.5 mm (1/8 inch) style that we have known and loved for about 50 years. Instead, the phones have a 2.5 mm jack. I did not see this noted in any of the many reviews that I read---they all mention a standard audio connection. The phones come with a cable that plugs into the 2.5 mm jack and provides a standard 3.5 mm plug on the other end. But for the life of me I cannot even guess why a 3.5 mm wasn't used on the phones themselves so that any standard cable could be used. So if wired connection is important to you be advised that you may wantto buy an additional (more robust and longer) adapter cable, and I do see some on Amazon. Apparently the smaller jack is used on other headphones as well. But why? Makes no sense to me."
880,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very, very disappointed. I really wanted to love these - as I had wanted to when I purchased a pair of original QC35s. I love Bose speakers, esp. bluetooth speakers, and have Bose stereo systems in several cars I currently / recently owned (currently two Mercedes and one Audi), all of which are excellent systems.

These are the most comfortable headphones I've tried - which includes, for reference, Sennheiser HD1, Bang & Olufsen H9 (my personal favorite of all headphones), Bowers & Wilkins P7s, Bluedio, AudioMX, etc. etc. These ARE comfortable.

I do think these have the best noise-canceling in the industry, including the Sony MDR-1000X (or current WH-1000XM2). Much of that has to do with the softness and plushness of the ear pads; you'll notice that about 2/3 of the noise canceling is accomplished simply by WEARING the headphones, even while off.

I like the addition of the multifunction button that toggles between noise canceling high / low / off. Very good.

These are attractive. The ear cups swivel 90 degrees so you can lay them flat on your chest while around your neck. They just look nice - look like quality. The two-tone covers are a great touch and executed with precision.

Audio performance is still in the bottom 25% of all bluetooth headphones I've ever tested. And that numbers somewhere near 50 over the last several years. Here, the Bang & Olufsen just trounces the Bose. Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2 is a runner-up. Bowers & Wilkins P7 is also superb. The Bose sound performance at all volume levels is a forgettable also-ran. Even with the ANC turned off, the bass is wimpy and the mids - vocals, strings - are flaccid, underwhelming. There's no warmth, no voice, no presence. No different than the original QC35, and wholly inferior to the B&O, Plantronics, and B&W named above - by an order of magnitude. This isn't the ""Bose sound"".

And now the cardinal sin: connection quality. I tried with two phones to confirm (although both work extremely well with all other offerings mentioned above, and many more). On a clear day, the Bose QC35 has about a 15 foot range with a clear line of sight before it starts cutting out. If you put your phone in your pocket and walk outside, the music skips constantly. Unusable. Even indoors, you have to have the phone in the pocket on the same side as the bluetooth receiver - which appears to be in the LEFT ear cup - or it will also skip while your phone is in your pocket. Outdoors it doesn't matter; it skips constantly. If I didn't have a list of 60 or 70 paired devices on my phone - speakers, headphones and cars - I would say, ""maybe it's my phone"". It isn't. It's the QC35ii. Unfortunately, this is exactly the behavior I observed on the original QC35, which was also unacceptable. And, like the original QC35, I will have to return these.

If you want attractive headphones that are very comfortable and very aesthetically pleasing, and don't particularly care about the quality of the sound they're producing, these are clear winners, best in the industry. They tick off those two boxes very well. But if you want Great ANC and Great comfort, but dominant sound performance, these are not contenders in any way. Regardless of price. Check out Bang & Olufsen H9, Bowers & Wilkins P7, and Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2 for excellent comfort, three very different aesthetic options, and vastly dominant sound quality. Out of the three, the B&O is the top dog, but both of the other two are simply excellent and can't disappoint."
881,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Read reviews here on Amazon, that made me nervous on counterfeit headphones, but nothing to keep me from doing some research to find reliable seller. The headphones arrived and performed as expected out of the box- I am a huge Bose fan. Anyone denying the physical or sound quality of Bose is fooling themselves, or has a weird shape to their head. The headphones have seen noise canceling time and no noise canceling time, and have performed as a top shelf pick. The headphones have been more than 25ft away from a music source and did not lose the signal, until I went upstairs and the opposite side of the house- 30’ish feet I would guess. Love not having to leash myself to an audio source."
882,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the series I and I love them so much that I had to give a pair to my partner for Christmas. There is no guessing when you use these headphones, voice whispers in your ear the charge level and which of your Bluetooth devices are connected.

The Series II has some neat extras that are not in the Series I, a Google button is the most useful. When you first turn them on you will be instructed to download the Bose+ app, you can move on without it but you really do want it. It allows you to give the headphones a name and other fun things that make your listening experience that much more enjoyable. I think I'm going to secretly swap his for my older (2 years) set."
883,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for a few days and they are a lifesaver. I live in New York City and work from home near a busy road. There is noise all around me - heating, refrigerator fan, light fixtures, traffic, incessant honking and sirens, neighbors playing music loudly. After the first time I tried them and turned them off, I thought, wow why is my room so loud all of a sudden, what is that? It turns out it was just the everyday noise I've been surrounded by. That's how incredibly silent my world becomes when I put these on.

Granted, like other reviewers have mentioned, the world won't actually become completely silent, but it'll get as close as you can to it. For me, as someone who has a case of misophonia, these do such a great job that I can focus on my work so much better. They make a world of difference. Sometimes I just leave them on without music.

Bonus points for the Bluetooth connectivity and the mic. I now take all my work phone calls on this. I have connections to my work laptop, my work cell phone, and my personal cell phone. I can stream music to it, pause, take a call, and resume my music. I've been told the receiving end hears me very clearly.

Yes, $350 is a lot of money. I originally had no intention to get these; i wasn't considering them at all. I was looking at the QC 25s (wired). But after spending time reading reviews and making the decision that this was something necessary because the noise was impacting my concentration on work, I pulled the trigger. Going wireless is sooo much better than being chained down to my phone or computer.

Definitely a worthy investment if you experience similar conditions as me or simply enjoy silence!"
884,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I did a lot of research on a solid pair of noise-cancelling headphones and it came down to these and another pair. I knew that these were significantly more expensive than the other, but based on a few reviews indicating that the quality of the other could be a hit or miss, I just ended up going with these because I knew they would be a solid purchase and love them. I also went to Best Buy and tried on several in the same category, and loved the lower profile of these and the lighter band around the head (didn't feel too heavy).

It was a plus to have the Google Assistant function with the series ii since it went along with the rest of my environment. I love the cordless and bluetooth feature, and I can be connected to my phone and computer at the same time. I also kind of like the robotic voice that tells me how much it's charged when I turn them on (though I think you can turn that off as well). It has high, low, and off levels of noise cancelling and also comes with a smooth and solid app that helps with the pairing process."
885,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Please don't buy these; they are garbage, period. Won't turn on, won't charge, computer doesn't recognize them. Even when they did work, pairing them to anything except a smartphone took 10 minutes of reformatting and reinstalling intermediary Bose software....hmm, there was something else...oh yeah, THEY BROKE AFTER TWO MONTHS!"
886,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the comfort this Bose headsets provide. The sound quality is above average, expected from a headset at this price range.
You can have up to 2 active simultaneous audio sources but you can add a lot more. The Bose App helps on making this process a lot simpler.
When the limit of 2 is reached, from the App, you simply deactivate one audio source to activate the desired one.
When having both active, the switch between sources is seamless. I currently have my MacBook, iPhone and Fire HD as audio sources while
having the MacBook and iPhone active all the time. When I need to use my Fire HD, I simply disable the MacBook. It's that simple.

The call quality from my iPhone is excellent. People can't tell I'm using a Bluetooth headset.

The price may deter many from looking at this product, but once you have it in your hands, you can't let go. It's that good!"
887,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These Sound SO GOOD, work So well and Feel so good that you should be begging me to stop buying them so I can leave some for everyone else. I bought 2 pairs of this one for myself and one for my father. These things can save marriages and relationships by the droves. I combined these with a Lenovo Yoga Tab3 and a 27000mAh and I love it!!!! Sounds superb, the software works excellent and is easy to use. these things tune themselves in a sense and they sound Fantastic. Anything sounds wonderful in the s they have excellent bass and clarity all mixed into one. If you are thinking about a set of Beats headphones, check these out first... I'm telling you they are worth every penny, durable as all get out and I have been using them nonstop since I got them. I am listening to music through them right now while writing this review."
888,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To start, I ended up returning these headphones. But not because they weren't good headphones. In fact they were amazing. Excellent sound quality, build quality, portability, good amount of bass. The active noise canceling worked really well. But that's also where I had the problem. I noticed that almost immediately after I put the headphones on, I would start to get dizzy, and some cases, irritable and headaches, which sometimes would subside after a short time, and other times not. This, I found, is due in part on how active noise cancellation works, by emitting a low frequency noise to drown out outside noise. I am particularly susceptible to certain frequencies, but did not think this would affect me as much as it did. I don't know if my susceptibility to motion sickness plays a roll, but I've talked to a few of my friends who've tried active noise cancellation, and had similar issues, who also happen to get motion sickness.

In short, I would definitely give these a try, especially if you don't have issues with certain frequencies to that could cause problems."
889,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm writing this because of problems with the control button firmware on the left side earpiece. In normal operation, the left button can be programmed to function as either 1. instant access to the Google Assistant (big marketing point by Bo$e) OR 2. to choose one of four levels of noise cancellation.
BUT, at least with Android 7&8, if you choose to program the button for Google Assistant, firmware disables the stop/pause function of the button on the right side earpiece. So you have a choice; you can have GA or stop/pause, but not both.
This is a known bug with Bo$e and can be found in the forums for months. It has been >6 months since release and Bo$e has yet to fix this issue.
This is my 3rd generation Bo$e NC headset. It is the most comfortable and most feature-laden of all. NC, sound quality, & mic are all good. Hardware seems of quality design and materials. Because of the bug, I'm rating it mediocre."
890,4.0 out of 5 stars,"While the quality is nice and the sound quality is nice, when connected to my laptop it constantly cuts in and out. Its a known problem sadly and I wish I did more research. Besides for that they are decent. Also they do not connect to my ps4 or sony smart tv. On my ipad/phone they work flawlessly and sound quality is great."
891,4.0 out of 5 stars,"While these are on the expensive side, these are hands down the best headphones that I've ever owned and are well worth the investment. It's no secret that Bose has the noise cancelling market cornered, and these are probably their best model to date. It's still incredible to me how well it works each time I flip on the noise cancelling switch, and things really do go silent almost immediately. The sound quality is amazing (as usual with Bose) - the treble is bright, and the bass is deep and rich, and vocals are crystal clear. The ear cups themselves are extremely comfortable, and I can wear these for hours on a plane or on my commute without any discomfort. While they feel incredibly sturdy and well made, they surprisingly don't feel too heavy while wearing them. The included soft case is really nice, since it's important to protect these things when throwing them into a backpack or laptop bag. I also like that these come with a cord, so you have the option for Bluetooth wireless or corded listening. Finally, the integration of Google Assistant takes these amazing headphones to the next level. While this definitely isn't their best feature, it's a nice added bonus that makes these headphones an even bigger part of my daily routine.

All in all, these are some seriously expensive but seriously incredible headphones. If you listen to music/the radio/audiobooks fairly frequently, then you should seriously consider investing in these headphones. They're the best on the market, incredibly comfortable, deliver amazing sound quality, and feel like they'll last for years to come."
892,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I want to love love love these headphones, but I don't. I'm female and they don't adjust to feel snug on my head. If I really want to have a solo party they will fly off. Also, if you accidentally to flick the switch to ""off"" they will just die. Almost every other pair of BT headphones I know of has an automatic shut off after a period of time when nothing has been played. I find it odd that Bose overlooked that on this product."
893,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Stay away from the black set. I work from home and I am on 4 hours of conference calls a day and dont want to be tethered to phone or pc for that long so I need a comfortable, reliable and long lasting blue tooth headset for work and play. So I purchased the Black QC35 II set first to replace my Samsung Level headphones that just snapped with normal use. Within the first week I noticed the BT connection dropping intermittently for 3-4 seconds at a time, didnt matter if the phone was in my hand or several feet away sitting on my desk. So I went thru the normal troubleshooting steps of reinstalling and updating software and no luck. I went to Bose website and checked their support forum and found that's its a known issue with no apparent fix that i have found. A customer mentioned he purchased both the black and silver set for himself and his wife and the Silver ones worked fine with no issues. So I wasted no time and sent back the black set for a refund and purchased the silver Q35 II. I have found that to be accurate, no issues with the Silver headphones. Now that thats out of the way. Easy pairing with my Galaxy S8 using the Bose app. The battery life was significantly longer with Silver Heaphones than the Black Headphones which makes no sense since the were both new. For music, the sound is fantastic, my music tastes ranges from techno Daft Punk to Metalica and everything in between except country. The reliable Blue tooth distance at least my house is acceptable but thats not a big requirement for me. The Silver Bose QC35 Series II headphones are what I expected from Bose and for the price."

However, there would be situations where I would still be disrupted or distracted by conversation if it was loud enough; these headphones have been essential for proper studying ever since then. They’re comfortable, last a long time, and will only allow outside noise to distract your music if it’s ridiculously loud. I love these headphones, definitely worth the money. (and the google assistant is pretty convenient whenever you get notifications, which is a plus.)"
895,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought to replace an earlier, wired version. Just great. No wires, a big plus for me. Noise cancelling thing improved significantly, two levels, almost dangerously effective at high. Same Bose sound, which some find a little, what, smarmy? I like it, not an audiophile, admittedly, but I'm 70, the fine points lost to my hearing. One hint, if you don't want the ""google assistant"" stuff, buy the QC35-1 version for a few bucks less."
896,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible noise cancelling. I bought this pair since 2018 will be a heavy travelling year for me, and after first travel it does not disappoint!!!
International coach travel could de painful in many ways, but having a crying baby nearby a 7+ hours flight can be hellish.
It makes my travels more tolerable, its like put your surroundings in mute, but still can hear safety demonstrations and announcements. The assistant button i have it set up as NC level switch.
Some people complains about discomfort after several hours, but for me the only problem is taht in warm conditions my ears get wet, I hope the leather cushions hold it."
897,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These really are worth the money. I would've paid more for them. Everything just works. First thing I did was change the function of the Google button from Google to NR level, and turning off voice prompts. I was a little worried that I would lose all awareness of my surroundings while walking around with my dog (i.e. hearing approaching vehicles). No problem. One cool feature is how it feeds your voice through during phone calls, like you're speaking in to a mic with a monitor.

The first hour was so relaxing and refreshing that I had to gradually reduce the noise reduction, turning them off all at once was like jumping in to ice water.

I don't fly much but wouldn't want to without these. I suspect they would change air travel comfort in a revolutionary way.

I use them at work in my shop, where there are always a few furnaces, water heaters, exhaust fans, etc. Put these on and instantly I'm in the library.

I don't hear any bass from ghetto inconsiderates in their lowriders.

Can't hear lawn mowers.

The diesel trucks suddenly have mufflers.

These will not destroy noise in higher frequency ranges by themselves, but if you play quiet music, it's as if you're in a quiet room with the stereo on low.

Can't hear my clothes dryer tumbling.

Can't hear my heat.

I admit and assure you that driving with these is safe if you play music at a low volume. I can hear the tire noise or horn of a vehicle behind me. My Toyota becomes a Lexus with the QC's.

Battery goes for 2 days.

They're on the big side compared to ear buds or on-ear, but won't make you look like a weirdo.

As the days go by they become even more comfortable as they adjust to my head.

Bluetooth is excellent. I can walk throughout my 5 room apt connected to my S8 on the charger with no skipping or disconnect at all.

I am an audio professional and believe the bad image Bose has in the eyes of some of my colleagues is BS. I own headphone and speaker flat reference monitors and they serve a different purpose that the QC3. If I'm not using the QC3 for pleasure I'm wearing Sony 7506's for anybody who knows what those are. I know exactly what the intended purpose of all of my gear is, and I hope these amazing QC35's last a long time.

My SoundLink is another no-brainer product. I have some ear buds with a bad jack, I expect Bose will replace them out of warranty when I call about it Monday.

If you have the money, place an order today."
898,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sitting here in a hotel on a worktrip at the loudest nost nerve-wracking hotel in Denver. A few hours ago, I popped on these headphones and turned them on, and it changed everything. Silence sweet silence. Bravo with this device.
Google assistant answers does everything I can think it could do and more and also answers the most obscure of questions which is a very nice added touch (How do I shield surf in Zelda? (and it was explained to me while I was playing)

Great purchase, I don't regret it. Best headphones I've ever had and am now scared that I'll lose them or something will happen to them."
899,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's my 1st ANC headphones. I'm huge fan of Bluetooth headsets, so I'm using it wirelessly.

Pros:
• Very good for work - I'm not distracted by colleagues' conversations any more.
• Noice cancellation is perfect - all outside sounds are removed, but if I someone would talk loudly near by, I could hear it quietly. That's perfect for not being distracted by random conversations around, but still be able to hear if someone would want to talk to me.
• Battery life is great
• App is very nice (only just few little complaints)
• Holds on my head very conveniently
• Has automatic sleep mode, so it's convenient if I forget it on my table turned on
• Supports two devices. Works better than expected (no other headphones worked that well for me before)

Cons:
• I can hear some ultrasound
• Strange feeling during 1st days of usage, but I think, I got used to it already.
• App does not remember what noice cancellation level I had set before (wanted to use it in a Low mode during 1st days, but now I got used to High mode).
• I'm not yet used to keep it on my neck - too big for me, restricts my head movements
• Some small issues with switching between two devices. Got confused couple of times which device is being connected to, but overall it supports two devices best as from my experience with other devices."
900,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the Bose QC3 headphones, and they've been good; however, I'd heard so much about the QC35II that I decided to give them a try. Love the bluetooth capability, and the comfort level is much greater (particularly due to the extra padding on the band. The QC35II definitely does a better job of noise canceling, and the battery lives up to its reputation. I flew for over 4 hours, yet, on my return flight, it still showed 100% charge! My only complaint is the charging cable is quite short - inconveniently short. The battery is embedded in the device (not removable), whereas in my QC3, that battery was removable for charing, with a backup battery, so you could always have a working battery. I actually prefer that method, although the QC3 batteries drain faster than the current one. Love the ability to adjust the level of noise canceling and sound volume right on the headset. Well worth the purchase."
901,5.0 out of 5 stars,"BUILD QUALITY AND FIT: The build quality is excellent and I feel confident that it will last for a long time. It fits both me and my wife very well and both of us have found it to be very comfortable (better than Sony WH1000XM2). I have been using it for 3-5 hours in the office on a daily basis.

SOUND: The sound is clean and crisp. If you prefer headphones with high bass, these are probably not for you.

NOISE CANCELLATION: I find the noise-cancellation to be amazing! It cancels all ambient noise like noise inside airplanes or noise from AC. You will still be able to hear people talk and other random noises when noise cancellation is on and no music is playing. When music is being played at low volume and noise cancellation is on, I am unable to hear any outside noise. Noise cancellation works even if you don't pair it with any device.

APPEARANCE: I am not a fan of the silver one, but the black one looks slick.

CONNECTIVITY: Getting it connected with Nexus 6P was effortless. I struggled a lot to get it connected with my Windows 7 laptop which I use for work. Finally after a lot of trial and error, I was able to do it. I believe this is an issue with Windows 7 drivers. The blue tooth range is at least a good 30 feet. Switching between devices is again very easy.

CONTROLS: The right ear cup has buttons for switching on/off, control volume, skips songs, and pause/continue. They are very convenient, since I don't have to locate/unlock the phone. These works very well with my phone. However skip/pause/continue doesn't work with my laptop.The right ear cup has a button for google assistant/noise cancellation control. The on/off button can also be used to switch between multiple devices.

BATTERY: Battery lasts at least 20 hours as advertised.

MIC: I have used it for making phone calls and it works very well.

QC35 I vs QC35 II: If you already own QC35 I, I don't see much value in upgrading. If you are trying to decide which one to buy, I think the extra $20 is worth it. Even if you don't use google assistant (like me), you can program it to change the noise cancelling levels (without going through the app).

BOTTOM LINE : If you are looking for a really comfortable pair of noise-cancelling headphones with clean sound, get this one! If you prefer headphones with extra bass and if comfort is not an important factor, look elsewhere."
902,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of these on an impulse and I love them. They're wireless, they have a great battery life, they're comfortable and the sound quality is great. They block out all sound when music is playing though, so if you're jumpy, it may be best to turn down the volume or wear it with one ear partially out of the cup. I wore it on a trip to China and watched movies comfortably the entire flight.

I also use them at work, which is actually slightly problematic because I can't tell when someone has walked into my office and has been talking to me for several seconds if I'm working with my head down."
903,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Impressive battery life, solid bluetooth connection for two devices, expensive but not THAT expensive. Very effective for blocking out bass sounds like truck engines or air conditioners. Somewhat less effective with higher pitched noises like rustling candy wrappers or loud chatter. I have the in-ear QC earbuds too, and these are much more effective. Overall not a bad value considering the quality, I imagine these will last for ten years."
904,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nobody in amazon owns more bluetooth headphones than me. This is my 12th pair and I think I've finally found what I'm looking for. I use this pair, strictly for my noisy office building. Although you still can hear the subtle, muffled murmurs here and there, it elimates 80% of the background noise when the music goes silent. It drowns out our servers almost completely. The sound quality is 9 out of 10. Soft music, pop and top 40 genre type, it handles really well. Dubstep, techno and electronic music sounds great. Heavy metal, death metal is fair. noise canceling at high setting deters the music quality from its better. Having it off will give the highest quality, but i have it set to high because of my noisy environment and im perfectly ok with it."
905,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent!!!! Best headphones I have ever used no regrets buying them! Have also used beats studio, beats pro, beats solo 2, Samsung level. The only ones that come close in my opinion are the beats pro but I wanted wireless headphones. I’m no audiophile but I like listening to my music piano, violin, rap, electro. The bass is maybe not as high as the beats but still good enough for me to enjoy my music and not complain. Noise canceling is amazing!!!"
906,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise cancellation is fantastic. The sound is great as well. However, Bose does not deliver on all functionality. The multifunction button does not work to pause/play or skip track on current version of Android on Pixel 2 or Google Pixel Chromebook. Plus, don't bother using it to make a phone call. The call quality is poor and there is a constant echo of every word you speak on both Android and the iPhone.

Update: After restarting my Pixel 2, the multifunction button works for pause play for now but, using this this headset for for making phone calls on Android or the iPhone is unusable. Unless of course you are calling yourself. Everything you speak into the microphone is repeated back in the headphone about a 1/2 second later. That wouldn't be so bad if the echo was faint. The echo is louder than the voice of the person you are calling."
907,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lost my QC25's on a flight, so decided to upgrade to the wireless cans this round. Sounds and feels just as good as the 25's I had before, and the wireless feature is very nice. Battery life is more than adequate and can handle nearly a week of conference calls, music, or just silencing out airplane drone.

Two small quibbles I do have, though: First, getting the headset connected properly to my Dell laptop (Win 10) was a total pain. It didn't want to work for about 24 hrs, then only connected audio (no mic) for another 24, then miraculously the whole thing started working perfectly. I do have some issues where it will cut out sound from one application (say Skype) when another butts in (say and email notification). Second, there is no button to adjust the noise cancelling feature...it's all housed in the app. 90% of the time, this if fine, but today my phone was missing somewhere in the house, and I was connected on a call on my laptop. Made it impossible to adjust the noise cancellation."
908,4.0 out of 5 stars,After 4 months they stopped working
909,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Bose sound. ---But, Google Assistant feature will not work on Samsung J3 phone! If you are buying the Series II for this feature, it will not work; I have tried 3 sets of headphones and none would allow the Google Assistant button to work. The headphone message is ""Open Google Assistant and try the button again."" Android Oreo also has Google Assistant problems with the Bose. As of 12/29/17, there is no solution for the problem. I suggest you find out in advance whether your phone will work with the Google Assistant feature. Check the Bose community forum about this issue."
910,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my open office, which is rather noisy. It blocks most white noise entirely (HVAC, high pitch noise from lighting, etc). It probably cuts voices down by 60%. Bluetooth and dual pairing with my laptop and phone work seamlessly. Unfortunately, the audio quality is lacking - both highs and lows (""must be Bose?"") are disappointing... but with music on at a low volume, these pretty much block out all voices entirely. The headphones themselves are lightweight and feel very sturdy and luxurious with the suede and leather; they certainly don't feel like cheap plastic. I tried wearing these outside on a windy day, and they just couldn't understand how to handle the ""sound"" of air blowing on them."
911,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are exceptional quality headphones, which I fully expected from Bose, but I did purchase them for their noise cancellation feature. On this one feature, they fall short. I am using them at my workplace, which is noisy and where the acoustics are so bad, we can hear each other breathing. I needed help to cancel all of the conversations around me but alas, these are not 'voice' cancelling. Voices come through clearly but at a lower decibel. I would have returned them but the quality of the sound of the music coming through the headphones was breathtakingly beautiful. So I kept them."
912,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these so much! I really researched and read many, many reviews on different noise cancelling headphones and decided to go with these. Even though they were more expensive, I didn't want to spend less and hate them. I'm so glad I did. They are everything I was looking for. They are very comfortable (even with glasses/sunglasses), love that they sync to my phone, sound is great (even with wireless), battery charge lasts a long time (as long as you remember to turn them off if you have to take them off & set them down), and the biggie is that the noise cancellation works like a dream! I use them mostly at work where I can concentrate. If you don't have music on you can hear muffled voices, but other sounds are damped down. With music on I don't hear much of anything around me. Definitely worth the money!"
913,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you’re looking for the BEST noise canceling headphones with all the comfort you’d expect from $350, then this is where you stop and buy. However, if you’ve ever been prone to car sickness, Disneyland rides or any type of motion illness, I would pause before buying these. Basically there is a thing where the noise canceling feature sends a frequency that messes with your inner ear/balance, the same thing that is triggered when you get motion sickness. I enjoyed these bad boys for 3 days, and then experienced severe dizziness and nausea for hours after wearing them. I thought it was from the travel (I bought them for flying) but then I wore them for day 2 and 3 while sitting at a desk and still got severely dizzy. Unfortunately I have to return them, but if I didn’t get the spins, they would be my favorite set of headphones."
914,1.0 out of 5 stars,"At first, I was really excited for these headphones, as I heard Bose is the best and it was getting better reviews than the Sony.

The headphones fit the ears nice and snug, and the noise cancelling works wonders--a lot better than those $79.99 on-ear models.

However, the electronics don't seem to work well. I can't get this to work with my Samsung Galaxy S8 Phone (Android Oreo update). I've tried pairing several times and downloading new firmware, but it still won't connect. Worse, the on-off switch appears to not work--it doesn't stay shut off! It will turn on at random times and the battery gets drained. The instructions didn't come in a booklet, you have to download the app. Using it in corded mode seems to confuse the software.

I love the feel and the effects of the noise cancelling when it's on, but this just won't work. I'll have to try once more this weekend and contact customer support but if that doesn't work, I'm going to return it."
915,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Sony and Bose and I prefer the sound of Bose over Sony because maybe I am just used to Bose sounds-have 2 Bose sound systems.

But just have issues reconnecting the Bose to my smart phone and laptop recently. (The first time were ok) I was in doctor's office and cannot use it. I went home and tried even disconnecting to all laptops but will not connect to any device. I searched and found a solution to reset. Basically turn off the headset for at least 30 sec, plug the headset to the wall or power for at least 5 seconds and then unplug and wait for at least 1 minute and turn on then it works but cannot connect to two at the same time. Then found out to clear the list by pressing the on switch all the way to the blue tooth until the list is clear. Still cannot connect to 2 devices then found out that to connect another device is just do the same until you hear connect another device. But now the Bose smart phone app cannot connect. So deleted again and again and see what will happen.

My problem is - I have probably 7 wireless/blue tooth headsets from cheaper to average price ones and I do not have these problems and I have this problem with the top of the line expensive no discount Bose 35II? This is unbelievable!

If you do not need good noise cancelling, just buy the average wireless/bluetooth headsets, some do sound amazing."
916,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose Quiet Comfort II

You should get them if you don't have them. I used to use the in-ear headphones, but didn't like them and thus, rarely used them. My expensive bluetooth headset would just sit there sad and lonely.

And I often thought, why would I buy the Bose headphones? They are so expensive.

Well, I bought them and I love them. I keep using them. They just stay on my head all the time. They connect to any device instantly, accept voice commands, are super comfortable (no ear fatigue), have great fidelity and clarity (both for mic and sound). I use Zoom for video conferencing multiple times a day and I can run my sales calls with clarity and convenience.

Now I see what all the fuss was about and I wish I bought these years ago."
917,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing bad to say about them. They’re loud, even though they don’t feel like it at first. Sound is very clear with decent bass. Noise cancelling works well at medium to high volume. At low volume, there’s a lot of the noise cancelling ‘static’. It does block out the vast majority of outside noise. Noise leakage is at very low as well, especially if not wearing glasses so you get a better seal."
918,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The new style of Bose headphones are awesome! I decided to upgrade from the Bose Quiet 35 to wireless. While nothing was wrong with my old pair, I must say that not having to deal with a cord anymore is amazing and was one of the driving factors in getting a new pair. I travel quite often and the cord would constantly get in the way when I was shuffling through my bag or getting situated in my seat. Technology is always advancing and the Bluetooth capability is a nice added feature that my old pair did not have. Although the price is high, I am happy with my purchase. Bose creates a good quality product that I would highly recommend to anyone. Especially if you are constantly on airplanes and want to completely drown out all background noise."
919,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are awesome. Sound quality is what is expected from Bose. They have the google assistant button, which I don't use, but I have used the headphones on phone calls and no one has complained of the quality of my voice yet. It can pair up to 8 devices, and doesn't have much issue connecting to them. It's read back capability is pretty good as well. The comfort of the headphones are second to none as well. Noise cancellation is impeccable. Definitely worth the extra money over Sony or Beats."
920,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these headphones in the mail a couple days ago and couldn't be happier. Like most people, i chose these over Sony's WH1000XM2 headphones -- as i simply wanted the best, and these headphones do not disappoint. i could only describe the noise cancellation feature as ""magical"" given the fact that a once noisy La Fitness during peak hours as well as a noisy workplace are now peaceful serenity. With my cheap ~9$ headphones i previously used, i would turn up the music constantly to try and block out noise, which as you know is counter-productive. You can keep the music really low or even switched off with these headphones and just turn on noise cancellation and ta da. The inverse wave cancellation blocks out a considerable amount of noise (not all).

There are a couple things however that i wish they improved upon for the price:
1. Wireless range is really low (less than 10 feet before you start noticing signal issue/loss)
2. You have to select Google Assistant OR Noise Cancellation via the app; You cannot have both available at the touch of a button simultaneously. I think everyone would have been OK with Bose adding another button for us to use both as needed.
3. Bluetooth pairing is limited to two device only. (So ipod, ipad, iphone trio cannot all be connected simultaneously)

Other than that, i purchased these for the noise cancellation and elegant audio quality and think they have far exceeded my expectations thus far."
921,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I own two of these... ran one of them over with a skid steer and when I told bose about it, they said no problem... ship them back and we'll send you a new pair completely free. Sure enough, that's exactly what they did!"
922,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love the headphones. They are very light weight. The big drawback is that they are not compatible with windows. To use them with a windows computer you have to use the stereo plug and it kind of defeats the purpose of wireless. I wanted to use them on a gaming computer but to no avail on the Bluetooth front. I wonder if they will work with windows phones (we will never know as no one owns a windows phone:) ). Bose needs to make their devices compatible with all OS's. not just the most popular mobile platforms.
923,2.0 out of 5 stars,These were a Christmas gift for my son. These are the best headphones on the market. I was going to order my son a pair sennheiser headphones that he asked for originally which were a little less pricey. After researching I decided on the Bose Quietcomfort. It was worth every penny. Incredible sound. I could not believe the depth of the bass you can hear in these. I can’t say enough good things about these except you get what you pay for and Bose are the best! He was so surprised on top of it and thrilled! He loves them and hasn’t stopped talking about how these are the best headphones you can buy! He uses them constantly! They are definitely noise canceling as well! I can’t recommend enough. Spend the extra money and buy these.
924,4.0 out of 5 stars,"i dont understand how anyone can rate this product under 4. sound quality is best, set up was a breeze (download the app on your phone). i compared the sound on several pricey bluetooth headsets and this was a winner. yes, if you answer a phone call the ambient noise is audible and can be distracting, but big deal, get used to it. or dont use it to answer phone calls. I read several negative reviews for this product because of this reason, if you are looking for a phone headset get one that is meant to be. do not trash a perfectly great product which is to listen to music etc etc. i fly a lot and noise cancellation is very important to me. this head set is awesome on the plane. cuts off everything.
battery life is great too.

AWESOME PRODUCT EVER"
925,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones themselves are great - easily connected to my phone, downloaded the app for some customization, music and phone calls sound great, and the noise cancellation is very good. Can't recommend them more.

Now, that being said, I was shipped a pair of returned headphones when I ordered new. They had already been connected to ""Eric's"" iPhone and they had already been named ""Eric's Bose"" as shown in my Bluetooth device list and the app. I worked with Amazon support and they were able to throughly test the functions of the headphones to make sure all the buttons worked and such, and offered that I could either return these for new or keep and they would refund some of the cost. Headphones looked new, no wear/tear or markings, and everything worked as it should, so I kept the headphones and had some of the price refunded. Customer service worked well, but the used headphones should not have been put back in stock with the new ones."
926,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned many professional and prosumer studio headphones (Sony MDR-7509HD, Sennheiser HD380 and Shure SRH440). I edit audio and video on my computer all the time, so I'm often critical of the sound quality I'm monitoring. Here's my honest opinion on these headphones. The bass is exaggerated when playing music at low to mid volumes (the bass is less exaggerated at higher volumes). If you are used to the ""Bose"" sound, this isn't that big a deal, but I would stay away from these headphones if you are being paid to do post production work. That being said, I love these headphones!! The noise cancellation feature is amazing. I live in a complex where daytime noise (landscapers, cars...) is noticeable. These Bose headphones remove most of the ambient noise and the Bluetooth range allows me to listen to music in the living room while my computer is on the other side of a wall in my home office. The battery life is easily 12 hours if you don't crank up the volume. Not sure about the battery life listening to music with the volume turned up. Don't like being forced to download a Google app to experience all of the features though."
927,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing! Heavy duty. I’m not worried about rough housing these and I use them for my daily commute. Travel case is good and easy to open and durable. I have a different pair of headphones for work and the case is cumbersome. Not these! Great noise cancellation. I like the option to have high, low, or none. Walking on the streets is good to hear some traffics noise. These really block out noise so well and sound quality is awesome. I haven’t had to charge them yet and it’s been almost 2 weeks."
928,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the way they sound but was very let down to find out that they do not support aptX-Low Latency codec.

I had planned to use them for late nite TV and there is very noticeable lag on the audio.

I tried the BOSE website to look around for future updates or work arounds but found none (really surprising for top line headphones and the price)."
929,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great comfort and sound , limited volume level on my i phone, very poor Bluetooth distance from source, only a few feet. Battery not 20 hrs as advertised less. Google assistant only marginally helpful at this time. I hope the app can be updated and improved enough to read mail and support more commands. Overall you are safe from not blowing your ears out with these on your I phone. Noise canceling is very good and can be turned off. Sounds good with a range of music types."
930,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally bought the Bose for my husband and a cheaper brand (with great reviews) for myself. After messing with the $99 ones for a year, I finally gave up and bought the Bose for myself. The switch on the cheaper pair never worked right, but I had chalked it up to me not knowing how to use it well. That was not the case. The switch is defective. The quality of the speakers is great, but the noise cancelling is much MUCH better on the Bose. And the switches all work.

My only complaint: some of the functionality is lost on an airplane when you have to switch out of bluetooth mode to airplane mode. I don't know why it couldn't all work when you are plugged into the device."
931,4.0 out of 5 stars,"No brand comparison, only compared against $350. I read a lot of these reviews, and also own and like other Bose gear.

Sound. A recurring theme in these reviews is that the sound isn't bassy enough or rich enough or something. Actually this was an encouragement to me, because I was just hoping for minimal color, and certainly no enhancement of bass (more on this below), just to hear what's there - in a wide range of styles of music. I love the sound of these headphones, or lack of personality; the music sounds amazing, and as others have pointed out, you really do hear new detail in old music. For example, the old hit Sultans of Swing sounded extraordinary; you know Mark Knopfler's lead would be gorgeous, but also a perfectly rendered P-bass and kick. Similarly dipping back into early Police and enjoy amazing detail in the bass tone and bass/drums balance. Too bassy in the EQ and you lose the insight into normal bass. This also improves listening to classical and work music e.g. Tycho, Mercury Project, etc.

Comfort. Very good. I fatigued after a couple of hours of wearing. My not-small ear fits in the cup but seems to be very slightly touching some of the hard irregularly shaped structures inside. I extended wear-time by making occasional headband adjustments. The cushions and construction and button layout all seem fine.

Connectivity. So far it works fine, pairing easily without some of the inexplicable Bluetooth wrestling matches I've had with gear over the years. I've got it on an Android phone and a couple of Mac desktops. I was listening to my work desktop and a call came in on the Android, and the ""right thing happened"". I said to the caller ""uh, can you hear me OK"" and person said ""uh, yeah fine"". I don't think this will replace my main conference headset. But it works well enough so far. The voice prompts are helpful. I have not tried the included 3.5 <-> 2.5mm phone cable, but I'd expect it to work in the unlikely event (low battery) I'd want to wire up. Range seems OK; I don't expect it to work if I wander far away from my desktop, and the mobile is in my pocket, so a non-issue there for me. Note on the Mac: turn off the headphones as sound input (mic) if not needed; it changes the sound of the music output.

Noise cancellation. Works really well - just what I wanted. Having tinnitus, I was looking to lower the volume of my headphones to save what's left of my hearing and still have good listening. Noise cancellation is a big help here. In fact, the moment I put on the headphones with NC but no source, it was so quiet, I immediately went fuh, my tinnitus is loud! Some of you will surely know what I'm talking about. So, with NC you will notice yourself more, but it's still a matter of letting your mind's other focus put the ringing aside. And try turning down the headphones, about equal to your ringing as a starting point. I wish I had gotten these headphones a while ago! And yes, the seemingly flat EQ is a great starting point for listeners with tinnitus, as boomy bass, even if it momentarily ""drowns out"" ringing, makes it worse over the course of a listening session, and of course over the long term. Save what you have left.

Other stuff. Comes with a nice case. The battery life seems OK but very early days on that. Noise cancellation mean you will probably not react to peripheral sound (e.g. spouse talking in next or even same room), and could possibly expose you to new risks such as missed alerts/alarms and people assuming incorrectly that you're aware of certain actions. So use thoughtfully.

Complete recommendation, no deductions even considering high price. 5 stars."
932,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's great, it drowns out the noise from the outside world, however idk.. the bass isn't what I thought it would be, it's not as heavy as the older versions. I could be wrong, but idk if others have the same problem I have.

Other than that, the color is stunning, the case is very strong and durable the ear soft pieces are very comfortable, I would recommend this if you want to drown out the world, it's excellent, but BOSE, you need to work on the bass"
933,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Quality cans. I bought these to help me relax and sleep on flights, not particularly for sound quality. But after a month I started using them on the old phone, computer, etc. I compared these head-to-head with some Sony MDR-1000X headphones - not so much that these were great, as the MDR-1000X had poor audio quality. My reference of 10+ years was my reliable set of Sony MDR-V6s. The MDR-V6 are known for their flat response - the QC35 II sounded 20% boomier and lacked some fine detail at the high end... but they blew away the MDR-1000X. The 1000X sounded far too boomy, to the point where I had to put on a ""bass reducing"" EQ.

OK, noise cancellation. I'm slightly a Sony fanboigh, and the noise cancellation quality is far superior to the MDR-1000X. Not even close. The 1000X sounds ""artificial"" - not-quite-cancelled - whereas the Bose feels like I'm turning on a mute button for the outside world. I am aware of Sony's ""best noise cancellation industry"" claims for the MDR-1000X and uh, no - not even close. Claims is just that, claims.

Best part of these headphones is the subtlety. They don't look flash. They felt a little plasticky, a little wobbly when I took them out of the case - closer inspection revealed they were made of GRP (glass-reinforced plastic). This is deceptively high quality stuff and is superior to the MDR-1000X. They blow away the Sonys in build quality. The Torx screws showed over torque marks but not more than by 1-2 lb/ft. I'm picking nits here, people. They are worth the scary high $400 if you need noise cancelling. If you just want great wired cans buy V6s - they will sound 20% better but don't have the woooonderful noise cancellation - I'm serious, it's very very good."
934,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Been using this for over a month now and it's great! I recommend it!

Fitting:
It covers your ears well, comfortable over the ear cushions make it really nice/snug. The strap that sit on my head usually adds pressure, I have to readjust to the right setting and its good.
Battery:
I used this to and fro from vacation, charged it once. It holds battery real well.
I use it in my office for calls and music and haven't charged it since. It's been weeks.
Siri and Calls:
Yes, it works with Siri, not sure why the details doesn't specify this. The general button when pressed and held activates Siri on my apple device.
I use these in my office and the quality is clear. I often ask my caller if my voice is clear and they confirm.
Bluetooth:
Great connectivity! I have my phone and Mac computer synced at the same time. Its automatic after you set it up. Love it
Carrying case:
It comes with a carrying case which is great, looks great, fits well. It also comes with a charger wire.
Noise cancellation:
I used it in the plane and didn't realize how good these were till I took them off mid air and the sound of the jets rushed in! That made me keep them on. Even if you're not listening to music, having them on at home or the office keeps the random noises and chatter out.

Overall a great set of headphones. I researched a long time before deciding on this. This product even had negative reviews which took me a while to order them but I haven't experienced anything negative about this. I do recommend these to travelers, home office users and if you're out and about.. It cancels all noise!"
935,4.7 out of 5 stars,"The product feels heavy on the head, and though the band at the top is soft, it feels as if it's pressing down at the top. That said, the sound quality and noise dampening are very good and the battery also lasts quite well. The only way to control the noise reduction level is through the app. The set itself has a binary noise control option, not the intermediate level that the app allows. When using during phone calls, I am able to hear the other person talk very clearly, but the other person is unable to hear me talk, when I am in a noisy place. That would be another negative point."
936,4.6 out of 5 stars,"I bought these only because I could not get replacement foam cushions for my QC15's. The aftermarket ones just kept falling apart. I didn't know what I was missing. I love the wireless feature of this headset. Love the compact folding, taking up less space when I travel. Being able to adjust the noise cancelation feature I also found useful. These are even better than the 15s for sound quality. I didn't know it could get better."
937,4.4 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good. Comfort is nice. But beware petite girls out there. Not for us. This does not fit our heads, it falls off all the time. Sony one seems to fit better, in the sense that it feels more secure. The noise canceling though is best with Bose, no doubt about it, although I will say I was expecting more. I am very unhappy that this is too big for my head. Now I understand why people say it's so ""comfortable"" compared to Sony's. No wonder. This is for giant heads. Although I am petite, my head is not small. Anyway, I don't know. But the product is good, there is no doubt about that."
938,4.5 out of 5 stars,"I did a lot of research on noise cancelling earphones because the really good ones are so expensive. I finally decided to go with Bose because I knew they were good quality and have top notch technology. I could not be more thrilled. I absolutely love these earphones. They are comfortable and do an amazing job. Of course, they are not going to block out noise 100%, no earphones are at that point yet, but I would say at least 80% when there is no music and 95% when there is. They also do a great job of holding a charge. You really do get what you pay for, and these are worth every penny!"
939,4.6 out of 5 stars,"This is my second set of Bose noise cancellation headphones. My first pair were bought almost a decade ago and they finally just wore out. Plus I wanted the wireless and rechargable features. Have been using them about a week now and am very pleased with the purchase. I get amazing sound quality with no lag or loss of sound between wired or wireless. In full noise cancellation mode using wireless my battery life is 10+ hours with only about half an hour recharge time. The quality that I get with the audio is something only a person who has owned a set of Bose headphones can understand. It is crystal clear and full range. The only other headphones that have come close to the quality was a set of Turtle Beach gaming headphones that I used on my computer. No Sony, Audiovox, or other headphones that I have tried have ever come close to the sound quality and nothing has ever come close to the full noise cancellation of Bose."
940,4.6 out of 5 stars,"When it works, it sounds great; truly great. But, you have to download an app just to get basic instructions and even then, it leaves out important features, like the hardwire back-up connection. (Have not found word-one on the topic. Good thing I'm tech-savvy and know what male and female connectors look like and am an experienced judge of relative size :-) ) Headphones spontaneously disconnect from sources for no discernible reason. Clearly they delegated the user experience to people who aren't paid enough to care. BOSE IS COASTING! I will look for reviews of similar products that herald the market-driven metanoia (change of heart) of this customer-be-darned corporation. Demand more - buy something else till Bose cries ""Uncle."""
941,4.2 out of 5 stars,Bought these for a long trip to Okinawa and they were lifesavers. Made the plane ride much more tolerable. I also love them when mowing grass and doing other outside work. In the past I always used my earbuds and was constantly having to stop and put them back in my ears after knocking them out.
942,4.3 out of 5 stars,"I travel a bit for work and these work wonders on planes, you almost forget you are flying because so much noise is cancelled! After a recent 4.5 flight I was amazed at how much more energy I had getting off the plane than I usually do. Having the constant, loud whine of the plane really does wear your brain out.

These are also great for the office if you work in a cube environment or if you have an open floor plan where others' conversations get distracting. While these headphones are expensive they are certainly worth it and will probably cause your productivity at work to go up (just don't be rude and wear them all the time)."
943,4.8 out of 5 stars,"Pros
- comfort A++
- noise cancellation (besides wind) is fantastic
- battery is great (non replaceable but easily recharged)
Cons
- sound quality good with bass and highs, but mid-ranges need more love
- bluetooth connection clips frequently (a few times a day, I used them all day) for 10 seconds or so
- microphone doesn't always work the best for phonecalls

Apparently the clipping issue is a common one for these headphones-- seems like Bose's firmware caters more to Apple brands, so if you use iPhones and such clipping may not be an issue. Bottom line: with the reputation Bose has for top-quality, the kinks were deal-breakers, definitely not worth working around with the high price tag."
944,4.1 out of 5 stars,"Good wireless headphone. Quality is good but not better than its predecessors, including the wired one (QC15). What I am really disappointed about this headphone is the battery life. This thing does not last more than 8 hours, why are you (BOSE) claiming that it last 22 hours on a single charge? Totally BS! I routinely get between 6-8 hours listening to music and talk. Listening to music alone would last about 7-8 hours. Definitely false advertisement."
945,4.5 out of 5 stars,"I bought my son the old version of these years ago and he LOVED them, but the ports all broke. Honestly, he had them on all the time so I feel like we got our money’s worth plus some. So I bought him these which are a big step up. I’m not sure he sees the difference, he hasn’t bragged but he uses them constantly and it appears the ports are better designed."
946,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Overall pretty good headphones. They have the normal stuff you expect from boss; comfortable, durable, etc. There are only a few small things that annoy me with them. A. They’re not $350 worth and should definitely be less. B. They revert to high noise cancelling every time you turn on the headphones but this is made a little better by the fact that you can turn off the voiceover in the app. And C. They sometimes won’t connect to my phone when I first try to connect them. It will make the beep as if it connected but then nothing will happen and I have to play with it for a little bit to get it to connect. But I suspect that it’s because it’s also trying to connect to my PC which I also use it for. Despite these minor flaws, there are plenty of good things, like a great carrying case, amazing battery life, good range, quick charge time, can connect to multiple devices at once, and have amazing noise cancelling (which you’d expect). Also worth noting that the microphone sucks but I never use it so I don’t really care, it’s often better to just disconnect them if you need to take a phone call."
947,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There isn't much to say about these headphones that hasn't already been said in the 400-odd reviews that have already been posted. But they're so good that they deserve yet another five-star review. The sound reproduction is very good, the noise cancelling is amazing, the comfort is remarkable, and the wireless connectivity is excellent. I'm very sensitive to headphones that clamp tightly against the sides of your head. These headphones are comfortable enough to fall asleep wearing."
948,5.0 out of 5 stars,I work in a noisy office. Lots of unnecessary noise. People trying to out talk each other. Threw these own and what a blessing. I could concentrate on my work.
949,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have hyperacusis, a noise sensitivity. These cut out about 40% of the sound which I love. I had to disconnect the headphones from bluetooth and google assist because the headphones had a continuous voice reminding me to connect to them, which was making my noise sensitivity worse. After that these are a great buy. I also own Bose ear bud version of the noise cancellation devices. I love them both and each have there place. The ear buds hurt my ears if I wear them too much but are easier to wear when I am lying down or when I want to be less conspicuous."
950,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things are dope!! Better noise reduction than my QC 20 in-ear headphones, even with foam earbuds. Going wireless is sweet, easier to move around. Battery life is great. Only place QC20 does better is for sleeping.

The full-ear pads take a bit of getting used to. At first the pressure behind my ears bothered me, and if it's too warm the area around your ears will sweat. But after several hours I got used to it and doesn't bother me anymore. I can leave them on for hours at a time now.

Flying with these is a much more pleasant experience. You still hear a tiny bit of hum from the plane, but only if you're really listening for it."
951,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great set of headphones. Upagraded from Bose Soundlink. These are amazing. The Assistant button is great. I use mine to adjust noise cancellation level (you have to pick what you want the button to control Google or Noise). I think I am more sensitive to the noise cancellation, day one it bugged me but now I leave the NC on low for hours with no issues. I never use high NC. The one thing that is sightly of annoying (I might be getting picky...). When I pair them to my Samsung phone or my iPad they always pair with the NC on high. I wish they could remember the last NC level of the device it was paired with - then I could use the button on the headphones for Google control and not NC control. Sound is great though and that is the real reason I bought theses headphone...no regrets."
952,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had great experience with the Bose brand in the past. This was no different, except for 1 small issue. The active noise cancellation made me sick to my stomach. I felt like I was seasick within a handful of minutes of wearing them. I had never tried noise-cancelling headphones before, so I thought it would just take some getting used to. Sadly this was not the case. I tried them for nearly a week in different settings (quiet room listening to music, work cubicle with noise all around). I let co-workers try them. The consensus was that the headphones made all 4 of us feel sick to our stomach. I loved the sound quality. I loved the fit. I loved how easy they were to pair with my phone. If not for the sick feeling, it would be 5 stars. I recommend finding them and trying them in person before you buy them - that was my mistake."
953,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are superb, soft, comfortable, and immensely clear in sound. The Bluetooth pairs easily with phones, tablets, and PC's. The noise cancelling feature is great, with 3 settings: low, high, and off. Last but not least, is the customer service with World Wide Stereo. Immediately upon ordering, they reach out showing their gratitude for becoming a customer, but they stay with you to make sure everything is working as it's suppose to. Highly recommend these headphones from this seller!!! Thank you for a great experience!!!!"
954,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had other Bose models before. They stand behind their products which I like. I usually wear out the headphones, because I wear them 40 hours a week at work. I’m glad I splurged for the top of the line this time. The noise cancellation is great, it cuts the noise of machines down so they sound distant.This works for the voice of annoying coworkers as well. :-) The Bluetooth range is much further which is nice, and Google Assistant is fast and accurate (sorry Siri). You are worth the best!"
955,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this one today, absolutely wonderful sound. Was debating between beats studio 2 and these. Got beats because it was on deal for Black Friday. Unfortunately could not enjoy the songs with beats studio. Too much is bass sound. Got these to see if it's just not my ears. Started to listen and don't want to take them off. It's expensive for sure but worth it.

It's interesting that it comes with Google Assistant configured but the cover says made got iPhone iPod and iPad. Using it with Android phone without any issue. Maybe Bose should update the packaging."
956,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Please, save yourself the money and the agony! I should have returned these immediately. I have sent them back twice under warranty, and never got the problem fixed.

CONSTANT BLUETOOTH STUTTERING.

PROS: they work okay with a wire? But, they are supposed to be wireless headphones.

CONS: with bluetooth connectivity to my laptop or phone, audio cuts out for a split second every few minutes. Sometimes it is a short gap in the audio, other times it is a sudden, quick crackle. It always happens. This is with an android phone or a Windows 10 laptop. Those devices connect flawlessly with several other bluetooth audio devices. A quick Internet search will show hundreds of posts about this issue.

The latest firmware update worsened the sound quality. There is now much louder background white noise.

Noise cancelling is average. I had a $30 pair of noise cancelling headphones that I bought at the airport several years ago that were nearly as good. These are definitely not $350 better than those.

Sound quality is decent, definitely not as clear and full as other high-end non-noise cancelling headphones, slightly better than average."
957,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this item twice. The first one would constantly pair once sound was initiated from my iPhone (tried multiple iOS related items). It did work on windows/android though. The replacement set paired without a single problem.

By far the MOST comfortable headphones I've ever owned. I love how I can switch between paired items (phone, tablet, pc). The sound quality is amazing too.

Cons: I now get shot by coworkers with nerf bullets to get my attention."
958,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd pair of Bose noise canceling headphones, loved the first ones, the second ones were better - over the ear model, these are my first wireless headphones. Love them more than the first two. I fly 200 days a year, sleep with them on when jet lagged in a hotel...not the best idea but they are comfortable enough to use for 10-12 hours straight. My daughter usually gets my old sets and she still enjoys using the old ones - in her noisy office. They still work after 15 years. Lexus of headphones."
959,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought these eliminated all sound other than what you can hear through them. They do not! They do a good job of eliminating some sounds in the background. I could still hear my dog barking. My wife cherping at me. I want this for or expected baby crying. Bose please make something that blocks it all! For head phones and eliminating a good amount of background noise they do rock! Sound awesome! Connect easily! And are super comfortable! Just don’t block out all noise which I though that’s what “noise canceling would do” I have a lot of nose products they do make the best for the money! Sound bars, speakers, my car stereo are all Awesome products as well."
960,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Cannot think of anything to complain about this headphones, just perfect. I`m a student pilot and I use the noise cancellation while I`m flying and its so good just cancels out all engine noise and trust me its very loud. There is only one headphone that compete with QC35, the Sony MDR 1000X and only advantage that MDR 1000X have is the Ambient Sound mode and the Quick Attention but it looks too silly for me, who would have a conversation with someone while they are holding their hand on the headphone like that. I think Bose can implement Ambient Sound mode with software update hopefully they will do it soon. Haven`t tested the MDR`s Ambient mode so cannot say anything positive about them."
961,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because there is construction outside my office. I am happy to say that even without music, they block the vast majority of the construction noise. I am so relieved!"
962,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Material Quality: This is a high quality build that is pretty durable, but will require some taking care of and case protection traveling and not in use [4/5]
Comfort: The headphone ear cushions are pretty comfortably, but can irritate after long periods of time for those that don't wear over the ear headphones[5/5]
Sound Quality: The sound quality is amazing a really captures a 360 experience (Pretty close to Dolby Technology), but with the noise cancellation (i.e. when you power on your device) while traveling in any moving vehicle moving at 20+ mph can feel like the high pressures disturb the eardrums. [4/5] Recommendation: utilize your radio or speakers when you can.
Loudness: Just enough not to destroy your ears. But, you can also install an audio enhancement app on your phone to modify this easily (not recommended or needed though) [5/5]
Battery Life: Rarely need to charge the headphones as the batter life is great, even when playing for long periods of times (4-6hrs for 2-3 days) and not charging it until the middle of the week. [5/5]
Recharging: Fast recharging and Fully charges even faster [5/5]"
963,5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW... I use them to listen as I watch movies on my Microsoft Surface and the sound reproduction is EXCELLENT. Plus they always connect, very comfortable on the ears, not hot, not heavy and wow, they really eliminate the outside ambient noise. I'm pretty impressed by how capable or effective the noise cancelling feature is. I choose the silver and no one plays with them. My guess is they don't look impressive or high tech enough. Works for me...."
964,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted some headphones that I could use for two main things: work (I work from and online so I wear headphones just about all day every day) and traveling. So other than how good they sounded, I wanted them to be comfortable to wear all the time, or even sleep in if I was on a plane. I also get bad headaches, so they needed to, you know, not give me a headache. They also needed to not hurt my ears after extended periods of wear. And, basically, these nail it. They sounds great, the noise canceling is top of the line, but they're also much lighter than many other pricey brands I've tried. I can wear them for hours and and be totally comfortable.

When I was researching various brands I noticed that the battery life on these was generally less than a lot of others, at about 20 hours. However, that's 20 hours with Bluetooth AND noise-canceling on. You can use the headphone jack on these and double the battery life with 40 hours of noise-canceling. But really even so, that's mostly a concern for when you're traveling, and 20 hours is is plenty log enough for most any trip.

I guess the only drawback is the price tag, but it is what it is. For me, they're worth it, because they ticked all the boxes."
965,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've has wired bose nc headphones forever. The freedom of wireless is nice, especially on airplanes. One gripe, though: Every time you turn it on you have to endure the auto voice reading off connection and battery info. I use my headphones in the morning a lot when there's noise and I really don't like having to hear that voice."
966,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After a lot of research, I ordered these for a trip to Tokyo and the noise cancellation was fantastic. Very good sound - balanced with not too bright or too much bass - for both rock, jazz vocals and trance music. The Bose fit my head well and were comfortable for the whole 14 hour flight - my head is on the large side and many headphones (Sennheiser, Sony, Audio Technica) were are too tight after an hour.

Battery life is good - I think I used about 50% for the Tokyo flight. I have other Bose headphones and they have held up well, so I expect the same for these."
967,4.4 out of 5 stars,"Great sound. Feels nice on my head. Frustratingly, seems that there is no way to adjust the volume for any of your phones alerts that come through. They are REALLY loud. Like, almost painful and certainly surprising. If your headphones are set to volume 4 (arbitrary number as an example) and things go pop in your ears at volume 9, that's not good."
968,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is great, easy to use and works very well with multiple phones. Very good battery life. Only complaint is the noise cancellation on a phone call removes all feedback when you speak so you are not sure it is picking up your voice, the other person has confirmed i sound great so i am very satisfied with this purchase."
969,4.3 out of 5 stars,I love it. Very good bass and the ear cup is big enough to fit. I am very with it.
970,3.9 out of 5 stars,Overall it is good. Sound quality is good and comfortable. But the wire is short. It has significant noise floor in quite environment.
971,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Left ear volume is lower then right, overall performance is great"
972,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Finally a set of Bluetooth headphones that gets a great, neutral sound signature right out of the box!

No booming bass, overshadowed mid-range and non existent highs....just nice, clear sound combined with a wide sound stage that you can shape any way you like. Want stronger bass? Simply EQ it that way. Like a richer high end? Again, use a good EQ and you're all set. The beauty of these is simply the amount of real control you have over how they ultimately sound. Add to that almost 30 real hours of usage on Bluetooth, a corded option in case that's not enough for you, and sterling build quality, and you have a winner here.

I'm not at all surprised by this as Audio-Technica has a great reputation for getting a near perfect neutral sound signature in most all of their wired offerings, and it's great to see that extended to the wireless realm. If all you want is a loud, boom-y, muddy sound, there are plenty of choices, even at very high prices, from the likes of Beats or Sony for you to choose from. But if you are a bit more discriminating, these should be on the top of your list. These are a steal at what they are selling for elsewhere(that's why I didn't get them here to be honest), don't think just go for it!"
973,4.3 out of 5 stars,"I’ve owned these headphones for a few months now, and couldn’t be happier with the build quality and sound. As others have noted, the tone is very neutral and clear; suited well for classical music, complex tones, and delicate balance. These headphones do NOT have over-represented bass, and are not like Beats or other headphones that “thump”. For great, clear audio, I can’t recommend these enough. With the Bluetooth feature on, there are headphone mounted controls and volume that are easy to use. The overall volume of the headphones and quality are diminished slightly in wireless mode, but again, I can’t recommend these enough.

Wonderful headphones."
974,4.6 out of 5 stars,"Overall disappointing. The build of these headphones looks and feels expensive, but they sound like a $15 pair of headphones. There is no lower-end whatsoever. At max volume you get a little bass, but they still sound cheap. Max volume is not loud at all."
975,4.2 out of 5 stars,"excellent sound quality on lows, mids, and highs. clear Bluetooth connection. comfortable buds that don't stick out and feel snug even while moving. you can tell the built in amplifier and large drivers work very well since these produce a soundscape much like over-ear headphones. can't beat with this price.
Audio Technica always creates fantastic products with unbeatable prices, you shouldn't be disappointed."
976,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Love these earbuds! Been looking for a Bluetooth set for quite some time, and Audio Technica was the first! They got great sound, fit snug, and last a full days work! Things i would change would be longer cord just a .5 - .75 inches, and longer battery life is always a plus!"
977,4.1 out of 5 stars,"Reliable connectivity to iPhone is a big plus and the BT range is good enough. There are a couple of issues. I can hear hiss at lower volume level - I set the volume on iPhone X max and control volume on the headset. It is clearly audible hiss. At about 20% volume level, I cannot hear the hiss anymore. Another is the battery clip. I read somewhere it got broken easily. Mine was broken in a month."
978,4.8 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these this morning at a large retail chain. I wanted to give my initial impressions but I don't want to short-change any information a prospective buyer might want so I plan on doing this review in 3 parts.

Part 1:

Package: The Bose QC30 comes in a very nice premium package. I don't normally care about such things but I am sure there will be several unboxing videos you can watch on YouTube shortly. The package contains the headphones, a case, two extra sets of earbud covers (large and small, medium comes already installed) a short micro USB cable, and the instruction manual. The case is quite nice and has a stretchy fabric interior pocket similar to the QC35.

Comfort: These are quite simply the most comfortable in ear buds I have ever tried with the possible exception of the original Bose IE. These are much more comfortable than the Bose SOundsport Wireless or the Bose QC20. I am satisfied with the fit of the medium tips and I haven't felt the need to try the others yet. The tips are smaller and the bulkiness of the prior modes I just mentioned is gone - probably due to the neckband. The neckband adds almost no weight.

Update:The BT is awesome. I set my iPhone 6 Plus on my desk and then walked to the end of my office building hallway - about 60 feet. I only had one wall in between but I never lost signal. When I turned the corner of the hallway adding two more walls, i began to get BT loss and breakup.

Controls: The standard on/off/pairing button found on most Bluetooth headphones is located on the inside of the band. On the right cable, there is a small control module that contains the standard 3 button configuration that handles volume up and down, play/pause, next/previous track and fast forward/rewind. These controls work the same as almost all Bluetooth earphones so you should have no trouble learning the system. This set has a very unique feature and a real departure from prior NC headphones. There is an additional set of up/down controls on the right earbud cable that allows the ability to vary the degree of noise cancellation -the iPhone app has a much better method. You can go from no cancellation to full NC using either method. I was in a crowded restaurant using this feature. I played around with this feature and determined that there is a big ""jump"" in NC at a little more than the halfway mark. Which brings us to:

Noise Cancellation: Again, this is a very unique system that Bose has employed. Because of the variable control of the NC and the smaller buds, the NC doesn't cancel noise in the same way the QC35 or even the QC20 do. Both of those rely on a degree of blockage of sound coming in and the QC30 does not. It relies completely on the electronics to provide NC. Although I find this method way more comfortable than the QC20, I don't think it provides as much noise cancellation. The lower registers are still cancelled quite well but the mid to higher registers (talking, clicking, etc.) are not cancelled as well. With music playing, this isn't really an issue but if you plan to use these without music or for audiobooks or podcasts, you might not achieve the same level of NC that the prior mentioned Bose NC headphones achieve. Feel free to ask me more questions about this. Also, I have a flight coming up soon so I plan on covering this more in a future part of the review.
UPDATE: The app has an animation illustrating the degree of NC. It is represented by larger sine waves going into the QC20 and smaller smoothed out sine waves coming out. The animation varies in line with the degree of NC you are using. Very cool. I am posting another pic so you can see it.

Sound: The sound is quite good for the size of the bud and for not requiring deep in-ear insertion. However, because of those things, you will not get the lowest register of bass with the same authority as the QC35. The bass does not break up and hits clean, but is not quite as good as the QC35. I used a test track - Hooverphonic - Inhaler. It is very deep bass and the QC30 reproduced it well without driver rattle or break up. That is pretty impressive for a bud this small.
I then listed to the entire Zero 7 - Simple Things album. It was smooth and detailed sound at the same time. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the NC turned all the way up and didn't need a lot of volume for the music to be very engaging. I'll have more impressions on sound later.

That is it for the first part of the review. I know these are new and will generate interest so I hope this helps for now. If so, click the yes button below.

More to come......."
979,4.5 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE to raise review to 3 stars.

I have tried the QC30 again based on a pair my co-worker purchased. The NC was much improved and I did a little research to see why this might have had happened. This is what I found from the Bose website about their new firmware update at the beginning of October:

""With firmware version 1.3.6 comes a change in the Noise Cancelling performance of QC30. The Noise Cancellation has been improved in the lower frequencies to make it more consistent with QC20’s performance.""

Based on this and my experience with my co-worker's set I purchased again and have taken them on several flights. They do now perform similar to the QC20i.

If this were my first time buying the QC30s I'd give it 4 or 5 stars. Since I feel they released the product prematurely and also didn't prepare their support staff for the release, I'm only going to raise my score to 3 stars.

ORIGINAL REVIEW

I have owned the QC25, 2 sets of the QC20i (I lost one set) and now the QC35. All have great noise cancellation and sound. I love the wireless convenience of the QC35. I was looking forward to the QC30 as a replacement for the QC20i. I found out from Bose support it’s not intended to be a replacement.

I fly between 60 to 90 times per year and rely on the noise cancellation. With all previous models, announcements, conversations around me and screaming babies weren’t a problem. That’s not the case with the QC30. On my 4 hour flight this week I could hear everything. The only way to drown out the kid 3 rows behind me was to turn the music up to full. I typically don’t play music but only leave NC on and work or read. That’s not possible with the QC30. I switched between the QC35 and QC30 and there is absolutely no comparison in NC. Switching between the QC20i and QC35 shows little or no difference in NC.

I called Bose support and they told me the QC30 was never intended to be a replacement for the QC20. They said the NC wouldn’t be as strong and wasn’t intended to be. That is why one is designated QuietControl and not QuietComfort. Which I thought was a totally bogus answer. That the QC30 was intended for people with the need for variable noise cancellation levels. I said I didn’t believe their marketing was clear on this.

I couldn’t be more disappointed. If you are expecting the NC level of the QC20i or QC25 or QC35, don’t expect it from the QC30."
980,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Bose has managed to combine the lightweight feel of earbuds with the amazing functionality of headphone-grade noise cancellation. On top of that, they have added the novel technology of controllable noise cancellation - all of these factors combined should propel the QC30 to a five star range - but some inherent problems bog it down.

There are real problems, as other reviews here and on Reddit have mentioned, with the microphone. I've tested it on both the receiving and calling end, and it is bad enough to warrant taking off a star from the review. The battery life also causes a bit of an inconvenience as it's not possible to use them while charging, but it's not a deal breaker.

The controllable noise cancellation is, simply put, amazing. The headphones not only reduce the noise cancellation at lower settings (levels 1-4), but also amplify external sound. This is one of the greatest perks of these headphones - I can, for the first time, listen to music and still carry on clear conversations with people around me or enjoy ambient noise of the nature. This is the key feature that sets the QC30 apart from the QC35 and QC20, both of which I own, as in both of them when you turn off the noise cancellation feature, the structure of the earpieces still keep most sound from being heard. Controllable noise cancellation is definitely the technology of the future.

I found the effectiveness of noise cancellation at the higher settings (levels 10 - 11) to be comparable to the 20 and even 35. If you're having second thoughts about buying these due to fears about ineffective noise cancellation - like I did - I can assure you that those fears are unwarranted."
981,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not my first Bose product, and I am extremely disappointed. Sound and noise cancellation are great but as an overall product, I hate them. I am especially annoyed that my dislike of them was based on performance from the beginning but because they weren't my first Bose product, I decided to give them a chance, hopefully a firmware update or something will improve the situation. What ended up happening is that I still hate them, I missed my return window and now I am stuck with $300 headphones that you couldn't pay me to use. I don't write reviews but that's how strongly I feel about those headphones.

Here are the issues with the headphones:
* The Bluetooth is quite unreliable. It keeps breaking and I end up with choppy music or podcasts. Frequently, I can lose sound altogether for a second or two, comes back for a fraction, goes out again. Issues that you normally see when you are not in range of the Bluetooth signal, but that's not the case.
Indoors, it works okay most of the time, but not all the time. The real issue is that the performance is really bad when you're outside. If the phone is in my back pocket, it will not work at all. As in, the headphones will not be able to connect to my phone. So I started putting in my front shirt pocket or my jacket, but that's on the left side of my body, so when I turn my head to the right, the sound starts dropping. I am not exaggerating. The only time it works flawlessly outside, is when I hold the phone, in my right hand, in a looking-at-it position while walking on the street. I live in NYC. I walk a lot. That's a deal breaker.

*The second issue is the mic. When talking on the phone, it picks up all sorts of background noise that makes it impossible for people on the line to hear me, especially (again), if I am outside. I can hear them great (thanks to the noise cancelling), but they can't hear a word I'm saying. I have had to disconnect the headphone, just to answer a phone call. Again, that's a deal breaker.

Other than that, they're great. I would not recommend them.

UPDATE (March 12, 2018):
Since my review, I have bought a different pair of headphones, but I still use these on planes since the ones I bought are not noise-cancelling. It's now been almost a year since I bought them, and I can't believe I spent $299 on them. They are probably the worst headphones I've ever bought. In the span of a year, with heavy use in the first few months and then very light use later on, they are falling apart. The edges of rubber on the inner side has separated from the plastic on the outside. The flaw is not just cosmetic, it affects the ON/OFF button, making it harder to press.

The worst part about this whole thing is that they have soured me against Bose altogether. I am now looking at buying a different noise-canceling headphones, and Bose headphones will not be an option."
982,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! These earbuds are so amazing. Before I bought these, I looked at all the bad reviews. I have many other Bose products, and so I got these. They have superb noise cancelling ability, fidelity of sound, and ease of use. They do not have the usual noise of the dangling wires on the ears - you know what I mean. I only walk with these, and passing cars are nearly inaudible. No foot step noise. Barking dogs are very faint. Only the clear sound of the music, or spoken word. The buds installed were the right size, and after charging, they are so easy to wear. I am an old school music lover, and classic is what is good. The sound of the trombones and horns on Dvorak's 9th Sym were so crisp. Piano music, a good way to measure sound quality is dynamic and crisp. Try this piano concerto recording of Johann Hummel. These earphones are not for everybody, as the complainers here talked about, but these are far and above anything else available. Buy a set!"
983,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In addition to the Bose QuietControl 30 earbuds, I own the QuietComfort 20i noise cancelling earbuds and QuietComfort 25 noise cancelling headphones.

Contrary to reasonable expectations, there is a noticeable difference in noise cancellation between the 30 and 20i when cancelling the sounds of ocean waves as well as other ambient sounds. As a test of noise cancelling, it should be fairly easy to cancel the sound of ocean waves which is reasonably close to white noise. I would have expected the results to be the same or better with these new earbuds. Sadly this is not the case. The old QuietComfort 20i earbuds handily beat the brand new QuietControl 30.

Additionally the QuietControl 30 earbuds start up randomly with noise cancelling off or on. With noise cancelling off, the earbuds do not go to a neutral sound level and instead amplify ambient sounds and feed them into the buds. This amplification introduces white noise of its own when run at 3/4 sound cancelling levels. So these earbuds actually add noise at certain settings.

I love cutting the cord. It is wonderful to not have wires hanging off my face, but these earbuds are failing to meet the basic goal for which they were designed, solid noise cancelling. I am debating whether to return these earbuds and wait for Bose to get the bugs out.

UPDATE: I exchanged the earbuds in the hopes that I had a dud. The new buds work exactly the same as the old buds. I ran a test by playing white noise on my stereo and adjusted the volume so that it was just inaudible then switched earbuds around including my old QuietComfort i20's... The winner was the old QuietComfort 20i. There was a very noticeable difference in noise cancelling. So I am now more convinced than ever that the Bose Quietcontrol 30's are inferior to the 20i. I really wish Bose had come out with earbuds that worked better than their older models, not worse. I remain very disappointed. I plan on trying other noise cancelling earbuds as they come out, such as the Here One from from Doppler Labs... The quest for the best noise cancelling earbuds continues with Bose getting a failing grade for noise cancelling.

UPDATE 12-5-2016: All the problems persist... and in addition... about 30% of the time the earbuds fail to connect with my 2014 Macbook Pro Retina and my 2015 Macbook retina 12"". I am forced to turn off the earbuds repeatedly until they finally decide to connect. It is very annoying. This product needs a software update. I have experienced no similar problems with the other Bluetooth devices that I use with my macbooks.

UPDATE 3-21-2017: After a software update of the Bose earbuds, the problems with Macbooks has gotten worse. These earbuds fail to connect to any macbook (my two macbooks and also macbooks belonging to friends). There seems to be no workaround. I will try to get my money back. These earbuds are such an expensive disappointment. I have changed my review from three stars to one star."
984,2.0 out of 5 stars,"At $300, the most expensive around the neck bluetooth headset, there's an expectation of near perfection which this product doesn't have.

The good:
- Sound quality is great. Great as in lots of base which is what Bose EQ is known for...while still doing well at the the mid and high tones.
- When noise cancellation is turned up, it also is doing noise cancellation on the mic for the person you're talking to...and doing it pretty well.
- Once Bose went to the in-ear with extra noise baffle, it does a good job at reducing noise in addition to the extra tech that also does noise reduction.

The Bad:
- The around the neck is almost equally proportioned in it's design. It's counting on it's rubberized material to be sticky enough not to twist around (which it's constantly doing). Any around the neck needs to have a shape that allows gravity to help keep heavier weighted areas in the lowest position (eg LG Tone Ultra). See pic on how it's constantly spinning.
- The earphones can't be attached to the neckband, which means they're constantly dangling/catching on things. Magnetic clipping to the ends would alleviate this problem, but would already increase the size of these large ear accessories.
- No fast forward/reverse buttons
- The primary microphone is in the right earbud, which means if you are wanting to just one-ear it, you have to do the right ear or risk having the mic constantly having scratching noise from it rubbing against shirt/chest.

Long term concerns:
- Since the earphones are always dangling, I'd expect with long term use I'm going to loose more than one ear mold getting caught and popping off.
- Having owned 3 other Bose over-ear Quietcomfort headsets (which all have had earpad and headpad deterioration of materials after 2 years), I know they have their industrial design honed for 2-3 year material breakdown. I'm concerned that the rubber used will start becoming sticky and intolerable after 1-2 years of use (like my Bose SoundSports have become).
- I have right ear hearing damage from using a Bose Bluetooth headset Series 2 for podcast/music listening at too high a volume (trying to use it in too noisy environments), so I am very careful now with volume and single ear use. When doing voice audio content (podcasts/audio books etc) I specifically always use both ears to make sure I don't turn the volume too loud and cause hearing damage. A good note is I've been able to keep the volume at a lower level than my other headsets, so I don't think I have to worry too much.

Noise Cancellation Notes:
I came with the expectation of similar noise cancellation as my QuietComfort headsets. You could turn it off (and hear whatever ambient noise comes thru), or you could turn it on (it does it's best to eliminate all background noise period). That is not how the noise cancellation works with these (and ultimately why the battery life of the QC30 is as short as it is). When the headset it powered on, the headphones are constantly outputting sound. Using the Bose app, what you're adjusting with more/less noise cancellation is the amount of sound that is either relayed from the mic thru the headphones, or how much external noise is cancelled by the headphones. Why I say this, is because if you turn off all noise cancellation thru the app, you can hear everything around you like you didn't have any earphones in. However if you power down the headphones, you get the natural noise reduction of having an in-ear headphone occluding external noise.
I think this is a conscious engineering choice, and serves two purposes:
1) It makes the ""noise cancelling"" feature seem more impressive as you adjust it's level up and down
2) Technically I think they designed the headset to be worn 100% of the time, and adjusting the noise cancellation level using the two dedicated buttons when the situation around you is you're talking with someone, or when you want to block out as much as possible all external noise.

I think this decision is flawed for several reasons:
1) It's quicker/easier to just pull the earphones out rather than spend the 4-6 seconds constantly adjusting the noise cancellation amount up/down based on the situation
2) Designing earphones for 8-12hr regular usage is fundamentally flawed. If you were trying to leave noise cancellation up, you are going to be affecting your hearing long-term. You also get what I'd call ""ear fatigue"" because having the noise cancellation enabled for 2-3hrs, then taking them off you can feel a difference, and your ears adjust/recover from the noise cancellation experience. 8+hrs of constant earphone use is not productive and ultimately fatiguing: Why I love the around the neck design is precisely that I CAN remove the earphones when not in active use quickly and easily, and put them back in when you need them. The engineering choices of this headset work against this use case.

At $150, I might consider putting up with it's flaws for the sound quality or without knowing ultimately because of materials/use I'm probably only going to get 2, maybe 3 years use out of them...but ended up sending them back in the end. The search continues for the best around the neck bluetooth headset."
985,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones started out great when I received them at the beginning of 2017. The sound was good. The connection was stable at 30 feet easily. The noise-cancelling worked well in a variety of settings. I'm now well into 2017 and they simply don't work (connect to the device) unless they are practically touching the device they're paired with. I've followed all the Bose suggested troubleshooting instructions and it has made no difference. Contacting Bose has also been a zero. No response. Considering what I paid for them, I'd expect them to work for longer than they did. I'm also not satisfied with the lack of response from Bose. I'll change and update this review if/when I happen to hear from the manufacturer."
986,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After several months my headphones no longer work. They seem to constantly connect and disconnect. All my other wireless headphones work fine, so I know something is broken with the Bose headphones. I was hoping to send them back to Bose for an exchange, but after 6 emails I am getting nowhere."
987,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously, Bose??? I have bought QC30 from Amazon on March 8, 2017. It's not even been 6 months since my purchase, but the plastic parts on the edges of the neck part started to detach from both ends. It's totally unacceptable from and it's getting worse. I would expect a lot more quality and durability from such an expensive product and especially from Bose product."
988,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They're bulky, inconvenient to transport, and are rather obnoxious with the large control module hanging off your right ear.

The noise canceling isn't bad, (almost as good as my four year old QC20s) but the headset started squeaking in my right ear every time I turned my head; the control module was rubbing against the cord sheath. This is a design flaw and will likely happen to almost all of these units in the first few years. It makes the product a non-starter. Turn your head to look at a tree ""sqeak"" turn your head to look at someone next to you ""sqeak"". I had no idea how much i looked around until the 2 hours I had with these headphones (yup. A 2 hour walk is all it took for them to start squeaking)

The design of this headset makes it unsuitable for travel. Unlike the QC20s, which bundle up into a pouch the size of a travel comb, these come with a large hard-shell protector case the size of your neck; and they *need* it. There's no retraction or protection mechanism for the ear buds and their controller; unlike the venerable HBS series from LG. Put these in a travel bag without their space-hog of a case and your courting disaster.

I was ready to love them, but after consideration and trial... the target market are people who like something that looks cool, but don't value utility much at all.

I suggest you wait for something lighter, tougher, more ergonomically designed, and more travel ready."
989,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Within a week the headset became non-functional after charging. The green charge indicator remained on and the unit became completely non-responsive. Speaking with Bose technical support there is no fix for this issue and you have to return them and wait for a replacement unit. Additionally the headset would temporarily lose connectivity with the bluetooth device and reconnect (about once an hour). You should definitely read the reddit thread and other issues users have posted on these before making a purchase.

As a side note the quiet control 20 are the best in ear headset I have ever owned but with the iPhone 7 and other phones removal of the headphone jack you either have to use the adapter or buy a standalone bluetooth to 3.5mm connector."
990,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned numerous Bose headphones and have always loved them. I purchased the Quietcontrol 30 wireless headphones in January. It is now June and I have used the headphones every day. The noise cancelling has been fantastic. The in-ear headphones are very comfortable. I would have given this product 5 stars until it simply started coming apart. The plastic cover of the base is coming off on both sides and at each end, and as a result, the power switch has stopped working. If this were as inexpensive product, I would not have been concerned and just bought another one, but given the cost, I would have expected the material to have lasted longer than 6 months. It appears the adhesive attaching the cover to the base cannot handle the continuous heat created by contact with my neck. To be clear, I only use the headphones when sitting or laying down, so I do not exercise with them."
991,4.4 out of 5 stars,"After trying out the Bose sport wireless and the Bose QC32ll this bose blow too.. unfortunately i just cant justify the neck band.. LG Tones atleast store the wire and ear piece into the neck band, unthese qc30 they just tangle and bounce around when your not using them. Also the neck band tents to over turn on your neck, making very annoying having to turn it back around.. also the neck band is thick and you will find it sticky when you are sweaty and it feels gross...however... i give it 2 starts because the noise canceling is decent.. but that also does not justify the $300 price tag.. bose is very focused on the sound rather then comfort and style.."
992,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Now on my second set, first one would not charge and now the second one charges it seems, but lasts 1 hour at the most. Not worth it."
993,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Listening to music is great, and the noise cancelling is awesome. However, should you want to make a phone call, the microphone is of such terrible quality as to be mostly unusable. If you ever try to take a phone call in a crowded place such as an airport, the other party will be completely unable to hear you. When using these to place a phone call, it is worse than a cheap $10 Chinese headset. Works great other than talking on the phone, but I would've expected better from Bose."
994,3.9 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these because I travel quite a bit for work, and was look for a wireless solution with good noise cancellation. I had been using, and still like, the Bose QC 15 headphones I bought years ago, but was also looking for something more compact to carry. For music and entertainment listening, the AC 30s are great. One of the nicest features is having them pair with two devices at the same time (in my case an iPhone and an iPad), which makes it easy to listen to an audio book or podcast on the phone, then switch to the iPad for movies or other video without reconnecting to a different device. They are comfortable to wear, and fit my ears nicely.

The big problem is that they are useless for phone calls, as others have observed. Bose still has no answer for this, and my own theory is that the problem is that the microphones are placed at the back of the ear buds, which directs them toward the background noise and away from my mouth. If that’s true, no firmware fix is going to solve the problem. My solution to this is the Apple AirPods I’m picking up today. I’ll still use the AC 30s when I need active noise reduction while on a plane or something, but my daily use device will likely be the AirPods."
995,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Arrived extremely quickly

Fits comfortably, has been a breeze to sync with my phone. I really don't even notice it's being worn. I suffer from chronic daily migraines, and bought it for reducing auditory overwhelm- when I flip it on and crank it up, it feels like I'm in a bubble. I can hear outside sounds still, which is helpful for staying aware, but at a far less irritating level. It seems to preserve a good amount of the volume of highs, so hearing voices, and the strike of your foot are still there, which I don't see as expressly negative. I use this in grocery stores, coffee shops, gyms, and walking around town/ crowds.Also helpful for naps. Haven't tried the QC 20 for full cancellation, but this honestly works well enough to make a palpable difference with my symptoms in the moment. Feels kind of like when you're at altitude in a plane."
996,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Only works as headphones. If you want to use this to make phone calls, look elsewhere. Headphone wise, they are decent. $300 decent? Meh. I have $20 over the ear Sennheiser's that sound better but that's an apples to oranges comparison. My point though is you can spend a LOT less for good sound. I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase and would get my money back if I could. I heard these worked well for phone calls and people either tell me they can't hear me, I sound like I'm in a tunnel or they hear background noise when I'm in my car.

UPDATE 8/29/17 - still very disappointed in these. If my phone is in my pocket, the audio cuts out periodically if I twist my body in any way due to loss of bluetooth signal. Works best with phone on desk, in airplane storage pocket or in your pants pocket if your torso and legs are facing the same direction.

For use as a headset for phone calls, people tell me I sound like a robot. VERY disappointing. Seems like turning the noise cancellation helps a little but still FAR from perfect. I really wish I could return these."
997,4.3 out of 5 stars,"These things are fantastic!! Wish I had bought them years ago!!
I work around very loud equipment and can't wear over-the-ear protection as I also wear head gear, mask and safety glasses. I have relied on expensive custom molded, corded earplugs/phones for years, which are much less comfortable for long wear and much harder to remove when you need to speak with someone, and you always have to deal with the cord to the phone (I have to be able to hear the phone ring while I'm working).
I was disappointed that my two year old Android will not accept the app software, which would by a lot more convenient than trying to work the control buttons blindly, but after reading reviews of the app, maybe that's not so bad after all. Mostly I just set them to full reduction and soft phone/music volume and leave them there. They will last at least a whole day for me.
The super soft, non-irritating domes are easy on the ears, They don't handle wind noise or percussion type noises as well as over-the-ear protection, but for toning down or shutting out ambient noise, they are incredible! They'll turn a loud exhaust fan inches from your head into a light hum and you'll forget it's even running!
They are equally awesome in controlling road noise in a noisy car or truck, and the fact that you can ""tune"" the reduction to suit safety concerns is a huge plus!!
I see that Bose is now offering ""Hearphones"", which at $100 MORE than these, will do the same thing to ambient noise but allow you to tune IN voice. I'll HAVE to get a new phone to properly work with Hearphones, but it would be super nice to not have to yell across the truck to converse with my wife!! I'll keep the QC30 at work, and eventually add a set of Hearpones to my arsenal for road trips!
One more thing, if you ride a motorcycle, and wear a 3/4 or full helmet with good ear coverage, these things will make you think you're riding a BMW! Got to have ear coverage though, as wind noise comes through as constant clicking sounds. Not loud, but annoying."
998,4.6 out of 5 stars,"Best Headphones! I could not stand anymore going to the gym, trying to listen to the music and having to listen to other people’s conversations on the phone, talking with friends and interfering with my work out. Since I purchased and use this headphones I don't even know if there are people taking around me. The noise cancelation is awesome. I downloaded the apps for my cell phone and ipod. The sound is amazing; Bose has never been a disappointment. They are water proof if you sweat, battery life is great, very comfortable. Every time you turn on the headphones it tells you how much battery life is left. When the headphones tell you there is only 10% left it means they will stop working within 1 song. Hate other headphones telling me for about 4 songs that the battery level is low. The headphones are pricy but worth every penny. You will not regret having them once you experience sound and music at its best! I would not recommend to be used while driving- you don’t hear what is happening around you. Perfect to use with your phone, great quality of sound. Fast delivery! Highly recommended!"
999,4.2 out of 5 stars,"I own the Bose QC 35, the Bose QC 20, and this, the QC 30. For me, each system has their own purpose. I use my QC 35 on a plane or when I can no longer tolerate ear plugs embedded deeply in my ear canal. My favorite is the QC 20, which I love and use primarily when I'm running or mowing the lawn. In my opinion, they do the best job of filtering out extraneous background noise and they sound great and are a delight in general.

Now, for the QC 30. I use these primarily for taking walks, for walking the dog, or for when I want concealment by not having cords hanging all over me. I really like these but they have a couple of minor quirks.

First, the sound quality is good, but I personally think the QC 20 has superior sound quality which is likely due to being wired versus a Bluetooth connection for the QC 30. I also don't think I get as much playback volume from these as I do from the QC 20 either and I like a lot of volume when I'm pushing that last leg of my workout. The noise cancelling is adequate and pretty much on the same par as my QC 35. Again, the QC 20 is best, but this is likely because I get a really good ear seal with the QC 20.

Finally, I didn't think much of it, but I don't like the controls hanging off the cord of the right ear bud. This adds weight to the right ear bud with a tendency with movement to slightly torque the right ear bud out of its seal in your ear.

The QC 30 sound quality is really good. The QC 30 is well constructed and durable. While they do have some slight quirks, I would buy them again."

What I don’t like

Noise cancelling doesn’t work very well for me. I used to own the “big cans” model. Better noise cancelling but (ahem) a bit outdated and geeky these days.

The carrying case. I like to travel light. Too big for me. Again YMMV.

1001,4.1 out of 5 stars,"I’m very satisfied with a noice-canceling. After reading other people’s revies, I was a little hesitant about that feature. But noise-canceling is great and you can control how much noise-cancelling you want. However the fact that you have to put on your neck is annoying. I ran about 3 miles and did weights with them, and these were just annoying. The neck band kept moving, I would have to readjust every 5-10 mins. Honestly bc of this I should’ve bought the power beats, since I just mainly need it for working out. Sound quality is great...but it is in the Powerbeats as well. They don’t fall out and you can use the bose app to control the volume. Anyways way to pricey for the headphone neck to be flying all over the place"
1002,4.8 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a replacement for the wired quiet comfort 20 headphones that had broken. I thought they would be an improved wireless version but was very disappointed as the noise canceling was far inferior to the quiet comfort 20 and I immediately decided to return them and buy the quiet comfort 20 again as a replacement. If you're looking for noise canceling buy the quiet comfort 20. If you're looking for comfortable wireless headphones buy the sound sport. These are kind of a weird, far inferior middle ground. As wireless headphones they have this additional neckband and don't have very good noise canceling which doesn't make them worth paying double for the Bose sound sport. If you want noise canceling then you should buy the quiet comfort 20. The slight inconvenience of having a wire is far outweighed by the significantly better noise cancellation"
1003,4.5 out of 5 stars,"So I have owned the QC30 since it was released and never been more happy with it. I will say I have owned a lot of Bose products over the year and hold them to a high standard.

So I use the QC30 for when I travel on airplanes. Though it does not have a wire to connect it to use it on airlines entertainment systems, I did buy a simple Bluetooth transmitter that I can use with the QC30. This works great and I don't have any wires to deal with in my seat. There are many of these transmitters on the market and they are pretty cheap to buy over all. I did also try them while working out for the heck of it and didn't really like having the neckband for that. That being said I believe they didn't really design the QC30 to be used while excising. I also didn't buy them to use while exercising either. It is doable to use them, but as mentioned above the neckband moves around a lot.

So back to the QC30 themselves. Many have said they don't like the neck band, but for me I love it.(for other then working out) Even when sitting on an airplane for 5+ hours I don't even notice I am wearing it. The overall length of the cable for the ear pieces are barley long enough. Only fault I can see in the product and wish they where just a tad longer. That being said it wasn't enough of a issue for me to take a star off. They are a solidly built product.

The noise cancelling it is great. I would say it isn't as good as the QC35, but honestly I wouldn't expect it to be. I do enjoy I can adjust how much noise cancelling is on, so I am able to hear people talking to me without taking the ear piece out. I am aware the QC30 where not designed really for airplane use, but I don't like using a over the ear headset this was the next best thing. I also owned the qc20, which are in ear. The QC30 are far far superior to the QC20 in every way.

So overall almost an perfect product. I haven't been able to find any major faults on the QC30s and I put them through the paces on my travels. I will continue to use them on my travels and will update this review if any major issues do happen, but I can honestly say I don't see that happening."
1004,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Other than I wish the earplug portion magnetically attached to the ""frame"" like some cheaper similar bluetooth earbuds and the price I really like this Bose product. I am not an audiophile and I use these more for Audible books than music I think the audio quality of these is solid. The variable noise suppression feature is the best in the industry. The battery last a reasonably long time and recharges relatively quick. They are lightweight and the ""tension"" around your neck can be adjusted simply by flexing them wider. The buds themselves fit in the ear well and I do not get any discomfort from wearing them even for long periods. The inline control works well to pause/start, control the volume and skip to the next song if so desired. It's greatest failing is in phone use. They work well for hearing the call, but those at the other end are not impressed with the voice quality or high background sound they get to the point that I do not use these to take or make calls. If taking/making calls with the earbuds is important to you it would be a deal breaker in my opinion, but for listening to books and music in loud or distracting environments these are the ones to have."
1005,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife lost her QC 20, and I gave her mine for a flight she was about to get on. Rather than buying another QC 20, I decided to try out the QC 30. I've been using it for about a month now. I've been using it with both an iPhone 7+ and an iPad Pro (12.9"").

Good: The noise cancellation on the QC 30 is excellent. I haven't directly compared it against the QC 20 (going back and forth), but I would say that the noise cancellation level of the QC 30 is better than that of the QC 20. It's really nice to not have wires tugging at the headphone. I think that feature alone allows the earpieces to stay in my ears tighter, thus allowing for better noise cancellation. I haven't had any issues in terms of the comfort level of the earpieces, the range of the bluetooth, wireless connection quality, or sound quality. All are as I expect from a Bose product.

Bad: So, why did I only give it 3 stars? I have two main uses for my headphones: while walking around town (every day), and while on a plane (a couple of times a month). I live in an urban setting, so I walk everywhere. Having noise cancelling headphones is critical for me: it drowns out the noise of the traffic and allows me to keep the volume at a reasonable level. The main problem I have is that while walking the base of the QC 30 (the part that goes around my neck) rotates. Within a minute, this rotation causes one of the wires leading from the base to my ears to touch my cheek, which is annoying. So, I then have to readjust the base with my hands. So once a minute I have to reach up with my hands and readjust the base. This becomes really annoying, especially if I'm carrying something while walking (as I usually am) or if I'm wearing thick gloves (which I do in Winter). On a plane, since I'm not moving, none of this mattes, so I can highly recommend using the QC 30 on a plane. But most of my use for noise cancelling headphones is while walking around in a city, and I can't recommend the QC 30 for this.

Overall: After using wireless noise-cancelling headphones, I can't go back to wired ones. So, I'm now in the market for wireless, noise-cancelling (in-ear) headphones without the base rotation problem that the QC 30 has. If my main uses for headphones were while sitting on a plane or sitting at my desk in an office, I think the QC 30 would be perfect. However for mobile use, I can't recommend them due to the base of the QC 30 constantly rotating around my neck."
1006,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Things I like about it:
- When you power it on it says what percentage of battery is left. That is very handy to know. I wish other Bluetooth headphones did this.
- When you power it on it also says which device it has synced to (and it syncs fast). I've got a few phones and a few Bluetooth headsets and the headsets don't always sync to the device I would most like them to sync to.
- I like having the power switch on the neck collar in a way that is easy to feel and find with your finger.
- The noise reduction is very good.

I own 3 bluetooth headsets (the other two by Samsung and Sony with the Sony one similarly priced) and I like this one the best. Though I like the way the Samsung volume goes uo/down by sliding the finger along its outside shell. They each have their merits. But I prefer this one best.

Overall though, I'm not thrilled with Bluetooth. I find too many things cause skipping in the signal unless I keep the phone very close to the headset. I say that about 3 different phones and 3 different brands of Bluetooth headset. I find Bluetooth not as reliable as a wired connection."
1007,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. I use them all day long on maximum noise cancellation (it is adjustable) and stream music at the same time with my LG V30 phone and they last 10 plus hours on a charge. They do not block out 100% of the noise around you. You would need the full coverage head phones for that. Not the ear buds. They do block out about 85-90% though. They are comfortable in my ears and I don't even notice the neck band after a few minutes. The free Bose phone APP interface is great and the pairing works easily. No issues. The sound quality is BOSE. If you've ever heard a BOSE anything then you know they are great. I would give it 5 stars but the call quality when making and receiving phone calls is lacking in NOISY environments. Too much back ground noise just like every one says. The feel and build quality is excellent. I expect they will hold up quite well. They don't include a charger, just a 6 inch cord. Seriously, it's a completely useless 6 inches long. They are Bluetooth 4 so no Bluetooth 5 advantages yet. I would buy these again when they come out in Bluetooth 5.0 in a heartbeat despite the noisy environment call quality issue and the cheap ass short cord."
1008,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these headphone for about three months. I have had good experience with Bose QC in the past and wanted something that was suitable for wearing outdoors doing activities.

I was initially very happy with the headphones. They sound great and fit great (mostly). I had no issues with pairing and it handled device switching well.

However, I quickly started having issues. The first issue I started having is that the unit would not power off. I would power it off, hear the tone, but it would remain on, draining the battery. I've recently starting having issues where it would not turn on. If I let it sit for a while and tried later it would sometimes start working. Even when off, I have discovered that the unit will lose 20-30% of the charge when left sitting off the charger. I frequently wear mine to listen to music or make calls with my iPhone 6. I typically carry my phone in my right cargo pocket. At that distance and angle the audio frequently cuts out.

I suspect there is a design or quality control issue with the button or the electronics itself. There is a certainly an issue with the antenna. My unit is not dead, but I expect far more from Bose."
1009,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I came to these after years of using Shure's ""sound isolating"" earbuds. They are great on audio, but not so (big surprise) on noise cancellation. Perhaps it is partly due to that history, plus reading all the negative reviews on the NC on the QC-30s, that I was not expecting great noise cancellation. I was really pleasantly surprised! I've used them at home and on flights and the suppression of ordinary background noise seems to be *very* good. I don't know how much expectations have to do with it, but mine have been exceeded.

Overall, I am not as impressed with the audio quality as with the Shures; they are just more accurate especially on bass, than the Bose. But that's a well-known Bose hallmark, and it did not come as a surprise. They are still very good-sounding earbuds, and I am happy with them.

One last thing: in tinkering around with the ear tips on the plane, I somehow lost one of the mediums. (Bose should include resealable little baggies for those things lest they get lost after they are opened.) I called Bose and, since I've had them for only a month, they are comping me another set. That seems to me very good customer service. So, as of now, I'm a happy camper and am glad to have made the switch."
1010,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always purchased bose earbuds in the past with my ipod. I thought with this bluetooth I would get the same quality. The reason I purchase bose earbuds is because of the sound but mainly the earbud sizes. I have a very small ear canal and their earbuds always had a small size for me that always fit. When I saw they made a bluetooth that goes around the neck (the style I like) I had to have them. I purchased the bluetooth thinking that it would be the same great fit. Boy was I sadly mistaken. I used the small earbuds and I was constantly having to push them in my ear. If I turn my head they fall out, if I cough or sneeze they fall out. Hell, if I take a deep breath they fall out. I have never before had problems like this with bose. Also, the seek button doesn't work. It goes forward when I press it, but it doesn't go back. If I walk five feet away from my phone, the songs become static. If I put the phone in my pocket, the song sometimes skips. And before anyone say its my phone, I can say it would be wrong. I have the galaxy samsung note 8. Purchased directly from Samsung; brand new out the box.
I guess this bluetooth is a trial they have out now. Hopefully in the future they will give that same quality that I'm use too."
1011,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones work great when they work. Lasts about 6-8 hours on battery. I use them moderately for flights for about 4 times per quarter.

10 months in one of my flights, the headphones randomly died. When I charged it I got a 'solid red light'. No amount of charging would bring it back online. I contacted Bose a few weeks later and apparently this doesn't fall under their warranty and is not repairable. Their solution is for me to buy another one at a 20$ discount from the original price at 299$. Might be lower if I tried in the states but my case was 'special' because I moved countries. The US branch ignored my emails [For bose reps see interaction ID: 2922381f-06dc-4de1-bf20-ee0bb73b66f9].

I wish I got more life out of it, and that bose would back their products rather than ask consumers to purchase another one at a joke discount.

I'd recommend waiting for future versions, or trying out other brands."
1012,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really great, yet still somehow manage to disappoint if you've been using other recent Bose noise-canceling sets. I have had the QC20 for a few years and really like them, but of course always wished they were wireless. When my mic went out on them I hesitated all of 3 seconds before buying this set. And they're great...wireless is obviously awesome, and they slip under a dress-shirt collar and are comfortable to have there all day while swapping between conference calls and the real world. The mic seems to work better than the QC20 did (even before it died of course) and people don't complain about background noise even in some situations I'd expect them to. Music sounds just as good. The noise canceling itself is the only deficiency; it's still pretty good, but noticeably inferior to the QC20. I met somebody who had these and a set of QC35 (the big cans) and had the same report, and now I've read a few online reviews that say similar things, so apparently Bose just for some reason can't get the canceling done as well in this form factor as either in-ear wired or over-ear wireless. Why that should be is certainly beyond my understanding, but there you have it.

Bottom line, if you want a wireless in-ear neckband setup that works well as a phone headset, sounds good, and has decent noise canceling, absolutely go for it. If you're looking for it to match your other Bose noise-canceling set's performance in that area, it won't quite measure up. For my part, I still keep the QC20 in my bag for plane rides, but I use this everywhere else."
1013,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don’t buy these if you expect for them to work for more than a flight from Burbank to Las Vegas! It is unfortunately just outside the window of return for me, but I just used them for the first time on a transcontinental flight from LAX to Miami. The headphones cut out after 1.5 hours in both directions of the flight. In both cases, I was not listening to anything via bluetooth, just had them turned on to cut the sound inside the jet. These headphones are a disappointment, but I purchased to replace lost Bose QC 20s, which were corded but AMAZING in battery life and much better noise cancellation. I also have the Bose over-ear noise canceling headphones, which are superior to both in-ear versions I’ve had.

I will give these away — they’re that bad."
1014,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got mine -- both sound quality and noise suppression seem to me comparable to the wired ear buds from Bose that I have been using for several years. But there's one design feature that keeps me from giving these a five. The wires on the ear buds really need to be longer. These seem designed for people with very short necks. I am a man of average build, and I find it really hard to use the controls because of the short wires. I also agree with other reviewers that you should be able to plug in an audio cord so that you could use these with airline entertainment systems etc."
1015,4.4 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these to provide wireless convenience and because my older QC20i do not provide remote volume control with an Android Phone. I retuned the new QC30 within an hour of receiving them. First, the sonic quality is poor when compared to the wired version. The highs are muddled and the bass isn't nearly as full and robust. I suppose this could be an artifact of bluetooth but I doubt it. That alone is reason to return them. But worse yet is the microphone. I was on a call in a very light wind and the party on the other end said that the wind noise was almost equal to my voice in volume. I then put on the wired earbuds and continued the conversation. The guy I was talking with said all wind noise disappeared. So back they go. Thanks Amazon, you are great."
1016,4.3 out of 5 stars,"I originally purchased the Sony WF-1000X noise cancelling wireless earbuds, I purchased those first because they were completely wireless. After using them for a few days I was a little disappointed with the quality of noise cancellation. Also after purchasing I found that they didn’t have any water resistance so I couldn’t use them at the gym.

Mainly I was looking for noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones that I could wear comfortably for a few hours on a flight, wear to the gym, or wear when laying down.

These headphones meet most of my needs the only con I’ve come across so far, is the neckband. I’m not a huge fan of this, although it’s not uncomfortable I would just prefer a pair of headphones without one.

Sound is good so far, the headphones do have good volume too. Noise cancellation works great, so far these headphones are getting a 5 star review from me. There are a few things I would change if I could but compared to what else is on the market these come closest to what I was looking for!"
1017,4.3 out of 5 stars,"I so want to love this headset. So much the case that I kept them past the return period and now I’m stuck with them.

They look awesome and the build qualify is superior to any of the countless band headsets I have researched over the past year or so.

I’m typically a big fan of Bose products. I know they’re by no means audiophile grade gear, but their products tend to stand out and are consistent.

My past experience with several of the over-the-ear Bose noise cancelling headphones was extremely positive so when I saw the QC30 hit the market, they looked like the ideal match to what I was looking for.

I spend a lot of time reading reviews and thought that, given all of the great experiences I’ve had with just about every other Bose product I’ve owned over the years, I would look past some of the harsh criticism of this product. Let’s face it, there are lot of audio snobs out there and many of them are anti-Bose.

I swiped the virtual credit card that Amazon makes it so easy to do and the next day I became an owner of a product that exudes quality from the moment you open the box.

Only one problem...the right ear was completely dead! Thankfully Amazon rectified that issue and less than 24 hours later I had a replacement pair on my doorstep.

That was the first time I bought a Bose product that was D.O.A.

Over the past couple of months, the QC30s have been on many a travel with me. I’m a road warrior. A sales engineer hopping from customer to customer, city to city, state to state. I use no fewer than 3 Bluetooth enabled devices on any one trip (1 to 2 phones, an iPad and a laptop) and found the Bose app makes it super easy to pair and switch between devices.

The sound quality isn’t half bad. No...it’s not anywhere near as good as my Shure SE535 IEMs or any of the various OTE headphones I have in my arsenal, but not anywhere near as bad as others have made them out to be.

But the pain...oh THE PAIN!!! The rubberized ear pieces, irrespective of using S, M or L they hurt. They make my ears sore and chaff the skin so bad that I can’t keep them in my ears for more than an hour or two at a time.

Even with short breaks across the course of one day, I have to give my ears a day to heal before I can use them again.

Most recently I began to notice that I get a buildup of pressure between the earbud and my eardrum that would seem logical given the fact that there’s a significant altitude change when you’re on a plane, but when you experience pressure issues sitting in your office or hotel room, that logic goes out the door.

No matter how great these sound, I hate to say it but this is the first Bose product that, without hesitation, I would NOT recommend. Sorry Bose...I can’t do it."
1018,3.9 out of 5 stars,"I haven't had any problems with these so far. I use them mostly for conference calls while mobile throughout the day. I'm guessing my pair came after the microphone updates people believe happened because I haven't had any issues with people hearing me. I agree with most complaints about wishing you could keep some of the noice cancelling on while on the phone or at least revert to the last level of noice cancelling after a call is ended, but that being software I'm hoping they update that."
1019,4.3 out of 5 stars,"So, the headphones are great ... BUT (yeah, a big BUT) ... The rubber of the end comes off, dont know why,"
1020,4.5 out of 5 stars,"I read the reviews on this product before I purchased it and I was ready for some set backs. But, Bose really needs to step it up a notch and make this product a little friendlier to pair. As with my Bose wireless speakers, the headset is not friendly for pairing. I have to turn off the bluetooth on my other devices in order to be paired with the current device. Not fun when I have to search for the last paired item throughout the house for 30 mins in order to pair with the current device. It happens with all 3 of my Bose items. However, the sound is phenomenal so I have to take the bad with the phenomenal."
1021,4.3 out of 5 stars,"The good: the noise cancellation is excellent. I work from home and live right next to an on-going construction site. It works just as well as the QC35, but is more comfortable to wear over longer periods; lighter and less heat/pressure on the ears.

The only real problem: the Bluetooth connection is less stable, than on the QC35 (which I have as well), which seems to have to do with how how it moves around while wearing it, plus it seems to have a shorter range. The lack of a plug in jack doesn't bother me, but it would certainly make it better for things like airplane travel.

All in all far better for use around the town, on planes, and for extended wear. The QC35 seems to be better for listening to music, but that is it."
1022,4.6 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earbuds less than a year ago because I loved the convenience of neckband-style earbuds, and I was ready to splurge to upgrade my experience. I had only ever owned one pair of nose cancelling earbuds before, and they were a wired, bulky hassle.

I loved these earbuds, and was soon using them daily in an office environment and on occasional flights. Within 3 months I noticed warping of the rubberized casing, and by now there are large gaps at the points of the neckband and clear buckling near the middle. I threw the box away after receiving these in the mail, and the Bose website claims this is the only record of the serial number. I have emailed them about this issue and received no response, only ads."
1023,4.2 out of 5 stars,"I work in an open office environment, so decent headphones are a must. I use these primarily to listen to music, listen to talk radio, and for talking on the phone, pretty much all day every day. Have tried various other kinds before splurging for these. They are very comfortable, do a great job of shutting out the outside world, the sound quality is very good. I get about 8-10 hours of battery life on them, wish that was a few hours longer to make a full day, but I haven't used any that were better. It connects to both phone and laptop, which is also great. The app controls the level of noise cancellation, and also shows which connection is active, and lets me disconnect a source. It doesn't let me simply switch the active source though, which would be very helpful- I use both my phone and my computer as the audio source for calls frequently. So normally I'd give that a 4 given the price- all very good, but a little light on battery and what I'd consider a fundamental app feature.

But then I damaged them, 100% my fault, severed a wire. I figured that was it, maybe I could splice them, but not holding out hope. Contacted Bose to see if maybe they did repairs. They don't. But, they'll replace for me. Almost 6 months after I bought them, 100% aware that it was not remotely their issue. No begging and pleading on my part, not even asking. Wouldn't normally add a star for service (but will subtract), but in this case buying something this expensive, this kind of service is definitely a plus to be factored in at purchase time."
1024,4.3 out of 5 stars,"Usage Level: Daily, Harsh, Extensive
Experienced Battery Life: 11-11 1/2 Hours

Overall: I bought these headphones because I trust Bose, and I wasn't disappointed. I used the headphones way harder than they were designed for and they broke, but Bose gave me free replacements. I love the Earbuds so much, that alone made them worth it, though they have the same earbuds on cheaper models. I bought this model over the cheaper ones because the neckband form mattered to me. For daily activities, these have adequate noise control/cancelation, but they aren't that good with certain winds. The call function isn't exactly smooth either, but that's a software issue, not the headphones. If you are looking for a stellar pair of headphones from a trustworthy company these are a perfect choice.

Pros:
-- Earpieces fit like a glove, I've had issues before with wearing earbuds for long periods of time. I would end up with earaches/headaches from simply having earbuds in for more than about 2-3 hours. But with these earbuds that was not the case, I have worn these from a full charge at the beginning of my shift to the end of a double (10-11 Hours) and they never felt uncomfortable

-- The battery life on these models is at and above the advertised amount, I would wear them for up to 12 hours they ran out of juice at about 10:45-11:30 depending on how I used them.

Cons:
-- Neckband may break ...
To clarify, this is how my first pair broke, and within about 4 months. However, I also used them on a daily basis, far more than they were designed to be used. I probably got about a year's worth of regular use out of them in that amount of time. Also of note, when they broke I contacted Bose and they replaced them for free, no questions asked. (I didn't contact them until almost 3 after they broke too.)

-- They are not ""noise CANCELING"". I worked in a CNC Machine shop when I had my first pair of these, and they worked very well. However, there was a lot of ambient noise in the shop, and it was very notably not well suppressed. This is in part due to the fact that Bose did not intend for them to be noise canceling, instead, they break their models up into Quiet Comfort and Quiet Control, the Comfort models are generally meant for canceling noise and the control models only do just that ""Control"". So when I turned up my volume I was able to clearly hear my audios, but otherwise, it was difficult in such a noisy environment.

-- Random Disconnection. These headphones are prone to a random disconnection from your device, this happens without any notice and for no apparent reason. To the best of my knowledge, it occurs near the time that they fwd an update and you just have to disconnect and then reconnect the headphones from your device (via the bose app).

-- Can not charge and listen at the same time.

-- Neckband tends to slide one way or the other if you're being active.

-- Wouldn't recommend doing back squats with these. They'll get crushed."
1025,4.1 out of 5 stars,"Advantages:
1. Neckband: It really helps you prevent losing the headphones by having a light and comfortable (at least for me) weight around your neck. I owned the Powerbeats for about a week before losing it in a casual walk outside.
2. Sound Quality: Bose quality. Definitely comparable to QC35 though not as good, much better than SoundSport (which I cannot believe is made by Bose and returned immediately after purchase) and better than Powerbeats 3 (which is slightly above average but good for workouts).
3. Noise Control: I find noise cancelling a little uncomfortable at times and with QC35 the wireless is tied to noise cancelling. QC30 allows you to practically turn off noise cancelling if you want, and set it to the right level. Very nice feature.
4. In-Ear: You can't walk outside in the summer wearing QC35. QC30 are the best in-ear headphones I have ever tried among Bose, Beats, and Sennheiser products.

Disadvantages:
1. No cables. So you can't connect it to displays on an airplane (a comment from someone else on Bose Community).
2. The neckband may be obtrusive for some during workouts."
1026,4.8 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones in April of 2017 and it is now September 2017. I use them almost daily, mostly during work hours and they have not held up well. I noticed today that the plastic around the base is peeling away. See attached for pictures. I also use them while walking my dog and they have connectivity issues when my phone is in my purse or pocket or even my hand. I've even stuck my phone in the hood of my sweater just to keep it connected to these headphones. It's a shame that these don't work so well, I owned a pair of QuietComfort 15 headphones for years before replacing them and I used to sleep in those.

My recommendation is to skip out on buying these. They're horribly expensive and won't last. I have an old pair of $40 skull candy wireless headphones that haven't failed me yet."
1027,4.5 out of 5 stars,"I own the Bose QuietComfort 20 and have been using them primarily for airline travel. I bought the QuietControl 30s after I upgraded to the iPhone 7 Plus. I tried using the 20s for a few months, but got tired of using the little dongle to connect them to my iPhone. I now not only use the 30s for air travel, but I work from home part of the time and I use the 30s to everyday calls. The battery life is far better than the AirPods. I can use the 30s all day (probably 3 or 4 hours minimum call time) and they are still charged at 60% at the end of the day. The AirPods are more convenient for working out, but for all day calling and work, the Bose QuietControl 30s are far superior. The sound quality is exactly what you would expect from Bose. I have only good feedback from those on the other end of the call, so the microphone is very good also. If you need a good set of earphones for both work and travel, the QuietControl 30s are a good option. If I didn't own the AirPods, working out in them would probably be good as well, I just haven't tried it."
1028,4.5 out of 5 stars,Failed within one month: they don't charge and don't power on.
1029,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome product, as are most Bose items. My only complaint is that the adjustment for the active noise-canceling (ANC) isn't as useful as I had hoped. It does work but IMO there isn't much benefit to reducing it.
In addition, the ANC is not as effective as that of over the ear model, Bose QC35, which also own. I suppose that should be obvious but I merely wanted to mention it in passing.

The Bose Connect software leaves much to be desired. My Moto G(4) phone can find the QC30 earbuds more reliably than the Bose Connect software. I would uninstall it but every once in a while, I do use it to fiddle with the ANC. In practice I use the earbuds with full ANC turned on."
1030,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't listen to what the Bose competitors write about these earphones. They are simply the best in the market.
I am using them every day for 2 months now and they are absolutely perfect. The noise cancellation is excellent. The sound is excellent. The mechanical design is simple and good. The controls are simple and effective.
For years I was reluctant about inserting ear plugs into my ear canal, until I started using the Bose. They fit easily and comfortably into my ears and I cannot imagine one person for whom they won't fit. Unless the poor guy has a severe ear pathology.
The battery charging lasts for hours. I never got stuck without juice. Just don't forget to charge them at night.
The collar sits on my neck and does not move/spin/rotate or anything else, like I read in the other comments. At the office, I just relocate the collar over my head - like a girl hair bow - and I can keep listening to my music and my wife's phone calls all day long, although I might look weirdo.
To summarize, these are serious good earphones that last all day and filter the noise of our everyday life. Buy them."
1031,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good: Noise cancelling is great. Very comfortable and portable.

Bad: Within the first 2 months LEDs started staying on all the time regardless of charge or connectivity state. Button functionality became erratic during 3rd month. Rubber shell started peeling off by the 4th month. Whatever Bluetooth solution they use doesn't connect to most of the PC USB dongles I've tried (about a dozen). I'm now 6 months since purchase with a disintegrating product.

Customer Service never responds to Support Requests.

I wanted to like it. The core features are excellent. However, all the negatives outweight the positives.

edit: After months of trying to reach them via email support, I was finally able to reach them via phone support. Phone support was pleasant, acknowledged the issues, and is working on a resolution."
1032,5.0 out of 5 stars,I dont like not because of the price but because of the quality and frequent disconnect with your mobile or laptops. I dont want to go through pains after spending $320.
1033,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had the QC20 prior to getting these QC30 and it seems to me that the noise-cancellation and sound quality is pretty similar. The battery life is pretty good lasting over 10 hours with no problems. The charge time is pretty quick taking under 1 hour to fully charge from 0. Bluetooth is usually really solid, but had some occasional issues that was solved by getting closer to the source. I don't use the mic much but the mic sound quality isn't very good, given the increased distance compared to the QC20.

Overall, very satisfied. Real life saver on airplanes, buses, and next to heavy snorers (add in some white noise and the snoring goes away)."
1034,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Phone microphone quality is very poor, The rubber covering over the neck piece is coming apart. I switched back to my old LG Tones."
1035,1.0 out of 5 stars,"A few months ago I purchased these to replace a set of Bose wired in-ear headphones that I had lost. There's nothing to not like that I have found.
Noise cancelation is great. I use it whether or not I'm listening to music when on a plane. I even used it recently when trying to sleep, because there was a lot of outside noise and it worked great. I see comments that the over the ear headphones are much better, but I'm a female, and don't want to have to fix my hair every time I'm done listening to music, so form factor won for me, but I haven't been at all disappointed with the noise cancelation.
Other than that they sound like Bose, which I love the sound of. The people I talk to when using the set say that I sound clear to them. I like the over the neck aspect partly because when I'm not using them they don't get set down somewhere that I forget about, they just stay around my neck."
1036,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very disappointed with the Bose Quietcontrol 30 Wireless Headphones and I don't recommend them. I only bought them for the Noise Canceling affect and I took a flight and use these Bose Quietcontrol Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones and they worked very poorly and I didn't think they were worth the money I paid for them since they performed poorly with Noise canceling on the flight i took to the UK. There was not much difference with them on or off my ears regarding Noise Canceling. Keep in Mind I only bought them for the Noise Canceling affect and to me they failed and I regret buying them and and I am very disappointed with them. These were twice the the price of my Beats 3, 12 hour Earbuds and they work just fine but are not noise canceling."
1037,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i ride a motorcycle and have loud aftermarket pipes i have been buying headphones for years and always finding something i didn't like. they would fall out, get caught up in helmet, hurt my ears, battery wouldn't last and many more. Within minutes of wearing these i knew i had found a better product. these r pricey and when not in your ears they just kinda dangle around and that's all the negative i can say. by far, they are the most comfortable, best sounding, best noise canceling set i have ever owned! if you ride, this is the pair for you. music is loud and pipes just purr in the background."
1038,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ""upgraded"" from the regular earbuds from Bose to this set expecting life comparable to other wrap around type bluetooth brands. I dont really use the noise canceling and still cant make it 7 hours before it needs recharge. Otherwise nice to use at work easier to keep on for sure."
1039,4.4 out of 5 stars,Not good sound for calling because the microphone is on the ear so the person you call him can't hear you perfectly
1040,4.3 out of 5 stars,"The noise cancelling is amazing. The earbuds sit comfortably in the ear and the sound quality is great. But:
1. Battery life has averaged only 5 hours of continuous use.
2. You cannot use it while you charge them. This is a mortal sin especially with the poor battery life.
3. When using on phone calls, you can hear your voice and background noise on a slight delay. Irritating as hell.
4. On occasion, the Bluetooth signal drops out for a millisecond. Causing the song or podcast to pop in and out very quickly. Annoying but doesn't happen often.

With all these flaws, why 4 stars? Well, I've had many headsets and this one is so good at the noise cancelling, speaker quality and perfect fit and comfort that it deserves 5 stars but the shortcomings, especially the poor battery life and the inability to use while charging take it down a notch.

Yes I could turn down the music, turn down the noise cancellation and probably stretch the battery some, but I think most people use it like I do. Turn it on and start listening. So based on that, I give it 3.75 stars but round up to 4."
1041,4.3 out of 5 stars,"O think I got a used one, the product was not shrink-wrapped, missing the charging cable and the different size ear tips. I needed them for a trip so I wiped them down and charged them up. During my return flight, I come to find out that the battery was also bad. I only got about 180 minutes (3 hours) out of them, which was my round-trip flight to SLC from LAX. I am returning them for another pair because I love how small they are and don't take up a lot of room in my bag. The noise canceling was about on par with my Bose QC 25 but not as good as my Bose QC 35's. I could still hear a little of the jet engine.

I will update my review when the new pair come in."
1042,3.9 out of 5 stars,"The noise cancellation is great. Let's get that out of the way. This review is about all the other little things that knock a star off the rating.

Like most people, I fly only a few times a year. Earphones this expensive are hard to justify if you only use them on a flight AND don't fly much. But I also spend a lot of time in other noisy environments, including an open plan office, walking on the roadside, and in cafés. I live in India. If you've ever been here, you know India is LOUD. Vehicles honk all the time for no reason at all, and there are always too many chatty people around. I like my peace and quiet, I like not having wires dangling off my ears, and I like not looking like a dork wearing huge over-the-head cans 16/7 (which is how much I wear earphones).

I came to the QC30 via LG Tone HBS-630 (loved them until they fell apart), Moto Buds (never got used to the stiff neckband), and Bose QC20i (but that heavy dangling cable). The QC30 is easily a great upgrade. That said, Bose got a few things wrong for my use case:

1. There's no standby mode. Either the noise cancellation is on and constantly draining battery, or the headset is switched off. I wear these all day, but I don't listen to music all day. If I get a call, I expect to be able to lift the buds to my ears and answer. Can't do that here.

2. There's no magnetic storage for the buds. Come on Bose, both LG and Motorola figured this out. I've got buds dangling off my neck 80% of the day. They get in the way every time I bend forward. They get entangled every time I pick up the neckband from a table.

3. The controls are on the wire instead of the neckband. I have to feel around to find them every single time. Didn't have this problem on the LG or Motorola.

And two non-issues:

1. Other reviewers say the mic quality is fuzzy. I do about 2-3 calls a week and no one's complained in the week I've had these. Guess I can just switch to the phone for my limited voice call use (or maybe Bose will issue a software update).

2. I thought the variable noise cancellation was a gimmick. Why would you want anything less than 100%, especially in a place like India where you can safely ignore anyone honking at you in traffic? Turns out it is useful when you're in a _quiet_ environment and want to hear someone calling out for you.

**Update:** After a few more calls, I think the verdict is clear: the mike is garbage. People on the other side can't quite make out what I'm saying. I didn't have complaints in the first few calls because I must have sounded like I had bad network coverage. After several months of waiting for Bose to issue a software update, I'm taking off another star from the rating and just getting another headset for calls."
1043,4.3 out of 5 stars,I work in a very noisy environment and these along with ambient sounds clears everything away. They are totally worth every penny. At first I thought they would feel weird in my ears but they don't. They are the most comfortable ear buds I've ever worn.
1044,4.5 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones through Amazon, and I expected to like them much more than I do. The sound quality, of course, is excellent--after all, it's Bose. Battery life is great, and that was one of the attractive points to me. However, the earbuds fall out of my ears from time to time, especially when I'm out working in the yard. The C-shaped collar, or whatever it's called, presented an unexpected problem: over a period of time--say, 30 minutes--the collar would begin to twist around, pulling the ear buds out of my ears. In addition, the location of the adjustment switches is awkward, I have to feel around for them, and it's easy to dislodge an ear bud in the process. It's much easier when a single or double tap on the bud can make it pause, etc. Also, for me, the design that has the hooks around the ear is probably better, at least for me. Even with Bose Connect, I found switching between iPhone and iPad cumbersome. Finally, the case is lovely, but takes up a fair amount of room. I like to travel light, so this is a drawback. (Compared with AirPods, this case is very big.) In addition, the case doesn't have a usb charging port on the outside. I suspect that something like that will become standard.
That said, all these things are intensely personal, as is usually the case in earphones. If these give you a good fit, you'll find the sound to be superb."
1045,4.3 out of 5 stars,"WARNING: WARRANTY FRAUD ALERT!!

Warranty Exchange #1: Product fell apart after the first 8 months of use. Did a warranty exchange and waited nearly two months for the replacement.

Warranty Exchange #2: Warranty exchange short-circuited within 1 week of receipt. That was two months ago, I have yet to receive the replqcement.

Out of the last 13 months, I’ve spent 4 (and counting) waiting for Bose warranty replacements. This product is defective and so is the brand Bose for creating such a terrible manufacturer’s warranty intentionally designed to force customers into buying new products after their crummy design fails within a year."
1046,4.6 out of 5 stars,"Extremely comfortable during long uses. I work 10 - 14 hour shifts. Had these for about a month now and I've used them everyday at work. Hard to hear what's going on around me even with the noise cancellation down to min.

Battery life is nice and Bluetooth connection works fine. Only had it cut out once on the first day but my phone was a few inches from the device. Too close to have a reliable connection anyways so makes sense. I've walked across my whole house while still being connected to my phone.

One thing that would be nice to see would be on board storage. Even if it was a few gigs. That was a nice feature for the Samsung Gear X. Wouldn't recommend the Gear X because they were horribly uncomfortable after 30 minutes of use and they clog horribly where the sound coming out of them sounds like a whisper at full volume.

I have a galaxy S8+ so results on connectivity might be different. Probably going to buy another one because my wife tried taking mine for herself."
1047,4.2 out of 5 stars,"Great wireless earphones! I purchased these to co-exist with my QC35 headphones and I also own a pair of QC20 as well. The wireless aspect of these earphones are why I bought them, so a I could have something lighter than the bulky QC35; to be fair, the QC35 are the best at canceling all the noise, but these are lighter and sound great. I am watching my daughter swim at a swim meet tonight and with my music playing, they block all the nose; with the musics stopped, I can hear the louder sounds. I will update my review after I fly with these; that will be next week."
1048,4.3 out of 5 stars,"LOVE THESE HEADPHONES! I tried these at the Bose store and knew they were really good but it was not till I got them from Amazon and tried them in my home on my own devices that I really appreciated what a marvel of engineering and quality manufacturing they pulled off. Headphones are a remarkably diverse category these days so I understand others might want something different. Athletes and audiophiles have very different criteria than I do. I will say that for this segment these are the best in the world. The form factor is exactly what I was looking for. I put them on and they stay on all day. If I decide to take them out of my ears the collar keeps them handy whenever I want them and they NEVER tangle. The collar disappears on your neck. It is super light and once it reaches your body temperature you don't know it's there. The ear buds are super comfortable and they stay perfectly in place. The sound is really great for something so small. I get big volume when I want and they are crisp and clean. The best part is the noise cancelling. I travel and these are as good as any I have ever tried with none of the bulk of their larger brethren.

The only downside is the cost but I asked myself, ""How much for the one that works?"" These headphones are a category of one. If you want a great form factor, super high quality materials, great sound, extreme comfort and excellent noise cancellation this is the one."
1049,4.1 out of 5 stars,"I will start with the only two positive comments I have on these. One is the sound quality is great as you would expect and two the battery life is as advertised. As for the rest I have nothing good to say, the blue tooth range is very poor as in I would have to still carry my phone in my pocket at the gym and depending on how i would twist and turn it still cuts out from time to time even at full charge on the battery. The noise cancellation is not comparable at all to any of their over the ear styles, not that I was expecting the same level of NC but they do advertise them as comparable and I do not agree with that at all. They do not stay in place very well during physical activity and the neck band is very bulky and uncomfortable compared to others of similar design, the bulk of the weight is at the lower portion of the band on each side which is fine as long as you aren't moving your head around, as soon as you do turn your head the weight holds them down and off center as you turn your head back and forth, I was constantly having to reach up and adjust the band which I found to be very irritating especially from a set or ear buds with a $300 price tag, I don't mind paying good money for a product as long as it lives up to it's standards which I don't feel these do at all, you can spend even less than half the money and have a much more user friendly and practical product that works much better with physical activity."
1050,4.8 out of 5 stars,"Good for long flights and train rides, but makes me feel like I need to ""pop"" my ears as if on a fast high rise elevator. The noise cancelling is a little weird and I can't seem to quite get used to it. Purchased the non-noise cancelling Sports model and like them much better, but will save the QuietControl for travel. Battery life is great - about 10 hours. Wish I could plug in an external cable though to use with airplanes headrest entertainment."
1051,4.5 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Bose QC 30i headphones on Amazon last October. I currently also own a QC-15 and a QC 20i. I am a serious BOSE fan and sensitive to loud noise, so the noise suppression feature is important. It works. Not as well as the QC20 or the QC 15, but it works well enough for me. Sound quality a smidge below the others. I would not use it on a plane..... Unfortunately, over my many many purchases of various Bose headphones over more than a decade, many have been returned because of lack of durability or bad construction. Sure enough, my QC-30 DIED last night, roughly 6 months after purchase. In an effort to insure that it was the headphones and not me, I left the charging cable on all night and awakened to the classic headband green light telling me everything was OK, powered up, etc. It wasn't. Pressing the on/off button resulted in nothing happening, whereas under normal conditions I would get a positive green power light and a blinking white light telling me the bluetooth hookup was taking place. Nada. So Monday, I will be calling Bose once again, telling them another one of my purchases needs repair or replacement, wait the appropriate number of days for cross country shipping, and eventually get a functional QC 30 back, probably from reconstructeds. The only reason that I am not angrier is that my fallback headphones, while not wireless, are great...so the music doesn't completely die, it just waits for a bluetooth replacement. And for the benefit of Bose whose people appear to read these critiques, I am wheelchair bound and therefore not using them to climb Everest, or even jog.
If you are a Bose addict like me, sure go ahead and buy it. If not, look for a comparable bluetooth headphone."
1052,4.5 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased several Bluetooth earphones. I am close to completely blind and my entrainment comes from audible, audio podcasts, etc. these are hands down the best sound, best noise cancel earphones I have ever owned. My complaint is it does not maintain connection through my house and the battery life is not as advertised. Non retractable lines but I knew that. I have owned 2 sets of LG and I love them, they last all day , coverage distance into my yard. But they just do not last. 150.00 earphones, not mistreated should last a year at the very least."
1053,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Have used for 3 trips. Sound quality excellent. Noise cancellation good for my frequent airline travels. Although I'm getting used to it, I'm not a fan of the neck piece which does not stay evenly positioned around neck. I'm still getting used to the position of controls on the neck piece."
1054,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have several bose products. These are great. I do wish the cord was retractable, but hanging is ok. I use on the plane and in the office. I have the bose over the ear too, but like these better. After a while, the over the ear gets uncomfortable. The QC 30 last me all day plus. I never run out of battery.

One issue I do have, when on a conference call, people say they hear my typing and it is annoying. That might be because I usually leave one earpiece out hanging."
1055,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the sound quality I listen to pop/dance music and it's really great the bass sounds good the highs mids everything is great the only problem I have with these is that I don't think they are worth 300$?? I've owned these for almost TWO years and the leather is already coming off and the power bottom is really hard to press I usually use my two thumbs to just turn it off and on and the fact that sometimes I can't even get it to work that way... I would probably buy these again because after hearing with these earbuds I can never find some pair of earbuds as good as the quality this gives!! I love bose but for 300$ I expected these to AT LEAST last me half a life time if not maybe forever because I only use these in my room!!! Why are they tearing up?? I don't know but I recommend getting these but take real good care of them and if u can. get a warranty just to be safe because right now I wish I could of :/
1056,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Noise cancellation is not as good on an airplane as my older wired in-ear bose model - but otherwise great. Battery is good for about 6+ hrs of noise cancellation + listening to music or watching movies, but again not as good as my older wired model."
1057,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had these for only five months now and they are falling apart already and I only use it for four days out of the week... I've always associated the Bose name with the highest quality but with this headset I feel like I've been robbed..
