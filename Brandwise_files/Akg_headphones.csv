0,"Cans sound fine, but the AKG branded audio cable supplied to use the headphones wired was defective. Looks like there's an intermittent in the plug on one end or the other. I used a cable I got from a $30 pair of headphones to test and verified it was the cable. I was actually about to return the product until I decided to check the cable. Not worth swapping the product to get a replacement, but kind of lame to get a bad $2 cable when you buy a $300 pair of cans :(UPDATE 02/2015The left earcup now only produces static when used with Bluetooth, just sent the phones back for repair. They were used exclusively wirelessly at my desk at work. The ""AKG"" branded plastic cover on the USB charge cable also came loose, making AKG 0 for 2 on cables. As an additional comment, the plastic logo panels on the sides of the headphones are a glossy finish that shows every single fingerprint. Overall, the quality is very poor for headphones in this price range, and I would not recommend them at this price. Might be worth it at $100-$120, unless of course they die after 4 months like mine.Update 3/2015After 3 weeks, still waiting on a replacement for the return I made. AKG's outsourced Indian customer support informed me that they are closing my service request, so apparently I paid $17 for UPS Ground in order to have Harmon Kardon throw away my headphones for me. I would at this point suggest that another manufacturer not under the HK umbrella might be a better use of your money.Final Update 3/2015HK Customer Service apparently just closed my case after a month without actually sending a warranty replacement and just stopped responding to my inquiries; Summary, HK doesn't honor their warranty. Worst customer service experience I've had in 10 years, no joke.",1.0 out of 5 stars
1,"I bought these for my Futaba Sakura cosplay, but I also just wanted a nice Bluetooth headset too. I have no complaints. I was very concerned about all of the bad reviews about receiving a faulty one, but luckily I didn't get a bad one (ordered with Pavilion Electronics for $146 which isn't too shabby because now I see them for a whooping $266!). I saw a review that showed the earpads were very deteriorated after a year but I mean, as an avid headset user I just buy replacement pads. Also the Bluetooth pairing was extremely simple, I literally just pressed the Bluetooth button on my phone and held the Bluetooth button on the headset and it paired instantly with my Samsung Note 8. The headset and your phone or media device have a different volume gauge from each other. It wasn't hard to figure out. The volume was definitely loud enough for easy listening and even loud listening especially for a Bluetooth set. Sounds don't distort either. If you have determined you don't have a faulty set, you are either going deaf or are a professional DJ that plays in loud clubs, but you would know that you shouldn't be buying Bluetooth headsets for work anyway. It comes with a charging cord, a cord that you can plug into your headset for wired listening and a nice storage bag. No complaints. Comfortable too.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2,"Holy cow, what a set of cans. These are some nice headphones! I read some reviews where the headphones came in damaged or people had trouble with quality control issues, but not so with my pair. I’ll try to detail everything here so you can get an accurate review on a pair of headphones that actually are worth the money and that aren’t factory defunct.Sound quality: 5/5Nice full bass but not so much that it crowds the mix or that it overshadows the highs/mids. As a matter of fact I found that pretty much all the EQ was spot on. Older recordings that aren’t as bass heavy still sound pretty great; the slight bass boost on the headphones help on that front. Newer recordings sound very round, but everything has a certain presence and can be heard clearly. The cups help isolate the sound (even though these are not noise cancelling) and these headphones seem plenty loud.Build quality: 5/5They feel very sturdy and seem like they could take the years well. The pivots/folding portion of the headphones feel pretty stiff, like they’re going to hold up and not just flop about after a few months of use. The buttons have a mechanical feel to them and are well placed on the right ear cup. The padding on the ear cups are very soft and comfortable, if not a bit warm for my taste, but that’s the trade off with these headphones: have hot ears or have no sound isolation.Features: 4/5The features on these headphones are a bit lacking compared to some newer models. The track skip/ffwd/rewind buttons may not be on the headphones, but the buttons that it does have get the job done. You can answer a phone call with one button press or decline it with a long press. One thing that I found to be a bit wonky was that the headphones have a separate volume from the phone/music player. At first I was a bit concerned with the volume until I realized that the headphones themselves were not all the way up. Bluetooth range seems to be a bit above average compared to other headphones I have tried. The aux input is also a welcome feature, letting you continue listening with the included cable.Overall, this is a great set of headphones for the money, and it just goes to show that sound quality is more important than features you won’t use half of the time anyway.Hope this review helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars
3,"Love this headphone but the left side is louder than the right. After a quick google search, this is a common problem with this headphone and this headphone have a high failure rate and poor quality control. I had to reorder a new one from Amazon. Hopefully it's not defective.",1.0 out of 5 stars

5,"Sounds impeccable. Bowers and Wilkins P7 Wireless sound pretty much the same. My regrets with AKG are: 1) short battery life and 2) they arrived broken. One earpiece was making a contant noise that was not natural. I had to fiddle with the earpiece to fix it (after which they sounded perfect), but after some time (a day or so) the noise would occur again. Perfect sound, however, if they don't arrive broken.",3.0 out of 5 stars
6,Sound:Very clear sharp and decent bass.  I was very skeptical of the sound quality because it uses Bluetooth but I was very impressive for a Bluetooth. These will replace my SMS audio Sync/kleer headphones.Design:These headphones are serious and mature looking. My  complaints are they don't fit my head snug. I read somewhere that you can bend the headband but I'll pass on that. There is no way to forward tracks on the headset. The volume has an obvious limit with my ipod. It's not to bad it's still not a deal breaker.If you guys want a superior sounding headphones that are BT these are it. Don't waste your money on Beats by dre.,5.0 out of 5 stars
7,"I have an unfair bias towards AKG headphones because they have always been a high end brand I've focused on, but I'm slightly disappointed. These sound great and look great (which are respectively most important), I just wish they had controls for changing tracks and activating digital assistants. The power off button is much easier to push than the pause/play button (resulting in accidentally turning it off).Doesn't get too loud, bass is a little warm, which most people prefer these days. Clear stereo highs. It has its own volume separate from the device you're synced with which is weird.",3.0 out of 5 stars
8,"A couple of tries, or more, is all to often the case to pair a new Bluetooth device. Not so with these headphones, paired on the first try. The comfort of these full size cans is as good as my lightweight foam pad on ear headphones. I expected the Bluetooth connection to be just okay, like my other Bluetooth headphones and speaker. What a pleasant surprise that these sound as if they are hard wired.",5.0 out of 5 stars
9,Definitely more open sounding than any other closed headphone I've heard. Direct connected to source via 3.5mm plug sounds incredible. Using via Bluetooth is compressed but not bad. Very light for size and super comfortable. Plush leather pads are so soft. Love AKG quality.,5.0 out of 5 stars

11,"These are a bit pricey compared to other excellent headphones, but if you want the convenience of a no-wire headphone and have money to spare this is an excellent pair of headphones.Some people say that the volume is slightly low, but I have no issues whatsoever. The fact that the charging port is a standard micro-usb means even without the AKG cable there would be no problems.",5.0 out of 5 stars
12,"Sound quality was fine wired but I couldn't get the bluetooth to work. Charged overnight, unplugged it and pressed the bluetooth button and no light. Tried NFC pairing and my phone found it, but it could not pair. Will exchange for a new pair and update review.Update: Replacement headphones sound great and are perfect for cosplaying Sakura Futaba from Persona 5. I used a set of replacement ear pads and spray painted them with red floral paint to change the color. Saved hundreds of dollars over the official Futaba AKG K 845s that Atlus put out.",3.0 out of 5 stars

15,"The balance was a bit off with the left being louder than the right.  No easy adjustment that I could find.  Doesn't quite fit completely around the ear.  The overall quality of the sound was good, but the bass left a lot to be desired.",3.0 out of 5 stars
16,"Quite comfortable for me, well-made and very good sound quality.  Bluetooth sound quality is HIGHLY dependent upon the BT ""sender"" - find something that supports aptX codec.  I used the Creative BT-W2 with these headphones and quality was MUCH better than stock Lenovo bluetooth. Range was also much better with the BT-W2. Paired well with my S5 phone and sound quality was excellent.  I can *just* get all my ear inside the cushion which makes them much more comfortable; my ear size is pretty ""normal"".  These are not a $300 pair of headphones as I think they originally went for, but they're decent for $180.  Not studio-quality, but no BT headphones right now will be - this is a limitation of bluetooth and not necessarily the headphones.  Corded quality IS better, IF you have a high-quality input, but still not a $300 pair of headphones. I also like how they fold relatively flat (like DJ headphones) for throwing in a laptop case. Contrary to other reviews, shutting them off is a matter of hitting the round button on them (controls power/pairing).One odd thing I ran into is I couldn't charge these with a li-ion battery pack... autosensing either in the headphones or the battery caused it to shut off.Pros: corded option (cord included) when battery dies or with a non-BT device, headband adjustment stays put, quit comfortable, very good sound isolationCons: can't charge while using BT (but can still use cord), power/pair button is easy to accidentally hit when reaching for volume controlsFailed a 5-star, because while they're very good, I just don't feel they are *excellent*.  Charging while using BT, <$150 price point, skip controls, better battery life would probably make them 5-start cans.  Still I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend them.",4.0 out of 5 stars

21,"I've now received two pairs of these with the same defect. The left ear is louder than the right and if I tap/press on the right ear it will cut in and out. The seems to be a common problem reported on Amazon and elsewhere.If I press and fiddle with the right ear in a certain way I can get it to stay loud until I move again, but something is still off about it. It sounds to me like it's wired out of phase. It's too bad because they sound like they have the potential to be really good. I hope AKG can get their act together but I'm not going to be their quality control tester for a third pair.",1.0 out of 5 stars

29,"Good BT headphones. I can listen them without noticing much difference to my HD650. Noise isolation is quite good. They are over the ear but not mach, so if wearing beanie these will become on-the-ear. Good buy for $200 as I got it, not sure about $300.Something that I would note:- blue led is always blinking when headphones are enabled, can be quite distracting while listening in darkness;- sound can be interrupted when listening in a place with a lot of WiFi networks. Still works fine when laptop on laps, may work not so good when laptop is on stand behind display, In non-congested places no problems. Can get up to 20ft range in these before interruptions appear.",4.0 out of 5 stars
30,Wow. I had tried many other high end BT headphones and these blow them away. The sound quality is incredible. Easily rivaling wired headphones in this price range.They seem to be of very good build quality and are very comfortable.You will not be disappointed.UPDATE: After all I ended up returning these and instead I bought the Sony MDR-1RBT. There were 2 main reasons I like the Sony's better. 1. The Sony's have a 30 hour battery life while AKG has a comparative measly 8 hours. 2. They are much more comfortable and fit completely over my ear. I have pretty standard size ears for a man and the AKG's bottom pad rests on my earlobe. The Sony's sound great but I think AKG  is just a bit better. The sound quality difference is so not noticeable to me that I don't see it as a consideration. The Sony's also have a forward/back button which the AKG's do not have. The Sony's have better noise isolation and leak much less as well. The Sony's come with a carrying case while the AKG's do not. The price of the MDR-1RBT-s as of this review is about $270 which is the cheaper of the 2 as well.,4.0 out of 5 stars

34,"Best sound quality I've ever heard on a bluetooth headphone or wired headphones for that matter.  I have own many bluetooth headphones including the Jabra Revo, Plantronics BackBeat Pro, Voxoa, and Velodyne vFree in the past and the AKG K845BT sound signature is the best out of all of them.  I wanted so much to keep these, but a few drawbacks with the AKG K845BT forcing me to send it back.Drawbacks:1.  The bluetooth range is very flaky and not as stable as the Plantronics BackBeat Pro2.  There is no skipping forward/backward on song tracks3.  Not foldable making carrying case choice very limited4.  Doesn't come with a carrying case (at $300 with no carrying case?  Come on AKG, you can do better than that)5.  The cable accessories come with the package seems very cheap like the other reviewer stated earlierIf AKG fixs these issues in future version, I would be willing to give it another shot.",3.0 out of 5 stars

They connect quickly and easily to any source and then reconnect to any source quickly and easily.

44,"The sound quality was very good. The problem was the build quality and bluetooth connectivity. The padding on top of the headband started to come unglued from the mettle band. The bluetooth connectivity was unstable, after watching a movie via my computer I attempted to watch another one only to find that the headphones were no longer connected. I had to reconnect in order to watch something else.  This was not an isolated an incident, every single time I switched from one program to another I had to reconnect.

46,"Seriously, they only way to turn these headphones off is to turn off Bluetooth on your device and let them time out. The buttons are stubby, awkward to use and lack the versatility of a Bluetooth device of this generation. My final complaint is the bass is lacking, I tested this both wired and wireless. Over all the clarity and range of the headphones is excellent if a little quiet. I'm not sure if the European Union forces AKG to limit the max volume output of these headphones but I would love to see what they can really do as it seams low for the size of the drivers. Though when I had them maxed out there was zero distortion. Anyway, it's loud enough to get the job done for commuting or flying but don't expect to DJ with them.The materials they are made out of are awesome, they are light weight, the sizing band works well and holds properly and the ear cups are comfortable and fit perfectly over my ears. There is little or no sound bleed so you can wear them wherever without disturbing those around you. The battery seems to last forever, I have used them so long on one charge that both my phone and my tablet ran out of power before they did. I'm still perplexed by the lack of a physical off switch.",4.0 out of 5 stars

55,The sound quality is great and it's the fullest sound I've head on a wireless set. I had a pair of Sennheiser mm 550-x travel Bluetooth headphones and these blow them out of the water! The bass is rich and the highs are well rounded creating a great all around sound. The noise canceling isn't top of the line but it certainly works. It's a great active noise canceler allowing you to hear when you aren't listening to anything through the headset. A definite great buy!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars

58,"These headphones sound amazing (when using the cord), exactly what you would expect from an AKG with 50mm drivers. However there are three big issues with these:1. When using bluetooth and paired with a mac, there is static (hisses and pops) added to the audio. It is very distracting from the music, and makes the bluetooth almost unusable. Also, the headphones claim to be able to be used as a headset with microphone (they offer up a headset bluetooth profile), however the don't actually work as a mic.2. The paint finish wears off very easily.3. The headphones don't hold a charge well - if fully charged, they will be dead after 1-2 days even if they are off.Based on these issues, you are probably better off ditching the bluetooth functionality and using the K545 (same size) or the K550 / K551 (larger size, slightly better sound).",3.0 out of 5 stars

Unfortunately straight out of the box I discover that the left ear cup gives away a weird noise, turn on the music and there is no sound coming from the left side either.I go back in and read some of the others ratings and soon realize Im far from the only one having this issue. I work on a cruise ship and my options on how to return the item is very limited. Im so F***ING pissed off because not a singel review ever mentioned this issue and after paying close to 300$ for a pair of headphones you expecting to have to deal with this s***.I advice anyone who considering buying a pair of those to turn back around and look for something else... save your self the trouble!",1.0 out of 5 stars
67,"I felt compelled to write this review because there is some misinformation in other reviews. I will try to be as objective as I can when necessary and try to be clear about when I am speaking subjectively.SOUNDI'll start here because most people seem to be agreeing that the sound is great. It does indeed have good clarity for a portable headphone, and the sound does improve slightly via auxiliary cable. I don't believe ""perfect"" sound is necessary with a portable headphones that I plan to use while out and about. I expect outside noise to leak in, I expect to be distracted, I expect the environment will not be ideal. Brilliant sound is for a controlled, quiet environment where you can listed to the subtle details of music (or films) and appreciate them. With that being said, I will reiterate that these AKG's are quite nice to listen to.Some people have mentioned the headphones are not loud. At max volume, they are not ripping my ears off, but they are plenty loud to me. In fact, I never have them on max volume. The volume up/down button on the headphones are separate from your devices volume. In other words, if you change the volume on the AKG's, you will not see the volume level bar on your device change. It is independently a headphones volume. My usually listening is device on max volume, and I control the headphone volume. Hence I have it usually around mid-level at most. Low level if it's quiet environment. Very rarely I have it at high if it's a particularly noisy environment. Just for reference, I have been to way too many shows without earplugs. I know my ears are not as sparkly perfect as they once were.FUNCTIONSHere is where I think there needs some clearing up. The instructions that came with the headphones are poor. The bluetooth is version 3.0. It's not a problem as far as I know even though 4.0 is available. It can only pair with one device at a time. There is a button on the bottom of the right earcup that turns bluetooth ON and OFF. It's a very ideal position for my right thumb. As I put them on, my thumb can hit the button to turn on, as I take them off, I can hit it again to turn BT off. Simple. There is a tone that is different for on and off you will hear. Also a blue light next to the button that blinks relatively slowly when turning on (it pairs with the last device it was paired with), and it will blink rapidly about 3 times when turning off.How to change devices: hold the bluetooth button for a couple seconds and the blue light will start blinking slowly again, it is now searching, so go to your device that you want to pair and find it and pair. While bluetooth is on and paired, the blue light will blink once every 5 seconds or so. I thought this would be distracting while on my head, but it's not. I can't see it at all. The nice thing is, if I take them off, because it continues to blink once every 5 or so seconds, I know it's still on.I've paired it with iPhones, Chromebooks, Macbook Pros, and so on. No problems, hisses, pops, whatever else others say. I have no idea why that would happen. Bluetooth is proprietary technology, it's the same in every device except for the version. If there are problems with a single device, I would look into the devices bluetooth hardware/software to see if there are issues. I've also never had a problem with the pairing dropping off.There is no forward and back buttons as many have mentioned. There is a pause/unpause, volume up, volume down. I never skip songs or podcasts. I just hit play and go on about my day. If I need to change what I'm listening to, I'm usually looking for something specific anyway, so I go to my device. For people who like shuffle play and have short attention spans for music, I can see how a forward/back button would be great. In that case, these headphones are lacking.There is a microphone on the bottom/front of the right ear cup. If you are looking at the headphones from the right side, so the right ear cup is facing directly at you, the mic is around the 4 or 5 o'clock position so it is closer to your mouth. It works just like any other headset for your mobile phone. I believe the clarity when speaking is not the best because I tend to get people saying ""what?"" more often than speaking normally on my phone or using a purpose built hands-free headset. I don't know if that has to do with the quality of the mic or the position or both. It works ok though for the most part.BATTERIESMy experience with the batteries have been great. I've had these headphones for 4 months now. When I got them initially, they had charge in them, I have no idea how much, but I went ahead and charged them up to full. I have in that time only needed to charge it once. When the batteries are low, a red light will blink to warn you and you will hear a tone. I use them almost daily, sometimes a lot, sometimes not much. I try to be good about turning off BT when I'm not using them (see FUNCTIONS section above about how easy it is to do this). Sometimes I forget to turn BT off and I find them still on at the end of the day. Oh well. I've only charged them once in 4 months. I cannot say you will get this battery life if you make heavy use of BT listening on a daily basis. Maybe you will have to charge it every day or every other day. I don't know. I can only tell you my experience.COMFORTThese AKG's lack most in comfort for me. It's their biggest downfall. At this price point, I expect my headphones to be very comfortable. The cups are round as you probably noticed from the pictures. This means that if your ears are a little bigger they will not be completely inside. Ears tend to be bigger up and down, not side to side. So oval shaped ear cups will accommodate a greater variety of physiques like the Bose or Beats headphones for example. The actual driver inside the cup is not at an angle the way Bose and other headphones are. For large reference headphones with thick padding, this can be ok, but the padding on the cups of these AKG's is not super thick, so the back of my ears are pressed against the inside. If you haven't figure it out, my ears are too big for these. I wouldn't say I have huge ears (like another reviewer noted) but probably above average size.The padding, although not super thick as mentioned, would be sufficient if the shape of the cups were oval. They are portable headphones, so I am not expecting the huge padding like reference headphones. Also the padding on the top band feels nice and squishy to the touch, but is not sufficient over long periods of time. My guess is this can generally be a problem for many headphones. I've heard Beats are pretty great in comfort though. The band adjustment is great. There are numbers so you can remember where is most ideal for you if it ever is moved. The cups turn to be flat, and they also turn slightly more than perfectly sideways to mimic the angle of your ears. But this isn't an equal replacement for having the drivers at an angle inside the cup because the cup padding now doesn't sit flat against your head behind your ear.To be clear about this comfort section, I am being quite picky because of the price point. They are probably more comfortable than many other headphones generally. I don't entirely notice the discomfort now because I am used to it, but I really shouldn't at all. I will also add they seem pretty light. I don't feel like there is a brick on my head.ROUNDUPSound:Probably about a 7/10 compared to high end reference headphones if those will generally be around 9-10 range relative to all headphones.For portables I could say these are 9-10/10 given I'm never really listening in an ideal environment anyway.Function:9/10 For simplicity. Lacks forward/back and pairing with multiple devices at the same time. Microphone position or quality can be improved for telephone usage.Comfort:7/10 generally speaking4/10 for this price point.I hope this helps!",4.0 out of 5 stars
68,"So far, not happy with the product.  Tried them wired in and Bluetooth.... They do not go loud AT ALL!!!  My earbuds that cost a fraction of the price blow these away.  These will probably be sent back, very dissatisfied for $249.99.",1.0 out of 5 stars
69,"I got to try these out, and they are great! I had NONE of the issues others are mentioning here. They have that ""wide magical"" AKG sound signature that NO other company at this point offers for BT, were pretty comfortable, look nice, and were easy to use too. BT sounded great, but of course using the wired option meant slightly more clarity & volume.Note: These are over-ear headphones, NOT on-ear.Very highly recommended!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

71,"Simply put if you like the original AKG K550 headphones or the new K545's these basically slide write into the niche between them. The sound quality is exceptional for a Bluetooth headphone. I dont know how AKG and Harmon pulled it off but their honestly is know difference in the sound from the K545's and these. I've owned the K550's for about two years and my fiancé has pretty much claimed them as hers now, so I was looking to upgrade to one the newer K545 or K551 models when these where realesed 2 months ago. I knew I would be traveling in the upcoming months and I had been looking for a Bluetooth headphone exp.(Parrot Zik and Sony MDR BT) when I decided to try out the new K845 BT 's and to my surprise the sound quality from these blows both of those models away. With the fit, finish and build quality basically the same as the K550's and with the added options of being able to attach a cord if the battery gets low, I was sold. Im usually not a white headphone guy but the matte iceberg white and grey metal) accents look absolutely sick and so far they are my best purchase of 2014. np",5.0 out of 5 stars

73,"Plain and simple comparable to the Sony MDR-1RBT and Parrot Zik wireless bluetooth headphones the sound quality of the AKG K845BT's blows them away. The Logitec UE9000 would be the only current wireless bluetooth headphones that are equal to the sound quality of the K845's. Both headphones sound equal to their brands wired counter part. If you know the history of AKG's headphone line these fall right in place between the K550's, K551's and the new K545's which are basically the wired version of this model. I highly recommend theses headphones if you get a chance to check them out in the Bestbuy Magnolia store you will pleasantly surprised.  The only flaw which is not a major one sincecthe headphones stay charged for a good 9-10 hours on continued use. Is that their is not an active off switch once the headphones are fully charged.  However once you unpair them from your device or plug in one of the Android or Apple included wires the Bluetooth functions do finally cut off. But to me that is a small price to pay to have a bluetooth headphone that sounds better than most of the wired headphones in its price range plus you can use them wired as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
74,"10.21.2016I ordered this again after I lost it because I loved it.When I got it and tried to listen music, I could hear buzzing noise.I don't remember there is noise before(probably not) so, I returned it and ordered it again.However, this one had same noise. I tried to listen other songs, but the result was same.I had to return and orderd it again. I really hope to not hear noises again... But.. this also has buzzing noise.Even the last one seems not new one. The box case's tape was opened.It makes me crazy. I got stress because of it.But I am not going to give up. I'm going to return and order it one more time.I hope to get a certain new one that doesn't have buzzing noise at this time.10.23.2016I ordered two more this headphone and I will return it again because these have same noise problem and uneven shape on both sides sponges.Also, some finger print on them too, so I doubt whether those are new.Now, I am getting tired to get the headphone doesn't have noise problem as I got before.",2.0 out of 5 stars
75,"I have to go with the ""I don't like it"" star rating for these. I've had them for 6 months now. The red light remains on forever. The bluetooth won't connect to my laptop anymore (it used to). They don't connect to the PS4 (never did but harman support said something about ""future update on the way""). The battery life is really short, or maybe mine are just lemons. When I was using them I usually ended up completely wired with cords coming from both ears, the power cable and the 3.5mm.GOOD:Every review raves about how good these are so there's not much more to say. The build quality is my favorite part.BAD:Bluetooth only connects to my iPhone 5 and nothing else anymore.The battery life sucks.There's no reset button.There's no software to tweak or help troubleshoot.The band over the top can be uncomfortable.For this price I expect more. If I'd stayed with a wired headset I'd be happier.",2.0 out of 5 stars

77,"These are a great set of headphones for use at work. I found them very comfortable, I can code all day with these on. Sound is excellent, and works really well with a mobile phone (as you'd expect). I actually preferred the sound quality when using Bluetooth rather than the cable. Battery life is awesome - lasting we about a week of daily use at work. No sound leakage at all. You won't bother anyone with these.BUT - The Bluetooth decoding died in one side of the headphones after about the 3rd recharge.  I am about to return mine and get a set of Sennheiser Momentum 2 Bluetooth headphones as my supplier (not Amazon) couldn't get me another set. It's probably just a bad set, but I thought people should know. I got mine for £150, so they were a bit of a bargain.",4.0 out of 5 stars

79,"Purchased my AKG845's(in white) a few weeks ago and now that they are broken in, I want to say how great they are. Especially when you consider they are wireless and sound every bit as the best wired headphones I've tried.The Sound,Overall well balanced headphones that despite being closed back, seem quite airy. They have a slightly accented, tight bass. The mids are, as with most AKG products, smooth and expressive. The highs are very clean and crisp. These are a very well rounded set of cans that have studio quality sound which are perfect for home use and yet, are  just small enough to travel well.The Tech.The Bluetooth pairs very well with my both my Blackberry Z10 and Playbook. As well, these paired easily with a freinds I-phone and my Nolan home stereo/BT adaptor. All the on-the-ear controls worked with each device. I am getting between 8 - 10 hours of battery life from a 2 hour full charge.There is not much to dislike about these and I highly reccomend the AKG K845BT.In reading some of the other reviews, I have to say that this... There is an off switch(it's the bluetooth button). These are one of the most comfortable cans I have ever worn. Sony MDR-1RBT's don't even come close to the sound quality of these. The paint has not worn off on mine(and I wear mine all the time and often take them on business trips) nor 3 of my buddies who also own them.Art",5.0 out of 5 stars

82,"I was completely floored by the sound of these headphones.I wouldn't say I'm an audiophile, but I've got good ears.  I'm an amateur musician and music lover.  I own several pairs of headphones and typically prefer Sennheisers.  I've got a pair of HD238s, HD580s, I have some decent JBL earbuds, and I use ATHM50xs for recording.  I listened to a pair of Sony bluetooth headphones that run about $100 more than these - I don't recall the model #.  My buddy had a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 bluetooth phones that I liked (several hundred dollars more than these AKGs).  The only phones that I believe sound objectively better than these are the HD580s.I have had discouraging experiences with bluetooth audio.  I'm not sure how they did it, but these are on par with, or better than wired headphones costing significantly more.  These are closed phones, so the soundstage isn't huge, but it does not sound constricted.  The sound isn't super flat and accurate; actually it is colored - especially in the bass range.  These are a bit bass heavy, but not annoyingly so.  Bass frequencies are warm and focused.  It sounds like there is a slight bump in the upper midrange/low treble - like a bit of presence has been added.  The overall effect is a mix that is vibrant and engaging.  They are never muddy, and instruments are easily resolved.  Listening is a real pleasure.They appear well made, and fit and finish is impressive.  Clamping force is nominal.  The pads are very soft and comfortable.  They stay on my head if I move around, but I couldn't go running with them.  I wouldn't do that with these anyway - I would feel like I'm treating them too harshly.  I haven't worn them for more than an hour or two so far, but I've had no issues with fatigue.  I'm curious to see how my ears feel after wearing them at work all day.  I've yet to find a pair of phones that live up to that challenge.I should add that upon first opening them I charged fully.  They wouldn't turn on at first...I feared the worst and thought they were DOA.  However, pressing on a variety of buttons woke them up somehow and I haven't had any problems since.I'm definitely really happy with these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
83,"Very happy with the AKG Y50BT. I like the clarity, battery life, weight and of the feel of the product. The Bluetooth range surprised me.

That's awesome considering there were several walls.",5.0 out of 5 stars
84,"Headphones, needs:Privacy so I could listen to music or have telephone conversations over the cellular network without my immediate neighbor hearing the voice of the people. This is especially true during a card game where we have 6 to ten people sitting at one table.Block sounds in my environment ... especially subways, cars and sirens. Many modern headphones I read reviews for did this both physically (with thick pads that seal the wearer's ear canals from outside noise) AND electronically.Finally, twenty hours of battery life so I am not running out at the end of the day, and a cable for those times I don't mind being tethered.The three best units that fulfill these requirements are these:Bose QuietComfort 35 (https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B01E3SNO1G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483854780&sr=8-1&keywords=bose+comfort+35) at $350 with great looks, perhaps the best noise cancelling in it's class until recently, and superior comfort.Sennheiser PXC 550 (https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PXC-550-Wireless-Bluetooth/dp/B01E3XLNA0/ref=pd_sim_23_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01E3XLNA0&pd_rd_r=W7PDJ23B2Y7KKRAM1ZB8&pd_rd_w=cdzB6&pd_rd_wg=3PCup&psc=1&refRID=W7PDJ23B2Y7KKRAM1ZB8) $400 for a set from a company known best for excellent sound quality, these have been regarded as best in class sound quality, but bested by the Bose in comfort and noise cancelling until:Sony 1000x (https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Headphone-MDR1000X/dp/B01KHZ4ZYY/ref=pd_sbs_23_2?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01KHZ4ZYY&pd_rd_r=8MEZSZBMAQA6FQ3Z8NZ9&pd_rd_w=i5bpQ&pd_rd_wg=BcDtd&psc=1&refRID=8MEZSZBMAQA6FQ3Z8NZ9) came out also at $400. It's close, but the consensus seems to be that the Sony has much better noise cancelling and perhaps even better comfort than the Bose, and better sound even than the Sennheisers.All of these models have very good to best in class noise cancellation according to a wide variety of reviews. The AKG's rely entirely on physical isolation rather than digitally constructed noise cancellation. The result is if the AKG's are your choice, you are at the mercy of your environment.However, the sound of the AKG's is superior to both the Bose 35 and the Sony 1000x (the Sony is considered by most to be best in class sound wise) in my opinion. And, if I didn't mention it, at less than half the price.At $150, the sound from these is surprisingly outstanding. Solid bass that doesn't overwhelm the mids, an open high end that doesn't grate, and a open soundstage that is sufficiently large to present an accurate sonic portrait of the musicians and their locations.So the compromise? No electrnoic noise cancelling. To reduce (and not eliminate as the other options mostly do) day to day noise, the AKGs rely entirely on thick ON EAR (not over ear) pads and strong but comfortable pressure.I'm happy. Is the extra money worth the better noise cancelling? I think not, but given that idigital noise cancelling allows one to keep levels down and ear drums intact, I would if the AKG's SOUND wasn't such a winner.Tinnitus (sic) is real, and a real problem as one ages, so do what you can in early life to reduce the risk of middle age hearing loss.I find the Grado SR 60e -- at $80 --(https://www.amazon.com/Grado-SR60e-Headphones/dp/B00KYTNU9U/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1483856913&sr=1-1&keywords=grado+sr+60e)are a better overall value and I prefer their sound to all of the others. They have an open back design that has the advantage of a much larger soundstage. Implemented properly, and these are, the sound is completely immersive and listening to these is effortless.Even for your neighbor, which is the downside ... these have zero sound isolation. Hence my decision  to buy the AKG wireless, sealed headphones for travelling about and out. And a little added bass too!",5.0 out of 5 stars
85,"AKG BlueTooth Headphones ROCK!!!  I got a pair of these in a promotional deal when I purchased the new SamSung Galaxy 8 smartphone.  It came with a bundle of the VR Headset and 256GB memory card.  At first I was skeptical of the quality being good enough for real music listening and considered them just a part of a VR gaming system.  However, after growing up on Sennheiser  audiophile headphones and enjoying B&O cans for years I was shocked at the musical reproduction of these headphones.  They rock my tunes at the gym during my workout on Pandora and have a great tight bass response and crisp, clear highs.  Very loud when you turn them all the way up without distorting and breaking up the bass.  Battery life is extremely good.  I've never run out of battery despite hours of gaming with them and not recharging.  I would say the claims of 15 hour battery life are probably spot on.  I generally just plug them in to charge after a few trips to the gym or playing VR games.  Once I discovered how good they were, my girlfriend had wanted a pair of BEATS for her to wear at the gym, I bought her this silver colored pair for her birthday instead.. She Loves Them!!!  I just don't see the value in spending a extra $150 for BEATS when these headphones sound just as good and offer superior battery life.  They look very cool in black (my pair) or this silver (girlfriend's pair) with the ghost lettering of ""AKG"" on the cans.  Bluetooth range is 30 feet with no breakup using my Samsung Galaxy S8.  Pairing is easy and the volume buttons synch with your phone's volume control.  One button turns them on/off and one button answers/hangs up phone calls.  These headphones are Super Cool!!  I took away a ""star"" because one of the ear pieces came off from use.  It wasn't a big deal to replace, though, it shouldn't just detach itself under normal wear.  Also, they don't have noise cancellation, but, spend about a $100 more and AKG makes a pair that does.Overall, for the money, I don't think you can buy another pair of bluetooth headphones with this quality construction, sound quality, and features for less than $150.  I like the looks of them far better than the BEATS I see others wearing and the battery life is Amazing to me.  The headphones are very comfortable to wear for extended periods with no discomfort to my ears or head after more than an hour at a time.  If I were to buy another pair I would get the noise cancellation only because I think they would be great to wear on a plane.  But, otherwise, I can't think of a single thing I would do to improve these headphones.  AKG BlueTooth Headphones ROCK!!!",4.0 out of 5 stars
86,"I work from a home office and have used a pair of Logitech USB headphones to conduct phone calls via VOIP and listen to music while I work. I travel frequently and my poor seven-year-old Logitech's were completely broken down.First, the good:  the sound from the AKG's is fabulous and although retailing at $150, I bought mine on Amazon for $74.Now, the not-so-good:  the on/off button is between the two cans when they are folded together for storage, so during my first real work use they ran out of juice after about 20 minutes while on an important client-proposal phone call. AKG designers could have placed this button just about anywhere else and it would have been better. The other drawback is a positive feature, depending upon how you look at it. The on-ear design does a great job of sealing outside noises (passive noise cancelling, if you will), which is an advantage while listening to music.  While speaking on the phone however, it provides a sensation like talking with your fingers in your ears. Now, I'm sure this is something I will get used to or perhaps I will talk less and listen more. I know many people who would have bought these for me ten years ago if they knew it would have that kind of impact.",4.0 out of 5 stars
87,"UPDATE: I've just downgraded my review to 2 stars. After a year of using these, one of the ear cups has fallen apart. I'm stunned that they couldn't withstand the same treatment that my previous AKG headphones endured, and now, instead of replacing a wire, I have replace the entire unit.I've had these headphones for 8+ months and I've been very satisfied with them. In that time, I've used them almost every day either at home or at work. My main uses are for music, either connected to a Mac or an iPhone, and occasionally for streaming video. I purchased them to replace a pair of AKG K450s that I loved, but was tired of replacing the cables for. (I'll make a lot of comparisons to my previous wired headphones through this review.)While the sound has not been as good as the K450, it's been good enough. The Bluetooth audio's biggest issue for me is that it favours the low end. It seems to be an issue with the BT audio, as the sound of these is brighter and closer to the character of the K450s when the bypass cable is plugged in. I'm not an audiophile, and listen mostly to high quality compressed music, but I spend a lot of time listening and have been able to enjoy my music with these. (Maybe not as much as with the K450, but ah well.) When using them to watch video, the syncing may not be exact, but it's close enough for casual viewing.Compared to other Bluetooth headphones I'd tried, these were the most comfortable. Understandably heavier than the K450, but just as compact. They sit fairly gently on my head, and I don't feel much pressure against my ears.I think I can usually get between 8-10 hours of listening per charge. Unfortunately, this leads me to my biggest issue with them: you cannot use them wirelessly while the USB charging cable is plugged in. Which means that once the battery dies, you have to choose between continuing to listen with the bypass cable, taking them off and charging them, or wearing them with two cables connected. I'd previously used a pair of Bluetooth headphones that allowed for listening during USB charging, so this was quite disappointing, and the biggest reason why they don't get 4 stars from me.Another minor design complaint is that unlike the K450s, these have mesh over the speaker hole in the cup, and sometimes you can hear that mesh rubbing against your skin and hair.Overall, if you're not looking for audiophile perfection (which I don't think you can yet find in wireless anyway), and like me, you're tired of replacing headphone cables, the AKG Y45s are a good, solid option for on-the-ear Bluetooth headphones. I have no regrets about buying these, despite some annoyances. I can't quite bring myself to give them 4 stars, but I'd give them 3.5 if I could.",2.0 out of 5 stars
88,For  a bluetooth stereo headset this one is fantastic.  Hubby is an audiophile nut job and I can't begin to state how much money he has spent on 'cans' over the years.

89,"I usually use a pair of grado SR-60s at home which I love and think are well balanced for my taste music I like (indie, classical, 60s soul, some IDM). Those don't work for the office because of the open air design, so I use Standard apple earbuds. At first seems these seemed overly bassy and a little muddy, but after a couple of days realized I was probably used to tinny Apple earbuds, and pairs really fast with iPhone 6 iOS10, all button gestures work well. Everyone has already mentioned that these sound good, so I will mention that they block sound in my office well (half the reason I got them). They are a little heavy but I got used to that quickly. Battery is still going after the first charge 3 days ago. Bag is neoprene. When used with included cord, sound the same to my ears. I tried a pair of $400 Bluetooth Beats at target and really don't think they could be worth the extra $280, especially because the music most people listen to is probably compressed anyway. My only negative is that they don't fold much for being foldable, and if they lie flat around your neck, the speakers point up which is distracting if taking them off for a quick conversation. The power button is also easy to hit when folding for storage. These are minor complaints. Considering most reputable brand BT headphones are $70-100, at $119 these seem like a nice step up from overly bassy Skullcandy and a much cheaper option than Beats.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The quality of the of the headphones sound is awesome! The frequency range is  amazing. Unlike many other headphone, where the low frequencies are  artificially amplified, so the ""bass"" sounds strong, here with the AKG Y45BT, the low frequencies are NOT too loud but CRISP. Other famous brand name sells a similar headphones for a price twice higher. The extra charge in this case is for its name only, not for the compared quality of sound and specifications.

106,"Great sound, connects easily to Bluetooth and the battery last for a full day of use easily.I am only giving it 4 stars because the wired cable that comes with it to connect to your device is not the standard.  The end that connects to the headset is unique so you can't just use any 3.5mm cable you have lying around or buy any type from a shop.If you only need it for Bluetooth connection, then it will suit your purpose. But if you also wish to listen via the wired cable or if the battery is dead and you are not in a position to charge it, you need to be aware that you can't use any type of 3.5mm cable.Charging is also quick and you can also charge with a portable charger when out and about.",4.0 out of 5 stars

117,"I'm totally amazed at the sound quality of these headphones.  I do hear a slight hiss which I believe to be coming from the amp in the headphone when it gets a signal from the phone and activates, but the overall sound quality is clean and crisp, with clear detailed sound through out the range, can't really say that it sounds forward or heavy to any degree.  I'd call the sound neutral but dynamic, and not so much that the bass is over done, but think of it like a system where you have large woofers, and even bigger subwoofers, however, these are tuned, so the bass has impact, but it's not boomy/bloomy, it goes deep with detail/texture.  I wasn't expecting sound like this, and again it's so clean over Bluetooth, I use these with my phone, my desktop and two laptops, and all of them are in sync when watching videos, so no BT lag, or it's minimal enough to be a non-issue.  I believe that for this reason, they work really well with Gear VR (they advise that you use wired headphones).  I got these for $119 or so, and they're worth every penny.",5.0 out of 5 stars

128,"This is my first set of bluetooth headphones and I love em. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I do like clear sounding headphones that balance out the range of tones well. The bass feels hefty and the voices clear - the sound is very well balanced overall(especially for it's size and pricetag). I've owned a pair of V-Moda crossfades and while this doesn't reach that level of clarity and depth, it's half the price and doesn't make me feel like I have a pair of weights on my ears.I was hesitant at first because I've only owned over the ear headphones before and didn't know if I would like the fit of on the ear headphones. But in the end, I like these better than the V-Moda set as far as comfort and wearability goes. It's something that I can take pretty much anywhere I go and don't feel I have to watch over it like an overprotective parent.I haven't run into any troubles with the bluetooth as far as pairing goes(I've used it with my iphone, my macbook. and a surface pro no problem). The range of it is about 20-30 feet and works well between rooms. As far as the fit they're pretty snug - I haven't had them fall off accidentally once. But I haven't done any strenuous activities like jogging or bootcamp with it, but for everyday use it works just fine and I'm sure I could wear them around the gym as long as I'm not jumping around a lot. Would highly recommend",5.0 out of 5 stars

156,"First off let me say that I really love these headphones even though they do have a couple of catches. First as other have said they are a little on the heavy side, not so heavy that they will make your head sore but you will definitely know they are on your head when your are moving around. The second, which I'm not sure is the headphones fault or my devices, but the audio play back can be choppy sometimes. I have found a fix for this on my computers, you simply have to reset the Bluetooth module then reconnect the headphones. After doing so I don't have any of the choppy audio or hissing. You can do this on a mac by holding down option+shift and then clicking on the Bluetooth icon in the task bar, going to debug and then reset Bluetooth module. On my windows computer I don't have this issue with Bluetooth. Besides these two issues the headphones have amazing sound and the battery usually lasts around 22 to 23 hours, or four days of casual use. I would recommend them to anyone unless you plan to use them while exercising, in which case I would look for something a little lighter.",5.0 out of 5 stars
157,"Good sound.  Two annoying reasons for the 2 stars:1.  When the battery is about 20% low, it will beep every minute.

160,"You hear the trap sounds from drummer Harvey Mason, those little incidental noises he makes as he moves around his kit in Herbie Hancock's Chameleon. You also pick out the hammer strikes as Esbjorn Svensson plays piano with his trio in From Gagarin's Point of View.The Y50BT 'phones put you in the control room with the engineer, listening to studio performances as the musicians lay them down.They reveal all the drum trap and piano hammer sounds, plus everything else, very cleanly. And they have very balanced bass, realistically present without thumping the heck out of me. Mids and treble are balanced too.I'm perhaps a bit pickier than many people, having been a professional keyboard player and the guy who fixed the band's sound system in my younger years. I also did my share of studio recording in those days, and I've written and produced scores for my own documentaries more recently.Y50BT headphones may lack the convenience bells and whistles of other Bluetooth 'phones, but I'll take their good sound every time.",5.0 out of 5 stars

165,"These headphones are surprising. I'm going to do a comprehensive review on them since there is probably a lot of interest from the Samsung Pre Order.Design :Design is nice. The headphones are plastic which I don't mind, and fit very comfortably on the ear. There is nothing uncomfortable about them when you wear you can wear for hours. However if you're going out for a walk or something these may be a bit bulky and awkward to wear out but then again that's style related. I usually feel odd wearing more than earbuds when I'm out and about. I'm disappointed they use micro usb. Anything new and premium should have USB C and it should have the port covered. I've written many head phone reviews in my day and the open charging port always annoys me as it cuts the life of the cans short. It does have a bypass cord and so the cans can be used blue tooth free which is always nice. I sure love having a headphone jack.Sound:I'm giving these a 7 out of ten for the price range. They are clearly bass oriented and that annoys my inner purist. I saw people complaining it needed even more bass. People, let the studios mix the songs k? The mids can get washed out a bit but that's nothing a good equalizer can't fix and the highs and mids and lows are pretty evenly proportioned considered the low end tuning. I think for most people these will be sufficient boom unless they literally just think ear rattling means quality.Volume on these depends on what you're using. They're moderately set up for hi fi so don't expect much of you're streaming Pandora. You may need to get some losses audio or try a higher fi streaming service like Tidal. You will get a much fuller louder sound if youre actually listening to lossless. That's why sources are important. It works with Pandora but it will be weak and you didn't get these bad boys to listen to A Thousand Years right? So download some lossless. You know you want too. They really perform well with the hi fi source material.Battery Life :Battery life is decent. It could be a bit better, but it gets the job done. Depends on end user usage. The bypass cable will make sure you won't end up having to talk to anyone on the bus though.What You Need To Know:Akg is a reputable brand but it does tune closer to the low end. These have a great sound with lossless audio. Charge them carefully. They also come with a bag. For the price they are a pretty good deal and are more for beginner base heads. If you're purchasing out of pocket you may want to see what else is out there first, but if you want reputable blue tooth cans now than this might be your jam. I don't think you'd regret the purchase, but there are a lot more headphones in the sea at this price range.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I am not an audiophile, but I know what sounds good. These sound great. Remember to push the on button only once instead of what I did and hold it down. You can hear the ""on"" and ""off"" beeps.

170,"My best sounding headphones by far are the AKG Y50BT, which came with the $99 Samsung promotion.  Their frequency response curves are sick; basically flat across with accents just where you want them.  Such excellent lows, and balanced very well.  Mid - excellent.  Highs - excellent.  Way, way better that 20hz to 20khz would suggest.  But I can't wear them long.  They're not uncomfortable.  I can wear them longer than other non in-ear headphones.  I actually thought they were light when I first tried them.  But I can't tolerate non-earbud headphones very long.Useful headphone reviews need comparison.  The Samsung AKG OEM in-ear, Advanced Model 3, and AKG Y50BT are my 3 go-to high-fidelity headphones.  I get different things from each, and each are brilliant in their own way.I love the Model 3s, but these beat them in every category except comfort.That said, Model 3s have a powerful low end and high highs (on part with in-ear AKGs),  They're convertible wired to wireless.  Sub is almost too powerful, which can mask the bass on some songs, but they're otherwise pretty well balanced.  Soundstage is not as open as AKG in-ear, but bring a different dimension in hi-fidelity sound.  They sound like high-end monitors when you get a good ear bud fit (silicone works much better than foam for me).  And they're bluetooth which frees me when doing chores where the cord doesn't snag every few minutes.I also want to acknowledge how excellent the Galaxy S8+ original AKG in-ear buds are!  Excellently balanced with a nice low end and excellent high end (I can't distinguish highs from these AKG Y50BTs), beautifully engaging and open sound stage, no fuss fit, great sound seal without being isolating, anti-tangle cord... I could go on and on.  The in-ear AKG's are so good and very underrated, despite their decent reviews.Still, AKG Y50BTs are better in almost every category except comfort and soundstage (openness).  $130 is a very fair price for the sound you get.",5.0 out of 5 stars
171,"Ive  got about 15 pair of headphones ranging from Bose soundlink on ear headphones to Polk hinge to  Jbl50s , Monster Adidas ,Sol Republicmaster tracks, Airfi . Id say my favorite is the Adidas for over the ear. Better base and nice tone. The Akg is my favorite on ear the highs are clear and not exaggerated like the Republic sols the Bose on ears are one of my least favorite headphones, I  prefer the Polk hinge even over the Bose soundlink. The most interesting comparison to me is the Jbl 50s  and the Akgs i think the sound is very close with the highs being better on the Akgs where the base is better on the Jbls. Though i will prolly usually the Akgs more because they are much more comfortable then the Jbls,Though im betting anyone that has the Jbls 700 elites wouldnt touch the Akgs.. I paid 58 dollars for my Akg y50s. So im not sure compairing them to a 300 dollar pair of headphones is fair, The build quality seems good in a world of plastics. Id still like to get some Sennheisers hd 4.50 bluetooth, but until i do when Im out and about my Akgs will have to do and at home my Monster Adidas.

My only complaint would be that when you fold the earpieces in two-story the headphones in the bag that they come with, it has a tendency to have its power button hit by the opposite your phone. It's never really run down my battery, but it is Annoying when I noticed that I'm not getting any notifications on my phone because all the sound is going to the headphones. That's the reason for only giving it four stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars

174,"I received my set in a Samsung Promo.  That said, I probably wouldn't have spent $130+ simply because I tend toward wireless earbuds or wired over-the-ear headsets.  This has been an interesting combination.First off, coming from someone who hates the on-ear feeling, these are pretty comfortable, even over longish periods.  If you are okay with that kind, these would probably do great for you.Wired and wireless quality seem pretty close, the signal is also very strong for bt 3.0.Battery life - I've never had any issues with the battery life or charging time.The only issue I have (and I'd ding about half a star) is the EXCESSIVELY aggressive connection.  The location of the power button leaves it prone to turn itself on should it get jostled.  When on, it will connect to a device in range and hold the connection.  If you disconnect it from the device, it will forcibly reconnect itself in a minute or two, overriding any other connection.  The only way to stop it is to un-pair it, or actually turn them off.  This is a major problem for myself as I typically keep them packed with my laptop and are usually nearby, and regularly I have my phone hijacked from use with my earbuds or car.AKG - move the power button or make the headphones let go when they are forcibly disconnected in future versions.  This is absolutely my only complaint.",5.0 out of 5 stars
175,"So, I hardly paid anything for these thanks to the Samsung dream bundle for preordering my Galaxy s8. They are absolutely fantastic. The earcups and headband are metal and don't feel like those cheap...ahem; Apple-owned competitors! Now for the sound. It took a couple hours at higher volume, but I think they are finally settling in. They sound really clear, despite being wireless. Yes, they also hit pretty hard with deep, pronounced, not overpowering bass. Just all-around great sound for any genre of music. I can't even tell they're bluetooth: no compression nuances or annoying pinging, like some older Sony's and Phillips I have owned. The only downside I can find are they make my ears hot due to the enclosed earcups design. But, small price to pay for really good sound. I think the full price here is right on par with how they sound. I'm now curious about how some other AKGs stack up against my Sennheiser gaming headset.

179,"Just bought these the other day. If the battery claims are true, this is probably one of the best on-the-go Bluetooth headphones. I'm a huge fan of AKG's to begin with, so I'm familiar with their quality. The response is pretty flat, which is good compared to the bass heavy options from Beats. You're still able to get these bumping, but when songs don't have heavy bass or if you're watching a movie, you want a true reference of the sound, not an overly equalized, bass heavy monitor.The fit is very comfortable and even with my big noggin, they don't look dinky. The cup fits on the ear and has a snug tension around the head to keep them in place.

At night, listening to music in bed, there is no wire to worry about. I can have my phone in the charger and listen to my music, wire free.They come with a nice ""case"" to carry them in, along with the charging cable and a cable you use with a non-bluetooth music player.The left side has the charging port. The right side has the on/off, pairing, and volume buttons along with the port for the 2.5mm cable. These are lightweight which I really appreciate!  Other headphones we have feel so heavy and bulky.My headphones are the white & gold and they are very classy looking! I love the color!!

The highs and lows on this sound amazing as well as the bass is pretty good and not overbearing. I see why Samsung chose this brand as they are high quality.",5.0 out of 5 stars
187,"AKG, a is a company known for premium microphones and headphones. It is an Austrian company that has expanded internationally over the decades. So these AKG Y45 headphones have a heritage from a company that knows good sound. When I received these for review, I was anxious to try this on-the-ear design. My previous headphone experiences involved over the ear (Beyerdynamic DT-990 Pro) headphones, inner ear monitors (Ultimate Ear Triple-Fi 10 Pro), and Apple ear buds.The packaging of these headphones is admirable. They are nicely boxed and include all cables and a zippered cloth pouch. There was no manual included, other than a quick start sheet. The controls and features are straightforward, so an in-depth manual is not required for most. Nowhere could I find where these phones were made. The materials are upscale and possibly they are assembled in China, but that is just my guess.The phones themselves are impressive. These are not cheap plastic phones. The headband surfaces are nicely padded along the surface that touches the head. The upper surface is a soft touch rubber. The ear pads feel like soft leather. The cups adjust on metal bands that pull down from the upper unit.The controls are reasonably laid out. When the phones are on your head, it is easy to find the volume +/- buttons, and the raised button between them. This button will pause the music being played. When paired with my iPod Touch, holding this button down invokes Siri. There is one other button placed lower on the right cup that will initiate pairing with your bluetooth device. Also, is you hold the volume + button down, the volume increases and then beeps when it hits the maximum volume.If you don’t want to use bluetooth with this headset, you have the option to use the provided bypass cord to plug the phones into the headphone plug on your device.Besides the intelligent layout of the controls, the phones have gimbaled cups that rotate and angle to fit the head comfortably. They can fold to a very compact form that fits well in the carry pouch. These are nice phones to take on a trip. Nothing feels cheap about them. But, how do they sound?I listened to these phones for hours, trying to pin down a good description of the sound I heard. The first impression I got was how deep the bass extended. The specs say list a range of 17hz up to 20000hz. 17hz is below the threshold of human hearing, so I don’t see the wisdom in claiming this spec. Let’s just say, if you like to hear the deep bass tones of your music, these phones will deliver. Moving on up to the midrange, I was impressed with the presence and warmth of vocals. The only criticism is the bass sometimes effected the lower registers of female voices; bothers me, but probably not an issue for many. I didn't felt that this was boomy, artificial bass, but it was pronounced.Now, the upper range of frequencies. Here, the phones rolled off the higher frequencies where they sounded restrained. The sound was there but lacked a crispness and definition that is so important in defining the character of many instruments. You could not experience the hissing of cymbals, or thwack of a snare drum. Also, the harmonics of bells and triangles were limited in range.With that said, if I turned the volume up, the overall result was rich and satisfying sound, albeit lacking accuracy.  I found I could listen comfortably to many different types of music. The fact that these are bluetooth phones means you don’t have to be tethered to your music source. For many, this may be a great feature. The range of these phones is good, and I was able to walk around the main floor of the house without much interference.  AKG markets these phones to appeal to the fashion sense of wearers who want to ‘make heads turn while you make a powerful statement’. If you are an audiophile who wants neutral, accurate sound, then look further.",3.0 out of 5 stars
188,"I previously thought I would not like on-ear headphones, but having tried a few pair recently I have changed my mind.  Love how small and compact they are, light enough to not feel anything, and really the ear discomfort I thought I would have has not really shown up.  Bluetooth is also great because it removes the need for cords, connects easily, lets you control your device, even use it as a mic.I recently got a pair of Bose Soundlink Bluetooth headphones as well, which are very similar to these albeit for a $100 increase in price.  This is what I will be comparing these to for most of the review.- Sound: These sound great, a tiny hiss when the audio starts from my phone, but this is the same I hear in all bluetooth headphones.  AKG is a good quality brand, usually with an emphasis on sound, and this shows here.- Build: Lots of metal, ear cups rotate all the way flat to make these super easy to store. Ear cups themselves are quite dense and hard right now, but I have a feeling they will break in nicely.- Comfort: Not as great as the Bose, mostly due to the hard ear cups and smaller head band.- Buttons: I hate these buttons.  The on/off switch is not a slider, it's a button you have to press, and of course when you are wearing them you have no clue if you are hitting the button correctly, but the beeps that are sounded don't clearly communicate what it is doing.  If you take them off you will see there is a red light that turns on.  The volume up/down and play/pause/etc buttons are near impossible to locate easily, and even when you do it's really hard to tell which one you are using.  The Bose are a mile ahead in this regard, tactile buttons, super simple didn't even have to think.  These are incredibly frustrating, enough to drop a star even if they are quite a bit cheaper.- Audio Alerts: Just beeps, and not different tons, just a few beeps for on and a few for off.  No clue about battery life, or what it connected to, etc.  The Bose shine in this regard, telling you battery life via audio, what you are connected to, what it is doing (i.e. trying to reconnect), etc.Overall they are great, but I can't get over how bad the usability on the buttons are, that small change would make these so much better for me to use.",4.0 out of 5 stars

190,"This is a smart little set of headphones with very good sound. While I prefer an ""around-the-ear"" set, there are some advantages to this type (weight, comfort, etc.) that give the user options which might not be available otherwise. Most other sets do not have a volume control on-board, an on/off switch, and the added wireless or wired options make this set superior (in it's technology) to my favorite pair of all time (Klipsch Image ONE Premium On-Ear Earphones).Sound: These have a very good sound quality in both high and mid-range, with solid bass tones (bass being one of the biggest areas most smaller headphones lose out on). Compared to the Klipsch set, I'd say these are a close second with some clarity over that pair added when the set is wireless. Hard to describe, but the signal seems more immediate and there is a very clear separation of instruments and crisp details emerge that get somewhat muffled on other pairs. I listened to Stevie Wonder's ""Songs in the Key of Life"" and heard things I had not heard previously on one of his most lush productions, for instance.Signal: I had a clear signal everywhere in my mid-sized ranch house. However, when I opened the garage entrance, things got sketchy.  According to the Bluetooth.com website: ""Bluetooth technology sends information within your Personal Area Network or PAN (aka your own personal space) at distances up to 100 meters (328 feet).""  This set of headphones does not get close to that measurement, I'd say the signal broke up at about 48 feet or so. Not bad for just being in the house and wanting wireless technology, but you aren't going to be able to mow the grass or work in your yard without some trouble.Comfort: This pair is OK, not horrible, not great. Compared to the Klipsch set, they aren't nearly as comfortable and didn't behave themselves nearly as well. There seemed to be a weight problem on the top band, no matter how I adjusted the tightness, it seemed to flop down when I bent over. I wore these for about 2 hours with no negative physical effects, however. Not too hot around the ear, no headache from being squeezed. I think you could do basic work with them, but probably not dance or exercise vigorously.This set comes with both a re-charge USB cable and a bypass cable for a direct signal. Also a nice carrying case for travel.For the price and the built-in technology, this is a solid set of headphones that I would recommend for around the house when you need wireless sound. Four stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars
191,"REALLY GOOD headphones!!  Sound is good and crisp.  Keep in mind if you have a smartphone that does 32 bit sound, you will have to use the by-pass cord to get that quality but wireless still has good sound if you use the equalizer correctly.  Sound Sync combines both smartphone volume & headset volume so there is only ONE volume control that you can use.

192,"I have years of experience with AKG products. I love my K240 headphones and have owned various AKG microphones for use in recording studios. I love the clarity of their products.These headphones, however, have me wondering who designed them. It's strange, I auditioned (and purchased) them at the Harman store in Manhattan and they sounded fine. The pair I have, however, has two serious problems:1) The are uncomfortable after only a few minutes as they have a strong clamping force2) My unit sounds *awful*. There is a really nasty distortion component somewhere in the 1Khz range that sounds like fingernails on a blackboard. it ruins violins, female vocals, anything with lots of overtones. I've tried both the wireless and wired configurations and it makes no difference.",1.0 out of 5 stars

195,"First of all, the design is just beautiful. The overall size is not too big, but rather small, and it fits perfect on my small head. And because of the small form factor, it doesn't slide down from my head when I move around. It was also perfect when walking/jogging on the street. I wore this headphone for a couple of hours to see if I felt any discomfort or ache on my ears and head. This headphone is the most comfortable one I've ever tried. This headphone is small, but the tension around my ears and head is just enough to hang strong to  avoid sliding. The ear pads are very soft, cushiony and leather-ish, and they didn't irritate my ears at all. ( No aches, pinches, or uncomfortable and noticeable rings around my ears were present.) My set is white and light brown colored, and I love the natural color combination of this. It doesn't look cheap; it looks luxurious and very stylish. This is the headphone I can wear anywhere I want, and I don't feel embarrassed by the look of it (I have owned some far too stylish headsets before, but this one is perfect!). If you look into other headphones, believe or not, some are really ugly and some are just uggggh. I liked Beats headphones because they kind of pioneered the design side of the headphone business. Now with this Y45BT headphone in my hands, I think AKG fine tuned the highly well-designed headphone design.Secondly, let's discuss the bluetooth connectivity and sound quality. It took about 10 seconds to pair with my iPhone, and I didn't have to do anything else. With the bluetooth turned on in my phone, as soon as the headphone powers on, the headphone and phone connect with each other quickly and disconnect when the power goes off. My phone doesn't have NFC support, so I haven't been able to try NFC connectivity, but I am sure it will be as simple as it can be.So how's the sound quality via bluetooth? Well, as far as I know, connecting wirelessly via bluetooth has its limitations in both bandwidth and range, so this headphone is not an exception when connected via bluetooth. I didn't expect hi fidelity or anything, but I concluded that I have to agree on what AKG claims on the description of the product. It says `high performance'. Whether they meant high performance in sound quality or high performance in anything else, the sound quality is way better than several of my bluetooth headphones I've been using for a long time. I was actually surprised that the bluetooth audio technology improved as much as it has. There's no background noise or buzzing sound like my other BT headphones makes. When connected with the included audio cable, the sound gets little bit better (and doesn't require battery powered on).Lastly, using this headphone on phone calls is convenient. While listening to music, if phone rings, the music stops and the ringtone plays. And without taking out my phone to answer the call, I just press the center button (between volume up and down, just like the Apple earphone remote buttons.) Phone call audio quality, as I tested on both ends (as a caller and receiver) was pretty good. I experienced in the past that many bluetooth headphones had really low microphone level, so the other party  on the phone had a hard time hearing me talk. With this headphone, I did not have the kind of issue I had before with other BT headphones. Call quality was wonderful as well as the the regular sound quality.The battery is built in, and it's not replaceable. The initial full recharge took about an hour and the battery lasted more than five hours of continuous usage. (I think it lasted longer actually, but I fell asleep with the headphone on.) When the battery died, recharging took a couple of hours. One thing I found very convenient was that while the headphone was paired and in use, it showed the battery level right next to the BT icon on my iPhone. And, if the music paused for a certain period of time, the headphone disconnected the pairing and conserved the battery power.Overall, this is very well designed and well made bluetooth headphone that doesn't suck the sound quality too much. I have several stereo bluetooth headphones (Sony, Motorola, and LG) and this is the most comfortable, convenient, beautiful, and pleasing sound quality headphone with long lasting built in battery power.",5.0 out of 5 stars
196,"They sound great, have great battery life and look great (MAGA!).  Biggest beef is the stupid location of the power button as well as how easy it is to turn on.  I suppose if they gave you a hard case like some of their cheaper competitors, it wouldn't happen as often.  As it stands now, when I put them away I unpair them from my phone to prevent an unwanted connection and my notifications going to the headphones instead of my phones speaker.",3.0 out of 5 stars
197,"My complaint with most of these types of head phones is that they do not come with a bluetooth adapater for devices.  At the MSRP of these head pones, I would think that they would include a bluetooth plugin so you can use it with any computer, dvd player or even TV set.  The one place a bluetooth headphone would be really great for is on a long haul flight.  It would be great to have a nice set of head phones that don't tether you to the arm reset!With that said, the sound quality of these head phones are very good and the noise cancelling is adequate. It contains both a charging cord and a tether so you can use it with non blue tooth devices.  It also has a nice compact carrying case.  The only performance issue is that the heaphone unit is not really comfortable to wear.  I have a large head and the top has to rest on my head for the speakers to reach my ears.

199,"I am writing this review on the eve of returning a set of Y-45BT's that only arrived from Amazon three days ago, after having scoured all over the internet for a pair of portable bluetooth headphones that offered premium sound.Failure to offer a comfortable user experience is my #1 reason for returning this set - my ears were in excruciating pain after 45 minutes of use, at which time the ear phones became uncomfortably hot which also started giving me a headache.  In comparison to my Bose QC3's that also offered faux leather padding, the QC3's are far more comfortable.  The headset adjustment doesn't offer sufficient slack so unless you have an extremely small head, you are going to hurt.Failure to offer a rich, engaging sound stage is my #2 reason for returning this set - I am well aware that BT headphones cannot compare with wired one in a sound quality contest but having been spoilt by my QC3's the AKG sounded flat, trebles were ok but hardly any bass.  A very monotonous listening experience.Onto the positives, there was no hissing contrary to what others have reported and I found BT connection was quick and stable in my unit.Overall a major disappointment so back to square one.",2.0 out of 5 stars

These aren't noise-cancelling--which I knew--but its buttons aren't intuitive (press once for this, twice for that), you don't know how much charge it has left, you can't turn it off easily, the mic echoes terribly and it actually died two different times without warning while I was on calls.

209,"These are definitely more fashion headphones than anything else.  I have the white pair with the brown accents, and I think they look really nice, although they're a bit small.  Guys with big heads might have trouble getting these to fit comfortably.  From the point of view as a fashion accessory, I think that the Y45BTs are probably more for women.On the right earpiece, you get a 2.5mm line-in for the passthrough cable, the microphone, power LED, and buttons for power, volume up, down, and a multifunction button.  The left side has a USB charging port and another LED indicator.  The multifunction button is context sensitive so if you're receiving a phone call, you can answer with one press and hang up with another.  If you're playing music, you can play/pause with one press, skip to the next track with a double press, and jump back to the previous track with a triple press.  I tested out the button in iTunes on my Macbook Pro, and it worked great.The build quality is actually really nice.  The two earpieces can turn flat and pivot inwards for easy storage.  The leather headband and ear pads are soft feel very high quality, and even with my big head, I don't feel like my ears are getting pinched.  I don't think they feel any more flimsy thanAudio quality pretty decent, but I expected something a bit better from AKG at this price range.  I'm not an audiophile, but I love my relatively cheap Grado SR-60s which are definitely better than these.The biggest problem that I have with these headphones is the faint hissing sound, which has been an issue with every wireless headphone set that I've ever owned.  It's much less noticeable when music is playing, and I could almost get used it if it were constant, but it comes and goes as the headset switches in and out of sleep mode when there's no input.  To make matters worse, when my iPhone goes into sleep mode, there's a periodic, electronic whining sound that comes from the left earpiece.  I have these same issues when the headphones are paired with my Mac Pro, so it's definitely not a device specific problem.  The hissing all goes away when you use the included 3.5mm to 2.5mm pass-through cable.The hissing and squealing noises are definitely noticeable to me, mainly because I knew what to listen for.  I've had these same issues with two other pairs of wireless headphones in the past, and I was hoping that AKG had figured out a solution.  I'm guessing that some people wouldn't mind it though, and if you can get over the hissing sound, these are fashionable, albeit pricey, headphones that will look great with your fancy new iPhone while you hang out at your local Starbucks.  If you're looking for good sound quality, I'd still recommend a regular pair of corded headphones.",2.0 out of 5 stars

218,"These headphones are not good. They are GREAT and have pushed the envelope on my expectations on what a I set of headphones in the price range should cost. I don't make such statements flippantly, as I own about 12 different headphones many of which were purchased from Amazon. The two most endearing qualities of this pair are as follows:1. The sound quality to my ears is nearly flawless. Now, that is a subjective judgment. But when I listen to my favorite music and I fully get into it and forget it I'm wearing headphones, that is a good sign because I am very critical when it comes to how music comes across through speakers, and headphones. Out of all the headphones that I have owned over the years, there has been only one that has been my ""Go-tos""and that is the Plantronics Backbeat Pro. Plantronics is known primarily for its headsets used for call centers. But they also make some of the best headphones which many authoritative sources rank to be among the best, and I'm with them. Now these from IdeaUSA will also be the ones that I reach for.What is it that I like about the sound so much? Well, it is full, and it sounds alive. At the same time they avoid the tendency to bottom load on the bass just because people like bass. Rather, these are well-balanced and they disappear when you're listening. It's just you and the music.2. The noise cancellation is in same league as both my Plantronics and my Bose headphones. When I push around the vacuum cleaner and I turn these on, I do not hear the sound from the vacuum cleaner. I don't mean that literally, because the hum is still there just as it is with any high-end set of headphones. But, what I mean is that whatever noise does slip through, does not dilute the music or, for that matter audible books which I listen to a lot these days. And that is something that up until the past week that I could only say about my Plantronics headset.If you are the type of person that doesn't go by brand-name, but rather are fully judging headphones by the sound, you want to grab these and give them a try. Go ahead and compare them to The overrated and overpriced brands that are out there. That's not to say that there are not some really incredible headphones that you can pay over 500 bucks for. I'm just saying forget about price. Forget about the fact that you may have never heard of idea USA before, and just try them and see what you think.A few other things to consider:-These headphones have your cups that can be turned in such a way that the set becomes a flatter profile. So it easily fits into the included zippered hard case.-The controls on the ""cans"" give you more than left tactile sensation that it becomes very easy to pause, play, increase or decrease the the volume, advance to the next song, go back to the previous song.-These are very intuitive and I was able to charge them up and begin using them right away Without reading any Instructions. In fact I don't even know where they are.Is there anything I don't like about this? Well one feature I would love to see is a way in which they allow you to turn on an external microphone so that you can clearly hear what's going on in the outside world. If you have the noise canceling turned on, you won't hear much other than your music. If you turn off the noise cancellation the seal surrounding the two earpieces is sufficient to still block out most of the outside noise. Consequently, if you want to hear something you have to take the headphones off your ears.That is a pretty minor complaint.So if you're looking for Headphones that are audiophile quality for a price that is on the low end when compared to other headphones that cost a lot more, I strongly recommend that you give these a try.",5.0 out of 5 stars
219,"I’d consider these V200 as on-ear headphones, resting on top of the earlobe rather than going over. The older, V203 headphones by iDeaUSA were over-the-ear style. Both have a similar build, in fact, the headbands are nearly identical in size, quality and materials used. The padding is the same too. Included in similarities is the metal slider that has a sturdy hinge for rotating the ear cups.As mentioned, the ear cups got smaller. As a result, they also got lighter. I weighed the V200 in at 335 grams whereas the V203 was at 345 grams. For comparison, an unopened can of soda is around 385 grams, so both are lighter than that. iDeaUSA also has the V201 that weighs even less at 213 grams. As for myself, I prefer the more sturdy and solid metal body over the plastic; I like the durability and quality feel. Not only that but, because the headband is well padded, they don’t feel uncomfortable or too heavy. I’ve worn them for hours straight without any discomfort.They felt comfortable when wearing with eyeglasses too. Some headphones I've owned end up pushing against the temples, which cause pinching against my ears. The ear cup padding on the V200 is soft enough to prevent added pressure, but still firm enough to stay well in place. In fact, I couldn't feel any difference between wearing the headphones with or without eyeglasses.The noise canceling works well; I was able to listen to music with the vacuum running, and didn’t even hear the motor. That is, as long as music was playing. I did notice that my ears got hot when I was moving around; the ear cups block sound but also trap in heat. They work great when sitting at a desk or doing work in the kitchen, but I’d avoid tasks that increase your heart rate for too long. That is, unless you don’t mind sweat building up. The headband also slides forward a bit when bending down, such as in a bowed position. Which means some chores might cause a problem. Overall, I find that these are best for sitting back and relaxing – or going on leisurely walks.As to the sound quality, I’d say the V200 have more bass but slightly less treble than the older V203. Great for music, movies and video games. That said, you get better treble with the noise canceling turned off, just as you get more bass with it turned on. Overall, I think the sound quality is quite good.With both models (new and old), there’s a male voice that speaks the current state, such as, “pairing, device disconnected, power on, power off, etc.” While I don’t see a way of turning that off, I do find the audio prompts helpful when the headphones are on my head. That way I can hear what’s going on while pressing the button rather than having to watch the indicator light.When taking these out of the box for the first time, I noticed a slight odor coming from the ear cups. My guess was that it was due to some sort of epoxy from the manufacturing process. When contacting the manufacturer, I was told the smells were actually caused from the protective case. Apparently, the factory changed the material used so that new models don’t have this problem. For buyers like me who received one of the early products, I found that the odors go away when leaving the headset and case in a breezy windowsill for a day or so.The carrying / storage case they come in is much nicer than the bag the old V203 came in. It has a hard shell and zips closed with enough room to store your extra cables. There is also a loop that fits fully around your wrist that makes for easy carrying.An included 3.5mm audio cable lets you connect to a non-Bluetooth device. However, keep in mind that there is no prong for the microphone. The mic only works when connected to Bluetooth.Overall, I find that iDeaUSA typically produces good quality products at a reasonable price. These V200 are no exception. They are lighter than their older counterpart, look sharper, have a better carrying case, and offer more bass.",5.0 out of 5 stars
220,"These headphones did meet my expectations. The noise cancelling worked well, cutting out droning, repetitive noises like fans, lawn mowers, and aircraft engines. Some people think noise cancelling is suppose to cut out all noise. Not true; you can still hear non-repetitive noises (and higher frequency noises) like someone talking to you in the same room i.e. if the music is not playing too loud. The Bluetooth pairs up every time to my Android phone and Kindle Fire. The 30 foot range is about right. I like the voice prompts. The bass response is good without being overwhelming. The mid and high ranges are not as ""crisp"" as top headphones like the Bose QuietComfort 25, but still satisfactory for this price range. Turning on the noise cancellation seems to give the music a midrange ""boost"" which then emphasizes the voices more. This isn't ""bad"" per se, if you like that equalization setting. I also like the construction. They seem sturdy with the adjustable metal bands, not plastic. I had to throw away my other pair of wireless headphones because the plastic broke at the joint between the headband and the earpiece. They are comfortable (on my average size head at least), I'd say just about the right amount of tension.",4.0 out of 5 stars
221,"I've had these headphones for about 2 weeks now and I'm very happy with them so far.  I used them on a 5 hour flight recently and they definitely met my expectations; very comfortable to wear and very decent sound quality.  I'm sure if you compare these to the Bose version, you would notice a comparable difference.  For the price difference though, you will be very happy with these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
222,"These appear to be very well built. Nice weight but not too heavy. Very comfortable ear pads. Easy to use controls. Will give them the first real test in 2 weeks when on a 5 hour flight to Seattle. So far, I have used them in the office and it is very interesting. Put them on, and just turn the noise canceling on, and was amazed at how much ambient noise is in the office. AC fans, lights humming. All gone with the flick of a switch. Listening to music, I don't hear any distractions, even if someone walks up behind me. Now, it remains to be seen how well they work in an airplane environment.In the office, I can't really crank the volume, so I can not tell  how well they operate in a noisy cabin like a plane, but will update after my trip. They will get loud, but not ear splitting loud. That is probably good unless you are a metal head and like sheer volume.Overall, for the price, they can't be beat, IMHO. Everyone who I have let test them out, has asked how much?  When I tell them, they vow they are going to order a pair. I work with a lot of people who travel for business for work, so they can appreciate the product.Just remember to make sure the noise cancel is turned off when you put them away. It will drain the battery sitting idle.Update: 5 hour flight to Seattle and back. No need to recharge. Worked excellent in the airplane. Does not kill outside noise and sound totally, but it is effective. This is the one to buy. Forget the Bose brand and their high price.",5.0 out of 5 stars
223,"LOVE these headphones! They sounded wonderful on my Lumia 735 and now they sound just as good on my Galaxy J7 V. I actually bought a Bluetooth USB dongle so I can listen through my desktop computer and laptop. My ONLY complaint is, as others have said, the noise cancelling feature doesn't turn off when you turn off the headset, so it will drain the battery if left on. But, putting it in the case after each use forces me to angle my phone ear cups and I always see the green light is on so I never forget to turn it off. I must say that they sound pretty good w/out noise cancelling turned on but everything sounds wonderful with it turned on... more bass, more mid-range... just has a beautiful sound, so I always use that feature. $99 for something built so well and connects easily? Oh yes!! Other headphones I've used have had problems showing up and pairing, taking up to 15 minutes to get the job done. This literally connects in seconds, as it should. A+++, very happy, and thank you!",5.0 out of 5 stars
224,"These are version well constructed. Due to neurological and vision issues, I no longer read books. But I still love books. With headsets like this I can listen to books hour after hour. Three head band is passed and well constructed. That's important to me, since my head size is larger than normal. I wear a 7 7/8"" hat .. large enough that even one size fits all hats don't fit. But these headphones remain comfortable for me. The ear cups for comfortable on ears. The passing is exceptional. They passively reduce outside sounds. The audio reproduction is good. It is certainly good enough for speech.Music also sounds clear and crisp on these headphones. I remember thinking ""I don't remember that sound ok that album!"" with more than one album.The active nose cancellation is pretty good. It only eliminates low frequency sounds. It reduces, but doesn't eliminates mid and upper frequency sounds. In fact it seems to ""brighten"" mid range sounds. In particular, exterior speech sounds clearer with these headphones.The microphone does a pretty good job picking up my voice. It's perhaps not the best, but it's not bad.The headphones such well and easily with my phone. It's not the very latest Bluetooth standard. But it's not out of date.The battery is pretty exceptional. A couple hours chargers the headphone fully. They then last for 12 to 18 hours of continual use. Use of active nose cancellation decreases that time. But not dramatically.",5.0 out of 5 stars
225,"I Initially had some difficulty with pairing the headset with my PC (2017 Win10Pro v1709).  The pairing defaulted to the V200 Hands free driver which is mono and oriented to speech (1 channel, 16 bit, 16kHz).  After some adjustments I discovered there is another driver ""V200 Stereo"" which delivers the standard CD quality sound (i.e. 2 channel, 16 bit, 44.1 kHz) I expected . This drivers delivers the high quality audio I was expecting of this headset. I have not tested the headset using the supplied 3.5 mm audio cable. Sound quality is good for this type of unit.  The sound level (and balance) changes when you switch on the noise cancelling. With the Noise Cancelling on, the sound is a bit warmer and louder with more reverb.  Sound placement and distortion levels are actually quite good.My only complaint is that the driver does not allow for listening to very high quality sound sources (e.g. 24 bit 48 kHz audio).  Just a quibble since I would not expect headsets in this price range to support that level of quality.I have not tested the microphone for speech quality (there is no boom microphone.)  The mic is located in the right headset exterior cup. and really is not ideal for lengthly conversations.I have had the headset for 2 weeks and am satisfied with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars
226,"They work fairly well - I am very pleased with them as headphones/bluetooth headphones, but less impressed by the NC function.They come with a nice case that has kept them safe on numerous trips and seem fairly robust generally.I have only worn them for about 2 hours at a given time but found it to be a comfortable experience.On an airplane they reduce the engine noise and ambient noise, but it's not amazing.  Definitely better than mere noise isolating earphones, but don't expect the same NC functionality as the expensive name brand competitors.I paid $20 when there was a coupon available and I'm happy with the purchase, but if I had paid $80 I would probably be less impressed.",4.0 out of 5 stars
227,You can obviously spend hundreds of dollars for the high end noise cancelling headphones. And I'm sure those work really well. It's not fair to compare an $80 paid to those. This set works really well and for the money the value is tremendous. I'm not an audiophile. I primarily use these when I'm working on my laptop in a coffee shop or library for hours on end. I have several ear buds that I had been using. But after a few hours my ear buds started to get uncomfortable. These headphones are comfortable and the sound is solid.  The active noise cancelling works but it doesn't block out all sounds. It seems to do a good job blocking out lower volume constant noises like the humming of a fan or refrigerator. But it won't totally block out sharper intermittent noises like glasses clinking or someone talking on the phone. Overall they work great. The ability to plug a standard wired connection into your music source when the batteries die is also a great feature I've used a few times. The carrying case is very helpful. This is a great value for just $80.,5.0 out of 5 stars
228,"I bought these to work in a very noisy open office and they work great.  The noise cancelling works pretty well, especially if you have some music playing.  The sound quality is excellent, especially for this price range, and there is no scratchy background noise like some bluetooth headphones have.  I'm able to use them for most of the day even with the NC on.  Since they charge off of a USB port it's easy to recharge them if needed and you can continue to use them while they're charging.  You can also connect them via a regular 3.5mm cable if the batteries are dead and they work fine for listening.  Even without the NC on, the ear cups block background noise pretty well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
229,The headphones have worked well in the first week.  The active noise cancelling is decent; it blocks moderate noise from about twenty feet away.  The charge seems to last at least 8 hours with the active noise cancelling on.  I've seen comments about the headphones being heavy but they didn't seem heavy to me.  I like the way they fit over my entire ear.  There is occasional static/interference.  The headphones won't stay paired with a Vaio laptop (which may be due to an issue with my computer).  The headphones pair fine with a Pixel phone.,4.0 out of 5 stars
230,"Overall these headphones are some of the best in its class under $100. Great for a portable headset for commutes, travel, or daily use on the go.The controls on the side of the headphones are intuitive and easy to access. The seek and volume buttons are flush but are large enough to find/use without issue with the low-profile Bluetooth button in the center.The headset appears to have a mostly metal construction and create an industrial/modern/minimalist design. It feels sturdy and durable when handling and folding. The folding hinges and moving parts do not feel like they would break, even when I stress tested them with a reasonable amount of pressure there was no sign that the headset would break. These are a surprisingly durable pair of wireless headphones without being excessively heavy.The comfort of these headphones is also very well balanced on. The earcups are well-padded with pliable foam and a soft faux leather material. The stitching seams on the leather are subtle and well-placed to avoid pressure points. They also don't pinch the sides of your head while wearing them, but also don't feel loose.Overall, these headphones are a serious contender in their class. It is worth noting that these headphones are really best used with ANC activated, without ANC it seemed that audio quality was noticeably less enjoyable. Also, I would not rely on the ANC for louder environments, but they're perfect for some ambient noise when riding a bus/train, walking around the city, and comfortable indoor listening.The headset also has room for improvement with the low-end sound (bass) which is average and the ear cups could be a little larger. However, I'm really happy that iDeaUSA listened to feedback and gave the ear cups an ovular shape that better fits the ergonomics of ears. Very pleased with these headphones overall and the solid construction of these makes them perfect for portable listening.",5.0 out of 5 stars
231,"This is a very high quality headset. Crystal clear sound with excellent stereo separation. The ANC works quit well also. Battery life is more than 10 hours.

233,"Was looking for an alternative to spending $300 on Bose, Beat, etc. These are awesome, made of very high quality material and the noise cancelling is on par with these other headphones for sure.

236,"These are very comfortable.  I wore them all day long for four days while my house was being renovated.  They did not bother my ears, or head, at all.  The head band feels like it sits a little further back than I would like.  I have a smaller than average head but they didn't feel too big on me, they look a bit big, but that's okay.  They don't block out all noise, but they reduce the noise.  I like the controls on the headset, but wish it had a pause button.",4.0 out of 5 stars

289,Hard to judge sound quality as I only wore these for about 60 seconds.  I found them painfully uncomfortable and quickly returned them.  They squeezed my not-particularly-wide head and the ear cups were too small for my not-large ears.  Avoid!,1.0 out of 5 stars

298,"I have a set of Bohm headphones and these are better than the Bohm B76's.These are just more comfortable on my head.  The other full ear cup headphones are usually heavy and, as a glasses wearer, I find that they are uncomfortable.These ones are lighter and the ear cups are more adjustable.  You can swing the ear cup forward and have the band hold them in place.These paired easily to my PC, my phone (android) and my itouch.There was no cut out, within 15'.I was listening to the Moody Blues, Queen, Adele, Ed Sheeran, CCR, and then for the finale: Disturbed 'Sound of Silence'.The highs were clear and bright without any grating sharpness.  The deep base and background sounds were pronounced and clear.Lyrics were easily heard and in some songs, I heard background singers I never knew were there.All in all: these are wonderful headphones for the price.They come with a hardshell case, a charging cable (standard micro usb), and a plug in cable.Again: I like that these are more comfortable on my head than the Bohm's.If you need a pair of headphones for noise cancellation and listening to your favorite music, you'll love these.My husband stood behind me and couldn't hear any noise bleedthrough on them as I was listening at a medium volume (70db).Very happy with these.",5.0 out of 5 stars

301,"I'm a really enjoying these headphones. I really love the long battery life which is really one of the main reasons for my purchase. Second reason for my purchase  was that I own the w206 wifi speaker from ideaUsa and it is absolutely incredible. I really like that I have dedicated controls to change track so to change tracks I only have to short press once. I hate headphones that not only combine the buttons to change volume and tracks but also make changing the volume the main function but operating with a short press and changing tracks the secondary function being done with a long press, now for me I change tracks much more than I change volume up a down so It would seem to make most sense by having that as the short press function. I'm pretty sure we all skip trough songs back to back sometimes and it's so time comsuming when u have to hold a buttin for 3 secs to change one track. so I am so thankful this is no issue with these headphones which is a 3rd reason why I bought yet another bluetooth headphone. So all in all I can't think of any negatives I've experienced testing these puppies out.Update 6/04/17:Back for more just to say how much I'm loving my ideaplay products I have these headphones which I really enjoy using I bought these for work cuhz the long battery life my powerbeats Ike phones don't always last all day, but come to find out they idiotically only allow buds so I can't use these v200s at work..sucks. so anyway the Anc is w.e. but I don't have an experience to compare to anyway but I do use it sometimes and there's a noticeable difference it's like it turn the outside noise into white noise, or that's my take on it. But these phones are a must buy. But even more so is the incredible w206 ideaplay wifi speaker man I love this thing there are some pitfalls but still I'm blown away by this powerful lil thing. And if u use music streaming service you'll love this speaker it controls the music from say Pandora independently without your phone or w.e. I'm gonna get another one to get the full experience. OK so the pits are the battery seriously inferior and it's just a lil heavy with no handle so this is really more of a home speaker. So I would definitely recommend if you want your house bumping with a feature full musical experience. Not for travel though.",5.0 out of 5 stars
302,"This probable one of the most comfortable and best sounding headphones I have purchased.The sound is very crisp and immaculate, the noise cancellation function really cancel out 90%< of the surrounding noise even when played at a low volume.I wear these headphones 8+ hours during my work day and they fit over my big ears very comfortably without any long term fatigue.These headphones greatly surpass any competitor in its cost range. Definitely recommend these Headphones, especially if you work in a very noisy environment for extended hours.",5.0 out of 5 stars
303,"Love the voice guidance system! This headset automatically finds and pairs to previous pairings without issue upon powering up. Better sound quality and craftsmanship than headsets 3x the price! I'll admit though, that I don't notice a difference with the noise cancellation switch in either on or off position besides the LED lighting. The weight of the headset gets a little lofty after watching an hour show. Not sure if I could wear them more than a couple of hours at a time. Additionally, while doing a great job on enveloping you with airtight sound from the surrounding environment, the full earcups get annoyingly sweaty. I do enjoy the headset however in order to earn 5 stars it needed to be lighter and use earcup material that doesn't make you sweaty. Funny, but I don't remember the liquid filled earcups of my old Koss Pro4AAA ever making my ears sweat like these do?",4.0 out of 5 stars
304,"THe sound is fantastic, quality construction, easy accessible and logical buttons, comes with a great storage case as well as airplane plug adapter and wired audio cabe.  My problem with them is that the noise cancelling is weak.  It adds a bit of pink-noise and a small level of reverse audio (the noise cancelling) to block out unwanted surrounding sound.  I have another big-brand and they are much more active and effective in reverse phase cancellation of ambient sound.  If I was rating the noise cancellation alone, I'd give these headphones 2-3 stars.  But I am indeed pleased with everything but the noise cancellation, which does reduce vs cancel. Passive noise isolation is good. Active noise cancellation (that uses the internal batteries) is weak.",4.0 out of 5 stars
305,"I bought ideaUSA Active Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones to replace an outdated set. The headphones sound great and are very comfortable to wear. The phones were easy to pair. The device has three buttons to switch between calls and music, volume, and track selection. The package includes the Bluetooth headphones, USB charging cable, 3.5mm Aux cable, Airline adapter, Carrying Case, and User Manual.The product arrived as scheduled. I appreciate that the seller, ideaUSA, contacted me with useful information prior to using the product. I recommend ideaUSA Active Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones as a high-quality audio product.If you found this review to be helpful, please click the yes button below.",5.0 out of 5 stars

307,"This is my second product from this brand and I am extremely happy with them. My first item was a Bluetooth speaker and before buying it I was wondering if the quality was good and I was not disappointed. That's why when I saw the headphones from the same brand I purchased it with my eyes closed and when I opened the box to see the headphones, I was surprised from the moment that I saw the headphones inside a nice case with zip. all the cables and everything looking well organized and clean. The quality is just great, it looks premium that I am afraid to walk with them in the street. 😁The sound quality is very good and clean as well and I like how easy it is to pair with any Bluetooth device. I set it up with a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and my Ipad pro and I was so happy playing with Google Voice in android and Siri in the ipad having the freedom to be some meters away from them.I spend hours sometimes practicing piano or editing audio and video and these headphones are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.I love the product so much that if I could  I will give 10 stars instead of the 5 that amazon allows.I am buying another one for my wife and already my co-workers want to buy for them as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
308,"I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.These headphones do a decent job for what they cost and what they do. The sound quality seems solid with decent bass and treble; I'm no audiophile, though.The noise cancelling works very well at blocking distant and low-frequency sounds like neighborhood noise or, while driving in the car, the road noise. It does not hold up so well against somebody speaking right next to me. Compared to $250+ ""big brand"" noise canceling headphones, there's no comparison, but the price is significantly lower.They are a tad heavy, but this is to be expected to support their noise canceling and battery.Docking a point because I expected better noise cancelling over all.",4.0 out of 5 stars
309,"The noise canceling option is amazing. There is definitely a difference! The sound has great quality also. It connected easily to my phone without a hassle. I also love when I turn it on, it says ""powering on"".They are a little on the heavy side and run big, but stay on fine when I'm running, however, if I lay down to exercise, they call off.Other than that, I highly recommend them. They come with a nice protective case also!",5.0 out of 5 stars
310,"Thoroughly impressed with these headphones.They have a sturdy heavy weight to them and fit my big head nicely and securely.  The material feels like faux, very soft pleather.  Easy setup.  Comes w a nice carrying case.  They are pretty bulky so if you want a lower profile not so much these.I love using them to listen to relaxing music before I go to bed.They also seem balanced. Not too tinny or base.I tested some Beats. Do yourself a favor and avoid those unless all you want them for is shakin' it. (Eg: they're unbalanced, too much base, not clear)",4.0 out of 5 stars
311,Great headphones!! First of all the sound is amazing!!! The fact that they are Bluetooth and can also be used with an aux cord when the battery is drained is an added plus. The noise cancelling is superb. I meditate daily and always use headphones. I'm always on the hunt for good clear sound and active noise cancelling. These do the job. I was stuck on the hesh2's. I've finally found a little heavier duty and ones I think will last. They are quite comfy and not plastic. They are well made. You can't go wrong with these.,5.0 out of 5 stars
312,"These headphones scream quality from the workmanship and material. The band is made of solid metal. The sound is not bad for a noise canceling earphone. For those that are concerned about electronics on your head, you can just use the cord and leave the headphones off. They feel a bit tight but are still quite comfy for non-full ear covering headphones. The noise canceling is not the best in its class (think bose) but still do pretty well to block out certain noises. Overall, I am quite happy with my purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars
313,"We initially purchased the v201 headphones, and when we contacted IdeaUSA regarding our dissatisfaction with the noise cancelling they offered to send us a pair of V200 in exchange. The noise cancelling on these, while not perfect, is definitely better. Sound quality is decent, the only thing that is annying is we find if we hit the button to pause music, if we hit it again to unpause and hold it a fraction too long it tries to initiate a FaceTime call.",4.0 out of 5 stars
314,"Very good sound quality.  As is generally the case with these types of headphones the active noise cancelling feature does not cancel all noise..  The only ones I have tried that actually did were the $400 Bose noise cancelling headphones.  But.. I am not going to pay that much.  These cancel some noise and given that these are much cheaper than Bose, i think they were a good deal.  Build quality is very good. They feel sturdy and of high quality.",4.0 out of 5 stars
315,"Great stylish headphones for the price. Sound good and clear, look fantastic and i get compliments on them. Although, being on ear, they can only be one for so long before it gets a bit uncomfortable and you need to change the position on your ear but i'd definitely buy these again. I still watch movies, game, and listen to music with them. All in all great headphones for the price!",5.0 out of 5 stars
316,"ProsThey have excellent sound quality, the headphones have a good feel made with metal and some good material that feels great.They are not unconformable with long periods of use, but i will say they are on the heavy sideall the things it comes with are very well made and does not feel cheap, feels like a $300 but way cheaper in pricehas Bluetooth, with i would say 12 hours wich is enoughand if the Bluetooth functionality cease to work you can plug in a 3mm aux cord becouse it canConsthey are heavythey are too bigthe noise cancellation does cancel some noises but not all noises, but its not a huge dealyes im giving it five stars and it has some bad things but what i buy headphones is for the music quality it will bring and it has deliverd, beyond my expectation",5.0 out of 5 stars
317,The overall quality is extremely high. The case is nice and the headphones feel like they are built really well. The downside is the sound quality is mediocre and could be better. Also they would be more comfortable if they were built as over the ear instead of on the ear style.,4.0 out of 5 stars
318,The head phones a bit on the heavy side but fit good the sound quality is excellent with the noise canceling on but every once in a while I will get a bunch of static and the only way I can get it to go away is to turn off the noise cancellation. Other than that the battles last a long time it charges fast it sounds great,4.0 out of 5 stars
319,"Fit really well, and feel nice on my ears. Very flexible and moveable. Has a great look. Sound quality is really nice. Controls are easy to use and work well. Has really good range for blue tooth. Only issue I have had is a high pitched noise that happens when I turn on noise cancellation. I can't use that feature because the sound happens every time and is painfull to hear. As long as I don't engage the noise cancellation feature this isn't a problem and I can listen to music for long periods of time.",3.0 out of 5 stars
320,"Great headphones so far! I used these on a trip from LA to Okinawa and had these on for about 16 hours straight. I was listening to music and used the cord to plug into the plane video screen.

Has good highs that don't fall off, the mids delivers. This the best NC headphones out. The only gripe is the battery life when you first get it. After a few days it gets better. It's worth to try out. I also used viper4android to fine tune it perfectly. Good job AKG",5.0 out of 5 stars
346,"Bought it on the Black Friday with very good price. I would like to say the sound is quite good.I had one over ear Sony MDR-10RNC, the NC is good but sound is quite boring, that's the reason why I chose an On-Ear.As for AKG N60NCBT, the quality is quite good. The head set bag is small but just match with the headset. Very convinent for traveling.NC is always on when the BT is connected. It works well in the noise enviornment, but I should say not as good as Over ear NC.It is perfect for female sound. But not so deep bass, so not so good at electronic music.In all, it is a perfect head set I had owned.",5.0 out of 5 stars
347,"Connects beautifully, syncs sound flawlessly, sounds good, folds and travels really well.Two big issues: 1) the power switch is right next to and is the exact same shape and feel as the ""next/previous"" switch; this is frequent disaster. 2) does hurt the ears after wearing for long periods, because of the squish/clamp nature of them. Feels fine enough at first, however that pressure is certainly felt later.",5.0 out of 5 stars
348,"They're great. Sound good, Bluetooth connects flawlessly. I like the low profile design.Sound cancelation not as good as my old Boss QC15s, but good enough.Wish there was an auto power off feature. Also, as a bald guy, I wish the top band had more padding. On long flights I get a sore indent on the top of my melon.",4.0 out of 5 stars
349,"I listen primarily to music with a strong vocal component: early and traditional music, contemporary folk, modern vocal compositions etc. For such music, these headphones perform exceptionally well. I can't speak to bass reproduction, as the music I listen to is generally strongest in the higher registers, except to say that it seems more than adequate. I ran some bench-marking tests, which the headphones passed with flying colors. Soundstaging seems pretty effective to my ears; however, I can claim no great sophistication as an audiophile.As I use these for traveling, the fact that they fold down compactly and are relatively light is a big plus. Bluetooth pairing is extremely straightforward and unusually well executed compared to many devices I have used. Use with the supplied cable is easy and the sound quality equally excellent (or possibly slightly better). I have not experience any discomfort from the ear pads, with up to a couple of hours of continuous listening. The noise canceling is terrific, and a delight as I do much of my listening on long rides on the bus (I'm a long-distance commuter).I can't speak to long-term durability, but these seem very well built, and the included soft pouch is very handy. All in all, I'm delighted. The only negatives are the placing of the volume and pairing switches on the right-hand speaker, which can get confusing, and the fact that they are a little loose on my head.",5.0 out of 5 stars
350,Just awesome headset. I already got a Bose Quite Comfort 35 II ... that was comfortable for sure. But this guy has lot better sound quality than Bose. Try it you will forget Bose. Product has superb noise cancellation too. Only issue is it is on ear so ear gets hot on long time play.

359,"As an experienced headphone enthusiast and a fan of AKG, I decided to pull the trigger on a pair of N60NC Wireless headphones. I went into this purchase not knowing what to expect, as there are no detailed reviews of these here on Amazon right now, or anywhere else for that matter.Despite the beautiful design, great build materials, light weight, fantastic portability and decent NC, these headphones receive only two stars because they fail where it matters most - sound quality.I do not consider myself to be a bass head but I do find these to be quite lacking in the bass department. Unlike some other headphones that are generally considered to be bass light (like the Audio Technica DSR7BT) adding bass to these via EQ only made them sound muddy and distorted. The mid range, although forward, lacks in the body and resolution necessary to make vocals spirited and engaging. The highs are sharp, hot and overall very fatiguing. The sound stage of these is almost non-existent, which is a big departure from the glorious sound staging that AKG is known for. The entire range of these headphones sounds as if it comes out of a distant pigeon hold, gets bounced off of a wall, then gets projected into your ears. These are pretty terrible sounding headphones all around.This is an disappointing release from AKG that is nowhere near competitive at the $300 price point. I hate to say it but the Beats Solo 3 Wireless sound far better than these. In fact, my $32 Lasmex HB65 sound far better than these do.I recommend steering clear of these because of the vastly superior competition around this price range. Below is a list of some of the other closed back headphones I own or have owned that do better at this price range to help you understand my frame of reference.In order of my favorite to least favorite:Bang & Olufsen H7Vmoda Crossfade 2 WirelessSony MDR1000XAKG K550Audio Technica DSR7BTBeyerdynamic DT1350Sennheiser Momentum 2 WirelessBeats Solo 3 WirelessSennheiser Urbanite XLBeyerdynamic CustomLasmex HB65Denon D600AKG N60NC Wireless",2.0 out of 5 stars
