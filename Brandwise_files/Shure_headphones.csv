0,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Shure SRH440 came included with our high-end electronic keyboard we bought. They lasted about 9 months before the plastic piece that keeps the earmuff attached to the head-piece (or whatever) broke. So in other words, the ear muff was dangling by the little wire.

OK, we had some bad luck. So we ordered a new one from Amazon. In less than 3 months, the earmuff was broken off again. See pic.

The headphones are comfortable on my head and ears. The sound quality is good and the noise cancellation is good as well. But they just keep breaking under reasonable usage circumstance. Admittedly, teenagers (girls) also use these but they stay parked at our computer 100% of the time and I did not feel like our use case was extreme. Yes, the kids dropped them off the table occasionally and these were probably dropped on the floor a couple times, but for $90 I don't feel like they are very durable. Otherwise they are good headphones

If you are going to use them in a studio or placid environment and totally pamper them then there's nothing wrong. I'm just disappointed in their durability. Ordered a Sennheiser HD280PRO and build quality seems much better at the ear muff. Haven't owned them long enough to say they are better, but from looking at the ear muff attachment I do not think my next problem will be that.

No fault to the vendor or Amazon. I never bother with reviews but I just wanted to point this problem out.

UPDATE 11/29/2017: The Sennheiser HD280PROs are still great and haven't broken yet. Definitely recommend you purchase them over the Shure SRH440."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was recently in need of closed headphones with a $100 budget and curious about what the market offers. I thought I might share my findings with someone in a similar situation. The Shure SRH440 turns out to be the most accurate, neutral sounding closed cans among the eight headphone models that I have compared. Below is my review of these headphones.

I am a speaker builder with measurement equipment, so I know what is neutral and undistorted sound. Unlike speaker systems, most headphones have no crossover or frequency response correction circuit. So, it is critical to be able to know how much such uneven responses affect perception of their sound with respect to accuracy and neutrality. I have good sense of it since I have been measuring sound. But I do not have proper equipment for headphone measurement, mostly importantly a dummy torso/head, nor am I willing to invest time in making a DIY setup. This is the reason why my search and audition have been limited to headphones for which measurement data exist, with some exceptions (see below). I made use of three different sources for the data: InnerFidelity.com, Headphone.com, and en.GoldenEars.net. While there is consistency within each site's measurements, there is also inconsistency between them, due to different measurement conditions and compensation methods. So, I researched and took those into account.

One may say we can use EQ to remedy irregular frequency responses. But EQ has its own limitations. Some minor EQ'ing can help, but headphones that need too extensive correction should be avoided. The foremost reason is the loss of dynamic range. Theoretically, with EQ you can only limit, not increase, dynamic range in a certain frequency band. On the source side, you lose digital bit depth, and on the headphone side, you suppress the driver's efficient response range.

Below is the list of headphones that I have auditioned (in the order of their street prices):

- Tascam TH-02 ($30; no data available)
- Panasonic RP-HTF600-S ($32; semi-open headphones)
- Brainwavz HM3 / Incipio F38 ($35; no data available)
- Tascam TH-2000 ($50; no data available)
- AKG K518LE ($50)
- Sennheiser HD 429 ($65)
- Creative Aurvana Live! ($70)
- KRK KNS 6400 ($85)
- Shure SRH440 ($90)

My DIY speaker system (it measures very flat) served as a reference with respect to tonal balance. I also own some open headphones like Sony MDR-MA900 and Sennheiser PX100, which also provided a baseline when I evaluated tonal balance of the headphones under comparison. I used a desktop headphone amp that has flat FR and reasonably low output impedance.

I will give short, summarized impressions for each pair.

Tascam TH-02 (no measurement data available)
This is a really nice surprise. There is a little hump in the bass and midbass regions, and some wide, shallow dip in upper mids and lower treble (i.e., slightly polite presentation). Otherwise, these are relatively accurate headphones at a fraction ($30) of cost of headphones of comparable quality. Construction is good for the price. The pad size is between over-ear and on-ear, but comfortable enough.

Panasonic RP-HTF600-S (semi-open headphones)
Warm tone, deep bass. Treble is there, but upper mids and lower treble are lacking. Comfortable to wear. A good value, but not great for those looking for reasonably accurate sound.

Brainwavz HM3 / Incipio F38 (no data available)
Mid/upper bass ruins the sound which has otherwise good midrange-treble balance. Very uncomfortable to wear due to non-swivel cups.

Tascam TH-2000 (no data available)
Simply inferior to its younger brother TH02. Very dull and muddy presentation. The model uses the same ear cups as TH02 but contains different drive units. The driver may have better components but execution must be bad. Not worth the asking price.

AKG K518LE
You need to remove the thick foam pad at the driver's front (easily removable) to have better bass-to-mids balance. Even the pad removed, the phones still have bass-oriented sound, but not bad. Mids to treble balance is good. Somewhat similar sound signature to Tascam TH-02's. But the TH-02 sounds a little more natural. The headband can be too small for some people. The clamping force is a bit above a comfortable level.

Sennheiser HD 429
Anothter pair of headphones with bass emphasis. Not overly bassy, though. But a bigger problem is treble, which is a little too polite to be neutral. I would not consider these headphones a good value.

Creative Aurvana Live!
Smooth and warm tone. Bass is somewhat loose at times. Treble has sparkles and at the same time sounds smooth. But relative to bass and treble, upper mids and lower treble are somewhat recessed, making the headphones' sound colored. Some people may feel them musical and full, but I prefer the Tascam TH02 at a lower price. The appearance is very good, though, with some feel of high quality. Very comfortable to wear with memory foam pads.

KRK KNS 6400
It has much more neutral sound than the headphones described above. Mid- and upper bass is somewhat lacking, and treble is a little overly presented. Good monitor-type sound. But there is one problem with these headphones. They are not very efficient, which means their usability is limited---you need a desktop headphone amp or a high-current capable portable amp to make them sound good. A little too bright treble is a weakness, too.

Shure SRH440
Without doubt, these are the best of the bunch. Perceived dynamic range is unbelievably wide. These are in a different league in terms of clarity as well---perhaps, the KNS 6400 is close but also with weaknesses (see above). Treble is sometimes a little on the bright side, but not as bright as the KNS6400's. Some people may find them bright with bright recordings, but the headphones should not be blamed for that. These produce very neutral and accurate sound. Bass is sufficient and often pleasantly strong in the mid- and upper bass regions, but deeper bass is not covered by these cans. Most music recordings do not contain this deep bass, anyway.

I summarize my findings with the following top two picks:

1. Shure SRH440: These are the headphones you can safely choose under $100 if what you are looking for is accurate, neutral sound.

2. Tascam TH-02: This is a secret gem. At $30, you get really good closed cans. Its overall presentation is not as clear as the SRH440's, but with their price factored in, you cannot complain. They are definitely in the same league as the AKG K518LE (foam pads removed) and the Creative Aurvana Live. It may depend on personal preference, but among the three, my pick is the Tascam. The Creative has a better look and feel, but I'd choose the Tascam for its sound.

Another headphone model I wanted to include in my search was the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro ($90-$100), but after I listened to the Shure SRH440, I decided not to. According to HeadRoom's measurements and many people's common impressions, the HD 280 Pro has a little subdued treble compared to the SRH440 which has great mids to treble balance when compared to my reference speakers. The Sennheiser covers the lowest octave much better than the Shure, but that is not my priority.

I also considered the Koss ProDJ100 because of good reviews, but ruled them out because of their measurements. Their response might be flat in fundamental tones from most instruments but not with harmonics due to a large dip around 5-6kHz. Some people may think they sound good, but there is no way for them to sound accurate and natural by my standard."
2,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
* Excellent frequency balance. All bands from low to high are represented well and fairly, not overwhelmingly.
* Very sensitive to quiet sounds, so high volume is almost never necessary, especially in a quiet room.
* In Overwatch terms, around the time of release this meant that if you set the volume such that the loudest possible 2khz square wave no longer caused pain, you could then use the same volume setting and, while standing at the factory entrance in King's Row, still hear a reaper walking upstairs. In the far deck. In short, ""rip headphone users"" should make no sense to you as nothing can cause you pain and you can hear everything.
* Isolation is good enough for moderate fan noise.

Cons:
* Headband lasts about 2 years tops for me as both pairs I've owned have broken at the thin sliding plastic joint
* Headphones are so heavy that your neck muscles will probably need some training to get used to them.
* Headphones are so heavy that the top of my head began to develop a bald spot from long term use. After switching to KRK studio headphones which are much lighter (but not as bright sounding as these), the bald spot grew back within a month.

In short, know that you will have an interesting, yet inherently transient experience with these headphones. Don't expect to pass them to your grandchildren or anything."
3,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I start my review I would like to say that I'm not a musician and I don't know anything about recording or mixing audio. I got sick and tired of cheaper headphones that needed an extreme EQ adjustment to sound even across the entire frequency spectrum. I wanted to try headphones were supposed to have neutral sound and was as close to having a flat linear frequency response as possible.

I fell in love with them the instant I heard them for the first time. Everything sounded so clean, so balanced and not even once made me want to turn on an EQ. I even played back a frequency sweep on them and I couldn't hear any of the frequencies being any louder or quieter then any of the others. These headphones match my ears' own natural frequency response very well.

I've seen quite a few people complain the there's not enough bass, but not to me. I think it's spot on. It's very tight, clean, and accurate and never gets sloppy or muddy even on the most bass heavy songs. The midrange is nice and wide and full. In fact, the midrange was the very first thing I noticed and is something I never knew I was missing so badly and wanted more of compared to all my previous headphones in my past. The treble is sharp and crystal clean and clear and detailed but yet not harsh to my ears at all. Everything is all in balance and totally flat just as I was expecting and wanting in these headphones. In fact I even reverted my iPod back to stock firmware from rockbox because I no longer have to tame my headphones' sound with an custom EQ.

These are so far the best (and most expensive) headphones I've ever owned. I absolutely love how the sound and I think they're perfect in that aspect.

Why 4 stars then?
2 words, build quality. These headphones feel really weak and the used pair I had before buying these brand new broke right at it's hinge exactly how a few other reviewers on this site had shown and I'm afraid my new ones might do that. Also, even after very light usage, my headphone jack is starting to bend at the tip. But hey, that's what having a replaceable cable is for and I've seen some pretty nice and extra durable looking third-party cables out there for these. ;)

EDIT: The right side completely broke off and I had to do a MacGyver style repair to get them back together. But the sound is still just as good though."
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: August 2012
Shure replaced my phones!
I wrote to them as well as called them. Very friendly staff.
Turns out there was a Shure partner in New Delhi and I went to their location and they changed the phones for new ones on the spot. With two years manufacturers warranty, that's awesome.
The design flaw still stands of course. I'm Shure they'll fix it.
I wouldn't want to use another set of cans. These are just perfect.

UPDATE: July 2012
There is a metal T shaped hook that fits into the top (head) piece. Its held in place by a plastic cap covered by 4 small screws. This plastic cap has broken on my right cup and its about to break on the left as well (I just checked).

This plastic ""cap"" that holds down the metal T joint, is very easy to break. It broke on my right can and is almost broken on the left as well. Ive put up some pictures.

I really think Shure needs to look into this and strengthen the design at the joints.

These caps should've been made of metal. Mind you, I have used these phones VERY VERY carefully. I don't see these working in a real commercial studio environment.

Apart from that still a great sounding pair of cans.
______________________________________________________
My mixes improved when i started using these cans.

They do bring out reasonable mid range detail you want to hear when you're EQ'ing your mixes. They are decently transparent and have close to a flat response.

To know exactly how the response of these cans are, search ""Shure SRH440 + frequency response""

They are reasonably flat upto say 3khz and then there's a dip from 3 to 8 khz followed by a spike to return to normal at say 10khz after which the response falls off.

i did some research and chose these over the 840. A Shure engineer or something like that said these were better for mastering/mixing. You can google ""Shure 440 vs 840"" if you'd like to confirm.

I just didn't really like the plastic feel of some of the connectors. I guess its not a big deal.

I'll update this review next year to write on how it worked out for me."
5,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Older and more dynamic material can sound great on these things. The flat and well-defined midrange is by far the best part. The bass works best with more pronounced or acoustic sounds. The treble may roll off a bit early for some tastes, but I found it balanced enough to do the job. Listening is accurate and modest. Bass will never thump, and ""S"" sounds won't scream at you.

Comfort concerns might be overstated in other reviews. I wouldn't wear them for hours at a time, but they're still a solid enough fit for my average-sized head, and fairly comfy. The detachable cord is a big win in my book, and has saved me from tangled nightmares and any fear of breaking the connector."
6,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit: I must update this review to mention that these headphones have broken like many others who have posted reviews. The sliding hinge no longer sticks and the headphones on the left hand side simply fall apart. I can push the metal interior back into the housing which keeps them sort of working for a few times until the friction of use breaks them again. Very frustrating, as it has only been 7 months and I have taken extremely good care of them.

Previous review:

I've owned these headphones for four months, wearing them about 4-6 hours per work day. They are the single most uncomfortable pair of headphones I've ever used out-of-the-box. This is a very relative bias, but after seeing other reviews claiming they are very comfortable, I don't want to steer others into the same trap. If you find them comfortable enough, you're lucky! I had coworkers try them out and comment, and receive all negative feedback in terms of comfort.

Here's what I bought along these headphones in order to increase the comfort to allow for all day use:

- Velour ear pads http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OM06RG/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
- Extra cushion support http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00862522A/ref=oh_details_o09_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
- Standard black velcro

I took the extra cushion support and put black velcro along the back and along the top of the headphones. This provided the perfect amount of cushion. The replacement ear pads also increased comfort.

As for the quality, they are perfect for my needs and there are plenty of more technical reviews to base opinions from. Overall after lightly modifying the stock headset, I'm very happy."
7,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SRH440 headphones are sturdy and seem to be generally well constructed. As per the experience of many other reviewers, I found the ear cups and the headband to be quite uncomfortable (the headband began to pressure the top of my head almost immediately.)

I have already replaced the ear cups with the Shure SRH840 models (available on Amazon for $14.49) and they do indeed provide a much more comfortable fit. I have also ordered a ""Replacement Upgrade Headband Comfort Cushion Pad in Leatherette with snap locks"" (not sold by Shure - but also available on Amazon for $8.95). The trouble is, my $99 headphones now have cost me over $125 with shipping. So what do you get for $125?

The Pros:

* Quality construction and durability * Fairly precise separation between instruments, and quite good vocal reproduction * Decent soundstage (a sense of the instruments and/or musicians being in distinct places on the stage) * Generally non fatiguing listening

The Cons:

* Ouch. Fairly extensive modifications necessary to make the headphones comfortable (at least for me). These are supposed to be ""studio"" headphones. What gives? * Overall pretty flat sound reproduction. Hearing these 'phones will not knock you out of your chair - but they certainly won't make you wince either. * Depending on the source, the highs can be both ""bright"" and ""mushy"". This description sounds contradictory, but I feel it's accurate. Cymbals, horns, and other instrumental treble can be somewhat harsh and tinny - but at the same time ill-defined and ""smeared.""

For those who are wondering, I'm powering these phones with an HRT Headstreamer headphone amp/DAC - so they should be getting sufficient boost (and digital music should be smoothed out).

The Bottom Line:

I may have been a bit harsh in my description of these 'phones since I am used to the true audiophile-quality pair that I use for home listening. If you've been listening to your music and video on a pair of $14 earbuds, these Shures will be a very substantial upgrade, no doubt. For $99 bucks, they seem like a pretty decent deal - although when you add the expense of new ear cups and headband, it becomes a somewhat less obvious call. Other people really love these 'phones - and after a ""burn-in"" period, I may find there's more to enjoy."
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as monitor headphones for my small recording studio. I had another pair of isolation headphones, but these are better and the others are now backup units, or engineer units, because these isolate the monitor sound on performers _really_ effectively - sound goes in performers' ears and _not_ your mics. If you've ever had a click track bleed through to your microphone - or even had to work to prevent it - get a pair of these and relax.

And that's with the standard pads, too - the ones that come with the 440. A lot of people swap out the higher-end pads for comfort, but I find these pads perfectly acceptable, and as before, the sound containment is just great. I haven't had the weight problem others have mentioned, but I take my headset off whenever I can - too much headgear time can damage your hearing, and nobody needs _that_. I could see the top padding being inadequate for long-term wearing, though.

These aren't my listening-for-pleasure headphones, but that's not what they're for; they don't do any of the sound sweetening you're used to hearing on home headsets. But when mixing an album, _you don't want that kind of help_. You want to sound good _without_ that, and that's what these are for. They have the nice flat, even reference sound - similar to my studio flat reference speakers, tho' not _as_ flat - which you need for recording. In short, they do what they say on the tin: they're studio reference headsets. Not pleasure-listening headsets. And for that job, they're great."
9,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these headphones back in May 2012 as they were the cheapest headphones that had a detachable cable. I'm not a big audiophile, but these headphones sound good, and I've had too many pairs of Sennheisers die on me from faulty cables.

As of this writing (Dec 2013) the cable still has no issues. I have, however, broken one of the joints in the headband that allow the cups to fold/articulate for comfort. I was able to superglue an extremely tiny plastic piece together and rebuild the headphones almost as they were. This patch has held for a few months, but I expect this point of failure will be the death of these headphones. This same weak point maybe the source of several of the 1-star reviews. I do emphasize tiny: There are two screws in a couple mm wide piece of plastic that hold the joint together, and supergluing the plastic together without accidentally glueing the join shut was quite infuriating.

I still will keep the review at 4 stars, despite having to do a repair since I like how these headphones sound, find them otherwise comfortable, and frankly, my other headphones (mostly Sennheisers) have all died entirely far sooner than these, all from their integrated wiring.

Last thought: The coiled cable that comes with this is quite long. It can easy stretch 7-8 ft, but after that it starts to pull an awkward bit of tension. I find though this is a good length for desk usage since you can stand up and stretch without needing to take them off."
10,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality - lasted me about a year and decided to buy another pair that works beautifully. Sound quality is great and the comfort leaves a little to be desired, as it can get a little uncomfortable if you keep them on long enough, but in my mind the quality of the sound is enough to make up for this. The cord is long enough to let you move around with relative freedom without feeling like you're going to get unplugged or erode the wires."
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound fantastic. Much better sound than many Bose or Beats headphones that cost hundreds more. These are very highly rated elsewhere on the internet and didn't disappoint. I still use them today. Shure makes very high quality headphones and microphones.
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great for the price. They remind me of the Bose Triports I used to own, but with way more definition and clarity in the mids/upper range.

It's hard to find headphones are a well balanced. I listen to a wide variety of music, and I've yet to find a piece that doesn't sound great.

My only complaint (minor as it is) is the cable. It's coiled. Unless your connection is right next to you, the tension on the cable causes a slight (or more) tugging sensation on your head/neck. It's minor and easily corrected with an extension cable."
13,5.0 out of 5 stars,"(just sayin these are my first pair of monitor headphones)
ya my first BUT i have listened to ALOT of head phones including: sony giiq, sennheiser, bose, philips, and crappy beats by dre. i owned the sony bose and philips and these are the best of all. if your looking in the range of $50-150 get these. if your thinking about beats NO NO NO NO $300 for head phones that suck worse than sony giiq's. no JUST NOOO

14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I *love* my new 440's. They're exactly what I was looking for in a circumaural design.

Pros:
-Frequency response is phenomenal. Only a hardcore audio engineer could find a flaw in these.
-Removable cable! I think this is an undervalued attribute. If the cable accidentally gets cut, you can just replace it for about $10. It locks into the left earpice, is think and beefy, has a big fat strain relief on the plug end, and has a useful coil in the middle. A 1/4in adapter screws (yes, screws) onto the end.
-Closed design: When fit snuggly on your head, there is very little bleed out. I can listen loud without fear of disturbing others in a quiet room. Good external noise cancellation, too, although this was not expected.

Cons:
-The cushions. They were WAY too shallow for my head. That is to say, they fit *around* my ears just fine, there's just not enough *depth* inside. My ears would get squished up against the sharp plastic grill inside because the cushions were not think enough. There is a very, very thin layer of material which goes over the drivers, but not enough to make a difference.

*** Worth noting: I told Shure about the cushions and the pain that I was enduring when wearing these, and inquired about buying a thicker pair of pads. They responded the next day and shipped me a pair of pads from their most expensive headphones (880's, I think?). These are MUCH better, featuring a slightly squisher and thicker pad, as well as a nice thick layer of foam stuff which covers up the plastic grill. KUDOS TO YOU, Shure!!!!

Highly recommended, as long as you can get your hands on the better pads. Or, if you have really small ears which don't stick out from your head too far.

5 stars, because of the Shure customer service."
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not what most people would call an audiophile, but I do love my music. I listen to speed/thrash/death metal and lots of different genres of techno. There are a few other types of music thrown in there, but this is the majority of what I've listened to through these phones, so far.

My previous pair of headphones were by Creative. They were not bad. But these Shures absolutely blow them out of the water! I'm hearing parts of the music I had never heard before. The richness of any song made with decent studio equipment is just awesome.

I listen to music through my PC with a Creative X-Fi sound card. I know that this can introduce a lot of ""noise"" in the music. Frankly, I've never noticed it. The Shures do not amplify this, either (although, I may just be deaf to it...?).

With the equalizer set to ""flat"", I get very good bass from the techno, but the solos in the metal also sound really crisp. Also, the crushing power riffs in the metal are extremely satisfying.

I just want to finish by saying that there have been several times while listening to music and doing something else (surfing the web or reading) I would stop what I was doing and just sit in absolute awe of the sound quality coming out of these earphones. These make me wish I had plunked down the cash for a quality pair of headphones much, much sooner in my life.

I hope you enjoy them as much as I do, if that's even possible. XD"
16,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones to replace a broken pair of ATH-M50 headphones. The ATH-M50 headphones sound great, but I wanted to see if these could perform just as well for a fairly cheaper price (about $50 cheaper. I got these for about $75). Here are my conclusions:

- I found that the clarity of the SRH440 is equal to that of the ATH-M50.
- The SRH440 has better sound dampening. Less sound escapes the earcups.
- The SRH440 has an awesome detachable cable and has a strong build. These seem like they will last for a while.
- The comfort level is on par, or even better than cans in this price range. Sliding adjusters make it easy to find the best comfort. The ATH-M50 swivels in more directions than the SRH440, but that does not take anything away from the 440s for me.

- The ATH-M50 has stronger bass that also reaches lower levels, although statistically, the SRH440 has a wider frequency range which could reach lower lows than the ATH-M50.
- The most significant difference to me is the sound stage (spatial interpretation of instruments). The ATH-M50 has a slightly recessed midrange that, In my opinion, gives the vocals a instruments a more natural and pleasing sound. This doesn't take away how great the SRH440 sounds, but sometimes it feels a bit more in your head than spaced out.

Overall, I rate these a 4 out of 5 because they outperform many headphones in this price range. The the only gripe I have about these headphones is that the soundstage is not that great."
17,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, these headphones sound great. Bass is slightly recessed, but still very present and well-reproduced, just not overpowering (if you're used to headphones like the Beats By Dre, you might think that they have weak bass).

Unfortunately, in order to make these headphones even remotely comfortable, you're going to need to spend another $30 or so to modify them.

The headband is made of not-terribly-soft rubber, wrapped in pleather. This is nowhere near as comfortable as an actual cushion. Since there is not much clamping force from the earpads, the headphones slide down and the band feels like it's trying to make an indentation in the top of your head. My solution: I attached a Sennheiser HD580 headband cushion (Part Number H-52715) to the underside of the headband with velcro tape. It made them INFINITELY more comfortable.

A lot of people complain that the earpads are uncomfortable. Personally, I didn't think they were too bad, but I still went ahead and replaced them with SRH840 earpads (Part Number HPAEC840). They've given the headphones a nice cushy feel - though personally, I don't think that the sound has changed noticeably (some have reported that it increases bass and mellows high frequencies). Softness-wise, the 440 pads could be likened to three-day-old bread; the 840 pads are like a fresh loaf of bread.

After these modifications, my 440s are every bit as comfortable as the JVC HA-RX700's they replaced, but with crisper sound and much better midrange reproduction.

EDIT 10/4/11 - After a few months of use, these headphone remain comfortable with the modifications I made. However, I find myself wishing they had more bass. Enough so to it's a bit annoying to me. Turning the volume high enough for decent bass results in overpowering ear-stabbing highs. Overall, the SRH440s are still more enjoyable than the JVC HA-RX700 for music, but I think the much-cheaper JVCs were actually a bit better for movies & gaming."
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll preface this by saying that I don't know if I should call myself an audiophile or not, but I definitely hear and appreciate quality. I can still hear the full range I should be able to and have tested that up to 20khz. It only got painful, not quieter. :)

I received these headphones recently and have been trying them out for all kinds of music, from piano by Glass through Mozart through Daft Punk, The Glitch Mob, various top 40 tracks and various scores and soundtracks.

Bass:
I have read a lot of reviews that said that these headphones are light on bass. First let me add my two cents on that one. These headphones have plenty of bass. I have to wonder if the people who said it wasn't really there have some minor hearing loss. Nothing against them, but if you value clarity and not just bass then these are probably the right pick for you. I have listened to Klipsch, and similarly priced Sennheisers and those were lighter on clarity and heavy on bass. In my personal opinion, too much bass can make even clear mids sound muddled.

Clarity:
These headphones, as others have pointed out, have really brought out color in the music and subtle details that are lost in most headphones and earphones I've listened to. You can hear everything, from the change of direction of a bow on a string to the click of the c or k sound in a singer's throat. I've actually started listening for those details and have found detail within sounds in synth and artists like eDiT that I never knew were there. It enhances the visceral experience of the music.

Burn-in:
I haven't burned these in yet and from what I understand, they will get even better when they do.

Comfort:
I can see that over long periods, the headband may not be the most comfortable thing in the world compared to some of the others that I've tried. It hasn't been a problem for me though, but then again, it's hard to find something that's so uncomfortable that it bothers me without actually causing soreness or pain.

Concerns:
I am so far only a little concerned with the exposed wires just above each of the cans. These won't be used outside the house though, so it may be just fine. It would worry me more if they were going to be used on the go.

Portability:
They're not. Don't even try."
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first started using the SRH-440s, I was a little bit underwhelmed. After burning them in, they were spectacular.

SOUND

1. They are very well balanced, the highs aren't too high, the lows aren't too low. Everything is in harmony with each other.

2. The bass is perfect and there when it should be.

3. The noise isolation is very effective. Jumping from a pair of noise-cancelling Bose or the well branded Beats to these is barely noticeable. You won't get distracted by any outside noise.

4. I recommend burning these in, when I first got them sometimes the same sound or song would sound different. Now everything sounds pretty good and consistent, so I would definitely burn them in before regular use.

COMFORT

I got the SRH-840 pads as suggested by other comments. Haven't used the 440 pads period. The 840 pads are very comfortable for long sessions. They are't very heavy and won't weigh you down on their own, but the coil cable is long and adds a bit of weight. The band isn't really noticeable, which is good. It sits comfortably on my head, and I have a big head. There is plenty of room for even bigger heads as well.

VALUE

These headphones are an incredible value. They sound fantastic, are noise isolating (and compete with expensive noise-cancelling headphones), have a perfect amount of bass, are comfortable (especially with the 840 pads), and are under $100.

If you're just an amateur who wants a pair of headphones that an audiophile would find impressive but don't want to break the bank, go with these.

If you're looking for a good set of monitoring headphones on a budget, look no further. These are an impressive set of headphones. go get em!"
20,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lets start off saying that Shure said they were going to have my headphones shipped out on the 6-11 with a normal shipping option. They shipped it to me on the fourth.
That was a nice surprise. Now if your going to buy these headphones for long flights or long car rides forget it. There comfortable for about 40 minutes then they start to hurt. The sound quality on these are fantastic but you pay for it in bulk. There comparable to Bose headphones and are just what you would expect from Shure's other line of products. The durability on them seem to be good but I don't to test it's limits. It could probably survive a 1 story drop. If I were to do it over I would probably buy the SRH 240's or the SRH 740 DJ's.
Over all real good in sound, quality and durability accept for the bulk."
21,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The brightness of the audio is over exaggerated, I really like the removable cable-/it would be nice if it came with a second cable that was straight,more suitable when recording as they are usually longer and less apt to get tangled.
At about the same price Sennheiser HD 280 pro sounds more balanced and has good isolation."
22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"really liked them!!! they're not that expensive, they have excellent noise cancelling and their portability is great, loved the design. they have a standard 3.5 mm jack, but come with a 6.5 mm adapter (which i lost, but you can but buy'em shure hpaqa1), which is a great feature."
23,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these after my sony's fell apart. I still use these after two years. Keeps most of the outside noise out.

24,5.0 out of 5 stars,I hook up these baby and alli hear is music from ipod or music from my amp. The best part is..when the eife is babbling all i see is her mouth moving and i hear nothing!! the noise cancellation is by far the best ive tried yet.. The bose are good but this shure set is much better
25,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am no way an audiophile, but these 'phones have completely opened up music to me. I can differentiate instruments much better then my 20$ Panasonic headphones ever could, and music just sounds ""better"" now than it used to. Build quality is great from my (limited) experience they feel solid the cord is very nice. On the negative side they are still quite tight for my head and are quite heavy making somewhat discomforting for long periods of use (4+ hours).

All-in-all a great ""first"" pair of real 'phones."
26,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I greatly enjoyed the sound of these headphones. They provide excellent noise isolation (from outside sounds) without being tight on the ears, and the sound is crisp & clear, but not harsh. Unfortunately after 1/2 hour the ear pads were pushing my glasses earpieces into my ears & head such that the combination created a very uncomfortable (hurting, even) area between my ears & head. I tried them with my glasses off for a little while, and they were much more comfortable, but still pushed on the top of my ears a bit. Perhaps my ears are just too big for these headphones. The headband isn't the most comfortable either, and pushed on my head uncomfortably after about 1/2 hour. I imagine that could be remedied after some additional adjustments. The quality & build is very high, as is the sound quality. So - final words - excellent sound & isolation, NOT good for glasses wearers."
27,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wanted a newer pair of headphones for listening to music and TV. My old 70's Koss earphones were very outdated in sound and quality. These are wonderful. Comfortable, great sound, and fold for storage. Nice long cord. I bought a y adapter so my wife can plug in her Bose and I can plug my Shure when watching movies to hear better. I think my Shure sound better than her Bose. I am very happy with them."
28,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones and I'm glad I bought them. I did a lot of research and felt like these were arguably the best pair for under $100 (at least on paper). I've had them a month or so and listened to them for many hours and they sound great. They're very clear and crisp and I like the noise cancellation. The default bass is just slightly flat for some types of music, but I still think you won't find anything close for this price. If you use any type of equalization then you can really do some cool things with theses. I wear these at work and people come up to me all the time and ask where I got them and if they can try them out and they love them too."
29,1.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones broke after 7 months of light use . Made with cheep plastic for $99 they should last longer . Would not buy again !!!
30,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have good sound quality (although I'm not an audiophile), are sturdily constructed, and look good. Unfortunately, there is almost no padding where it touches the top of the head, making it uncomfortable as soon as I put it on (I have a shaved head). There is also almost no padding on the ear cup rims; I wouldn't say it's uncomfortable there, but I would definitely prefer more.

I bought Koss headphones for much less (10 years ago) and their padding was ideal. These Shure headphones will go in the closet as soon as I get my next set."
31,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great, but there are two things that I wish were different:
1. I wish there was more cushion underneath the headband. After wearing them for a while the top of my head begins to get a bit sensitive. That might sound trivial, but I find myself shifting the headset slightly to relieve the pressure on the top of my head.
2. I thought that being an over the ear type unit it would insulate me from hearing distractions more than they actually do. I've tested noise-cancelling headsets and wasn't overly impressed with them either though."
32,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, and a step up from the SRH240."
33,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality, went to a music shop and listened to pair after pair of headphones. These had the best clarity in my opinion. Everything is super crisp (dynamics on drums and cymbals, guitars, etc. come through really well). A bit less bass response than most of the others I tried, but worth it for the clarity.

I've had my for at least a couple of years now and use them pretty regularly and they're holding up well."
34,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid headset. Great for recording and listening to music. Certainly one of the better general consumer headphones. If you're an audiophile however, you might want to look at a more expensive model by Shure, AT or Grado."
35,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my new SRH440s today, and have had them on my head for about an hour. They are amazing. From sound quality (remember, this is WITHOUT burn in), to feel on my head to the feel in my hands, I feel as though they are the best headphones in their class, and reaching well above it.

I have listened to the same recordings (CD quality) on AKG 702s, and frankly, they sound about the same (a little stronger bass on the Shures) and the Shures feel a lot better on the head, and in the hand.

They are overall a very well built set of phones, and extremely comfortable on the head.

I picked them up for $88 plus shipping, whereas the AKGs were 3 times that.

A no brainer if you dont want to spend a ton of money, but still get a great product."
36,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphones sounds great (very good balanced, no so much bass neither treble), it has been my office`s companion for almost 4 years. Maybe the only complain until it worked was the weight, its a little heavy and no so much portable, thats why the main use of it in my case was at the office.
Well after 4 years using it in my office frequently it is broken without no reason, just the bolts of the right side was broken. Its a shame because these still sound great."
37,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones produce very good and clear sound. I've been using them for playing games at night and unlike other gaming headsets I've tried, these do not produce excessive bass, just the right amount."
38,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound good and are pretty comfortable, but I've had two pairs break at the hinge after a year or more of normal use. I like them, but I probably won't buy a third pair."
39,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is very much to my liking, a bit softer, not harsh. At the same time the headphones are clear and detailed. I am using them with the 840 series ear cushions. The cushions definitely improve comfort so that I can wear them for hours without any problems. I also don't have problems with the top of the headphones pressing against my head as others have also pointed out (though I do have a small head).

Some have also expressed concern about the lack of bass. To me they have just the right amount of bass. And it's tight, not boomy like the Sony XB500's. The 840 series pads also increase the amount of bass without making it too boomy.

I tried various popular Sony headphones before I bought these... XB500 & XB700 sounded too muddy in the mids and too boomy and loose in the bass. The MDR-V6 sounded a bit too harsh in the highs for my liking. The Shures are perfect.

Definitely buy the pads: [...]"
40,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a huge fan of Shure. These are some great headphones for such a price. You definitely could not find anything better than this in the same price range. Shure obviously wins. As a bass guitarist I find the bass response pretty solid. Some headphones tend to over emphasize on its bass, which is sometimes too much and unbalances the music. This pair of headphones has a solid bass and a bright treble."
41,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I tested the Sennheiser HD 429 side-by-side against the Shure SRH 440, and the Sennheiser won out, in my opinion. I wrote up the full review over on the Sennheiser HD 429 page, so check that out.

However, I will say that it was by no means a hands-down victory. I am not an audiophile, just a regular guy that listens to my iphone at work. For me, the sound quality was equal, with the Sennheisers delivering more bass. But you can easily adjust that by changing the equalizer setting on your iphone or ipod.

For me, the difference came down to 2 things: The Sennheisers were more comfortable and had better noise isolation.

Overall, though, I think both headphones were great, and you'll be happy with either set."
42,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had two pair of these headphones, and although the sound is excellent, they break after a year of use. The break right at their joint with the Swivel and earphone cup. Note that both pairs broke just after the warranty period had expired. Where I like the sound, I am moving on to another manufacturer."
43,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SRH440s are a great sounding sturdy pair of headphones. The sound is overall a very bright but very clear. The highs and mids are emphasized over bass but the bass is definitely present without any muddling. They are good for watching movies and listening to music without the need of an added amplifier (of course using an amp improves the sound but its pretty solid without one). The 440s have pretty good imaging as well.

Pros:
Clear and Clean Sound
Price, good bang for your buck
Carrying case
1/4' adapter
Durability

Cons:
Little wire that sticks out to connect the right earcup (hope it doesn't catch something).
Weight. They are heavy and can get uncomfortable after extended use.
Ear cushions aren't the softest but they suffice.

Overall:
I highly recommend these and would buy them again in a heartbeat. They're a great pair of cans."
44,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very clean and you can hear a lot of definition in the music. Also quality construction. I did read that some people didn't like the bass. However, when I play audio that has great bass, it sounds great in these headphones."
45,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are comfortable for long hours of listening and adjust nicely to the head for a good fit(I have a small head). The sound quality is excellent with a good balance of frequencies from low to high. In listening to a CD of the Boston Pops I feel I'm sitting in the best seats of Symphony Hall. The quality of construction is excellent and appears to be a long lasting construction. I feel that for the price and quality this is an excellent purchase.
46,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for anyone who appreciates a wide variety of musical styles.

A note for casual listeners; these are flat mix headphones, which means they don't boost the bass like a lot of popular brands do. If you don't really care about the artist's version of how a song should sound, and just want something to blast your top40 garbage, these probably aren't the right headphones for you.

These are solid in construction and very durable. This is my second pair, my first lasted me about 3 years and only broke due to my carelessness. The sound quality is great, the range is great, and I find them quite comfortable. I have worn them for 6+ hours without getting a headache or sore ears."
47,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I read all about these headphones and watched video reviews on the internet and tried to learn everything I could about the sound quality, value, comfort, and durability before I bought these. When I got them I was so excited to wear them, but as soon as I put them on, I hated them. Even with the excellent sound quality, you can't listen to them if you can't wear them comfortably. I strongly recommend going to a store where you can try them on before you wear them, because I could not stand the fact that the tips of my ears touched the inside cloth (which was supposed to protect your ears from sliding along the plastic interior and instead did nothing). I definitely have slightly bigger ears than the average person, but nothing even approaching ridiculously large. I sent these back immediately, and have learnt my lesson on trying something on before I order it."
48,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought two of these for two of my sons. They both wear them often, for long periods of time, without complaint, so they must be comfortable. Nothing has broken. I appreciate the replaceable cord, as I expect that the cord is the most likely part to fail. The sound quality is the best of any headphones I have used, but bear in mind that I have not used any high end audiophile headphones. Plenty of bang for the buck in this item."
49,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This headphones are amazing, they go very well with pretty much all types of music. The bass is there when it needs to, and the mids and highs are beautiful, even listening to movies or audiobooks, the clarity and depth in detail of what you are listening is incredible. It's made with really good materials and they are very comfortable. You won't regret buying this because it's totally worth the money. Is a perfect investment for people who really want to apreciate music the way musicians meant to."
50,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones for their price. Can actually surpass many pricier ones. Just the band is way too stiff. The era pad crack in about eight months. The plastic will crack too with time where the ear pad connects to the band, but still it is quite sturdily built, you shan't be worried about breaking them if you drop the unconsciously on the floor. But the sound quality is qualitative: even, sturdy, frequency-proportionate sound."
51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted studio headphones that I could mix with in my home studio, and these were a perfect fit. They don't manipulate the sound one bit, so when you're mixing, what you hear is truly what you get. Mine are still working fine after all these years! Would definitely recommend these for any serious musicians wanting to get 0% manipulated sound for premium mixing."
52,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This item is great for me, I use it mostly when listening to music and watching videos. The sound quality is awesome and I like that the cable is coiled to keep it from being all over the place.
Still the cable could be shorter and the headphones begin to hurt my ears after long periods of wearing them (about 3-4 hours).
overall great headphones."
53,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones, sound is great (as expected from all the reviews I found online). They're a bit heavy so I can feel the pressure on my head and ears after a while of wearing them but it's no big deal (this would have taken off half a star but Amazon won't let me do that). The heaviness also gives them a sturdy feel and they are padded which helps. They go all around my ears so they're truly closed and don't really allow sound to leak in or out too much. Since the cord comes off and they bend they are pretty portable. Overall I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good pair of headphones."
54,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Can't complain, because for the price they sound just fine. The construction is less rugged than I would have expected from Shure, and even though the cable is removable, it's specific to this device. It would have been nice if it was a standard 1/8th inch connector on both ends, so if it breaks, I don't need to buy that specific cable from Shure.

The sound is a very flat response which is great, especially if you want to do mixing. However, it would be difficult to wear these for very extending mixing sessions because the head strap needs better padding.

All in all, I've always liked Shure products and this is no exception. In this price range it's a nice pair of headphones that would have no problem owning again."
55,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome sound while playing my drums.
Comfortable too."
56,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good value. Comfortable, good sound quality."
57,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Did a lot of research prior to dropping what seemed like a ton of money for a set of headphones. The Shure SRH440 has not disappointed. Amazing sound right out of the box...although the sound has improved after 25 hours or so of burn in. I don't think you could find a better sounding set of headphones in this price range ($93 delivered). Really like the ability to change the cable and ear pieces if necessary. They seem very durable. And they are very comfortable. I wore them the whole way on a flight from Honolulu to Chicago and they felt comfortable the whole way

My only knock would be that they are very large headphones. Not really a big deal for me, but may be for some.

Bottom line: If you are in the market for a great set of headphones for under $200, the Shure SRH440 should be on you short list. SIMPLY AMAZING!!"
58,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A great product. Just received headphones and burning them in as I type. Amazon delivery was impeccable as always and product got here 4 days ahead of schedule. I have big ears so I was very worried about comfort. I've tried Audio Technica M50's and they were way too heavy. The SRH440 is reasonably comfortable without having the headphones practically about to fall off your head. In terms of audio quality, the highs are a little lacking BUT this is right out of the box so that's a given. It's ok for general listening although I'd advise using an amp. The main reason I got these were to practice on my guitar without disturbing my roomies. No sound leakage thus far and does a good job isolating noise. Not exactly earplugs but it does block out most noise when something is playing."
59,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did weeks of research trying to find perfect ""cans"". I finally decided on these over the Sony V6 and Sennheiser HD 280. I also considered the Grado line but went with closed, and Grados are open. These are my first quality pair of headphones so I don't have much to compare. I use them with my Macbook and iphone and they sounds great with both. The seem durable and that is the major reason I decided against the Bose around the ear headphones - too many people had complained about the durability, and these Shure's are like half the price.

I listen to mostly rock with some hip hop mixed in, and like I said, these headphones sound great. My friend who does some home studio work has the Sennheiser 280s and said these Shure's sounded good.

If you're having a hard time deciding which to get, just go with the best price and whatever you feel drawn to, because any pair that's at least $75 will sound good. Get what you think will make you happy. If you're interested in the Shure 440s, you won't be disappointed."
60,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is absolutely amazing. However, I found the headband uncomfortable after about 3 hours. Another problem is I wear glasses which makes it uncomfortable to use all day.

After 100 hours burn, the headphone sound better, I learn to listen the sound that I've missing before with this headphone and after buy the expensive one (Beats studio Hi Def and Bose QC15) both of them was great but better than this one less than 15%."

64,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones almost 6 months ago and have loved them since I took them out of the box. The price has gone up some since I purchased them but when I bought them they were a steal at about $70.

The quality is on par with other higher priced headphones I have tried out at stores, and although they don't have electronic noise-cancelling, they do a GREAT job of physically isolating you from other sounds. I simply cannot hear anyone that is trying to talk to me with them on, and I don't consider myself as someone who ""Blasts"" their music.

The build quality could be a little nicer, but I guess that is where the the bargain price shows itself. However, they have proved to be very durable and fold up nicely into the included carrying bag.

Overall I am VERY satisfied with these cans and would recommend them to anyone."

68,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great!!!

I was looking for a good pair of headphones for a while now. After doing much research on the various Skull Candy and Beats models, I found a recommendation to check these out. First I must say that there is a reason that this model had only 4 and 5 star reviews. These are excellent! They sound great with music and videos. I listen to mostly R&B, Raggae and Rap and they performed fantastic with all Genres! An added plus to these is the ability to block exterior noise. They were not advertised as noise cancelling but they do a great job at it. I really cant even hear myself talk. The price was also a great selling point.

If your looking for a pair of good all around headphones, these are them! I am hooked!!!"
69,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great studio headphones. Good flat response. Flat is good people. Especially if you are mixing and recording. If you want something that boosts the highs and low and makes everything sound like a pop hip hop record don't buy these.
70,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So originally I had picked up a paid of Sennheiser HD 280 pros. I used it for work as I was working on audio and video. That head set sounded great at the time.

Now I'm at a new job but I wanted to bring my HD 280's to work so that I can listen to music and work at the same time. This meant I had to buy a new pair for home usage.

So I picked up the SRH440's. After reading reviews, I decided what could I lose.

It finally came in and I immediately plugged it in to my computer and started listening to tunes. I have to say, this headset is ULTRA CLEAR, it doesn't have the bass of the HD280's but that's okay, the clarity on these headphones rock!

73,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are a great deal. They are professional quality and I'm very happy with them. I use them for shooting video interviews, editing video on my laptop, and have even used them in a pinch when I needed to review music on my phone."

76,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound kicks in and out, sometimes all sound is in the left headphone, sometimes all sound is on the right. I am constantly having to twist the headphone jack to get even sound in both ears, with any source. I have to twist the jack when listenin to my iPhone, when listening through my PC or docking station at work, and when listening on my personal laptop at home. This has been a problem for over a year now, incredibly disappointed in these headphones.

UPDATE
thanks to the removable cord, I was able to switch it out for a replacement also from Shure and also purchased on Amazon. I chose the non-coiled version, it cost under $20 and now these headphones work again! Wish I had thought of that sooner, also wish the original purchase any so fragile. I'm not putting any strain on these headphones so there's no reason the cord it came with bends to the point of unusablility in less than 6 MONTHS. Anyway, rating has been updated from 1 to 3 stars."
77,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these phones. Comfortable and top-of-the-line construction.
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed an upgrade to my old headphones that (admittedly) I got at a garage sale. Nice full size headphones but the cable was getting damaged and had that annoying volume control feature. I think its cool but at the same time stupid because I find it the first thing to go. I fought with them for a while until I finally had it. So I went looking for an upgrade that would cater closely to what I'm doing more nowadays, that is home/studio listening for enjoyment and music production. I live in a rather noisy area where I hear the fire trucks and ambulances coming and going regularly and among other things. So I needed a pair of closed-back headphones for isolation as I find the sound reproduction of noise canceling headphones to not be as accurate and nowhere near this price range. I also wanted a set that offered the replaceable cable and ear cups option as decent headphones can last a long time but these two parts always wear out before decent drivers do. Amazingly enough I discovered the Shure SRH 440's. I got everything I was looking for. These are really nice headphones for what they're designed for (e.g. home/studio listening). These might not appeal to people used to higher end equipment but as a start into the world of detail and sound resolution it's wonderful for the price.

There are drawbacks that I feel some people miss about these. These don't have much bass impact (e.g. you don't really feel an explosion so much as hear it.) The sound signature is a rich neutral (e.g. it strives for balance and clarity, middle of the road). They are not really made to be run by Iphones and Ipods. These guys need a little more power to drive them to their full abilities with a headphone amplifier. They sound good unamped but sound their best amped. One other thing is these sound particularly tight and bright out of the box. There's nothing wrong with them because they need to be ""broken-in."" Some people like the sound from the get go, but for me it took a little getting used to. Over time the drivers have been slowly relaxing and loosening up making it sound even better with time. If your looking for nice pair of headphones that will last and deliver great sound, these are a nice choice at this price bracket.

PROS
+ Marvelous sound that is balanced and clear. - Even at really low volumes (while amped) I can still hear amazing detail.
+ Great isolation. - I don't hear the traffic anymore with these on and I'm not cranking these. I listen at very moderate levels.
+ Removable cable for cable replacement. (Or to change to a higher grade audio cable)
+ Solid build. Can fold up for easy transport and storage.
+ Gold-plated Plugs (For signal efficiency.) 3.5MM with a screw on 1/4 plug.
+ Full-size over the ear cups.

CONS
- Shallow cushions - The rim of my ear rests against the drivers. Depending on position can become uncomfortable.
- Shallow Headband cushion - There is some cushioning but mostly to cover up the inside parts.
For me it gets a little uncomfortable in certain positions but once I find the spot I'm content.

As these aren't powerhouse audiophile headphones, they don't require a serious amplifier to run them.
If your a budding audiophile, spend a little more on your headphone amp and you'll be happier for it.

My experience (if you wish to know)

Putting these on and turning on the music is like being transported. I found myself relishing music even more through these as I began to hear it in a whole new way. I enjoy all kinds of music from Metal, Classical, Folk, World, Electronic and Alternative. When I put on Vivaldi: Four Seasons (FLAC format), I couldn't believe my ears. The clarity and beauty of this music resonated out of drivers with such detail. The descents and ascents of the lows to highs and back were a treat. String instruments sound incredible in these as well (Violin, Acoustic Guitar, Cello). One thing is you'll notice the quality of your music more. You'll hear the effects of the poor sound reproduction in the higher compression formats. However, you'll also notice other parts of the music that cheaper headphones can't reproduce when listening to CD's. Some music will be more appealing in these than others. Mostly music that relies more on its musical detail (Classical, New Age, Flamenco) than impact."
79,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality that these headphones can produce is great. When plugged into a computer, TV, iPod, or receiver, they sound excellent. The full ear cups can cancel out a lot of surrounding noise, but not all since they aren't noise-canceling. I'm a little disappointed at how they sound plugged into my Peavey amp. The main reason I ordered these was because I live in an apartment and wanted to be able to play my electric guitar later at night without disturbing the neighbors. Unfortunately, the sound that the amp speaker produces is far better than the sound quality of the headphones when plugged into the amp, and it's not an expensive amp or speaker in it. All the tones sound a lot muddier and muffled with the headphones in the amp. Then again it could just be the amp..."
80,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is nice and balanced. The mids and highs are clear even in higher volume levels. These headphones are not for people who like a lot of bass in their music. It's very balanced, but full. The cable is about 4 and a half feet long coiled.
I bought these for $68.95 which are the best headphones in that price range. The higher price nowadays makes these a deal breaker since the materials aren't durable.

4 year UPDATE: The fake leather that is used on the head band began to come off. It became very brittle after a while and the smallest scrape would tear it. As for the sound, it is still as great as ever which is fantastic. Unfortunately, I end up with a bunch of leather droppings on my head after I use them so they are probably going to the trash. I have now switched my 5 star rating to a 3. Don't expect them to last forever!

Update2: I purchased another pair and about a year later, the leather around the headband is beginning to crack as well. Terrible."
81,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I first saw these phones in a magazine a couple of month's ago, did some research, and finally made my decision. And wow! Just got them today, and I am in awe. I'm rocking out with them right now. Build quality, sound, comfort... for the price, these cans are beyond my expectations. If you're looking some great phones, get this guy!

My only gripe is the cable. Some great big coiled thing, doesn't seem quite ideal to rock while on the move (at school, while walking, etc. Can't really tuck them under my shirt).
And the sound quality is so good I can hear all the flaws in my low quality music copies. Looks like I'll have to buy my music now... :-(

84,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The SRH440 Headphones are middle of the road quality. I expected a higher, audio quality. With technology improvements in fidelity equipment today, and, especially with Shure, I was expecting more from these headphones. These headphones are OK, but, if you are seeking a higher quality set, you will need to try Beyer Dynamics, for example."
85,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Somewhat heavy, not to burdensome for a 16yr old kid. Sound quality is good, definitly worth the $67 I paid. Not very bass heavy for those who love Bass, but to me they feel just right.

External
Ear pads are extremely comfortable and they rotat just in case it gets sweaty.
The top of the headset is some sort of leather and feels like a pillow.
The plastic is high quality plastic and it does not wobble alot
It folds and fits into a nice leather suede case, but it is not a type of headphone where you can just toss it into a backpack and expect it to work.
these headphones are best suitable at home when your sitting and wantign to listen to music

Good"
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,4 years later they may sound better than they did when I purchased these
87,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well the most important part about any set of headphones is the overall sound. And Shure hit the nail on the head in that regard. With deep bass, that actually sounds like bass notes and is not booming, clear mids and highs the sound of these phones is superb! The only reason i did not give them 5 stars is because of their bulky design and weight as their a bit heavy. However they are quite comfortable. For about a 100 bucks you really can't go wrong, especially if ""sound"" is your first priority. I would definately recomend these to anyone who really loves music, and wants high end audiofile sound at a reasonable price."
88,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very listenable, reasonably-priced headphones. I own these and, a Grado SR80i, and Sennheiser HD600 headphones. These are connected to a Nuforce Icon-uDAC2 headphone amp. In comparison with the similarly-priced Grado cans, the SRH440 are a sealed back design. The cable for the Shures has a coiled end and can be replaced. The Grados have a straight cable.
You won't hear much outside the Shures even at the lowest volume levels. This allows office mates to sneak up on you and the phone just disappears. Also, folks outside can't hear much from your listening with the Shures unless you have the volume up THAT LOUD. Both the Shures and the Grados will play THAT LOUD (but you shouldn't do that to yourself if you plan to keep your hearing).
Both headphones are comfortable. I found the Shures have the edge with very plush pleather ear pads. In fact, the Grados can actually be somewhat uncomfortable with glasses on. The Shures give me ""headphone hair"" like no other headphone I have.
Both headphones sound fantastic. I can't imagine regretting purchasing either pair. And, while your experience will vary, I found the bass on the Shures to be preferable, the upper midrange on the Grados was smoother. The Shures have a flashy presentation compared to the Grados and their balanced sound. I have compared both to the HD600. The Grados are closer to the Sennheisers. So close, as a matter of fact, that it's kinda difficult to justify the extra cash of the Sennheisers.
So, if you're looking for a pair of headphones for around $100, these are both excellent choices. The Shure SRH440 will give you isolation, comfort, and lively sound. The sound of the Grado SR80i is so smooth one could listen to them all day."
89,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a long time fan of the MDR-V6, but after a pair were stolen at school, I decided to mix it up because these were available for $76. I love these headphones. They have a much better sound stage than the V6s and I feel like the highs are a bit crisper. The detachable cable is amazing too. These headphones will likely replace the V6/7506 as the go to sub $150 headphones. They definately live up to Shure's name and are like to SM57 of headphones."
90,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my husband, and he absolutely loves these headphones. He says they're the best ever!"
91,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sound you could ask for in headphones. Crisp and clean. Lows/Mids/High all come through perfectly in harmony. Vocals are superb. Bass is strong but not overpowering as you may find in Beats; no wash out. Highly recommended
92,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound. These sound better than any headphones you will find at the mall, or Best Buy. Better sound than and Beats, even though the Beat are so much more expensive.

The clarity of highs is amazing, and the bass is perfect, not over bearing. I would only say that if you want Bass monsters, these are not it. If you want clean Bass and perfect everything else, these are it.

The only negatives are, the cord it a spiral type, and is very big and heavy. To many people this is actually a plus.
Also they are not the most comfortable, not much padding on the band. These are only good for about an hour, before they start getting uncomfortable on the top of your head. But the price and sound make it worth it. I personally do not listen to music much for more than an hour."
93,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, very comfortable. Reasonably priced for the build quality and sound quality."
94,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, okay, not really. The reduce the auditory effect of those chattering around the wearer.

I had to get some sound reducing headphones because there's more chatter around my work cube than there used to be. The headphones by themselves provide some sound reduction. When playing music, I slip into my own little world.

Cons: Both the headphones and the cord are somewhat heavy."
95,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love Shure. This is the second pair of headphones that I have purchased from them (I have E2-C earbuds), and I love both the quality of the products, and the great customer service supplied by Shure (two year warrenty, etc.). I am absolutely hooked, and I will only be purchasing headphones from Shure in the future.

These headphones sound fantastic, are very sturdy, and very affordable for higher end headphones. My only complaint is that the stock ear cushions are a little bit small, and I would recommend purchasing the SRH840 replacement ear cushions and using those instead."
96,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Although lacking a bit in comfort, these headphones are quite nice.
They present music the way it was recorded. They do not emphasize bass or treble, but try to be as accurate as possible.
After a few hours of wear, they will begin to get a bit uncomfortable, but that is easily aided by shifting them around a bit.
They seem like they are built to last, but the small wires on the sides of the cups could prove to be a problem if they get snagged on something, but I have fixed this with a bit of electrical tape to hold them down.
All in all, I quite like these headphones and I would recommend them."
97,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was willing to spend $250 on AIAIAI's TMA-1 Studio headphones until I read relatively negative reviews on them, which lead me to the Shure SRH-440s and I'm really glad they did.

These headphones are great for in-house production and I would recommend them to anyone producing music in their home."
98,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of those headphones that i would waste money on to listen to music daily. Give these babies about an estimated 40-50 hour run time, and you will be amazed with the results. High tone pitch pick up on old records, and one of those headphone where you can really hear the snare hits, tumbling noises across the headphones that will leave you speechless. i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for headphones under a $100"
99,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this item reading reviews of customers and I am very happy with the quality of it. It is on line with expectations.
100,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent studio quality headphones under 100$. Love them so much.
101,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Sure SRH440 studio headphones is a great buy, but has some limitations I think you should keep in mind. The build quality overall is great, the plastic seems solid and the look is second to none. There are some flaws though. My one problem I had with my last pair of studio headphones (Sony) was that the leather padding on the head-strap began molting and eventually began to show the foam underneath (which took about a year or so). They were great headphones though, and apart from that they were everything and more of what I paid for them ($100). This is a similar situation. The leather on the ear-cup is starting to wear through on the crease between the leather ear-cup and the plastic housing. I've only had these headphones for a month or two and this is happening. Thankfully, Shure offers a full plethora of accessories for all their audio products. All I have to do is replace it. I just wish I didn't have to do that.

The sound is great, but not impressive. For the price point, you get a good product and one you will most likely have for years if you don't mind the wear and tear on the leather parts. It's honestly hard to find a headphone that offers super precise sound nowadays unless you are willing to pay $300. My guess is that a lot of headphone manufacturers save their best magnets for the upper tier models. So, as far as I'm concerned this is a decent and safe value."
102,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. Precise and honest sound, perfect for reference."
103,5.0 out of 5 stars,Still going strong years later.
104,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair of 240's before, they were amazing. But after purchasing the 440's, I have fallen in love. These headphones are durable and comfortable. At first, they may feel slightly bulky, or too hot when wearing for extended periods, but they are a great set of headphones. They function at the same level, if not better, then most 200$ headphones. These are a must buy. I do not prefer the coiled cord though."
105,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound phenomenal. The construction is sturdy also and the pads are comfortable. I like the fact the cord is detachable also. The sound quality is amazing (especially for under $100). The only thing on these cans is that the pad is not really thick so if you have ears that stick out a bit they will touch the inside. The pad is replaceable also, but I wish they made different thickness pads to customize the fit a bit. Maybe they will since these are really new."
106,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An impressive pair of headphones, I bought them from Amazon after a long research and consideration, and I wasn't at all disappointed, especially after I bought an Asus D1 Sound card to go with it. Sound quality is perfect and you can hear new depths and details in Music when used with a good sound card. This combination of Headphones/sound card gives perfect sound with Classical Music, which is the only kind of music I listen to."
107,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great for the price. They adjust easily from my small head to my husband's giant head. We use them for recording music. I would highly recommend them for someone dipping their toes into recording equipment.
108,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best headphones in sub-$100 price range, hands down. Sound quality is just awesome, frequency response is excellent - no artificially lifted bass, just the right amount, at the same time crisp and clear mids and highs, no audible distortions whatsoever. Sound remains excellent in a wide dynamic range as well - both at low and high volume settings. I applaud Shure for the excellent job they've done, I don't think anything of this quality was ever available in this price range. So go ahead, do your research, or, better yet, drive to your local favorite music/electronics store and ask for a demo. Most likely you'll end up buying these just like me. I even like these better compared to the ""big brother"" SRH 840 - I see no significant difference in the sound quality to justify the steep price increase. Don't bother, though, if all you do is listening to MP3 recordings - you'll be disappointed to discover how poor the quality of MP3 actually is. On the other hand, any lossless format, CD or DVD quality music will be pure joy to listen to. Jazz, classical, rock, metal, you name it - all sound great, every instrument and voice comes alive (disclaimer - never tried hip-hop/rap - not a big fan). I'm sure these phones will work just fine in a studio environment too."
109,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones look pretty nice (although that hardly matters), and have a great sound-- I'm not much of an audiophile so couldn't tell you any specific advantages over most other headphones, but they're definitely the most solid of the recent headphones I've had.

I have only one complaint, and that's that they start to hurt my head and ears after not too long. But readjusting them usually makes that go away for a little while, and I only use these headphones with my desktop computer and at home (I use earbuds for traveling), so that's all right.

Overall, recommended!"
110,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking through my friends pictures on Facebook and noticed a really good friend wearing these headphones. I asked her what kind they were, she told me and I done some research on them. I've never owned a pair of headphones as expensive as these but I have to say, I'm pretty much satisfied. They don't have as much bass as I prefer but I can't complain at all. Very smooth sound, clear as a bell. I love them."

117,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi, I really enjoy listening to music with these headphones. The music is smooth and clear with a little bass, not too much but just enough. They have a really snug feel . They are nice but not good to wear for long term usage."
118,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After a guy at Guitar Center sold me on a pair. I had my employer buy them for me to use in my voice over and music production activity in producing educational material (video/audio/instruction).

119,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've have done hours of searching for headphones, and my search lead to the Shure SRH440. The high, mids, and lows are refined and have perfect clarity. From Hip-hop to classical music you won't be disappointed. Overall, I cant just say how great these are, and I got these fore $64 and free-shipping and can't be happier.

Complaints: Some people complain about the comfort, Get the Shure SRH840 pads. Some people complain about the bass, burn them in."
120,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a mid-range headphone that prioritizes on comfort. I am a programmer so I would love to wear headphone for hours without feeling much discomfort. Came across Shure SRH440 and I like it for multiple reasons.

The sound quality is great. I am not a sound expert so I will let the others who know more work out the details. For me, all the music I've been listening to is very clear. You don't need to turn high volume yet you will be able to hear most parts a song has to offer.

The build is top-notch. Very sturdy. The material is definitely not cheap ones. I have been using it for a month or so with everyday use yet it stays like brand new. The coiled cable is such a great idea. I could get out of my desk and grab a drink in the fridge nearby with no music interruption. Furthermore, the headphone can be folded so it's easy to store to the pouch that comes with the headphone. Great design!

The last and the most important thing is comfort. Unfortunately the default cushion does not meet my expectation. The cushions start to squeeze my ears after an hour or so and it starts to feel really uncomfortable. Luckily, the replacement (http://www.amazon.com/Shure-HPAEC440-Replacement-Cushions-Headphones/dp/B002Z9JWZI/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1367854644&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=shure+srh440+ear+cushion) works out REALLY well. They look exactly the same and but the replacement cushions do not give me any discomfort after long session of wearing. Furthermore, they seem to block outside noise better so I can hear my music even better! I do not understand why Shure does not use the replacement cushions as the default ones. It would have been a five star if they do.

Overall, great buy. I would really recommend you to buy the replacement cushions right away if you decide to buy the headphone though."
121,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With anythin, there are pros and cons, So let's start with pros:

-Sound quality is amazing. Crisp highs, clear mids, and rich lows. Very well balanced.
- Solid construction of the outer shell and ear cups
- Love the ability to replace the cord by removing it from the headset!
- No problems with fit. Very comfortable. I used them about 6-9hrs daily and never have an issue. I read that others complain about ""head squeeze"" but I am betting that they have not properly adjusted the sides accordingly. Not only can you adjust the length of the sides, but the cups rotate slightly as well to fit nicely around your ears.
- Sound does NOT escape the earcups when on your head- fantastic for office use!

Now the cons:
- The only thing that is an issue is the weight of the cord. Like the fact that the long cord is coiled, but it is a slight nuisance.
- Not much here in the style department. Not flashy. Very function-driven. I would wear these walkind down the street or anything... That said, I had to find something to complain about here.

You have found these headphones because you are looking for something BETTER. Clarity and definition are important to you- as well it SHOULD be. Highly recommend these headphones to anyone wanting an audiophile-quality headset without paying $250."
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before buying these cans, I was using a pair of Sony MDR-V6's for about a year. I loved them, and still do somewhat, but they were lacking quality on vocals especially and had overly bright highs. I got these to try to alleviate those problems.

They sound excellent in general, but I'll go over the different ranges real fast:

Highs: Very crisp and true, although with a very select few songs (most noticeable with Not Afraid by Eminem) they can be shocking and fatiguing. Honestly, it shouldn't be a problem at all for most people and I could potentially just blame my sound card for driving high highs.

Mids: I don't notice as much in general with mids, but they're fine. Vocals are clean and beautiful.

Lows/Bass: These headphones are not meant for bassheads who basically want jackhammers duct taped to their eardrums, but they definitely can push out some clean and loud bass. I noticed that the bass increased a LOT after burn in. It was fairly quiet to begin with but after something like 20 hours of playing music the bass really came out and impressed me.

When I ordered these they were about $69, which is incredible value for 'phones of this caliber. All I can say is that any entry to mid level audiophiles should enjoy the headphones after the burn in and normal people will hear them as godly. The impedance isn't that high so portable players can drive them, and where other people complained about comfort, they're actually NOT bad. It might just be me, but these are actually quite comfortable as is. I might invest in the SRH-840's earpads just to increase bass, but I can easily wear these for long periods of time without a problem. Sometimes they'll push my glasses a bit forward but again it's not bad at all.

I totally recommend these for listening to music. Maybe not for monitoring, but definitely for music. Order them and enjoy them!"
123,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Working in film, television, and news production these are a great asset. They have great manipulability, great sound, and solid cabling. That being said, they may not be best suited for extended-use, as they can get very heavy and don't have as comfortable earmuffs as say, some Beats headphones. However, in terms of fit, they do have a great advantage of width and length which almost forces me to wear them casually over Beats."
124,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received my new Shure 440's. The first thing I noticed is that there's no flimsy little wire sticking out of the ear piece, to which one connects the longer cable to the device (iPod or laptop). I've gone through two Bose OE (on ear) headphones over the past 2 years at $150 a pop. On both sets, that little connecting wire went bad. I'll never waste my money again on Bose!

These appear to be much better built. The cable plugs right into the ear piece; with no wimpy little wire to go bad. The 440's sound great, which is the most important thing. Of course there is more sound control when listening to a laptop (MacBook Pro), as the equalizer can be adjusted to suit your wishes. However, they also sound great with my iPod. I've read that they can become uncomfortable with longer use. I'll have to wait and see. If that's an issue, I'll just get the pads (for the Shure 880) recommend by others on this site. They're about $19.

I have to confess, I thought these were ""on ear"" not ""over the ear"". I suspect they might get a bit warm in the warmer months. Since we don't have too many of those in Maine, I guess I can get used to it. I'm sitting right next to a telephone, that was answered by my wife. I didn't hear it ring, so they block out quit a bit of background noise. These sound every bit as good as the Bose OE's that they have replaced. I like to listen to all sorts of music, and these will make it sound great for a long time, I'm sure!"
125,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from a pair of Etymotic 4R-S earphones I was impressed with the sound quality of these headphones that are 1/3 of the price. Mids and highs aren't quite as distinct but they do deliver stronger bass. Good enough sound for me.

They fit pretty well but will make my ears sore after a half hour if they're not positioned quite right. However I've experienced the same thing with other headphones so this isn't the fault of the Shures. They do a nice job of sealing out the outside world, too. Again not as good as my Etymotics but that is to be expected as the Etys are an in-ear-canal product.

The only thing that I'm not happy with is the cord. It's of good quality so it's heavy and thick. But because the coiled section is a good 18"" long it's very heavy in that spot and tends to fall off your lap, pulling whatever device it's connected to with it. At some point I will likely replace the cord or solder the bayonet end onto a different piece.

Overall though I'm happy with my purchase."
126,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned this pair of headphone, for over four years maybe? I 'm not sure, but it was a long time ago. They still sound great. I've never had issues with them, however, they are not too confortable for extended periods of use. I also use glasses and after a long time of wear, they begin to get painful.
The sound quality is great in my opinion. It's very clear and balanced. I'm bit of a basshead so I wish they had a deeper pumpier(?) bass, but I've never once regretted my purchase.
They have heavy sings of wear. The faux leather on the headband has chipped off a lot, but then again I've had them for a while and constantly use them. The ear cups are still in goodshape, no chipping of any kind.
I would recommend this pair of headphone, but do be aware that they are quite heavy and get painful after hours of use."
127,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had one pair of these, which I loved. Audio quality was fine (I'm no audiophile, but the isolation seemed good and I had no complaints with bass levels). More importantly, they were comfortable, easy to slip on and off, and the coiled cord stayed out of my way. When the plastic headband broke after less than a year, I was annoyed, and ordered a different brand. But I hated the other brand's usability so much by comparison that I wound up ordering another pair of SRH440s.

Here we are again, after less than a year, and my second pair of SRH440s has broken in the exact same spot. (And no, I'm not being rough with them.)

So ask yourself: do you want a pair of headphones that works like a dream, even if you know you'll be replacing them in less than a year?"
128,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have gone through the various iPod on/in-ear designs and I've tried the noise reduction large style headphones. I was a Koss PRO 4A fan in the old days and always wanted something that could bring back the quality of those old Koss headphones. Well, I found it. The Shure SRH440's are about as close as I think possible to my goal and I am very happy with the sound quality that I am getting from them. I can hear things in my music (jazz) that really improves my listening experience. Even using a flat setting on my equilizer the sound is great. But for my ears I've tweeked the settings to improve things for me. The headphones appear well built, but I have not had them that long (two months). The ear pads are not as soft as I would like, but hey now I'm getting picky. I would suggest getting the additional straight cord that runs from the headphones to your music device (the headphones come with a coiled cord) depending on where your using the headphones you may prefer to switch cords. Bottomline...if you want great sound and are interested in an over the ear, closed-back headphones at a good price...I would suggest you check these out."
129,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have that headset for almost a year now. Here are a few of the pros and cons:

Pros:
Great sound, very clean and precise, very well balanced.
Fits my head very well (I have a large sized head and the headphones can fit even a larger head easily)
Great overall choice for a reasonable price.
Detachable cable.

Cons:
No option to rotate one of the headphones outwards like in other studio sets.
Gets a little warm around the ears after a while of using it (but what over-the-ear headphone doesn't?)"
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A great set. You can hear every instrument. Not too thumpy, but you get what the artist is trying to give you."
131,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound.
Bass almost nonexistent, as everyone else says.
Ideally to be used with amp(~50-100$) like FiiO to get good bass.
After about 1-2 hours you'll be left with soar ears, you can switch pads or add some tissue beneath to make it softer, the sound is worth it as far as I'm concerned."
132,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll keep it short.

If you need something for recording / mixing and want entry-level headphones with great sound isolation, and extremely balanced lows, mids, and highs, then get this. For the price, they're incredible.

If you're planning on wearing these for extended periods of time, then these will get a tad bit uncomfortable. Not the ear portion, but rather the top of the head.

Either way, I love mine. For Shure."
133,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was researching headphones for the last couple of months, and to be honest, I was looking at either these or the Studio Beats by Dre. I couldn't bring myself to pay $300 for those headphones, even thought the bass on them is epic. These Shure's are my first foray into ""real"" audio equipment, and I am not disappointed in any aspects. My music sounds so different, and I was shocked when I went back to my $20 earphones. It was literally day and night in difference. I love these headphones, the only bad part would be that they can get uncomfortable after a couple of hours. Regardless, these are definitely worth the ~$70 I paid for them."
134,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superb product. Clear sound and very comfortable on the head.

Btly what I needed to get the best sound.
Knowing of Shure's legendary quality prompted me to order these headphones.
I ordered them, and waited with great anticipation for the arrival of my headphones. Needless to say, I am absolutely pleased with the fast shipping, and upon using them, the sound quality is wonderful.
If you are looking for a great pair of headphones, I would recommend these."
137,3.0 out of 5 stars,sound quality is excellent but not comfortable to wear
138,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good, I just wish the foam padding would stay on or be easier to re-apply"
139,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bass is lacking but these are very neutral otherwise. Used for studio radio recording.
140,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from the SRH240 to the SRH440 and I am happy I did. I was completely content with the 240's, but me being the electronic freak that I am... I had to spring for the more expensive model. The 440's definitely feel more ""studio-ish"" when it comes to weight and sound quality, and the wound cord and detachable option was smart on Shures part. I was in Best Buy the other day listening to the Beatz by Dre. and the Bose on-ear headphones... and I would take my $79.99 Amazon SRH440's over them any day, plus they look better! Two Thumbs up on not just the 440's, but Shure in general."
141,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've spent $100 on several headsets, and this one is by far the most clear, comfortable, and loud! I'm so happy with it I take it everywhere! You will not be disappointed."
142,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good from these, definitely above average for something in this price range.

However, wearing these for longer than even just 5 minutes makes my head hurt like hell. They must have never tried wearing the headset before deciding to produce it. I'm having to wear a hoodie with these so my head doesn't hurt. Definitely considering returning these."
143,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great. I use them at work, and even when no one is around and I have the opportunity to use the computer speakers, I often choose to use the headphones anyway because the sound quality is so much better. I have only had them a few weeks, but the headphones seem to be a good quality and I expect them to hold up for a long time. My ears tend to tire of them after a few hours, but that could be due partly to my wearing glasses. Once again, another great Shure product."
144,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, just treat them nicely and they'll do the same. Definitely the best headset I've had the pleasure of listening to. Went to Bestbuy to compare headphone quality and pricing and this by far crushed nearly everything they had to offer. Everything there just felt cheap and flimsy."
145,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were my first high-end headphones and I must say they do not disappoint. The sound is wonderfully balanced and neutral. I admit that bass is a bit weak, however it makes up for that in its accuracy, which could be preferred by some.
My only problems are that it is a bit bulky compared to other neutral headphones in its price range. Also to get the best comfort, you absolutely need the 840 earpads, but once you get them they are incredibly comfortable."
146,3.0 out of 5 stars,"In warm weather, my ears perspire when wearing this headphones for long periods. The coil phone cord is heavy therefore tends to make my head tilt.
For the headphone cord: this should be a linear wire and maybe coiled about 4 feet away from the headphone.
The headphone should provide different material ear padding that are breathable as an accessory."

149,5.0 out of 5 stars,"PRE ORDER
Mission:
I bought these looking for a replacement for another pair of headphones for monitoring purposes.

Attractions:
The first thing that attracted me to the Shures was the claim of flat response obviously intended for the professional studio (as labeled). The second thing that attracted me to these headphones was the low price. Another thing that REALLY attracted me to these was the REMOVABLE locking cable. I've had trouble with previous headphone jacks that ended up with me having to go buy a new jack and stripping the cable to solder it on, so it seemed like a pretty sweet feature to save future trouble.

Picking the Right Set of Cans:
I was doing some research on good studio oriented headphones below(or at) the $100 price point. I came up finding these(Shure SRH440), the Sennheiser HD280 Pros, and the Sony MDR-v6's and/or 7506's. And obviously I came to choosing these.

POST ORDER

First Impressions:
I had watched a few unboxing and review videos of the Shures just to see what I'd be getting, so nothing out of the box VISUALLY surprised me as I had seen it all already, but when I took them out of the plastic bag and actually held them in my hand myself, I was lovestruck. They are nice and heavy(in a good way) and VERY solidly built.

Build:
Like I said before, these are quite hefty in weight, but also in size. (Which I like a lot, but for those looking for smaller, lighter cans, I don't think this is where you want to go) The plastics used on the headphones are very solid and of high quality. I guess I had taken the build of the previous set of headphones I was using as fair, so when I just grabbed the earcups and pulled them apart I was blown away with just how well these things were made.
The headband is made of some flexible material covered in a synthetic leatherette, and feels sturdy yet moldable. It sits nicely atop the head.
From what gathered from the few moments the stock earPADS were one the headphones before I took them off to replace them with some upgraded SRH840 pads I had bought at the same time as these, they were okay in quality. A tad stiff though.
The cable is a nice, thick coiled one around 10 feet long that starts up on a SINGLE side of the headphones rather than a Y-cable, and terminates to a 3.5 mm/ 1/8 in gold plated jack.
The jack itself has a threaded end to screw on the included 1/4 in (whatever the equivalent is in millimeters) adapter. The rubber/plastic on the end of it has a nice grippy part to it that makes it easy to hold and plug in to whatever you need to. A small detail, but I found it quite nice.

Comfort:
Like I said a short ways up in the previous paragraph, I bought a set of replacement earpads that normally go on the big brother of this product, the SRH840, on suggestions of other peoples experiences with these headphones. I tried them on with the stock pads before I swapped them and like people said, the pads were fairly stiff and shallow. Immediately thereafter I put on the other pads. They were thicker, softer, and more comfortable. The most noticeably difference I would have to say though is the padding on the INSIDE of the pads that cover the driver. It is much thicker and of better quality. So during long wearing sessions I can see these being much more bearable. I've also heard claims of the pads improving sound quality, but I didn't actually listen to them before I swapped the pads so I can't confirm them. ** I also have pretty prominent(sticky-outy) ears that usually become discomforted quite soon after putting on headphones, but these are (now anyways) deep enough with thick enough inner padding that it's not much of a problem.
The headband is quite ""cushy"" and forms rather nicely to the head. But sometims, when wearing them for a long time, the top of my head begins to get sore where it rests upon my head.
These headphones are actually pretty tight gripping on my (seemingly) normal sized head. I like that A LOT, but I'm sure it bothers the hell of some people. I've heard people calling them loose, but they aren't to me.

Overall, they feel very nice to me sitting on my head.

Now with what was my greatest fear about ordering headphones,

Sound/Sound Quality:
I have previously listened to studio oriented headphone and they seemed ""canny"" and fit the closed back headphone STEREOtype(pun), and I hate having to wait unnecessarily for things, so I was afraid of ordering these before actually listening to them under the cause that they would sound crappy. I'll tell you right now, my fears were misplaced. The SRH440's sounded pretty darn good on the first listen. I still haven't burnt them in the full 100 or so hours suggested by many, but they sound great already. The highs are nice and crisp, the mids are warm and smooth, and the bass is lush and extended. I am currently playing pink noise and assorted sounds through them, and after a few of days(with breaks, don't worry) hey, maybe they'll sound even better.
As far as isolation of outside noise goes, the Shures do it quite well. I'll give you an example of how well they do it:I've had really loud music been playing through speakers in the other room, and I put these on as earmuffs to block out the sound. Obviously it didn't completely shut out the sound, but made it quiet enough that it wasn't unbearable to hear.
The soundstage with these is actually pretty wide and spacey. Things panned hard left or right sound more spread apart than other closed back headphones. Now I haven't heard a lot to compare to them (especially not open backed/open-air headphones which are supposed to have the broadest soundstage), but these headphones give me such an awesome stereo image when listening to music.

If I had to describe these headphones in two words, it would be these:
SUPERIOR VALUE.

Well there's my two cents. Haha, I hope I didn't miss anything.
Awesome headphones."
150,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds beautiful. Would give 5 stars except the ear cups come off a little too easily and are quite tricky to out back on. Otherwise, excellent value"
151,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tonal balance, fit and build are perfect for me. Of course this is a subjective appraisal from a 64 year old."
152,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality but fragile. [Keeps it from being 150$]
Comparable to sennheiser & M-audio."
153,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying that I have very good ears and usually am able to hear all the nuances in music quality. Currently I own Sennheiser HD428, Sennheiser CX500, and couple other cheaper earbuds.

These headphones have one flaw and that is comfort(although your opinion might be different). I strongly recommend upgrading to Shure SRH840 earpads. Stock ones are too hard and provide no padding between the ear and speaker plastic, which results in pain after about 15 mins of use. New pads completely solved the problem for me.

The sound coming out of these is very good. Instrumental separation is very good considering their price. Bass is not boomy at all, it is tight and controlled but might not satisfy bass heads. Midrange is pretty neutral and highs are very bright, almost too much with certain music. However, SRH849 earpads tuned down the highs slightly and they are perfect now. They also enhanced the bass slightly. These headphones slice apart frequencies like high presicion surgical equipment. Very detailed sound. I am very happy about that.

My sennheisers HD428 sound little less precise and overall sound is more laid back. I like both headphones but overall prefer Shure a bit more.

Overall these are amazing value and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice sounding set of headphones."
154,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price these are a great professional set of headphones---and also since they are big and fit well over the ear they cut out some background noice---fine phones,jones!"
155,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After a couple of days of usage I have the following feedback.

Pros: The sound is great. I played my test CD in which I have many songs that have the whole range of frequencies and vocals. The size of the cups are great (I have large ears).

Cons: Only con I have is the weight. It is a little bit tiring after a while. I read it in some other feedback but I did not think of it as something bad."
156,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones but a little crispy on the high end. I work in the audio industry and have been using these for mixing for a couple of years now. I've used them for mixing recording and for live use. In m opinion they are a little bright and crispy which can give you a false sense of highs if you are using them as reference monitors. With that said I do like them just for enjoyment.
157,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality for the price.
158,4.0 out of 5 stars,great earphones for sound but doesn't keep the sound in-- people around can still hear

160,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! I must say... First Off... the Seller who sent me my headphones needs to be commended, and blessed TEN-TIMES over for getting me my NEW EARS as quickly as they did! Absolutely Amazing. Shure is right on the money with these Babies. There are no delays, and when mixing you get the exact Mixes as they were printed for your specific needs! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!! A Complete Make-Over for those looking to Ascend with the Sound Quality given by Shure! These 440's Hit Me Hard! I Love Them!"
161,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are accurate and inexpensive. Perfect for studio work or critical listening, very enjoyable sound."
162,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easily adjustable for excellent comfort. This is important for me because I have a larger than average head size. Sound quality is unparalleled for the cost of the headphones. Very nice treble definition, down to the pin drop. Nice bass definition without distortion. Best feature: detachable cable."
163,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphone set but a bit heavy.
164,5.0 out of 5 stars,"simply the best sound quality for the value. it dampens all the white noise while providing all the sounds coming from the ipod, laptop, or device that it is plugged into it. 2 other co-workers tried it and bought it as well."
165,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great tone and volume. Perfect for practicing guitar in private without disturbing the neighbors. Would recommend to use as studio headphones only.
166,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Immaculate audio quality and very comfortable. Cord is a bit long, and some what strange to manipulate in some environments. Amazing product otherwise."
167,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I initially chose these over the Bose AE2's because these advertised a much flatter response, and the sound was great. However, after 15 or 20 minutes of wearing these lead behemoths, muscles in my head that I didn't know I had would start to ache. I don't know if it's because my head is oddly shaped, or my ears are too big, but what good is good sound reproduction if you can't enjoy it for more than a few songs at a time? Also, I know it's meant for studio recording, but the cable that comes with these phones is way too thick, and heavy. The coiled up pulls on your head if you are anywhere near the danger of pulling the chord out of it's socket, but if you're trying to use that extra length, the constant tugging is really annoying, I'd much rather have the straight chord."
168,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great phones for the price. Only negative is the band across the top of head. A little sore after awhile. Otherwise great sound.
169,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This are great headphones.
The sound quality is amazing. Clear crystal sound.
And for the price... GREAT.
But this are the most uncomfortable headphones I've owned, there is almost nothing but a thin cloth between your ear and the speaker, my ears and my head hurt after 15 mins of use.

DISAPPOINTING."
170,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these! great product and value for the money. These are some of the best headphones I've used. I've been using them pretty much none stop since Jan 2012 and they're still great. These are definitely quality build. Highly recommend for anyone that cares about great sound.
171,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these specifically to use with me Line6 HD500 guitar effects unit.. I honestly think these headphones sound better than my $1200 amp and cab set up... Couldn't be happier with my purchase!

176,5.0 out of 5 stars,High quality and great sound
177,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried three different headphones:

Sennheiser 280 Pro
Sound was very good, especially after some burn-in. But VERY uncomfortable. Way to tight -- really clamp down hard on your head. This produces great isolation, and they're well built, but this is useless if you can't wear them. Note: I don't have a big head.

Audio Technica ath-m30
The sound on these was mediocre, and they sit on the ear (not around the ear), so they don't isolate well at all. They are more comfortable than the 280s and much lighter, but they also feel a little weird (being on the ear), and I don't know why anyone would buy closed headphones that don't isolate.

Shure SRH440
I think these sound the best. Maybe not quite as clear as the Senns, but they are more dynamic. They feel less like the sound is in a tin can. The sound feels closer. They are very well made. Probably the best made of the bunch. And they are comfortable. Not as tight as the Senns and isolate almost as well, certainly well enough."
178,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are supremely excellent. Comfortable, amazingly good sounding, durable, and good looking to boot. I'm listening to them right now, in fact, as I have been nearly 8 hours a day for the past month. I listen to music pretty much any time I'm not walking around or driving, which is why a good quality pair of headphones was essential to me. The Shures fit the bill perfectly. Clear mids and highs, with punchy real-feeling bass. For this price they're amazing."
179,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones I ever had.
180,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They do not feel that heavy nor do they bother my ears. I do, however, take of any earring before wearing these for an extended period of time."
181,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones - I have never had a pair that sounded so good. They are comfortable and seem to be very well made. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to record music - or just likes to listen.
182,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as studio monitors and for playing my digital piano. Soundstage is pretty good, perhaps could be livelier and mid range can sometimes sound muffled, but overall great for a studio monitor. Only problem is they're a bit on the heavy side, making extended wear somewhat tedious."
183,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are comfortable and sound is very crisp. Suitable for recording in home studio or real studio. Would recommend them for anyone that's trying to be cost effective but still want a quality sound.
184,4.0 out of 5 stars,Quality of the sound is more clearly than other head phones
185,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great!
186,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones. if you need a studio reference headphone and this is the top of your price range or you just want to save some money. these can definitely do the job. my only real con is that after hours strait of use they start hurting my ears due to an insufficient type of padding. the new leather smell is nice when you first get them!

make sure to burn these in for an even better sound"
187,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Has really balanced sound. Fantastic monitors. If you are just listening to music on your stereo you might want headphones with more bass. But for recording and mixing when you want to hear all frequencies clearly, these are terrific. I would buy these again."

191,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are awesome! Great sound quality! I use them at work and just keep them stored in my desk, they are on the large side so not quite as transportable as others, but still all around great headphones. The seller was great too, they were the cheapest by far, and they arrived brand new in box, very well packaged, etc. I am extremely satisfied with this whole purchase."
192,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile by any means, but these are the best headphones I've ever used. The isolation is superb - so strong that it took me some getting used to - and the sound quality is the best I've heard from a pair of headphones."
193,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They're not Beats-by-Dre, so I'm actually listening to music instead of the constant humming of a sine wave which is great. Sound reproduction is great. The cord is detachable which is great. Comes with a bag which is great. It feels durable which is great. They leave the top of your head in minor discomfort after about an hour which is...not so great. I'm ok with it cause I shift the headband around a bit then no problems. It acts as a reminder that maybe I should take a break.

In short, I use them only inside for music production and monitoring and they work really well for me. If you're planning to look like a doink and where these outside, just don't. Get Beats-by-Dre, ""bro""."
194,5.0 out of 5 stars,My fiance loved them!
195,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are well balanced and sound really clear
196,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these headphones. They have great balance of sound.
197,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds better than my cousin's AKG K701s. I've bought MANY different types of headphones, and these are by far the best. I can hear every instrument clearly and I can even spot the flaws in the mp3 files I have now. The highs are incredibly crisp and the bass seems very natural. The mids are very good. The only problem? I need to get better sound files!"
198,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these headphones because of the detachable cable since that's where most of my headphones have broken in the past. I've had them for a year and a half and they are still fantastic. Nice and flat. Use these nearly every day to mix and besides the leather cracking over the ears they have held up well. Good purchase.
199,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good.
Thks."
200,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for home recording and guitar practice and I am very pleased they sound great and have large closed ear cups.
I also like the cable that unplugs since most problems with headphone are cable related it is easy to replace. great value!"
201,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphone do exactly what I need them to do. They are not the highest-end Shure's you can pick up but I am extremely satisfied. I was not going for the max bass sound so I'm fine with what they do.
202,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have used these for a couple years. Initially they were great. Sound quality was very good for gaming and music (note no microphone)....but...after about a year the plastic starting making horrible creaking noises that can be heard when over ears. This occurs if there is any relative movement between the plastic parts that make up the assembly. It is really annoying and I do not recommend because of this. And I probably will not buy another Shure product because of this issue.
203,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Already knowing what these headphones could do, I had to order a pair of my own. These headphone are studio quality and built to last. With good noise cancellation and a terrific sound these headphones are amazing. Plus Amazon offered them with a lower price than most other retailers. Whether you are using them for recreational or studio purposes, these will not let you down."
204,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love these headphones. They are very reliable. Shipping was fast, and the sound is amazing. I definitely recommend this product."
205,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality headphones. Bass response ok but could be a few db better. Otherwise just what Shure always seems to manufacture.
206,5.0 out of 5 stars,I read the reviews and they were positive. I am very happy with my purchase and the information provided by the Amazon reviews.
207,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sound, love the way I can remove the cord. I am very satisfied. Also love the carrying bag."
208,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have both SRH 440 and Sony MDR V6 so I'll just make the short comparison between them on this review.

Sound Quality: They almost sound the same. MDR V6 being more detailed and brighter. SRH 440 giving a sound stage feel when listen music. I use my Sony MDR V6 for recording, playing piano, guitar, detailed editing and Shure SRH 440 for listening music, movies or even outdoors.

Comfort: I'll go for my SRH 440 on this. They have a bigger ear cups and it doesn't rest on my ear tip (which is my only complain about the V6) I can wear them longer than V6. They are both warm at the ear when you wear them, and you will definitely know that they are there. Even SRH 440 is heavier than MDR V6, I found 440's are more comfortable to wear anytime.

Built Quality and Durability: Plus on SRH 440 here on two things...better leather-like material on the ear cups and detachable/replaceable cord. Other than that, I think there are both durable and will last a long time.

CONCLUSION: SHURE SRH 440 sound quality is enjoyable, great for easy listening, it gives right lows and highs, not being too bright and easily powered by MP3 player(even the MDR V6) for portability. Comfort; I would say is the main purpose of this headphones. To me, MDR V6 and Shure SRH 440 serves a different purpose.

I'm very happy and pleased with the purchase because of the comfort and feel of the 440s. But I'm thinking buying 750DJ or 840 for more lows because both 440 and V6 have almost the same lows(V6 a little better; would not even make a big or noticeable difference on regular listening). I'm considering SHURE headphones for my next purchase because of thier comfort..very big factor."
209,5.0 out of 5 stars,What I was looking for! Sounds are perfectly clear
210,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because of a review elsewhere. They sound excellent and are loud enough. A bit hot and sweaty after a while and they pinch my ear a bit, which is why only 4 stars. If I'd looked around a bit more I might have got the Sony MDR7506's but to be honest, I don't know if I would be able to tell the difference."
211,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried two pairs of Shure earphones, SE110 and SE220, and they didn't work for me: the sound was just below average. No bass!

Then I got a pair of Shure SHR 440 headphones. They are gigantic, they are heavy, they don't fit in your pocket, but do they sound great! Even though they sit above your ears and don't have any noise cancellation electronics, they are very good at reducing airplane noise. And they don't require an additional battery or charger.

My advice: keep whatever earphones you got with your iPhone, Palm Pré or Blackberry and buy a pair of additional headphones like the Shure SHR 440. At $100, they are significantly cheaper than the Bose noise canceling headphones and may just be good enough for what you need. They certainly work for me!"
212,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and fit but I had to have them replaced twice while under warranty when the plastic broke. Not hard on them dithery they just sit at my work all day. Just broke again 5 months out of warranty. Great sound but not the sturdiest.
213,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best earphones at the price. Comfortable and the sound is wonderful. Just what I was looking for for my VO audition editing.
214,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones if you are new to quality headphones. They offer a good clean sound and have a pleasant amount bass. If they are your first it is easy to get sort of tired though, Because you might not be used to the grip and weight of the headphones and the volume and insulation are other factors that could tire new comers."
215,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value. Respected manufacturer. I run sound weekly for a band and I am extremely pleased with the comfort and quality!
216,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my son who is a musician, and he loves them! Says they are worth much more than the price I paid, which is always good news."
217,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bulkier than expected but excellent sound.
218,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i used this headphone to mix and to be honest my mixes turn out to be very great, these headphone are very accurate and detail, so if your mix doesnt sound good on them, it doesnt sound good overall and if your mix sound good on them they sound good on everything else, great for mixing"
219,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome headphones...
220,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really comfortable and the sound is good but, I may be too picky, but maybe it could've been better, anyway a great product."
221,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The top is not so comfortable, after hours using it you feel the pain. However, the sound is amazing and they last long. 2 years and they keep going. They don't have isolation but if there is no extreme noise around you, you should be fine."
222,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is good , but the 'phones are a bit heavy for comfortable use over time. The TRS to mini stereo adapter is a nice touch and the detachable cord is very handy when packing the 'pnones away."
223,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent 8 hours in the studio tracking at full volume with these guys and had to have a pair for home recording. Great sound, great build quality, and great features! If the cord breaks you can replace it. If the earpads are old you can replace em'. They have great sound isolation to boot! At this price they can't be beat."
224,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tho saying they are the best ive ever had is not to big of a deal since before this the most expensive earphones ive had where 20 dollars i can say that the sound quality is way above average. They feel and look like they will last me for years. They are Very comfortable and I love that you can make them more compact for transport and that you can unplug the cable that connects to the computer from the earphones.

As a new person to higher end earphones im quite impressed with the amount of volume this things can pump! At 30% audio is higher than most other cheap earphones ive tried at 100%. i think they can almost sound louder than my on-board speakers. clarity of sound is perhaps about as good as i can imagine. Bass seems incredible, i think it was only limited by the mp3 format, if i knew where the disc was in my house i bet it would sound even better (tho not considerably).

The bad would be purely (in my opinion) on some design points. Tho its understandable that the cable connecting the earphones to each other shows externally i feel like theirs a high possibility at some point of it breaking somehow. In another thought it also looks pretty cool :) makes me look more wired :P.
The other bad would be that it dosen't block as much sound as I hoped it would. but its still blocks a hell of a lot out.

I tried these with Classical music violin concerto from vivaldi (from cd) and electronic from infected mushroom (mp3) for this review.
Ive used them for about a day and i already think its one of the best things i could have spent my money on. ""VERY WISE SPENDING"" i would say :P ive already demoed it to 3 other people and they also think they are awesome.

I guess i might edit this post in the future(if i can) if i have any problems with them.... or if i cant stop praising them :P"
225,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When the plug on my old pair of Grado SR80s needed replacing, I decided to give these a try. I was hugely disappointed. The sound was so different from the Grados I almost felt like I was listening to entirely different mixes of anything I listed to. The bass overpowered everything else. On top of that, I discovered that it is impossible to wear these headphones while wearing eyeglasses. So I returned them and got Grado to replace the plug on my old headphones."
226,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best phones I've ever had. But then the ""best"" are the Sony MDR V-250s with their volume, mono-stereo adjustable cable
I listen mostly to classical music and jazz. I like the smoothness in the treble and midrange, although a bit lacking in the bass.
Front to back soundstage is good. Reservations: highly sensitive in volume in that you barely have to turn the volume up
with a Sony Walkman or phone jack on You Tube. However, if you keep your Walkman at a reasonable volume, you'll be
surprised how good audio cassettes can sound. Phones a bit tight on the head, so take them off at about an hour.
Detachable cable excellent idea to avoid twisting. Can plug into 15-foot extension cable easily. I picked these, reading audio
forums' reviews by studio musicians. I figured that these experts would be good judges of headphones quality.
Overall, they are worth the money and I find, if I prefer, to plug them into the phones output of a Marantz 63 CD player and
listen in bed to a classical recording."
227,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic set of headphones. Great isolation, clear highs and mids, with tight non-exaggerated bass. Sound great when connected to iPhone or my laptop."
228,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought the product based on the review I read in Wired magazine. It is as good as advertised. My only problem is that it does not fit my head tightly and it moves when I am doing work in the yard. It is okay if you are just sitting/lounging.
229,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far the headphones have lived up to their expectations. For the price, the sound is excellent. I would agree with other reviews I have read that although comfortable, during long listening duration tend to have slightly too much pressure on the sides of the head, I'm optimistic that this will fade with more use."
230,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these headphones for a little over a year now. The plastic above both ear muffs has cracked and I have been forced to tape them back together. I have not been overly abusive or stepped on them. The plastic just wore out quickly. I also had to replace the thin ear muffs they came with because my ears would touch the plastic on the inside and it would become uncomfortable after about 30min. I replaced them with Brainwavzs HM5.

The sound is good and I have enjoyed them for as long as I have had them up to this point. They are too tight now, due to the tape on both sides, and will be replaced by something with a little more longevity."
231,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very analytical at times, and fast headphones. They do really well with all sorts of metal, rock, acoustic, classical, and even electronic. Throw any of your most complex and noisy songs at these headphones and they still still be able to separate everything out and let you listen to everything. As with most full sized headphones, this one is no exception, the 3D imaging is very good and among the best I've ever heard. They are comfortable, but not built from the best materials. They will survive multiple drops for sure, but they creak a lot, even when new. The plastics are decent, but the headband and earcup pleather isn't from the highest quality sources. Also sometimes my ears can feel the dynamic drivers of the headphones! There is no headclamping tho! and they do fold up!

Compared to the also really popular Audio Technica M-50, they sound much less colored and professional, but with distinctly dropped low end bass response. The M50's probably are just a tad slower, so they are fine for metal and rock, but their treble is less smooth, the bass is at times too bumbped, and mids are clearly recessed. also soundstage and instrument separation is better on the shures. On the other hand, if sound quality is second only to build quality, go with the Audio Technica's. They are clearly superiorly built. They are made form better materials and have better cushions, although the headclamping was quite severe for my slightly large head."
232,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best sound quality headphones for the price. Neutral, accurate, and remarkably crisp sounding. It's lacking a bit of bass, but it's actually not that bad, only if you're used to artificially boosted headphones will you be disappointed.

My only problem, and why I deducted a star, is the build quality itself. It's not flimsy or anything, even appears/feels to be pretty solid... and it would be aside from that GODDAMN EXPOSED WIRE connecting the left/right earcups. I've gone through 3 of these headsets now over 3 years from that cable going bad, and this will be my last one. I'm extremely careful with my headphones and they never leave my desk, just a long time of putting them on and taking them off and adjusting the band wears out that cable. It's a super common problem among long term 440/840 owners, and I'm not interested in the DIY BS behind recabling the headset.

When I can afford it my next headset is going to be a Shure 940, as that wire is fully enclosed unlike the 440/840. With that problem corrected it'd be the perfect headset and probably would last a really long time. Wire aside I love the way it's purpose built for sound quality, and isn't some fashion accessory.

ALSO! If you do get these, I highly recommend you pick up the 840 earcups. Improves the sound a bit and the comfort is amazing. I wear them all day every day working."
233,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After looking at several higher end options, I choose the Shure 440 phones based on median price vs. high reviews. I have to say, I'm 100% pleased. I'm using these with Logic on my MacBook Pro and for that purpose they are excellent as monitors. In addition, they are great for general use when I want quality personal audio. In case any shoppers are interested in knowing, the connection cord DOES disconnect completely from the phones. An option that I'm fond of, as cords tend to wear out faster than other parts of headphones. They are also coiled and springy. The included case probably won't get much use as I hang up my phones and I was doubly impressed by the included 1/4"" adapter that screws onto the cord and makes a secure connection.
The phones are all plastic but they have a great weight and feel to them and they are as far from ""cheap"" feeling as they can be. The pad in the band doesn't provide as much cushion as you'd expect, but it isn't uncomfortable. The cups provide moderate sound dampening and are wearable for hours before becoming even a nuisance.
As for those who talk down the sound, they must be listening to a poor audio source. Wen connected to good audio, these phones reproduce it wonderfully. The bass response is deep, the highs are crisp, and the mids don't muddy the sound."
234,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I review these headphones, I must say something about their intended purpose. These are NOT designed for listening to music anywhere except sitting down in your home or in a studio. The cord is incredibly long and bulky, and the headphones are far from stylish. If you're looking for headphones you can wear on-the-go, stop right here and go look for some in-ear-monitors or smaller sized headphones. If you are looking for the best sound quality you can find in $100 headphones, and don't care much about anything else, this is probably the right place.

Design Overview:
These headphones are MASSIVE. These are my first pair of studio monitors and I was not expecting them to be as giant as they are. I have a normal sized head- These headphones look ridiculous on me and on larger heads, still seem pretty big. I am not a very fashion-minded person but even I think twice about taking these around. The headphones fold up for convenience, allowing them to fit in my backpack without too much trouble. The cord is one of my biggest gripes with the headphones. It is not on par with the quality of the rest of the headphone.

Comfort:
These headphones will hurt your ears and the top of your head after about an hour. I was very disappointed with the stock earpads, and the plastic headband is covered by what seems to be leather with little to no padding. About a month after I bought these, I ordered the replacement earpads from Shure's higher end version of the product, the SRH-840, and slapped those onto my SRH-440. I am much happier with the comfort of these headphones with this 15 dollar investment.

Cord:
The only thing I like about this cord is that it is detachable and twists to lock into a jack on the headphone. I have a lot of issues with the stock cord. It is something like 10 feet long uncoiled, and even coiled up takes up too much space on my small computer desk. The cord is cheaply made, with the wires nestled into a plasticky tube that gets kinked up permanently much like a garden hose. Within three months the cord was unbearably tangled and did not coil up properly. With this stock coiled cord, it is impossible to go anywhere with the headphones as you have a large bundle of cord that barely fits into a pocket by itself, much less with an mp3 player. I replaced the cord with Shure's straight cord, just to find the cord was still something like 8 feet long, and made of the same low-quality garden hose plastic. The best thing about this cord, how it locks into the headphone, also made it very hard to find a third-party, decent cord. After some hunting on eBay, I found a reasonable length cord made from decent material. I should not have to go through this much trouble to find a cord I can walk with, and don't completely understand the appeal of a cord this long, unless you sit 10 feet away from your audio jack in a studio.

Sound:
I'm no audiophile, but I can tell you without a doubt that this is some of the best sound you can find in a headphone at this price range. Each instrument in your music becomes separate from each other, and much more clear. Low quality earbuds will bother you with how muddled they sound after listening to these cans. With a headphone amp such as the FiiO E11, you can even hear small details of each instrument that are difficult to describe. The sound of these headphones is never harsh, and the sound is warm but crisp. The only downside of the sound is a minor deficiency in bass. A lot of headphones have far too much bass, but these have the treble slightly overpowering. I'm not complaining- this is easy to fix with a small EQ adjustment.

Conclusion:
Overall, these are great headphones. I'm fairly picky about quality, and most likely, others won't have as much of a problem with the design of these cans. The manufacturer was likely trying to keep the price down on these while still maintaining an entry-level audiophile sound. Thanks for reading my review, I hope it helped decide your purchase. Below is where I found my custom cord and earpads:

235,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these just before leaving on a week-long vacation, on which they got quite a bit of use.

SOUND: I didn't burn them in, but right out the box they sounded great. The bass tends to be weaker than I'd like on some songs, but on others is all-enveloping and punchy... so it obviously depends on the recording/compression/etc. On my iPod the sound was noticeably flat sounding... but plugged into the audio port on my MacBook Pro, they sound incredible. Spoken word is especially impressive, such as podcasts, movie trailers, etc. I mostly listen to electronic, trance, pop, new wave, and many ""independent"" artists... so I really wanted something that would bring out the vibrancy and depth of my library w/o making a $400+ investment. These do the job very, very well.

DESIGN & BUILD: The only thing that really turned me off to these phones was the vinyl ear pads, which seemed cheap and out-dated - that is, before I opened the box. They are actually very soft, durable and of very good quality. The SRH 440s hug my head perfectly. The only discomfort I get is when they are on for long periods of time, as the lack of cushioning on the headband tends to be quite painful for me... but I find this only happens when they are sitting just a bit too far back on the top of my head, and so a quick adjustment alleviates it immediately. Like others have said, the build of the 440s is solid and made to last. The small wires that run from each earphone into the headband cause me to be more careful when handling them though... I'm just afraid I'll snag them on something.

OVERALL: These are my first over-the-ear headphones, and the sound and build is all of fairly high quality. I've owned some great sound systems, for example my previous car was an imported Volvo w/ Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (I have never and have yet to hear a sound system so powerful and sophisticated, on the right night/day, that baby could take me to another galaxy lol) and I think I know sound well enough for my endorsement to be warranted and informed. For the price, these are an essential for either the casual listener or audiophile looking for a decent pair of headphones (and I supposed studio recording as well, as that is what they are made for)."
236,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are wonderful headphones. I needed to limit my expenditure to $100 or less and tried to compare different products around that price. Being an old guy, I listen to everything, classical, jazz, rap, rock, opera and so on, but not Justin Bieber. ;-) They are very comfortable and handled everything beautifully. Cecilia Bartoli's Don Giovanni is crisp and clean. Notorious B.I.G's Ready to Die is rich and deep in the bass and his great voice clearly articulated. You can hear all the subtle interplay on Miles Davis' Stella by Starlight. I compared these to Beats by Dr. Dre, which cost dearly. Frankly, I don't hear a big enough difference to justify spending another $100, but each to their own. The detachable cord is a nice touch. All the good reviews these get are well-deserved."
237,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Whoever I bought this from was great because they let me return it & I didn't have to pay to have them intercept it from the carrier. What great customer service - very professional & friendly. I do own a pair of these, and wow, they are amazing. I e-mailed customer service, and apparently you can buy the earcups for the 840's & those will give u better bass response. I'm not sure if you'd want it personally (Because they are so neutral already & that's kind of the point), but that's one area I had problems with when it came to mixing -- otherwise they are really great at getting a good feel of how the landscape & mix sounds. I would say that these are the best for a neutral sounding mix. What you hear is what you get besides the bass which is a little weak in the mix, but that is ok too. Like I said, you can get the 840 cups, but I heard on the internet that these were purposely made neutral compared to the 840's for mixing and monitoring. I might get the 840's cups because the bass was a little weak in mixing & I made the bass a little loud and had to readjust the bass mix on stereo speakers (which is good to do anyways). So there you have it. Would recommend over the HD 280's & basically anything else in this price range (have not compared to Sony's 7506 but from a couple reviews they are at least equal with the 7506's except maybe the bass but the tone is more neutral & even overall -- I heard that the 7506's are a little pronounced in the high mid's)."
238,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure makes rock solid stuff. These headphones are no exception. I use them for video audio editing and hear stuff on these my ears don't hear any other way. Built with a plug in to replace cord that is inexpensive was one deciding factor, others were the solid build and Shure's Military quality products. I've got a Shure 58 mike that they demonstrate driving a nail through a 2x4... if that's what a sensitive mike will take, I figure I can beat a rhinoceros senseless with these and still have them working. Highly recommended."
239,4.0 out of 5 stars,"To continue on this trend, they're perfect headphones. Only improvement is quality: but I'm talking $500 dollar quality. For the price they're great overall. My main concern was durability, connections, and comfort. You can wear these for hours, and you won't feel them, since they completely go around the ear. They can be dropped and won't break, and the wire as well as the cushions are replaceable so that's all a plus. The phone line wire is also a plus, as won't make you trip over everything or fear for the life of headphones as they hook on door knobs, etc. AND IT ALWAYS happens, you know it too.

Overall - - cannot complain. The BASS could be better, but for $70 bucks? Once again, I'm talking ridiculous, move your brain bass - these headphones produce great quality, just not at the $300-500 range of course.

Buy them - I did days of research on this before purchase, and it paid off: best headphones for this price by far."

I received these for Christmas and proceeded to have an extended listening session with my iPod. I initially thought they were ok but as I listened more I heard some stuff that I just did not like. In the low end I heard quiet a bit of distortion when the bass drum and bass guitar really got going. By the way the mids and highs were really crisp but what are they without the low end.

257,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased the Shure 440's from Amazon and have been completely satisfied with them. These headphones are very comfortable and keep sound in and out fairly well. I will say that the bass isn't going to blow you away but the overall sound quality of the headphones is very crisp and clear. The detachable headphone jack is also a plus, considering that I have ruined many good headphones by damaging the cord. If you have your eyes on these headphones I would still recommend that you test before you buy to see how you like them."
258,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound Quality was okay after hours of breaking it in but I was still a little disappointed for the price. Surprisingly heavy and gets uncomfortable quickly.
259,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is my first set of headphones. I like the great sound quailty. Over the ear is the way to go these headphones are more than what I need.

270,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These 'phones were recommended to me by an audiophile friend. I've recently picked up a few hours a week of voicetracking work, and was happy to buy new headphones! I was very pleased when I received these; they sounded great and were wonderfully compact. After a few weeks, I started having problems: they cut in and out on me. Sometimes they would work, sometimes they wouldn't. And two weeks ago, the ear pads both fell off. I'm just very disappointed- for what I expected the quality and durability of these to be paired with the price tag, I sure hadn't anticipated problems like these."
271,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price of these headphones, you can't go wrong. I decided to upgrade from the cheap Skullcandies, and these headphones blow them out of the water. They sound amazing and the build quality is great too. I can hear details my music I never heard before. They tend to get a little uncomfortable after an extended period of time, but that will happen with over the ear headphones. If you're thinking about getting these, don't hesitate."

273,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these when looking for a replacement for my Sony MDR-V6 cans, which I had used professionally as a radio DJ for 20 years.
I was very disappointed with the sound of the Shures. I found them to be mid-heavy and muffled with weak highs and non-existent lows.
The build quality is very nice and they are fairly efficient or I wouldn't give them 3 stars.
But even though they say the new ones ""aren't as good as the old ones"" I got another pair of the Sony MDR-V6s... which btw I think are also superior to the Sony MDR7506."

283,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are really great to listen to music with. Details really jump out of songs that I never remembered hearing before.
284,3.0 out of 5 stars,This is an audiophile headphone. If you are looking for an exciting or fun headphone or a headphone with any kind of beat to it....Look elsewhere.
285,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these 3-4 years ago and still going strong. The ear cushions were not comfortable after long uses when I first go them; however, they are perfect now. Many of the comments have alternative cans to modify but I haven't tried them.

I'm not an audiophile; however, the sound quality is much better than the stock headphones you would receive with iphone or Galaxy devices."

Other thoughts: Build out of plastic, wires stick out"
288,5.0 out of 5 stars,This headphones sound great. Made for high quality sound sources. Great on high frequencies. The only down side is that you might need to equalize a little to tweak the bass.
289,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it for a home studio project, a good alternative to the expensive headphones used for professional.
It produces a clear sound and enables monitoring to be precise.

I will recommend it to my peers if they were to get a monitoring headphones in a mid range pricing."
290,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Totally disappointed. I could not get a good fit, they slipped off my head. I could not get them to stay on. This isn't helped by the coiled cord, which either pulled my headphone amp off my desk or the phones off as it's too stiff, would hardly uncoil. The volume was WAY too low- playing at a medium volume I could not hear the music. Sorry, but they were useless to me."
291,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is better than Beats by Dre, Skullcandy, Sennheiser, etc. The flaw is the long cord. Besides that, it is great. Doesn't look cool like Beats, but who cares they are headphones. Great purchase."

297,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use it to monitor my pro tools tracks.
298,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In running a professional studio finding the right headphones has always been a problem. They need to be durable, true sounding and isolating. We always used the AKG 141's and 240's but they are not very robust and need lots of TLC to keep running. They sound great but are open backed so the isolation is not optimal. But now a new pair of 141's are close to $150.The Beyer Dt 770 are better isolating, though they sound a bit ""canny"" not very natural in the vocal range. But they are $199 a pair.The Audio Technica ATH 50's sound great but are also in the $200 range

Enter Shure, the makers of the revered 57 microphone. The SRH 440 Headphones sound excellent,isolate well,are rugged and best of all I found them for $80 on Amazon. Now when they get thrown across the room I don't worry.

The only thing I don't like about them is the coil cord they come with. Straight cables are much more practical for studio use. But the cables are detachable.

We've been using them for a few weeks now and they are liked by me and the professional singers we work with.

300,5.0 out of 5 stars,These head phones are a must for anyone who does any semi professional to full professional sound technician work!!! And such a good price!!
301,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these about two years ago. At first they sounded terrible. I just dismissed them altogether and used my stereo monitors to produce music instead of these. I then went back and used them extensively for several months. They did sound better after awhile. I guess they needed to be burnt in. I still feel that I wasted my money on these. The sound is very flat (ideal for hearing each track), but they are so flat that it just sounds muddy across the board.
The bass is nonexistent. The mids are muddy, and the highs are very low in the spectrum. I've listened to all kinds of music through these and it is what it is. I think they should lower the price dramatically for these. I'd say $35 to $45 would be more like it. Overall, I would NOT recommend them, but they do barely do what they are advertised. There are so many better cans out there that you might as well spend $30 or more for. The Audio-Technica ATH-M50 is what I use now and it is a world of difference. I cannot say enough good things about that particular pair.

These are just so muddy and blah. Save your money."

305,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
306,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I initially liked these headphones a lot- they seemed to reproduce mixes I tested on them accurately, and were very neat and sturdy in design.

My opinion changed recently when after a number of really bad experiences of dubbing vocals, I found that the culprit was none other than these headphones.

My Apogee Duet produces a great, clear sound that translates well on my Sennheiser headphones, however those aren't closed back like these. I got these to monitor instruments and vocals as I would record them, however I would choke (and others who tried to sing with these on as well) and have difficulty in doing so.

The underlying reason, I found, was that these headphones over-accentuate the high frequencies to where listening through them is unbearable and makes monitoring sounds painful.

I think this is specifically the case with me because the Duet seems to deliver very transparent high frequencies, but I noticed the same increase in driving the hi's when I A/B'd directly from my Macbook, and it made me super uncomfortable to listen to.

I'd warn anyone before buying and committing to these, to test them first and return them if they give you the same difficulties and uneasiness they've given me especially while recording."
307,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad sound. Save your money.
308,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SRH440 is the best set of over ear monitors I've ever heard for critical listening in the price range. I don't think you can buy a better set of non-noise canceling cans for around $100. I think many headphones that cost $200 or less fall short of the sound quality. The build quality is sturdy, and I can tell I will have these headphones for a lifetime. Even not extended, they hug my very average sized head just right, and there's plenty of slack for people with bigger heads. And they are comfertable for hours at a time, and the pads are soft pleather but, not the cheap stuff. Plus they are replaceable.
They keep a fairly decent amount of sound out, if they were a little more snug they would keep more out, but even so walking down the street you have to try to get distracted by cars going by. If you're from or have ever been on the T in Boston, you know how loud it is. With these things on my head, I can still hear the very muted grinding of the rails, but its hard to care when even on the quietest volume setting on my 80GB ipod classic the music is not only still very audible, it's clear as day.
The highs, mids, and lows are completley balanced like a flat equalizer setting, unbiased on there own and not effecting each others presence. I wouldn't recommend them if you're a bass junkie, because the base is very smooth and even for both electronic music or a big jazzy double bass. Whether on the lowest or highest volume on any device I've used it with, everything is extremely clear and life-like. All genres of music and talk. Listening to rock you can relearn what distortion is supposed to be, listening to classical you can hear the sweat on the soloist fingers as they slide around the strings, listening to stand up has that scratchy, sweaty pickup of a comedy club mono channel microphone.
I bought these for an everything, every day user after enjoying the Shure SE210 in ear monitors for two years. I took a chance because I didnt know a lot about these phones, just that shure had not yet let me down. I must say, I am a customer for life.
I cant even begin to imagine what the SRH840's sound like, but I'm guessing for $200 they blow everything $350 and under out of the water.

*Edit: Great shipping and service from Sarjo Wholesale Group.Thanks!"
309,5.0 out of 5 stars,NO REVIEW NECESSARY...THE RATINGS SPEAK FOR ITSELF...GREAT PRODUCT FOR ME WHEN I'M DOING MY MUSIC IN THE STUDIO
310,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not someone to write many reviews but in this case i will. i purchased these, used them the first month, worked fine and sat them a side for about a year. I plugged them this morning and now they have a short in them. Do not buy these, a waste of 100 bucks."
311,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I started out looking for a headset, and everyone said ""go get some headphones and a mic, it will sound a lot better"" so I did, and honestly I was expecting more. These headphones sound about the same to me as my logitech g35s, which cost the same amount, and were actually comfortable. I'm just going to list the rest of this in pros and cons though, because that will make it a lot more clear.

Pros: none, I mean honestly, they sound the exact same to me.

Cons:

Comfort: This is honestly the least comfortable thing I have ever worn, people will recommend the shure 840 earpads, and while that helps a little they are still extremely uncomfortable. Basically, if you want to pay $90 for a constant headache, then these are for you. The earpads that come with the headset are entirely too small and incredibly uncomfortable, and the headband causes me frequent headaches.

Sound quality: I am no audiophile, and maybe I'm just deaf or something, but these sound no better than my old G35s which is a usb headset for those who don't know.

Basically, this headset was quite possibly my least pleasant purchase I have ever made, and I intend to return it as soon as time allows."
312,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the design and portability considering they're over the ear headphones. Shure in general is a high quality brand, with a great reputation for making professional products. However, these sound terrible. The sound is garbled and muddy, and lacking definition. Bass especially loses definition. My old Sony MDR-V6's, which needed to be replaced after over a decade of reliable use and performance, sound substantially better than the Shure's. I tried a friend of mine's top of the line version of these, and they sounded very good. They were natural and neutral sounding, yet well defined. He and I both thought I would still get a good sounding product even with a lower end model. That's unfortunately not the case. I tried to see if burning them in over night would help, but my complaints never changed. The material covering the phones seems to easily soil, leading me to believe they won't hold up over time. Even the the foam surrounding the ear pieces seemed to loose their firmness after an hour or so of continuous listening. I don't expect these to last me anywhere near as long as my Sony's did, and they certainly don't sound as good. There are a few positives, such as the fact they fold up relatively compact making them fairly easy to travel with for headphones of this type. And the cord is detachable which should help it last longer in terms of wear and tear. These are also very sensitive phones. I plugged them into an airplane jack and they seemed a little loud even at the lowest volume setting. However, overall I would not recommend these or purchase them again."
313,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm the type who likes to hear every detail in the music. When listening to an old analog track from the 70s I actually think it's cool to hear the increasing ""hiss"" as each instrument is punched in as the song builds. Or to hear the singer(s) take a breath just before committing their lines. Both the Sennheiser HD-280 Pro(which I have owned since 2007) and Shure's newer SRH-440 enable me to do that very well, and at *reasonable* not too loud volumes.

I looked up both headphones at headphone . com. The graphs of their freq response correspond well with how they actually sound to my ears, hence the title to this review. Both phones are very close in performance in the lows to mids, and in the high frequencies. I have next to no sensitivity above 12kHz, so I cannot comment on either in that respect.

Where they differ, and you will see this at the website I referenced, is in their handling of deep(below 80Hz) bass and of the high-midrange section (3-4kHz). The Sennheiser does NOT lack for bottom! It's not boomy - just *there*. The Shure needs a little nudge of the LF EQ band to match the Senneheiser, but where it out""shines"" the Sennie is in that high area just where midrange becomes treble. It isn't glaringly bright there, but you can definitely hear more breathing and sibilance through the Shure. The Sennheisers are good for overall listening, but if you are a techno or house/club music junkie or modern rock affecionado you will fall in love with the bass bottom of these. The Shures have most of the spectrum covered, but will specifically satisfy classical listeners with their interpretation of strings and other high-freq instruments, as well as jazz and most rock sub-genres.

All in all, they are a draw as far as sound quality goes.

Construction/Comfort wise, both are decently built. Nothing plasticky cheap about either, although the Sennheiser is slightly heavier. The HD280 has that ""vise-grip"" on your head - something which I just accepted as being part & parcel with classic German quality. It doesn't bother me and has actually loosened slightly in the 3 years I've owned them. The Shure - not nearly as tight. In fact, when leaning my head up to see my monitor or down to see what the cat is throwing up(!) the headband slips down over my forehead or back. If the Sennies were tight these are loose! No amount of adjustment helps, unless one has a much larger head than I.

Still, they isolate sound almost as well as the Sennheisers, and sound just as good, in their own way. I recommend either - and find it a good idea to have two decent cans around to listen to and monitor my music. There is also a body of thought out there that both speakers and headphones should be ""broken - or burned"" in. Nothing wrong with that, so long as bass/treble controls are kept flat and no EQ is employed. Play a variety of your favorite CDs through the headphone at the loudest volume you'd COMFORTABLY listen to for AT LEAST 10-12 hours, and let them play over night in the corner. ++On that note a good-old-fashioned CD carousel or 6disc magazine is a great asset++ Burning in can't hurt, as long as the phones or speakers aren't blasting to the point of distortion. And my Sandisk Sansa mp3 player drives them both quite well, the Shures slightly louder at the same volume given the Sennheisers."
314,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have Shure mic. for ever, so I thought Shure headphone must be great... boys that was a mistake... sounds like crap, no bass, sounds leak, uncomfortable to wear... poorly design and just look cheap... I returned it."
315,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Others have written better reviews than I could but after owning these for 5 years I have a couple recommendations.

1) They do creak - This can be lessened or eliminated completely by using some silicone lubricant at the joints. Do not use oil or grease though as it could eat the plastic.
2) The standard ear pads aren't very comfortable. I swapped mine out with Shure HPAEC940 Replacement Velour Ear Pads for SRH940 Headphones (Pair). They're MUCH better and fit perfectly.
3) If you're adventurous... some people have modded these headphones with amazing results. Check the google if interested.

Overall these headphones have and continue to serve me well. For the price, I'm not sure they can be beat."
316,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received a 'refurbished' Shure SRH440 a few days ago. It was just like new but the seal on the box had been opened. At first, I liked it, but didn't love it.

But as others have mentioned, the ear pads aren't great. Shure should bite the bullet and just build the 440s with the 840s ear pads! I haven't ordered the Shure 840 ear pads as many have recommended (why should the user have to spend another $15 to make the product comfortable???)...instead I did the 'sock mod'...I am just NOT a fan of 'pleather'.

Swiped a black pair of socks (not too thin and not too thick, but soft) from the hubby's sock drawer and cut the top 3.75"" off of each one. Put the top (finished) end of the sock around the outside of ear cup and tucked the 'cut' end into the recess inside the ear pad. However, it won't stay tucked without help. I cut two 9"" segments (one for each ear pad) from a TV cable (coax) and curled them into tight circles and tucked them into the recess inside the ear pad, to hold the cut end of the socks in place. Ahhh...much better now.

Some people have said they don't feel the 440 has enough bass, but it is perfect for me...I do not like deep, heavy, booming bass. The sound is crisp, clear, clean. Very good isolation...outside sounds stay outside...inside sounds stay inside...just as you would expect from a circumaural, closed-back headphone.

I have seen several 440s (as well as 840s) on Ebay broken at the hinges. The 440 is plastic, so I would recommend putting it on, taking it off, and adjusting it using equal pressure with both hands and being gentle when folding up.

While reading reviews, do note that everyone has different shaped/size heads and ears, and different hearing acuity. I guess that is why reviews for the same model of headphones often range from 1-5 stars!

I am giving these 4 stars due to the ear pads and potential for breakage at the hinges. I also wish that there were more cable choices instead of long coiled or long straight. I would much prefer a 3-4 foot straight, but since there is a special connector at the end that attaches to the headphone, I haven't found any alternatives. Some enterprising person should make different lengths and sell them on Ebay!

I think the sound is GREAT and highly recommend the 440s in the under $100 headphone class....but I am NO EXPERT!

However, check out the ""NVX Audio XPT100 Studio Over-Ear Headphones w/ ComfortMax Earpad Cushions and Extra Pair of Angled Earpads"", as well as a short and long cord, and padded storage container...on Amazon, which I rated 5 stars.

UPDATE 10/12/14 - In order to make the 440 more comfortable/useable:

Go to a fabric store and get a piece of 'minky' material to wrap around the headband for cushioning:

317,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome! Clear, full, rich sound with strong response across the entire frequency range without overwhelming bass! They are also quite comfortable and the shape and size of the earcups is almost perfect in my opinion. I love the removable/replaceable cord with the twist to lock feature. It's also coiled which I prefer since coiled wires stay out of the way more and still have the necessary length. I compare these with ANY headphones at twice the price!! I can think of only two extremely minor quibbles about these - 1) The exposed wires by each earcup might get caught on something, and 2) They are a little on the weighty side. I would point out that the exposed wires makes it easier for the hinged earcups to fold up into the headpiece easier. Given the tremendous quality of sound and workmanship of these headphones, it seems rather picayune to point out such minor imperfections of such a stellar product! I have several other sets of headphones of common, well known brands that are all very good, but none of them are as excellent as these! I cannot recommend the Shure SRH440 more highly!! Fantastic sound at a great price! Remember these are designed as studio or home headphones and not meant to be worn while walking around, running, etc."
318,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like to analyse music sounds. I usually listen a song many times over and enjoy various parts of instrumental at different instances. I do not appreciate any deviation from flat response by phones (or speakers) as it can be easily achieved by equalizer, but cannot be undone if you buy a low quality phones with distinctive resonances. For long time I have been using Sennheiser HD45x series and more recently Sennheiser 280. As much I have been surprised when putting these first time on (in 1994) I am now surprised with my newest acquisition SURE SRH 440. Yes the difference is clearly audible: mid and high tones are ""clearer"". Note that this is not simply described by a frequency response. Clearness means that the membrane can reproduce more complex non-repetitive sounds more faithfully. There is no clear technical measure of it: one must hear the difference. With SRH 440 I can hear and trace hidden tones and their echos (if exist) much clearer and at lower volume than with any others I tried. That said, one has to be aware of other limitations. Sound cards of most computers and laptops (I do not even want to go into mobiles), bad studio recording practice, low bps rendering etc. are sufficient to erase any advantage of these fine phones versus cheaper ones.You also need to have very good ears too. I know that because of my old age (50), or too many antibiotics, my right ear has slightly lost its analytics (that said it is still excellent) so I am not going to buy $2k phones in this incarnation no more. Having in mind average level of bad hearing of the hi-fidelity-equipment-ignorant generation (people coldly enyoing 128kbps mp3s or not being able to hear a difference between mono and stereo), I believe that these phones are just too god for most. So do not dwell: buy it and I ma pretty sure you'll enjoy it."
319,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones sound good. I used them at work nearly every day for about two years. The main problem is that you have to hold really still. The headphones are light, mostly due to the plastic construction. After using them for a few months, they started squeeking when I moved. The longer I used them, the more they squeeked at all the plastic joints. If I hold still, they sound great. But since I don't sit that still, I've switched over to using the Sony MDR7520 instead. Sound quality is still excellent, but the cheap squeeky plastic is gone."
320,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SRH440's are just jaw dropping amazing phones. I wanted a good set of headphones to listen to my music and as a monitor when I play my keyboard. I set out to Guitar center set to spend around $250. To my amazement Guitar center did not have a demo station set up. I was still able to demo several brands Senns,Audio Tech, upon request using my ipod as a source. I demoed the Senn HD 380 pro, nice sound,comfortable,not blown away. I also tried out the Audio Technica ATH-M50 witch was a big let down after reading all the great reviews. I has a very boomy(loose) bottom end and the mids and highs were average at best. I then went to Sam Ash just around the corner and they had an awesome demo station set up with probably 20+ headphones for demo (from $29-$179) and they had some more expensive ones in a glass case that the salesman said I was welcomed to try. I think I tried them all,Sony 7506,KRK 8400,Senns 280 pro,380 pro, Shure 840's(nice but somewhat flat for mixing). I didn't try any of the $300+ phones ,out of my price range. When I put The Shure 440's on it was like the music came to life, beautiful mids, bass was punchy not boomy at all and the highs were great also. I've read complaints that the bass is lacking, well not from my ears. It's punchy and precise,perfect. If you're into artificial unnatural boomy sounding bass then you'll probably like the Dr.dre's. These are the best sounding closed headphones at $200. and below without a doubt. Comfort is another thing, very stiff pads. I changed mine out with the Shure 840 pads,HEAVEN ! Get these and be happy !"
321,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using Shure SRH440 headphones as a hobbyist audio engineer since 2009, and there are so many things to love about these headphones.

Pros:
* Fantastic sound quality across the entire spectrum. Deep lows, solid mids and crystal clear highs; in the top 10% of headphones I've used
* Comfortable fit and size for average and large heads
* Well constructed, solidly built; I transport my set back and forth from work every day without a case, still working as well as the day I bought them
* Fabric/leather have deteriorated significantly over the years of abuse, but this is only cosmetic, and held up much better than expected
* Decent noise isolation -- not amazing, but good
* Comes with 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter
* Extendable cord for easy for comfortable mobility while wearing set
* Comes with great fabric carrying case

I can only think of one con:
* Very thin layer of fabric between your ear and plastic -- can get uncomfortable after extended use

I've had these headphones for 7 years, one of the best purchases I've ever made. If you want a good mid-range set of headphones that give you clear and accurate sound, you couldn't do better than this set."
322,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am happy with this product, so far. I have only had it for a week so I can't be sure how durable it is, but it was comfortable enough to wear for several hours without much pain. I have somewhat large ears that are often hurt my studio headphones, but these aren't so bad. They hurt slightly less with the SHR840 ear muffs I bought for them, as well.

The sound these produce seems accurate and balanced. I was expecting a little bit more of the higher frequency bass and a little less of the lowest frequencies, but I think that was because my other headphones are designed to emphasize bass, which is bad for my current needs. If I want bass, I would rather use a knob or filter to get it. I do wish Windows had a global equalizer. It's insane that we have to rely on sound drivers for a global equalizer under a modern Microsoft OS. I guess I could always get an external one if it bothers me that much.

These really are great sounding headphones; especially for recording."
323,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a big head, and I found the stock ear pads combined with the headband size gave me headaches within an hour every time I put these on. In addition, my first pair had mismatched drivers (or some other issue) causing one side to play significantly more quietly than the other. After noticing this issue, I measured the resistance of each driver at the jack and one was ~39ohms and the other was ~70ohms. I guess this may be a somewhat widespread issue, because a few of the reviews I found online show frequency response curves with seemingly significant differences between each ear's driver.

I was able to work with Shure to get a replacement, and they were very responsive and their replacement process is totally reasonable. (They don't offer advance replacement, but overall the process was easy to follow and they don't even require an RA number for you to send items in for repair, just that you complete a repair form and send it along with the item.) The replacement set resolved the issue with one side playing more quietly than the other. The replacement set came in full retail packaging with all accessories too, so that was nice.

To address the comfort issue, I upgraded the earpads to the HPAEC840 model. That helped quite a lot, and I can wear these now for probably 90 minutes without a headache. I think the band has stretched a bit over time as well, so overall they're reasonably comfortable today.

As for the sound, I really enjoy it. I like the sound better than the Koss A-250 headset that I'd used many years before this. The sound seems very natural, and when I use an equalizer to flatten the response, they actually have remarkably good bass for a 40mm headset. The EQ settings I'm using today are:
29Hz: 0.0dB
59Hz: -9.4dB
119Hz: -10.1dB
237Hz: -7.5dB
474Hz: -10.1dB
947Hz: -7.5dB
1.9kHz: -5.0dB
3.8kHz: -7.5dB
7.5kHz: -10.1dB
15kHz: -7.5dB"
324,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok I heard a lot of good things about these online and decided that I wanted some headphones for home use so I decided to get these.

At first use, the sounds are very decent with excellent mid range sounds. This is not a headphone for people that like the sound of bass that rattles a car's trunk. These are for those that want to hear every detail in a song...even the minute ones. It offers good bass, but just not to an extreme some people would like.

I had an issue though it seems to have gone away. I would have one side of the headset go out but slowly. The music would cut, then vocals. I checked to see if it was properly connected and twisted and it was. The issue seems to have resolved itself though its a bit unsettling once you've just received the headset.

Whats cool is that these headphones fold in so they are easier to transport if you do have to take them somewhere.

Personally, and if you have an ear with a protruding antihelix such as myself, these headphones (and probably many others) will hurt if you wear them for 30+ minutes. There is nothing but a very thin material between your ear and the plastic base over the speaker. This will push the ear creating discomfort.

Its a great headphone, but comfort is lacking (for me) and im concerned about the reliability of this pair...back to my music...

*update 6/14/11* having problems yet again with the left (cord side) speaker/cable problem. For some reason the speaker kicks in an out. Sometimes when I unplug it and plug it back in, it works...sometimes it doesnt fix the problem. I will probably have to contact the vendor.

*update 7/23/11* contacted seller about sending the headset back.

*update 8/12/11* contacted manufacturer

update and probably last. contact attempts failed with shure as they have been unresponsive to the last 2 emails i sent out. Feb 27 and March 8 were the last dates of the emails. Issue unresolved. Minus star for customer service."
325,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First pair of these SRH440's I heard had long been well broken-in and they sounded PHENOMENAL. GREAT bass, distinct mids and crisp highs. Very good sound stage, the kind you can imagine the sound out beyond your walls and that you can FEEL! Well, I got my own pair recently and I have got to say that unequivocably no doubt regardless of what anyone says; these things NEED a break-in period. Bass was great off the bat. But mids and highs were something to be desired. I used some high-frequency break-in sweeps from YouTube with the cups rubber-banded facing each other to isolate the sound during the break-in. Not too loud though. After some 50 hours of this, I must say I AM THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED! Sound across the spectrum just jumps out at you! BEST headphones I have ever owned! And I have heard some great ones from back in the 70's when AUDIOPHILE headphones sounded far better than most today! After break-in, sounded with FAR
better BASS,these sounds through the mids and highs like some of the better EARphones I have heard. FANTASTIC! GO SHURE!"
326,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This are the most amazing headphones ever, I simply love them, I have had them for years now, and I honestly wouldn't know what to do without them, they are just so natural. I am a professional Music Producer, I mix and do mastering for living, moved to NYC for grad school and I do not have mixing monitors here as I did back home, so, I had to get used to work on headphones, and of course I trusted this amazing ones, if you are a hip-hop/electro fan, I mean, IF YOU WANT ""BEATS"" SOUND-LIKE HEADPHONES,, THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR, if you instead do like good quality, natural sound and amazing resolution in all the frequency range, DON'T EVEN BOTHER LOOKING ANYWHERE ELSE, I have used very expensive headphones like the Sennheiser HD600, and they do not compare, I actually decided not to listen to any other headphones again in my life, so that way my ears get so used to this ones that I can keep mixing and mastering with no issues, that's how this headphones actually are, plus they are really comfortable and the fact that you can replace the cable makes them twice the awsome. please buy them"
327,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Except for the long connecting wire, these headphones work well in the gym. You need to wrap the long wire, and tape it, then keep in your gym shorts while exercising. After that, they work well. They do not get smelly or loose quality if worn frequently in the gym. And, the light weight design works well with any exercise. As for use as a studio headphone, maybe not so great. They keep out noise, but due to their design, do not have enough padding to keep out high level noise. Again, at the gym, that is good, so your buddy can get your attention.

My rating would be a two star if used by somebody serious in the music industry. For my use, it has worked just fine in the gym (except for the cable wire being too long.)"
328,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been happy with these headphones in terms of sound quality and build quality. Other reviewers have talked plenty about the audio quality, so i won't repeat their sentiments. I have a big head and big ears. When i extend the headband to 9 (goes to 10 max) i get a good fit. So, someone with an even larger noggin could make these fit. I've personally tried on the 440 and 840 Shures. Lots of recommendations out there for 440 owners to upgrade to the 840 ear cups. Having tried both, i can see why. They don't look different, but feel more supple. Well, now there's another option. Shure recently came out with the SRH-940 head phones with velour pads. Having tried another pair of hedphones with that material, i was in comfort heaven. I did some digging between Amazon and the Shure web site and found that the 440, 840, and 940 can use the same ear cups. So, for $30 more, i'm now sporting $300 worth of comfort on $100 head phones. I think you'd be happy with either the 840 or 940 ear cups, but i really like the 940 velour pads. Super comfy and i don't feel sweaty wearing them for extended periods. I wear them at work. Helps me focus on my work while tuning out the rest of cubeville. My only regret is now i'm at home, cringing while using my cheap USB Logitech heaphones. Never knew how bad they were until i got some good headphones....

The headband on the 440's could use improvement. It may be padded, but still hurts my head a bit. I'm getting more used to it after a couple weeks, but i had hoped i wouldn't have to get used to anything. As much as i still like my SRH-440's, i'm really thinking of the 940 now. The headband design looks super comfy and i know i'll love the ear cups :)

Look for part HPAEC940. At the time of this review, Amazon did not carry this part, so i had to look elsewhere. I ended up ordering from the earplug superstore. What a nice bunch of people! I love ordering from Amazon, but since i had no choice this time, it was a smooth transaction and awesome service from them."
329,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Having owned this pair for about a year and a half my view has changed with time. Depending on usage, shelling out on a more expensive set of cans may provide a noticeable/necessary benefit. I used my set for gaming/listening to music/watching movies/in-flight. No doubt are they great value for money but they do have a few shortcomings

COMFORT
These are comfortable for short usages (1~2 hours). However any longer than that and strain applies to both the ear and the point of contact with the scalp. The ear cups clench with almost an excessive force which is great for isolating the sound however NOT so great for extended use. However the main problem is the build of the padded band or rather, lack thereof. Despite having a padded appearance, the edges are reinforced with a hard plastic inside the band which destroys any of the padded comforting effect. However, I must stress, this is ONLY noticeable after extended use.

BUILD QUALITY
Great at first... After a year the plastics squeak on the slightest movement. This is, however, only a minor issue as most of the sound flooding into your ears will drown out these noises.

SOUND QUALITY
Superb for the price point. Strong bass and crisp upper range. You need to spend a quite a few more large ones before you can find a noticeable difference.

ISOLATION
Due to the tight fit, the passive isolation is good.

SUMMARY
Although most of this review might seem harsh, these are issues that appear only after long periods of use and after over a year of usage. For the price point, it is hard to find a better set of around-the-ear headphones."
330,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these headphones three months ago after searching for a worthy replacement of my Sennheiser HD-205.
SRH440's sound quality is amazing. Thanks to their great damping, all external noises are isolated, and you hear nothing but high quality sounds. As their impedance is 44 Ohms and not 32 as the HD-205, the bass is not as deep, but I found it satisfying enough. I use them to play an electronic drum set and enjoy every moment.

Two major reasons for which I decided to purchased them are:
1. Their perfect isolation level. As one who works at a shared space, isolation is crucial to avoid distractions. I also enjoy it for hearing clean sounds without hearing my surroundings.
2. I can use them for hours straight. I'm easily irritated by headphones/earphones and this model was the first one I felt good about. For example, I couldn't use my Sennheiser for more than 30 minutes cause they extremely hurt my ears.

There are a few cons as always, but I still think they worth 5 stars:
1. There's no ventilation (obviously. they're isolating). My ears become really warm after an hour or two, but it's not unbearable.
2. The cable is a bit short, which I find inconvenient when I play the drums with them on.
3. They're weigh slightly more than the rest of the headphones I tried on."
331,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE these headphones! But do know that if you buy these, you need to buy the replacement ear cushions (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Z9JWZS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). The difference after swapping the cushions was day and night. Not only was it significantly more comfortable, but the sound quality improved noticeably. The seal was better, blocking out sound and keeping sound in--the most noticeable change was with the bass.

The comparable headphone is the Audiotechnica ATH-M50, which many of my friends bought. It's a more popular choice, and it has better bass, but I personally prefer these headphones. They're cheaper, and with the new cushions it really has a nice, balanced bass. But not only that, my favorite part about these headphones is the bright sound--I absolutely LOVE it. You can't go wrong with these!"
332,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have several backpacks and camera cases for every occasion. In the same way, I have headphones for different occasions and uses. I needed a good closed back set of headphones with good noise isolation properties and good quality audio sound stage. Although I don't consider myself to be an audiophile, I enjoy listening to music and what better way to listen than through a good set of headphones. So, based on the number of outstanding reviews, I decided to purchase the SRH 440 headphones.

First Impressions:
Well, when I got them the first thing I noticed was that these are pretty big. I used to own a set of Sony MDR V4 headphones and also considered buying a set of MDR V6 headphones which are considerably smaller. The SRH 440s are larger with circumaural ear cups that fit around your ears vice on them. The packaging case is made of very good quality cardboard and it comes with a soft carrying case and 1/4 inch adapter. The headphones have a nice heft to them, but could be exhausting over long periods of time. Unfortunately, when I first put them on, the ear cups and headband were the first things I noticed as being quite uncomfortable, especially for the price. But overall, my first impression was that these cans were of very good quality.

Sound: 5
I can't say enough about the sound from these headphones. They are simply fantastic. I was most impressed with the full presence of bass and the mid range, encompassing a nice, 3 dimensional sound stage. I mainly use my Sennheiser PX100s on my laptop and previously considered them to be outstanding primarily for their value for money, so when I compared these SRH440s, I was quite surprised at the great quality sound. There is no comparison between a full-sized, quality closed-back set of headphones and a portable open back set. The SRH 440s are simply outstanding, producing a rich and ever-present soundstage.

Comfort: 3
I found that these headphones were let down in the area of comfort primarily for the ear pads. If they would have come with the SRH 840 earpads, I think that I would have kept them. My first impression when I put them on was that they should be softer around the ear as well as having a more plush headband. They dug into my head and I had to make several adjustments to them before they felt a little better. I was expecting a more plush feel to them and I unexpectedly got a much more firm fit and actually found them a little uncomfortable at first. Even after listening to them for several hours, I found that the pads around the ears never got more comfortable over use.

Look and Feel: 4
These headphones are built with quality in mind and it shows in their look and feel. They fit quite nicely and notwithstanding the comments I made about the comfort, they feel quite good on my head. I suppose I could have sprung another $20 for the SRH 840 earpads, but then the price of these headphones would be encroaching the realm of the Audio Technical ATH M-50s, which are considered the top contender in closed back headphones. The SRH440s look a little big on the head and have a decent clamping force, thereby holding them firm to your ears. They look great and feel OK, but if they were to have come with the SRH 840 earpads, I think that I would have kept them. I called Sure and asked them if they would replace the pads or exchange them for the SRH 840 earpads, but they were not very accommodating and seemed to imply that I should have bought the SRH 840s in the first place.

Durability: 5
They are built very well and could probably stand the rigors of heavy studio and home use. The coiled cord is nice and thick and having removable is a very nice touch. The plastics used for these headphones are made of quality materials and I feel that they are quite durable indeed.

Overall, I was let down in the area of comfort. Especially in the ear pads and somewhat in the headband, which I felt a little pressure on the top of my head. For the price you're paying, you should expect comfortable headphones. For a little more money, I returned them and bought the ATH M50s instead and now couldn't be happier."
333,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an owner of a five year old pair of their in-ear headphones and now these no frills value leaders, Shure has just become my go to for headphones of any type. At $79 these are a no-brainer. Demoed these next to the $100 KRK 6400 and $150 KRK 8400 and while maybe not quite as flat, they certainly are more musical and therefore my pick for everyday listening. Team them up with an amp if you can, they still sound good straight from the iPod or computer. Very comfortable, well built and all that. Not as beautiful or stylish perhaps as AKGs, Beyers and the like but try getting sound like this for $79 elsewhere. Don't even consider Bose, you'll overpay for bad sound. Comes with a nice long coiled cable which can be replaced with their straight one for a little cash. Highly recommended unless you can afford the Beyerdynamic DT 880 at three times the price."
334,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
- Sound great. There's pretty much nothing below 120hz, but I knew that going in. Their low-end sounds similar to the AKG K271, only with less chomp between 100-200hz. Still, their sound is enjoyable, and I think they will be useful for mixing.

Cons:
- Extremely, unbelievably uncomfortable. The ear cups are too shallow, the padding a insufficient. You can swap out the pads from the srh840/srh940 version for like $15-25, but supposedly that changes the sound, and not for the better.
- The creak when you move - no good for vocal tracking.
- My head might be a little on the small side, and the headband just fits at the smallest setting. If you've got a tiny head, these will be even less comfy. Headband also has insufficient padding, and is uncomfortable.

These could be decent headphones for <$60, but they are *not* worth $100. They feel cheap, they creak terribly, and are ridiculously painful to wear. I'm a bit insulted these list for $100, actually. You can buy a pair of AKG K271s for not much more, and they are *very* comfortable, especially the MKII model, which comes with the velour ear pads.

If you're going to spend $100 on headphones, you'd be better off spending it elsewhere, these are not worth it.

UPDATE: 11/05/15

Previously I was comparing these to my old AKG K270 headphones, which I don't currently have enough power to drive sufficiently, so I purchased the k271 mkII, which require less oomph to get them moving. Anyway, now I can definitely say that the SRH440 sound absolutely terrible in comparison. The SRH440 seems to have practically nothing below 200hz, and I think it starts to roll off even higher up. You can feel none of the bass, none of the kicks, whereas with the K271 mkII you can actually *feel* the bass, and not only the kicks, but the transients in general are sharp and potent, something entirely lacking in the SRH440, which sound like mush in comparison. No hyperbole here, the SRH440 sound dead and lifeless in comparison.

The stereo image on the K271 just blows the SRH440 out of the water, OMG, the SRH440 really do sound like mush in that aspect also. The clarity on the K271 models is astounding. The K271 is not known for its low-end response, it's actually anemic down there, but the low end *is there*, you can hear it, you can even feel it above 120hz. On the SRH440 it sounds like anything under 200hz is *absent*, just not even there. You can't feel it, fine, but you can't hear any of it either, it sounds like it's been abruptly cut off, no gently slope, just lopped right off.

Not to mention the K271 mkII are very comfortable -- if my k270 pair is any indication, you can wear them all day long and not incur *any* pain, whereas the SRH440 cannot be worn for mere minutes before becoming irritatingly painful. Also the SRH440 always fall off my head, where the K271 models do not. Actually, no circumaural headphones I have ever owned before have fell of my head like the SRH440 do, I do *not* know what their deal is.

I really wasn't expecting such a massive difference between the SRH440 and the K271 mkII. Yes, the K271 mkII are light and plasticky, but they still feel heaps more solid than the SRH440, which are embarrassingly cheap and crappy feeling.

The SRH440 are just a terrible buy for the price. These aren't worth more than $30 in my opinion."
335,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my pair of SRH440's for almost a year now and even when I managed to break 'em I STILL love 'em.

My first motivation to buy these was when I saw a couple of music videos of performers that I really dig wearing them in the recording studio.

I'm a public radio disc jockey. When I'm at home, in our tiny little house, I usually listen to new music and DVDs over ""cans"" in order to not disturb my family. My 440's open up whole new sonic vistas. Now bear in mind, I use them with a pretty groovy integrated amp, but for my money these babies sound GREAT. I've had lots of good mid-range to audiophile ""cans"" over the years (Koss, Sony, Sennheiser) but these remain my faves.

And they take a LOT of physical abuse both at home and going back and forth to the station, where they have Sennheisers but I've gotten so addicted to my Shures that I take the trouble to lug them around. Heck, I even took them with me to the hospital when I had to go through six weeks of chemo. I would have to spend 5-6 hours in a recliner and these Shures just blotted out everything and were comfortable enough to stay under for LONG periods of time.

At home, they get trashed. (I have teenagers who are musicians, what can I say?) One night, I stepped right on them on the floor in the dark. POW- broke a piece of the headband unit. Sent them to Shure in Illinois for repair under warranty. They turned them around in 3 days (in house) no questions asked. Love it. And when the warranty runs out, some of the critical ""high wear"" parts (cable, earpieces) are user replaceable.

Just last night, I was watching the DVD of Johnny Depp in ""Rango"" It sounded awesome (highly recommended- great music) and made Depp's voice sound just AH-MAY-ZING.

And for the money? Can't beat 'em with a stick. ENORMOUS value. If you love challenging music, give yourself a treat and buy a pair of these beauties."
336,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my favorite pair of headphones ever, and I very much would like to give it 5 stars but unfortunately they broke on me after about 1 month of use. The sound quality is simply amazing and I haven't been able to replicate the same depth and quality on any other pair of headphones no matter how expensive. Unfortunately the plastic parts on these seem to break easily as one of the ears broke and is not hanging loose after just transporting them in my backpack with no bumps or anything.

It's a shame because I really wanted to like these and use it for much longer. Sadly I had left the country where I bought them and even though I contacted the store, they couldn't locate my receipt which is required to send in the headphones for the warranty I'm still thinking about sending them in for repair and hoping that it wont cost me as much as a new pair would."
337,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This will not be long and silly. It is exact and to the point. They work great. Extremey well built. The sound from these are not embellished ,but honest. I have used many head phones over the years, and these are pretty much great sounding phones. Nice lows but not a ghetto thumping boom and thump, clear mid range, and superb highs. One would be hard pressed to damage these things-that is how well built they are. They also fold up nice for travel, and have a detachable coiled cord which is very sturdy. If you want to spend more cash, well, I would suggest the 840's-I have a pair of them as well, but alas, they cost a tad more, however, in Shure, you get more. I had bought the 440 model and was very impressed and because of this I spent a few bucks more for the 840's. Both sets of phones are extremely confortable, and both sound best with ""break in time'."
338,2.0 out of 5 stars,Im a club dj and have been doing 3-4 gigs a week for the past 10 years. This was my 3rd pair of headphones. I had 2 pairs of sony's before these but I forget the model. They were the silver dj headphones mdr700 or something. I wanted to switch it up and buy something different so I bought these. I used them in the same manner as my last two pairs of headphones and they crapped out after 11 months. They did not break but something crapped out in the cord where it meets the jack. They worked for about a month after the problem started and stopped working last weekend. I have used shure needles since I started djing so I figured these would be choice. Wrong! Im gonna try the sennheiser 280's next hopefully I have better luck with them.
339,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is very mediocre. Lack of punch and dynamics The overall build is very good but the exposed wire on each cup can become problematic.

I am producing music, and that requires very accurate monitoring. I have my studio monitors, but since I live in a dense environment, sound is an issue. I bought these Shures because they are close-backed, neutral, and most importantly had good reviews.

What I got:
These cans are built very sturdily. You can literally feel the quality of it. It is also very conservative looking. It is for the most part comfortable, although it is NOT the most comfortable thing I have ever tried on. I think the ear cups are a little thin, but you probably can replace them with the 840 models'. I really like the coiled cord, since it makes storing it so easy and its just very convenient. The actual sound isolation is so-so in my opinion, nothing too great, but not too bad either. As for the sound quality, these cans were AMAZING! It allows you to hear every pin drop in your music, which I am very surprised considering its price range. Again, they are NEUTRAL, so if you are a hardcore bass head, you gotta crank up EQ or buy other headphones. However, I find these okay for listening (I listen to electro, house, trance) as long as you EQ.

The verdict:
Very very good bang for the $$. I am very happy with SHURE, as they live up to their name of legendary quality. These headphones are highly functional and durable, and I would recommend it to anyone who is into music production."
341,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these 3 years ago. At the time, I got them for only $72. First off, these are very good headphones, especially for the price I paid. I find it pointless to try and describe specifics of sound quality to people on the internet, so I'm going to try to focus on other aspects of the headphones in this review. I'm going to touch on a few things I didn't like about them first.

- I did not like the coil cable. I've always had a hatred for coiled cables. Just a preference, not really a flaw since I know a lot of people like them. However, since the cable is removable, it can always be replaced with a straight one. I never cared enough to do that though.

- I found these uncomfortable, and that is the main reason I no longer use them. They mostly just felt tight around my head, and I couldn't wear them for long periods of time. For comparison, I also own an Astro A40 headset for gaming and a pair of Beats by Dre Studio headphones and both are much more comfortable to me.

- This wasn't a problem for me, but i didn't like how exposed the wires are that lead into the ear cups. It seemed like it would be easy for something to rip them out or cut them accidentally. It does come with a leather bag to store them in, so if you plan on being mobile with these, I would advise using it.

Sound quality wise, these are excellent and an overall great value. If this is would be your first pair of reference headphones, you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal. I no longer use these, but I gave these to a friend of mine and he loves them too. If you've only ever used the awful ear buds that came with your phone, you will be very happy. Keep in mind, if you only have 128kbps songs on your computer, or primarily listen to music from YouTube, don't expect to be all that impressed. Bad quality music will only sound worse through these. It's a lot like watching standard definition programming on a 60"" LED HDTV and expecting it to look better because your TV is so good.

Also, I did buy a cheap amplifier after about a year of owning them and it did help out a little, especially since I like a little more bass in my music than these provide. Just remember, some people like these because of the mids and highs, and some people hate these for the lack of bass. Likewise, some people love Beats for their emphasis on lows, and some people hate them for their lack of quality mids and highs. It all comes down to what you want out of your music.

Are these worth $300? No. Are they worth $150? I think so. Are they worth the $72 I paid? Absolutely."
342,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So, yes, the headphones sound great, they are fairly comfortable (though the headband could be a little cushier--the top of my head starts to hurt after extended use)and aesthetically they can't be beat (Monster Beats... gross, gag me with a spoon) BUT--there is one downside that makes me wish I had returned my pair when I had the chance (no one's fault but my own, I know, I know, woe is me):

These things are creaky!! When you're wearing them, for example, with no music playing (why?? I don't know) you need only flex your jaw muscles, or tilt your head IN THE SLIGHTEST to hear the loud creaking of plastic, seemingly coming from where the can meets the headband (I'm just guessing at the appropriate terminology here).

Once I noticed it, I couldn't NOT notice it, even when listening to music loudly. The only way to avoid it is to keep your head completely still--which is not realistic, ESPECIALLY if you are hoping to walk somewhere while listening to music, which I like to do. Now, when walking, I find myself concentrating more on keeping my head stationary then on the music. Sorry Shure, these are some sexy headphones, but I can't recommend them."
343,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Haven't spent a lot of time with them, but the sound very good. I used them with some recording equipment and they sound clean. I also tried them with my HTC phone and they sound good with that as well, plenty of volume. I like the coiled cord and that is has both the 1/8"" and a 1/4"" jack adapter. As someone else reported the head band is a bit hard, not a bit deal, but that was the only thing I didn't like. Overall would buy again!"
344,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are comfortable and have great sound quality, but they are WEAK. I kept mine very delicately for almost two years now: never wore them in public, never twisted the sides, never put any unnecessary stress on them. Yesterday I turned the headphones around because one of my ears were sore, and doing this somehow caused the left ear part to completely break off. You cannot buy these headphones if you want them for long time use, which is sad as they have a great sound that I would like to recommend"
345,5.0 out of 5 stars,"pros:
1. I love the clean even sound, these don't add base, they let you hear the audio as it is.
2. Some have said that these are too big to carry around. They are studio size, I bought them for recording and editing but I like them so much I take them everywhere, they fold up well and can take a beating. These go into my backpack and travel with me every day.
3. I love that the SRH440 parts can be purchased and replaced individually. I've had these for about two, maybe three years and the cushions are just now starting to crack a bit despite all my abuse. I will replace those for less than 20 bucks.

Cons:
1. Only con I can think of is that the protective bag that ships with these to enable you to transport them without harm is a little tight and inconvenient so I never use it, this is why the ear pads are getting a little rough. I noticed the 900 series has more of a shaped hard case. This would be ideal.

Summary:
I don't think you will find a better set of headphones within $120 of this price."
346,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this pair of headphones primarily on impulse, my Beats Solo had finally given out to poor use by a friend of mine and because I'm in college and speakers are not really an option considering my room layout. I felt it time, to invest in a new pair of headphones.
I did a small amount of research before I bought these headphones and I found that most reviewers found a nice clear sound with these headphones and I commonly found a very high comfort rating from these headphones. What I failed to see (or ignored) was the somewhat poor bass response these headphones give right out of the box. This wasn't a dealbreaker for me, it's simply the fact that most of the music I listen to is either bass driven or has a high emphasis on bass.
The build quality of these headphones is to be admired however. Aside from the exposed cable on the sides of the headphones, the build quality here is incredibly sturdy. It seems as though these headphones can survive a beating if need be, which considering that they are studio headphones, they really shouldn't be. The headband of these cans is made of a high quality metal I believe, and they are able to stretch to fit all size heads. My head is fairly big and I found myself forgetting that these headphones were even on.
The sound... The highs and mids are crisp and clear, without being harsh at all. The music surrounds you and I found sounds and instruments in songs I never knew were there. Songs actually became more beautiful through these headphones. Far better than the horrid muddy sounding beats I previously owned. However, out of the box, these headphones have ZERO bass, in some songs it's nearly non-existent. With a a few (50) hours of burn in the bass comes out of it's shell (somewhat) and the sound becomes fuller and more satisfying.
For anyone working in a studio, these headphones are a must, the sound reproduction from a quality source is excellent. Every aspect of the music is alive and prevalent, (aside from the bass) and the soundstage is decent for this level of headphones. An amp may be required, but my iphone drove these fairly well.

I would recommend these to those who work in a studio, or are not bassheads and are patient enough to burn in these headphones before forming an opinion on them. Very few headphones sound great out of the box."
347,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Previously, I used and completely wore out a pair of Bose Headphones that were in the $110 range. The sound quality of those were very good, but the quality and workmanship were no match to these set of Shure Headphones. On the Bose, the cord is cheaply made and after some time, broke near the base of the headphone. It is permanently attached and once it broke at the thick plastic point of the unit, there was no fixing it. Basically, the entire unit was trash! Due to that issue and the poor workmanship, I will never buy another set of Bose Headphones.

Now for the Shure SRH440. Once I received the piece of equipment, I took it out of the box and was totally surprised at not only how well it was made, but I noticed there was not a cord attached (totally forgot about that in the description). I simply loved the fact the cord could be attached and removed at any time. Not only that, but there was an optional straight cord (I eventually purchased) that could be utilized. Again, the quality, compared to the Bose is unbelievable! The quality is much nicer; however, they are a bit more bulky which I truly do not mind.

Next was the true test,,,,, Sound! For the price coupled with everything I've already mentioned, the sound was Phenomenal... I seriously have not listened to so much music in my life. The base, highs and lows, etc... sound wonderful. Get these headphones, I promise, for the price, you will not be disappointed!!!"
348,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first pair of high-quality over-ear headphones; I purchased them back in 2011, and they are still going strong. Like some other people, I bought the replacement SRH840 ear cushions to make them more comfortable, but the stock ear cushions aren't bad. One complaint that I have with these headphones is that wearing them for an extended period of time begins to hurt the top of my head, but that is probably just a problem with my own head. My skull comes to a weird point at the top, which is probably a result of banging my head too much as a kid (I got stitches up there even). You can probably assume that this won't be an issue for you people with normal heads.

The materials have held up well against being thrown around in a backpack every so often, but the cable that it comes with and its available replacements are pretty lack-luster. I am glad that the cable is replaceable since cables will always go bad, but these cables seem calculated to go bad and are impossible to repair. The wires inside are really thin. With such a thick cable housing, I would have expected better. I have attempted a few times when the cable starts to fail to open up the housing and solder the wires together to give it new life rather than spend $15-$20 for a new cable, but the wires are lined with some kind of nylon string that burns and prevents the solder from sticking, forcing you to only have the option of replacing the cable.

As for sound quality, I am still very much in love with the sound I get from these headphones. The longer I have them, the more I can pick up new details in the music I listen to. I can clearly pick up the singer's breathing, background instruments that were only used as fillers for color, and other nuances that make songs into a true music experience. There is plenty of room for the full frequency spectrum, but these will not rock your skull with booming bass. I would say that these headphones were designed for an accurate representation of the audio it is provided, which is why when you look at the frequency response charts that have been produced it has a fairly flat response across the audible range.

Listening to acoustic tracks is an amazing experience. The headphones faithfully reproduce the warmth of the tones of classical instruments, and if your recording is good enough to have captured the sounds the instrumentalist makes, you will hear all of those. Electronic music if fun to listen to, providing enough thump and hum for the lows while keeping the mids and trebles nice and clear. Vocals are nice and clean, and percussion is pleasantly tangible. Overall, these headphones are a great buy for someone looking for their first steps into real audio quality."
349,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price and quality of these, it is hard to go wrong. If you are using them for more than a few hours in a row without any breaks you might want to consider something a little bit more comfortable. The audio quality is great, although after a few years of use I found the covering/wrap on the headband part started coming off on mine. I just bought another as a replacement as it was still a great offering given the price tag."
350,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried going back and forth between these SHURE440's and my roommate's $100+ BOSE IE2, my sister and my dad's $300 BOSE QC 15, and my brother-in-law's top of the line BEATS BY DRE headphones that he uses for his DJ business. Here's how they compare (SHURE440 were my top pick)

BOSE IE2 were honestly slightly richer in mid tones, but less clear overall than SHURE440. SHURE440 sounds better, but are way way less portable, which can be annoying when I'm on the go. I like how these BOSE IE2s are not airtight--sounds open and certainly more comfortable, but still goes into your ear far enough to block out noise. Also, these BOSE have a microphone, in case youre using them for your phone.

BOSE QC 15 are wonderfully magical at muting the world around you and being a comfortable joy to have around my head. But because of the Noise Canceling, the sound quality is clouded. Sounds good/great, but still clouded. And these BOSE require a battery or two. SHURE440s don't. Again, SHURE440 sounds more clear and balanced, with a more open feel to the music. SHURE440's are significantly less comfortable, however, and do feel uncomfortable after a couple hours. But I care about sound, not comfort.

The BEATS BY DRE Studio $350 headphones sound great, too. But the sound is slightlyyy clouded by the emphasis on adding bass. SHURE440's sound VERY neutral and clear, and this was distinguishable, albeit by a minor margin. BEATS were more comfortable and of course are more fashionable, but I buy headphones--nicer ones especially--for the sound quality, not fashion.

-Don't get SHURE440's if you are on the go a lot. Get ear buds. They're easier to protect and pack quickly.
-SHURE440's high quality, detachable coiled cord is perfectly done, in my opinion. It is thick, and a more vulnerable part of headphones. It's great that it's replaceable, if such a high quality cord would break.
-The earpads are also replaceable, although after a couple years mine show zero signs of wear n tear.
-I used SHURE440's for playing Xbox and it's like cheating--I'd be playing people online in Call of Duty, and hear footsteps in the game around or behind me. I would stop, aim where they'd come from, then get the kill as soon as the person runs around the corner 15 feet away where the noise came from. Simply amazing.
-ON-THE-EAR headphones give better sound, but AROUND-THE-EAR headphones are needed by some to block out noise and to keep noise in. !!! ALSO, some people really hurt their hearing in the long run by using headphones that do not block out environment noise, so they compensate by turning the volume way higher. This is not healthy!!!

I'm really picky about my music. For me, there's nothing better than feeling like you are surrounded and immersed in clear music. SHURE440's gives VERY accurate sound, and won't exaggerate the bass, or hurt your ears with sharp high pitches. I like that. Other people might not, but I want to hear the details as the artist intended. Other headphones like the BOSE IE2 may bombard you with more full sounds, but the SHURE's are more precise and neutral. It depends on what you like. After HOURS and HOURS of comparing and reading reviews, and even since purchasing the SHURE's I continue to test the market. But I've found the SHURE440's to be the best around-the-ear, sub $100, durable and true sounding headphones."
351,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a music producer and bought these headphones by recommendation from another producer. They sound great and have helped me step up my game. However I'll warn that mine ended up breaking. The headband snapped on the plastic extension when I was taking them off with one hand, not being rough or anything. Kind of disappointing. I was able to fix them with super glue but now they don't fit correctly anymore. Still usable but I feel like I can't wear them out in public anymore. I was surprised at how easily it snapped. Caution. Otherwise they've treated me well."
352,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones produce amazingly clear sound. I'm hearing details in almost all of my songs that I'd never heard before, and I love that. The problem is that I can only enjoy the sound if I'm perfectly still, and ideally lying down. The perfectly-still part is because these things creak *terribly* every time I move my head even the tiniest amount. I'm not talking about full head turns, just the small adjustments as I look from one side of my computer screen to the other at work, or glance up as someone passes my cube. It's maddening. The lying-down part is because they do dig in right at the top of my head after an hour or so. I don't think I'm at all unusual in terms of head size/shape or amount of hair; it's just that the phones are too heavy to stay in place with lateral pressure (they'd crush your ears) so they have to rest slightly on top instead. Between these two factors, I love these headphones most of the time but absolutely loathe them sometimes too. The most frustrating part is how little it would take for Shure to fix both of these problems. A dollar's worth more metal in the hinges and padding on the top and these would be almost perfect. How could they come so close and miss?"
353,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound quality for the price. Mids are a tad lacking, but highs and lows are incredible. The bass isn't overkill like beats but its there and it definately is quite strong and you feel the rumble. Its painful to wear these headphones because the cups are shallow and your ears will press against the hard plastic unless you have very small ears that don't extend much from your head. There's really no cushion for the headband either. Buy the Shure 840 cushions for these for $15-20. They fit perfectly and my ears feel perfectly fine now. Comfort went from 1/5 stars to 4/5 stars. There's still no cushion for the headband so it still feels awkard on the top of my head."
354,2.0 out of 5 stars,Tried it and sent it back.
355,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I appreciate good quality audio. I would never call myself an audiophile, but I appreciate good audio quality regardless. These are good. The lows are extremely *clear* and realistic; cheap bassy headphones might appeal more to a certain crowd, and they will give you more oomph, but in return you get muddyness down there (well, and in most frequencies really) and often a high frequency cutoff, whereas these go deep and aren't muddy anywhere. I'm really satisfied with the way these are set up.

They're also very comfortable. The pads are leather-covered and nice, though as with other leather-bound closed headphones your ears will get hot. You can make the set even more comfortable by buying replacement pads intended for the SRH-840, which fit the 440 just fine.

The headphones are solid. They're big and beefy, but they fold up nicely for travel. The included cable is thick enough, and it's also detachable so it can be replaced if it wears out for any reason. I'm a little concerned by the exposed wires on the outside of it, but I've had this set for more than three years and haven't had any problems yet."
356,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones with great price, and even better sound. They will be very uncomfortable for some people, yet for some, they will be very comfortable. It all depends on your head and ear shape. If you have these headphones, upgrade to 880 pads and you'll get even better sound and greater comfort . ( A friend of mine did this to his 440s,and I borrowed them for comparison, so I know what I am talking about ) .
All in all, these are some really good headphones, and you should definitely check them out.

357,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, i have a high standard when it comes to sound, and i was looking for a pair of studio headphones to use for mixing.

I love Shure, they are an american brand with high quality and when we americans buy something from them we know we get something for our money. And so with this headphones, the sound is definitly on the same level as headphones from other brands that costs $300 and more. For me it's very important to have a detailed and flat sound. A lot of other headphones are often overbassed. So even if the track is turned down to maybe a quarter of the rest of the song, the bass is still stronger than everything else. Not with this ones.
The bass just sits in the mix. when i eq it up it gets stronger and the other way around.

As well as nice highs, some headphones get ""scratchy"" highs, like some sennheisers, this ones are just great in displaying the full sound range.

Mids are as the rest just great, no mudding.

Shure delivers them with a detachable coiled cord and a carrying bag as well as an 1/4"" adapter.

One last thing, i use them with a headphone amp, just because it makes everything a little stronger and more clean. Though they also work fine with an ipod.

So to close this review, definitly BUY. You can't do anything wrong with these."
358,3.0 out of 5 stars," My overall thoughts on the headphones... Bass-Not as strong as I would like but has good thump, Highs-Good Highs!, Mids- Good Too! I give my full thoughts in the review video. The biggest thing I have to stress is that when I used them the headphones were heavy and the headband put constant pressure on my top head, this gave me headaches from time to time after long hours like say 3 hours... Also the earcups although they are over the ear, there was not enough space between your ear and the plastic housing. My ears would be pushed against the speaker which again after long hours it would hurt. Those were my two biggest gripes, aside from that the headphones are sturdy built and hold up its bargain for its price for sound. Disclaimer... Headaches from long hour USE"
359,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this headphone for a bit more than a year now, the best thing I've done is replace the hard stock ear pads with a set of 840 pads. They're a perfect fit and very comfy.
Overall sound quality is as good as it gets for the sub $100 price. For those wanting more bass, eq it.
Just bought a set of 940's, but my 60 year old ears can not discern any difference in sound quality.
I use to be a very critical listener, but not sure I was ever able to hear much of a difference in the 5-10Hz range or the 22-30k range.

Dollar for dollar the 440 w/840 pads is the way to go."
360,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a bit of an audiophile who, after using Shure products for many years, decided to give these headphones a go to use for primarily listening to music around the house. Having used many higher end non-noise canceling over the ear phones, I must say that these are by far the best value for the price range. They sound great with just a flat EQ, and you can pretty much do anything you want with them with a little EQ tweaking in whatever program/mp3 player you use. The fit is comfortable, enough pressure to keep a nice seal over your ears, but not so tight as to make long listens uncomfortable. The only reason i give 4's for build quality and durability is because I had to send my first pair back to Shure because top cushion that connects to the frame became disconnected and eventually just fell apart. As per the usual, Shure owned that defect and kindly replaced them for no fee. My current pair is holding up fine; I'm assuming the first pair was a victim of quality control.. they are Shure's first attempt at over the earphones after all. Also, the headphone cord is detachable and easily replaceable, a feature that you usually only find on headphones of a much higher price. All in all, you really can't go wrong with these at this price. Thanks Shure!"
361,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are, at best, of average quality. I've owned mine for a couple of years now, mainly for tracking in a recording environment. They are touted as 'studio monitor', but that is just misleading. They are extremely coloured, and will flatter any sound you put through them. For that reason, they are only worthy of being called 'Hi-Fi' headphones, and should certainly never be used for mixing, where accuracy is an essential prerequisite.

The fragile cables leading to the cups are badly exposed, and one of mine has just broken due to being pinched by the hinge, so I'm going to have to perform a delicate repair job. The faux-leather ear-pads eventually crack up and look badly worn, even after only a bit of use. These headphones are very plasticky, causing a creaking when moving the head or jaw.

I expected much more for headphones of this price, but was deceived by misleading reviews. I've finally had enough, so will be replacing them with something better very soon soon, and they will not be made by Shure."
362,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had these headphones for many years, and they served me well. For the price, the sound quality is excellent. The reason to not leave a 5 star review is the construction. The piece that finally failed for me was the plastic just above the hinge. I was expecting the outer wire that connects the headphones to be the piece that broke first. They lasted 7 years of use, so overall, pretty durable, but they are a bit more delicate than I would have preferred."
363,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Audio is clean in mid to high range however you will find it lacks in the low end range when it comes to lower quality audio. At higher bitrates the bass is accurate and clean but lacks the tight impacts you would expect when listening to some songs. The Shure SRH440 are however a well rounded design that performs.

Update: Using a Soundblaster recon3D PCIE makes these headphones shine and completely invalidates my previous argument. Make sure you are using it with the right equipment and they are worth every cent."
364,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair from a local store last night and they will be returned today (I learned a valuable lesson last night:do not buy a new set of headphones without taking your old ones for reference!) I have to say ""ditto"" to the reviewer with the Sony MDR V6: I did a back to back and the Sony has such clearer highs, it's not funny. On the Shure, cymbals and other high frequencies sound ""muddy"" or ""muted"" to my ears. The Shure is much louder and has much more bass than the Sony MDR, but they really sacrificed the highs. Not as troubling but still noticeable is the Shure wear very tight on your head and the pads are uncomfortable. The Sony fit and sound better, their only drawback being the vinyl pads start to flake after a while."
365,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The SRH440 was my first venture into professional studio monitors. I have heard the sound quality on the Sennheiser HD555 , HD280 Pro, Beats Solo and Grado Labs' SR60i. The Beats have the best bass of the ones I heard but were atrocious for the mids and highs. The Grado's and Sennheisers are a little bit better than the SRH-440s accross the board but they are open design, which usually have a slightly better sound stage and reproduction of sound. The HD280 wasn't nearly as good in my opinion, but some people claim that the 280 Pro have better mids and highs.

Now with all that said you guys might wonder why I gave this pair a 5 star rating. Well simply put, this is the best closed, circumaural pair you can buy under $100. The sound quality is absolutely stunning. Make sure to burn them in for at least 100 hours and you will see a sharp rise in sound quality. I needed a pair that was good for indoor and outdoor use. It had to be closed, minimal leakage of sound, with a decent length detachable cable, no 10 foot cable like that of the 555. This pair does the job for me and its affordable enough that they are a great first step into the world of audiophiles. Again, its a great pair for casual listeners who want EXCELLENT build quality (these are heavy and very well built). I would highly recommend this product to broke audiophile wannabes (like me!) or casual listeners who want a solid pair of headphones with very good sound quality."
366,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've use these in a professional Recording studio for about a year now, perfect for any genre what so ever. (I use them for Rock mostly.) I have gotten compliments from everyone that has tried mine.

Pros:
-LOUD
-Subwoofer is amazing.
-Crisp and clear like you wouldn't believe. Balanced perfectly and again. Bass is awesome for those certain pop songs...
-Makes Led Zeppelin seem like there performing in front of you :)
-Amazing. Simply amazing.
-Comfortable -- to a point.
-Noise-cancellation.

Cons:
-Wire is exposed on both ear, I haven't ripped it out accidentally yet but I take huge care of my headphones. (I can see someone doing it though.)
-The wire you can connect and disconnect going into the headphones after a while from people pulling on it (which I freak at) has stripped the plastic. But if you take good care and you are the only person using them you will not have this problem.
-Over about 3 hours of wear them, your ears begin to sweat because they sit tight to my head and get uncomfortable for me anytime past that... But usually I don't wear them that long anymore.

Overall 5 stars."
367,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A decent headset for audio monitoring, and recording. They could be a tad fuller & richer though. So they are not the best for mixing as they don't match the sound of most speakers on playback. The ear pieces will sometimes flip around on you when handling, and can be a little cumbersome to get back around. You'll see 99 bucks on these at places like Guitar Center. Normally you can get a price match for the Amazon price of $73.50."

I was looking for a set of good cans to go with my turntable, and collection of lps. For those days when I want to go loud... but the wife prefers to sleep.
I tried a couple other cheaper ones (samson ch700, and audio technica athm20), and I didn't like them. They sounded too ""electronical"" ( I don't know if that means anything to you), especially the voices. Decided to go a little up on the price, did some research, and these were recommended.
I just opened them, and the first record I listened was mike olfield's ""tubular bells"". It sounds wonderful. The music sounds alive. They have a very good bass response but it's not overwhelming the rest of the music, which I like. The level of detail, separation, depth, and width are just right for me. I also use a shure cartridge ( the popular m97xe), and they work very well together.
Ok, I haven't tried really expensive equipment, but if you're an ""amateur"" audiophile, like me, and are looking for some headphones to do the analog trick, while you're enjoying that comfortable chair, next to the turntable. I recommend these."
369,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all, I want to say that I did some research before I bought these. I at first wanted AudioTechnica ATH-AD700s because of their soundstage, as I listen to a lot of atmospheric/ambient music and want to feel immersed in detailed sound. But after hearing so many people complain about their bass I finally caved, because if they're really tweaked to the point of having a less-than-natural amount of bass (according to a couple reviews I read) then I want nothing to do with them. I also have a tiny head. So I decided instead to visit my local dedicated audio store, Long & McQuaid. Their selection was weak, only a few to pick from. Among the ones that stood out were the HD 280s, the Beyer DT990 & 770, the ATH-M50, some HDJ Pioneer headphones and a separate section for Shure headphones and a bad pair of open-air headphones.

I mostly enjoyed the HD280s, but they sounded too warm, and it just didn't feel like a very impactful listen. The sounds didnt seem like they were coming from all around me, they just kind of happened in the left and right ear if you know what I mean. I still thought those were the best against the Beyers (bear in mind though the Beyers I tried had an impedance of 300 ohms or something crazy like that, so I obviously wasn't driving them properly, but I didnt want to go all out and get an amp yet so I decided against them. I bet they're sick though) I also decided against a pair of KRK KS8400s which didn't really blow me away, they made my music sound different to be honest.

Regardless, I was set on these HD280 s but then noticed the Shure line, on the shelf to the side... I saw the price tag on what were called ""Professional Studio or Recording Headphones"" or something like that, and they were only 99$!! Now I'm in Canada so that may be backwards for you Americans, but I was happy to see a pair of Shures looking that good for that cheap. So I tried them against the 280s. They blew the 280s out of the water.

I had heard good things about Shure headphones but for some reason this brand always seemed low end at first glance and turned me off and I never thought to try anything of theirs.. On the first listen, it's actually funny because I didn't realize it but I had my iphone's eq set to treble booster for my old Sony MDR-XB300, but the sound was still blowing my mind. I could pinpoint to you exactly where the instruments were coming from, i felt surrounded by the music. After I re-compared to the HD280s I was sure this was the best deal I was gonna get.

The sound is so absolutely clear. I was walking home and had to take my headphones off several times because birds were chirping in a song I had just bought but I could have SWORN they were real. The range on these is amazing. I can hear the highest possible frequencies and they feel so real that they sometimes feel like they're touching you or inside you or something... And the mids.. I was listening to female vocals, and it sounded like I was the one doing the vibrato, you can almost feel the vocals. It's crazy how real these headphones make music. It comes alive. You're fully immersed in every song. And you don't have to worry about coloration or EQ, these cans reproduce sound beautifully, There's no emphasis on the bass and this is an absolute blessing. The bass is deep, detailed, certainly not modest or lacking in any way shape or form because after trying out a few pairs I've learned that bass is something that is kind of important to me and these give me exactly what I want, detailed bass reproduction without it stealing the show. These continue to blow my mind during break-in, the bass is getting both deeper and fuller. A genre that really makes these headphones shine is classical. I feel like I'm watching the whole thing from the conductor's perspective. I could almost see the person playing the instrument. I love it when sound becomes almost hallucinogenic, I crave this in sound and I love that these headphones make listening to music such an experience. This is not an exaggeration either as you can tell from the other reviews. This may be expected from a professional studio pair, but for listening of all types, ambient, rock, pop, dance, dubstep, especially classical, these are your best bet for under $100. In fact they're a steal at this price. No bs phone.

With regards to comfort, my only complaint is that after 6 hours of listening, my ears started to hurt. I had to take them off for a few minutes and then put them back on a different way to ease the pain. But other than that I barely notice them. They're big but subtle. They're also very durable and their sound and look have a similar quality: they don't mess around. The pads are super comfortable and block out sound just enough to be immersed in the song, but still slightly connected to reality. The headband is very comfy and listening to these for long hours is not a pain but a pleasure, like I said only after about six hours of listening did I start to experience some discomfort.

The 440s are extremely portable. They work amazingly on my iPhone, their impedance is 40 ohms so I bet they sound great through an amp too. They fold up like the beats do and include a bag which I thought was a nice touch for $100. It's already sick that they fold for $100 without being poor sound quality if you think about it haha.

I've used some, albeit mainstream, pretty good headphones, Monster Turbine Pro 24K gold edition, heartbeats, Bose in-ears, monster mobile jamz, and I have to say by far these have impressed me the most overall, whether in sound quality, value, durability, comfort, etc. Even in portability because these fold you're really not missing much.

This is an incredibly solid purchase. Fantastic soundstage, fantastic positioning, fantastic reproduction, no coloration, lifelike sound, extreme comfort, crazy durability (to prevent shorts, theres a plug-in under the left earpiece for the rest of the cord which is awesome! The cord is kind of retro because it stretches like the old home telephone cords, but again, this just gives you that ""this cord doesn't mess around either"" feeling which is how I feel about these headphones.

They're amazing, and definitely worth more than the asking price!"
370,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The SHURE SRH 440 are the most uncomfortable pair of headphones I have ever worn. I though that since SHURE is a great brand for microphones their headphones would be good. I was very wrong.

Because of their light weight (supposed bonus), the pads on the headphones slide down causing the top ridge to dig into my head. I can't wear these for more than 15 minutes because the top of my head starts hurting. The phones themselves are protected by hard plastic, which starts hurting my ears 15 minutes into the session. After 2 weeks, I am frustrated and am looking to sell them because I will not be using them again."
371,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've own a pair of these headphones for about 2 years now and they are still performing perfectly. In fact, i think they have gotten better with use. They have a very clear sound, great highs and mids, while the bass certainly isn't for those who like it in excess. My only complaint is that they aren't the most comfortable headphone I've ever worn. I have ears that are a little on the larger size, and sometimes it feels like my ears are touching the inside of the headphone and it hurts after a while. When compared to my bose, there is no comparison, unfortunately those are now broken. But, the over-all quality of these headphones has a hard time being bested for the price."
372,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great flat sounding headphones for mixing. BAD building material as far as the plastic extender bars on the sides. THEY WILL BREAK REPEATEDLY!! And I'm not one to (ruff-house) my headphones, but the plastic side will break regardless..."

374,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased the SRH 440's after my Sennie 280's broke down due to cracks in the headband (I have a large head), and I suggest you need search no more for decent headphones at an excellent value; first, let me say the SRH 440's are a much better fit if one has a larger head or dislikes the tight fit of Sennheisers.
I did not burn the 440's in, but rather started listening to them right out of the box. I listen to a variety of music from classic rock, metal, progressive (basically most music except trance and rap). The SRH 440's provide a equalized or balanced sound in my opinion as far as levels for highs, mids, and lows whether I listen to Pink Floyd, Metallica, or Tool. Again, I am not a big dependent of thumping bass, but the SRH 440's do provide a decent enough thump. For the 200 dollar and below range, the SRH 440's are a great set of cans and excellent value."
375,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This just arrived last week and didn't need to burn it much..Excellent sound stage..bass is slowly improving. this is definitely a good balanced headset. bass is not a great feature, but it is crisp.

376,5.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe it's just me but these sound identical to the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x I honestly couldn't tell the difference and these are much cheaper. If I would of known I would of got the Shure's. Have personally used both. Great esp for DJ's!
377,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones since 2009 and I love them, however I've never worn these with the stock SRH440 earpads. They are really hard and have very minimal cushion.

382,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not going to review the sound quality here. There's much more serious problem with these headphones - you cannot wear them more for than four hours. Top of your head will start hurting a lot. Also, after about 6 hours you will feel your ears beginning to numb.

I would've definitely bought some other model, had I known this in advance."
383,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The phones are as good as any other at this price. The problem is with the materials and design: when the foam pads come off, they are extremely difficult to put back on. Also, they don't travel well. I stuck mine in the bag (included) and carried them in carry-on luggage. The metal band came loose from one of the phones and doesn't seem to go back together properly.

The negative reviews about comfort do have some truth, but this is not a huge deal. For me they fit great and don't press in on my ears.

Haven't a had a single problem yet!

386,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to my Sennheiser HD280 cans, these don't sound as good to me. Maybe it's just because I've used the HD280s as my primary set for 5 years now. Other than that, they are super-comfortable (to be fair, I upgraded to the memory-foam ear pads that go with the SRH840s) and the design is awesome. For YEARS I have been annoyed that headphones were the only pro audio gear around that didn't have detachable cables and VOILA! Shure impresses me again. Nice job. I've had these only a few hours, but have been jamming on them all afternoon :)"
387,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for about 2 years now, and decided to write a review after the SECOND of the earpieces broke apart from the housing. The joint holding the left earpiece literally crumbled one day, about a year into use. All I did was pick up the phones off of my desk. The joint literally split apart into crumb-sized pieces. Frustrated over repeatedly having the buy headphones and not having them last, I just decided to hang onto them, seeing as how I do alot of one-ear work while voicing at the microphone. Well, just today, about a year after the first shattering, the right earpiece suffered the same fate. Is it summer humidity? I've no idea. But something is seriously wrong with the long-term durability of the headphones, and I have no intention of buying another Shure. The sound of the phones was very good, however, better than the Sony's I had previously. While they lasted at least."
388,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for a surprise birthday present (I didn't even know what Shure's were until now) and right out of the box there amazing...

You play Zeppelin, Jimmy's guitar sings like its never been heard before... You play anything, your guaranteed to love them!"
389,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this item a week or so ago. The sound is fine, as is the build quality - but:

1. The headphone is a very, very tight fit (I have a normal size head). My ears sting after a half-hour or so of use.

2. The thin wires on the headphone itself (not the cable leading to the input device) are looped and jut out, just waiting to be ripped apart by an unintended snag on your finger or something else. I had to wrap the headphone on each side with plastic and wind tape around the plastic in order to conceal and thus protect the wiring. It looks terrible and requires an explanation every time someone sees the headphone.

400,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Update Nov 2012--- recently got another replacement headphone (#5 I think, I've lost track).

Little piece of hard black plastic were on the floor. DO NOT BUY THESE!!! They are all defective. These are as bad as the ECCO Shoes debacle! Shame on these companies for not owning up to defective merchandise.

The sound of these is excellent, the blocking of outside sounds in also excellent, but these have a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW. I now see why they come with a long warranty as I have now had 3 pairs and each pair breaks at the pivoting hinge on ear piece. Yes they replace them, but each time I have to waste my time filling out the return form, boxing them up and paying some $8 - $10 to ship back. I am now boxing up my 3rd pair. When is this going to end? It is not like we have big heads nor are we rough with them. Always used in same location, we place them in a shoe box rather than draper over any thing to avoided the heavy ear piece from popping off again. They should have used a non-cracking plastic with fibers in it to prevent this repeated malfunction. I would suggest getting the Sennheiser version of these online for about same price."

The sound isolation is poor because they don't seem to grip my head very well.

405,2.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BUY THE SHURE 440's you can do better.

THE EAR PADS ARE UNCOMFORTABLE, this really gripes me Shure has perfectly suitable pads on their 840's that will fit perfectly on these, WHY DON""T THEY PUT THEM ON Everyone complains about the pads on the 440's. My point they have the right pads in inventory and you have to spend $20 to get them, STUPID.

How do they sound,GOOD, they sound GOOD thats it, they bottle you up kind of like putting your head under water but they do isolate you. The sound stage suffers a little it is right or left not much depth, the head band is lousy it flops around on your head if your not sitting still and the worst - there are these unsightly, poor designed little wires sticking out right above the cups that loop and will catch on everything, they have been placed perfectly to ruin your day.

Are they worth $100 plus $20 for new pads, ABSOLUTELY NOT, DON'T BUY THESE.

Here is my recommendation. Either outright buy the Sennheiser MD 595's for $259 OR here's the real deal- Sennheiser sells so many 595's they must have a bunch of refurbished, or what they call B stock phones. Amazon usually has these just look below the new price on the page for refurbished, if you can't find them there do a search on 595's refurbished. I have purchased 4 sets of these so called refurbished phones for about $120 each over the years. Every set has arrived in the original box, appeared unopened/unused and had the new headphone sharp sound that goes away starting the first 15 minutes of use to 20 hours when it's about completely gone. They have been just like the ""new"" ones. I think in most cases they are the new ones, if by chance you get bad ones send em back and try again that's easy.

406,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have excellent sound quality. There is no doubt. I've owned them for about a year and they have not ceased to amaze me. HOWEVER, there is something you need to know. This is the reason I write the review: These cans are extremely uncomfortable. The padding is quite thin in comparison to most over ear headphones. As a result, my ears make contact with the plastic that is in place to protect the speakers. If I wear these phones for more than 10 minutes I experience literal pain. I say this because I care about you. I really want to warn you. So please, before purchasing these find a way to try them out for a while.

Before you make up your mind please take a look at the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. I recently purchased these headphones. They are better in every aspect. They block 32 dB of noise. Very comfortable and snug. Sound wonderful. Read the reviews.

The reason I give this product five stars is because I find that people tend not to read one star reviews about products the want to buy ha. Anyways, please take it into consideration. Thank you!"
407,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is an excellent example of why we should wait before writing a review. During my first year of ownership, I would have rated this headphone as four or five stars. The audio is very good. They appear to be a bargain. Wonderful fit and comfort. Excellent all around. Better sound starts at double the cost.

The only indicator of the problems to come was the discreet ""made in China"" label. After one year, the left side above the earpiece shattered. Under warranty, it was quickly replaced by Shure. After 11 months of use, the replacement shattered in exactly the same way. Before anyone accuses me of pulling the headphones out too far when taking them off, I should note that I have used a pair of Sony V6 headphones in the same way far more heavily each day for over 20 years with no similar failures. In fact, I have had no similar failure on any of the other headphones that I have used.

I predict that the warranty replacement headphones will also last about a year, but the warranty will have expired by the time they break again. The good part about the next failure being predictable is that I have a year to research the replacement for the Shure 440s.

UPDATE: Marked down from two stars to one star. In my original review, I predicted another failure, the left side shattering, within one year. In this, the Shure fully met expectations. They successfully achieved failure after only nine months. I have never had this problem with over a dozen other headphones that I have used long-term. The product is now out of warranty and headed to the trash."

410,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm happy to announce that Shure now offers a straight cord for their SRH440 headphones. The part number is HPASCA1.
411,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
Flat audio output, so no artificial boosting of bass or treble ensures that I know what I'm hearing is accurate. Threaded 1/4"" adapter, comfortable for long periods. The soft case is well built and has a nice feel, but I feel like I might have preferred a hard case. Sturdy, coiled, locking detachable cable means no accidentally yanking the cable out while moving around.

Cons:
Not a fan of the 2.5mm proprietary jack to hook the cable up to the headphones. This means I can only use the cable that came with, and should something happen to that I'm up a very lonely creek.
I have to disconnect the cable to fold them up all the way. This could have been remedied by a little extra design work on the folding bits, but I guess this way means some extra protection from damage to the jack while transporting.
I do worry a bit about the longevity of the wires. Instead of being routed through the headband all the way, they stick out at the points where the headband is adjustable, and they could get snagged on something.

Other thoughts:
There's no active noise cancellation, but they create a nice enough seal around the ears that it doesn't become necessary. Passive cancellation also means I won't hear any inaccurate sound pickup while recording. I've had active sets that actually scrub out the signal coming through the wire because it's the same waveform as the outside noise. That is not a good attribute when trying to find the best mic placement.

The only time I've had bad audio from these is plugging into my laptop. But I'd excuse even that, since laptops have notoriously noisy signal from the headphone jacks. When I'm at home, I run an HDMI out to my TV anyway and have that decode the audio. Gives me a cleaner signal and I can edit my audio way better.

Bottom line:
It's the best deal I've seen for professional studio-quality headphones. This is a set for those looking for accurate audio representation, not music fans looking for orgasmic bass response. Given that, though, I still hear nuances in my music that I hadn't been hearing before."

413,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It has been a long time since I have purchased full-sized, closed headphones. After reading a couple of web-based reviews, I chose these SRH440s with the final factor being the awesome deal that Amazon was running at the time with the Sarjo Wholesale Group. These are very comfortable, all round, circumaural headphones. Bass is controlled, but sufficient. Mids are slightly recessed, but lively and highs are clear and vibrant. Overall, it's a nicely balanced and very fun sound presentation in a typical, closed-headphone kind of way. While I listen to all types of music, the only genre I can't really recommend for the phones is classical. Classical music needs a more spacious presentation than these closed cans provide. They are great with rock, electronic, jazz and country, though!"
414,3.0 out of 5 stars,"While the sound is beautiful on these headphones, I find that they ""creak"" a lot when my head moves. I can't find a position where this does not happen. I wish I could cure this problem, because the sound is really great - very clear, excellent highs and bass is good without boost."
415,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for about 3 months, and I can say wow. These have amazing fidelity, I believe that these are pretty good for headphones under $100, even though I bought mine for more than that. My only complaints are:
- Comfort is an issue
- Not much representation of bass
Pros:
- Good for mastering acoustic inputs
- Flat response
- Amazing hi's and mid's
- Detachable headphone cord

Although I know that these are not able to replace large studio monitors, I thought they would at least come very close, and they do. But since these don't have that much bass, it is hard to accurately raise or lower the volume. These cans are also not the most comfortable studio headphones you can find, pressure irritated the top of my head as well as the outer part of my ears. Build quality is solid, and the fact that the headphone cable (input) can detach from the headphone.
As a home recording studio guy, these headphones have almost no sound leakage whatsoever, and they don't move around too much if one moves their head. These are great for making music, recording vocals, even listening to music from your ipod, although I did mention that these are not the most comfortable headphones. Believe the telemarketing crap for these headphones, they have AMAZING high frequencies. These are probably best for mastering vocals and acoustic instruments, perhaps not for techno stuff, since lows are not that loud. These are very flat headphones, great if space or neighbors are issues. If not, then invest in some studio monitors instead, either way, your not throwing your money away."
416,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great turn around time from the time of purchase. Product was exactly as described. My husband is a drummer and these are perfect for him to be able to drum and still hear the music he's playing along with. I love that it comes with a case because they won't get damaged.
417,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is excellent and the headphones fit comfortably--at first. There is enough weight on the headphones to make one's scalp hurt uncomfortably if one wears them for more than an hour or two. They would probably be excellent for short-term use, but I wanted headphones to use for many hours at a time. One can shift the position of the headband and adjust the height of the headband but then the new position starts to be uncomfortable. I ended up giving these headphones away."
418,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality. If you're looking for phones with extraordinary bass then you probably won't be satisfied. The bass in songs is there as it should be, but there's no enhancement like you'll see in more popular commercial brands.

Like others have mentioned, I too had cracked/broken hinges within 3 months of purchase. I mailed them in and was given a new pair - great customer service."
419,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great headset to pick up when it's on sale for those of you who like to mix/produce/or as an input for a guitar. The sound is the epitomy of ""neutral"". No boomy bass or incredible highs, it's across the board flat which is great if you are designing your newest tune. However, I have a medium size head and after 1-2 hours of wear it hurts and is quite uncomfortable around the ears and temples.

Haven't had any issues with the cord or input at all.

Would not recommend if you're looking for an everyday set of cans for your iPod on the go. Requires and amp/soundcard/good source to really get you're money's worth. Look to other models or brands for an on-the-go type."
420,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I depend on others reviews so I will try to provide some objective data here to help. I try hard to sort through the reviews that are obviously ""bandwagon"" fans or uninformed opinions that don't concur with the rest of the data so that is why I wanted to post my experience with these headphones.

I purchased these at a friends recommendation that Shure makes a very good product. Reviews seemed to concur so I went ahead. I let thee ""burn in"" overnight as suggested by other reviewers when I received them. I played these from my computer at work, my mp3 player and my home laptop all with the EQ set to flat to determine if any of my issues were source related. Audio was both ripped mp3 and streaming audio from Spotify. I am by no means an audiophile, I just enjoy music. I had three reasons for this purchase: 1) help me focus at work. I am an engineer in a noisy cube farm. 2) travel - work has me on airplanes a few times a year. 3) Replace my creaking Acoustic Research headphones.

Pros:
- comfortable
- blocks out more ambient noise than most. (not isolating or canceling) I was most impressed by this attribute.
- very crisp and clear sound
- removable cable locks in quickly
- cable goes to only one side

Cons:
- small wires that go around hinge for each earphone made me constantly nervous whenever I handled them
- bass is very week. no kick drum in rock songs and no real bass in rap songs.
- although comfortable and sound blocking, they slip forward or back relatively easy when your head moves
- They CREAK. This is my biggest complaint and actually the very reason I purchased them. My A/R noise canceling headphones creak and it drives me nuts. Movement, especially chewing, causes the plastic joints to creak and this is very noticeable.
- Bag / pouch is extremely generic

Other:
- Cord seems durable but is very heavy due to the spiral
- Construction seems more generic than I expected.

Summary:
Sound isolating quality creates a very nice listening environment and allows for lower listening volumes. Sound is very crisp and clear. A bit too much High (high frequencies - high hat, tinny sounds) and not enough lows (no low end reverb on bass guitar or kick drum in Rock). The lack of low frequencies and the creaking led me to return these in search of something more suited to my tastes. I won't bad mouth these but can't recommend them to everyone.

Hope this helps. Good luck!"
421,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought this for my son because my husband, who is a musician and music teacher, really enjoys his. He likes the bass he is able to hear in it and clear in sound. My son enjoyed them too for his gaming and listening to music. We bought it when he was 15. He is now 16. They did not last more then a year, because he is very hard on his headphones. My husband has had his for the last few years and they are in good shape. I wouldn't recommend them for someone who is hard on his things. However, if you treat your items well, these should last you a long time."
422,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I won't go into too much detail; better reviewers than me have done that throughly already. Here's my quick list of pros and cons:

Pros:

- Awesome sound. Really well balanced pair of cans.
- Unbeatable price.
- Decent isolation.
- Hardly any sound leakage.
- Detachable cord is a massive win. All headphones should have this feature, in my opinion.
- Coiled cable, doesn't tangle as easily and takes much less space than a regular cable.

Cons:

- Headband gets very uncomfortable after 1 or 2 hours. It has hardly any padding at all on top, so be sure to grow your hair long to add some more padding.
- It clamps to your head a bit too hard. After long sessions (6 hours or longer) I get a bit of a headache.

All in all, I think these are a great buy. I've had these for less than a month, so the jury is still out in the comfort area; as with anything you wear, a break in period is to be expected."
423,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sounded great and lasted just about 25 months before they broke. I have no idea why, but the hinge part of the headphone cracked where it goes into the upper headband. I'm pretty hard on headphones so maybe it was just time. I would buy again, but decided to try something different."
424,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones were purchased for use during filmmaking and video editing. The around the ear and closed back design makes them perfect for cutting out background noise so you can hear all the detail they deliver. Fantastic value for the price. Preferred over the similar Sony model.
425,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite what some say, these are quite comfortable and don't slip. They are closed and do not sound as good as open headphones...my Seenheiser HD600's sound much better but they cost 4 times as much and are harder to drive. I use the Shure's with my Ipad and they are great for that. For serious listening I use the Senn's hooked up to my headphone amp which is connected to my stereo system. But these Shure's are good for portable devices.....of course if you want the bloated bass of some of the more popular headphones you will be disappointed."
426,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them. Compared to my Beats.. This is the same quality for much cheaper price and hell a lot lighter than Beats on my head. After half an hour of wearing Beats, Inusually get headaches because its heavy, but with this Shure headphones, I can listen to music for hours, so comfortable to wear and the sound is just as amazing or even better than Beats."
427,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not happy with the bass on these headphones. If you listen to hip hop, electronic, or anything that pronounces bass, don't get these. Otherwise, the sound is great. I wear them at work when I am trying to concentrate, and they completely drown out office noises at a relatively low volume.

The 1/8th inch side of the cable came bent, and I had to spend money to ship it back for warranty replacement. Unfortunately the side that connects to the headphone is a small non-standard size, so you can't really find these cables anywhere else."
428,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Why 4/5 stars? The were blown after 9-ish months, now it crackles and bass doesn't sound nearly as good.

Being that they blew so fast its hard for me to recommend these headphones to someone, but they did sound Great while they lasted. If you listen to bass heavy music ( Hip hop/rap or Electronic ) I would recommend something else, as these have a mild bass hit, but the bass note sounded clean. you can always use and equalizer to bump it up but it is easy to overwhelm them."
429,5.0 out of 5 stars,"theses headphones are just great. ive had alot of headphones...i have the beats by dre studios and compared with these..pick these if you want your audio to sound clear! Now these don't have alot of base..these are not for people who want alot of base.. because i have noticed that the beats by dre have too much where you can barely hear the highs and lows. the shure srh 440s are good if you wont to use them for recording in the studio because the isolation on these headphones are far better then the beats by dre.. because i have noticed the beats by dre leaks the sound into your microphone then when you play it back you may hear some of the song in your vocals. Now the comfort on the headphones are pretty good they fit well on your head.. it also depends on what type of head you have as well.. but i would give the comfort on these headphones any where between a 8-9. i was expecting a little more from these headphones but overall they are goood quality headphones. for the most part they are sturdy they dont feel cheap just a all around good headphone. the only thing that may be a problem is the coil cord but you can always buy another cord if you dont like the coil cord but even though it can go pretty far for the length.

and again if your a person that wants to hear your music clear with not too much base then these maybe the headphones for you but if you want alot of base this may not be the headphones for you"
430,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones for use with mixing live audio, recorded audio and using them as a guitar monitor. I also wear them at work from time to time to listen to music. I also wanted something that didn't squeeze my head and give me a headache, and in-ear phones weren't an option since they always make my ears hurt as well.

As far as I can tell these Shure 440s are the best bang for your buck. They seem to be much higher quality than the comparably priced Sennheisers I was looking at. The only thing that worries me is the external wire to each ear piece. I have almost snagged it a few times putting them away. I love the little bag they come in, it's great.

I haven't had these all that long yet, and I know alot of people say to burn them in, but I think they sound pretty good over all. I could go for just a little more bass in my music, but overall the balance is very good.

These phones are comfortable for the most part, they don't squeeze your head too much, but that also requires you to wear them directly over your head. This usually pulls my hair after awhile and does cause some discomfort, but not nearly as bad as some others do. The earcups are very comfortable and while they look to be too small to cover my big ears, they do it quite nicely! The material on the earpiece itself is very soft and doesn't feel like cheap vinyl."
431,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm something of a headphone junkie and I've bought a lot of different headphones over the years. Denon AH-950 and AH-D1000, the venerable Sony V6, Audio Technica ATH-AD700, AKG K240, Grado SR-80... all of them have their positives, and they're all solid choices balancing sound quality, cost, and overall value. The Shure SRH-440s are better than all of them, and at a price that makes picking up a pair a no-brainer. They sound incredible - not just compared to similarly priced headphones, but to any headphone I've ever heard. They're tough - I've taken my pair around the world and back, and they're holding up remarkably well. They're reasonably comfortably too - they've got a bit of heft to them and they hold on to your head, but I prefer that. I did replace the earpads with the pads intended for the SRH-840, and that made a comfortable headset even better. I can't recommend the Shure SRH-440 headphones enough."
432,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own both Shure SRH440 and Sony MDR-V6. Other people's comments helped me so I hope mine help you decided between the two. For the money, I would go with Sony MDR-V6. You can't go wrong, for the price point it's worth the money. Nothing to complain about, great sound, comfortable, light weight. The coil attached to the left ear cup can be heavy at times but this is the issue with all the coil cable headphones. When folded, it is pretty small and easy to transport. If you think you are bass inclined, just go with V6.

Now for Shure440 - personally I like the sound of this headphone better. Caveat: I replaced mine with Shure880's earpads. I highly recommend getting the replacement if you are going to spend money buying 440. It makes a substantial difference, much more comfortable and sounds better in my opinion. Shure440 separates sound better and has better sound stage. It has a bright warm tone that I personally like. To my ear, it is more neutral than the V6 - meaning it doesn't really emphasize anything versus the V6 seems to have a slight emphasis on the bass. One more thing to complain about besides the stock earpads is the weight. It's solidly built but a little heavy - for a long period of listening you will definitely wish it is lighter like MDR-V6.

Both are very good headphones - if you do enough research you will find that these 2 comes up a lot as good headphones for under $100 price point. Each have their own personality and sound signature. I wouldn't say they are similar at all. I keep MDR-V6 at work and the 440 for home listening."
433,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I must admit this is the most pleasant surprise I've had in a long time ordering something based solely on revues without actually having the product tangible for my own personal inspection. The Shure SRH440 headphones perform far better than I would have imagined, and replacing my old headphones would have been done a long time ago had I known the audio quality of these headphones is as good as it sounds!

For those who familiar with the following equipment I'll describe my experience. I'm a musical composer using a Roland Fantom X-8 Workstation, and a Roland 1680 16 track dedicated digital recorder with Roland DS-90A powered near field monitors. Until I purchased the SRH440 headphones I primarily relied on the monitors for sound, and would use my other headphones only to avoid waking others in the house during late night/early morning composing and recording.

However, the sound quality of the SRH440's is so far superior to the old headphones and the near field monitors that I use them almost exclusively when performing these tasks now. One of the most pleasant surprises was hearing the left and right pan effect of playing the keys on my Roland Fantom X-8 just as you would on an acoustic piano: I really couldn't tell before until using the headphones. I do plan on purchasing a more expensive pair of Shure headphones in the future only if their sound will surpass the sound quality of the SRH440's with a highly noticeable difference in audio quality.

Anyone considering a headphone purchase should definitely check out the SRH440's for serious consideration!"
434,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones after looking at headphones for a few months. I bought them for their ability to deafen every sound outside of the cups. They're closed, meaning they don't have as great of a soundstage as open cans, but the soundstage is definitely large.

First of all, I had these cans running at a bit of a higher volume than normal(I didn't have them blasting, but had the volume up maybe 10 percent.) for a full day and a half straight. I listened to them for a few hours of that time, but I had other things to do. Also, I've had them for about a month now.

The sound quality at any frequency of these cans is superb. I haven't been able to distort them with my iPhone or my laptop at any percentage of volume. I've equalized these cans to try it, and I have to say it doesn't work well although I dislike equalizing anything.

My biggest complaint in sound is that the bass feels strange to my ears. I'm used to having bass hit me from woofers from my component system, and from subwoofers. The bass range is good for speakers not based on bass(pun intended) and that's always good. After listening to these phones solely for 5 or so hours, I got accustomed to the bass and found it to be rich.

The reason for the 4 stars in comfort is because of the headband. The bottom isn't cushioned enough, and after extensive use(5 to 6 hours), my head started to become sore. Even if I stopped listening to them for an hour or two, after putting them back on for another hour, I felt the pain again. I've decided to extend the cups more than usual, and fit the cup to my ear while moving the headband further back on my head, and it's been working well."
435,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound great.
Pros. They Sound great, Very Durable, Detachable cable (great for replacing if anything ever happens it the one your using), Removable ear pads (you can upgrade or replace them), Comes with carrying Pouch and 3.5mm to 1/4 in adapter.

Cons Can get a little hot after a while, a Little bulky, you get what you put in; meaning if you play badly recorded music you will hear it and it can hurt your ears.

Overall its a great headphone and brand i would buy again if mine ever broke"
436,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Typical outstanding Shure quality both in build and sound.

Headphones are large and very solid yet comfortable.

Sound is excellent with wide yet balanced dynamics, good volume, and efficient passive noise insulation.

Very reasonable price. These headphones are way superior to far more expensive headphones from Bose and similar others.

Highly recommended for critical listening to both classical and modern music."
437,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I just give this headphones 2 stars because the echo cancel doesn't work at all, I bought this ones because that feature for recording. If you want a regular headphones, this one will do the work, but if you want for recording, you try another brand. The ""superior isolation"" was the main reason, but so disappointing. As a matter of fact when I down the volume of any device i connect to the headphones I always hear a little noise."
438,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I think these headphones are very good, the sound is even, rich and deep, yet you can hear what is around you without it disturbing you music. It doesn't have the fake loud bass that ""Beat"" headset have, but they do give the clear detail production of your music and vocal.
The only negative I would say is the plastic hinges to hold the ear piece, seem like they can break if drop or force to hard, but they fold up nicely.
Over all I say for the money spend you can't go wrong, I would recommend it to other, and would buy it again."
439,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish these headphones were more comfortable. The top of my head starts to ache when I wear it for more than half an hour. I like the audio quality though, so it's a shame I can't wear them for very long. It's stored away most of the time, because I just don't like wearing it."
440,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent reproduction and comfort. I have four pair of these phones for musicians to use in my project studio and everyone seems to be impressed with the audio quality and ""fit"" of the Shure SRH440's. They are holding up well to the ""less than gentle"" treatment they are given session after session. Overall, I've never had problems with Shure products, which seem to be well designed and properly manufactured for long and reliable professional use."
441,4.0 out of 5 stars,"these sound slightly brighter and fuller than my seven-year-old HD-280s, but maybe that's just because they're new. (I like classical and jazz)

I like them enough, but the cups aren't big enough to fit all the way around my ears, and the padding is not thick enough to hold the driver off my ear. They're still better than on-ear phones, but if you have big ears, get the HD-280s. The Shure phones also have the sound wires routed externally around the driver pivot, which exposes it to tugging and wear; I'm worried that will be the first point of failure."
442,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very very sturdy and they had a nice clean sound. Shipment came early. I was comparing them to beats on YouTube and they talked me into these and I can say I'm glad they did. Between these and my neighbors beats I think these are my fav dnt get me wrong I'm not saying beats are bad but if you can get these for the same price or cheaper than beats than u gotta be crazy to not get these but this is just my opinion.
443,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these for recording and quiet practice when I'm at my friend's house. The overall balance is pretty good, but I would say that the treble slightly overpowers the bass and mids. I play bass, so sometimes this is a problem. Then again, my one guitarist has an awful ear and turns his guitar up about 50% too high. Definitely doesn't help. But for casual listening, I think the range on them is quite good, and they are comfortable for long periods of time."
444,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are pretty amazing. I may be a little biased as the headphones I was using prior to these were twenty dollar Sony's, but I know good headphones when I hear them as I am constantly trying new headphones at music conventions and the like. These headphones are particularly perfect for country, folk, acoustic, and classic rock. I can literally hear Eric Clapton's hands sliding up and down his neck as he plays Crossroads. Alison Krauss's voice sounds more buttery than normal and I'm picking up small nuances and breaths in the Civil Wars songs that I never even knew existed. I listened to ""Fool That I Am"" by Etta (RIP) at least five times because it felt like I was REALLY hearing the song for the first time.
These headphones have a very natural sound to them, even, but not boring. If you want something with a lot of bass, then these are not for you. The bass is good, but if you primarily listen to hiphop/dub step/new R&B and want a bass that is going to bounce your brain around, I'd pick up something else. However, if your iPod is filled with various artists and genres and you need a pair of headphones that will suit all your needs for just under a Benjamin, then these are perfect. I'm sure these headphones will only get better as I burn them in and I cannot wait.
My only con with these headphones is that they are a little uncomfortable after about an hour of wear, but as they are literally fresh out of the box I'm sure they just need time to stretch and conform to my head. I have yet to pick up the 840 pads to replace the stock pads, but I am positive that this will only improve the response and isolation (isolation is very good btw. I use them to play drums and I can listen to my track at a normal volume and hear my drums with ease).
Bottom line:
If you want a very even EQ and good isolation then these are perfect.
However, you want a very bass heavy pair of headphones, look elsewhere. I hear the Dr. has a pretty good pair :)

Back to listening..."
445,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these to use around the house primarily with my phone. They sound absolutely fantastic as long as you use a good equalizer. If you are using them with a phone I would strongly suggest testing them on an app called Power Amp. With this app you can crank the base up until it turns your brain to mush. If you like classical music you can set it for that and turn the base down and it sounds superb. Best all around headphone I have ever used. (important) I tested these and my other headphones and ear buds with almost every music app available for android and Power Amp is the best. The UI in Power Amp is not my favorite but the sound adjustment more then makes up for that.
446,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones last year, and they have turned out to be a great purchase.

First off, the sound quality of these headphones is fantastic. I feel immersed in the music when wearing these. Some may find the bass to be a little weak, but I appreciate hearing the music as it was recorded. The bass seems accurate while not being overbearing.

The comfort was something I was initially concerned about. This was actually the greatest negative for the headphones in my opinion. I did not find the 440's too heavy for my neck as some reviewers stated, but I did find the cups to be too stiff. At the recommendation of another reviewer I bought a set of replacement cups for the SRH840's. These cups were fantastic and they fit exactly as the stock pads did. They were superior in comfort and sound isolation. I would highly recommend this upgrade as they made a world of difference.

Another pro in favor of these headphones is the SRH440's durability. When I took them out of the box over a year ago I was immediately impressed by how solid the phones felt. This product has been designed to last for years, and I think that Shure did a good job with these.

Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for accurate and long-lasting headphones."
447,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: This is an extremely fine sounding headphone. The cans fold in for transport with mechanisms that appear sufficiently durable. The detachable, locking single cord is a fantastic design element that others would do well to adopt.
Cons: Coiled cord was a deal killer for me, although one can replace the cord with a straight cord. (It may be available with a straight cord out of the box, what I thought I'd ordered...) Among three competitors tested, however, these phones were the least comfortable to wear.

In both sound and build quality, these Shures came in a very close second place after many hours of side-by-side comparison with Sennheiser's 448s and Audio-Technica's M50. Although the winning AT M50s seem a bit heavier and a bit more unwieldy, they are also more comfortable and secure, in addition to having a more realistic sound stage. But these Shures are a very solid choice. They are also a great value for the money."
448,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product, now almost 2 years later still is in perfect condition except for a small piece of plastic which broke when I dropped my headphones on the floor. The only con is that the headphones are not so comfortable after two or more hours of continuous use."
449,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have a recording studio. For the musicians I use a cheaper quality that Amazon also carries. But for me to make a good mix these are fantastic. They do not create a false bass which some do. It is all straight and flat in the sense that it does not add to the sound. They give you an exact sound. I also am a huge fan of the screw on adapter. Makes a huge difference. Worth every penny
450,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for well over a year and the more I use them the better they sound, they do need to be broken in. They come with a flex cord that can be removed. I have had them on for a period of time and the comfort level is ok, they can be a little heavy after a while. I use these to mix and play. Four stars for comfort level."
451,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my daughters birthday present and they are very good. My daughter is a musician, so she hears music very well and she said these sound very nice. However, I felt that the construction was a little flimsy. They feel very fragile. That said it has been 6 months and my daughter is still using these and they seem to be working very well for here."
452,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This has already been reviewed to death, and I can only echo what everyone else has said.

These headphones sound great. For $90 it's hard to beat these. They do a fantastic job of isolating noise from your surroundings.

One issue I had with them is that after a few months of ownership the hinges and swivel points began to squeak/creak. They still work great, but if they move at all, there is an audible creak. If you are listening to music quietly, you can hear the creaking over the music.

Otherwise though, fantastic."
453,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure offers incredible sound well balanced between treble and bass: unlike many headphones, the bass is not overextended or blurry. They are not comfortable headphones to wear, but worth the slight discomfort. Also seals out external noise very effectively, without leaking sound to the outside world. Highly recommended."
454,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound with great balance, smooth and detailed response. As with most Shure products, these perform well beyond their modest price and styling would suggest. I use them for recording and casual listening, and have zero complaints. Some have said they lack bass, but I don't hear that. The bass is there, and so is everything else across the entire range. Love 'em."
455,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a good set of headphones to wear 8+ hours a day while working. I needed something that wouldn't put pressure on my glasses, or shift around, or get too hot. I also didn't want to spend a lot of money as they will get stuffed in my bag with my laptop for shuttling between work and home.

These headphones delivered on everything, and the sound is simply awesome. The padding is very comfortable. The adjustments were easy and don't seem prone to slipping. The headphones fold up into a neat package and come with a leather-like drawstring bag.

The coiled cord is a good length for using connected to my laptop or iPhone while still being neat. There's a straight cord available separately. The cord has a screw thread for attaching the included 1/4"" adapter, and a rotating lock on the other to attach the headphones. Both are very nice touches.

The sound is truly remarkable. I've been listening to the built-in laptop speakers and Apple earbuds for so long that I had forgotten what my music sounded like. The mids are clear, the highs aren't shrill, and the bass is definitely present. These are my first closed headphones and the bass is vastly better than any open phones or earbuds that I've ever heard."
456,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Up front: I was using some standard Apple earbuds before I bought these, and a pair of JVC Gumy earbuds before the Apple earbuds.

Overall, I really do like these headphones, and I've been using them for about a week. They provide decent amounts of low [I'd be content with a little more, but I knew that it was going to be a pretty flat EQ on these before I bought them], and very crisp, prevalent highs. Specifically, the highs sound really, really nice when you're listening to the crash on a drum kit, or something of the sort.

Generally in my experience-

--Pros:
-Great highs, pretty good lows
-Clear, crisp quality
-Block outside noise pretty well

--Cons:
-Could be a little more comfortable [specifically on the headband], but it certainly isn't a deal-breaker.

---

For the price tag on these, they're definitely worth the buy, in my opinion. They seem to hover around $85-$90, but if you wait, they'll occasionally drop to about $75, which is when I bought them. I can't really imagine getting anything else quite this good at $75."
457,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these headphones, they are pretty sweet. I love the 10' cord, I feel perfectly safe standing up from my laptop and not worrying about my headphones being tragically ripped out. The headphones are extremely comfortable from the first time I put them on, and the earcups are very big compared with my Philips headphones, which feels great even after a few hours of wearing them.

A few notes about the sound quality:
Audio is very clean and there is great sound definition. The bass is nothing impressive however, I wish there was a bassboost feature/switch. These headphones are excellent, but they seem to be more for studio recording since the vocal quality is quite excellent. So, the bottom line is if you want a great pair of headphones at a good price, pick these - if you want an AMAZING pair (for you audiophiles out there), step up to a more expensive pair from Shure."
458,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these sight unseen. It was a mistake. They have great sound and are highly rated, but they are not comfortable to wear.
I should have tested them in person before I purchased, and so should you."
459,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very affordable and fairly comfortable given the size and weight. Even though they aren't technically noise cancelling, they do a very good job at muffling external sounds."
460,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So after doing some research on headphone/audiophile forums I came to decide on these. I have to skip over the part about technical aspects of sound. However I can say (with the SRH840 pads) these are very comfortable. They stay on my head when I am moving around and close out the outside noise well. Even when off they cancel out a good deal of outside noise. They grip my head but not too tight, just right. For the $80 I paid I think these are great, certainly in a league with my friends' Beats by Dre and I paid way less. Some people say you would want to pick up an amp with these because of higher impedance but they are plenty loud for me even at lower volumes they do okay. If you are a nitpick about sound I would get an amp but if not they do great all alone.

Summary: I'm not an expert, they are comfortable with the better pads from the SRH840 (Average without), sound fine without an amp, and are a great bang for your buck at $80.

If you get these, MAKE SURE YOU A SET OF PADS THAT FOR THE SRH840, they literally take 30 seconds to change out and totally make these headphones fantastic, they are about an extra 15$, absolutely hands down worth it and I was on the fence about it when I ordered them.

Let me be crystal clear here. If you buy these headphones, buy a set of replacement pads that are for the SRH840 to change out the stock pads, its worth it, trust me, I'm a guy on the internet."
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In short, these are the best IEM's I've ever tried, but I'm not 100% convinced that they're worth $300.

I'm not really an audiophile, but I did a lot of research on IEMs (earbuds that sit deep in the ear), and I thoroughly tested a few of my finalists. So, in this review I'm going to compare the Shure SE215's ($99), Shure SE425's ($299), and Etymotic Research ER-4PT's ($299). My main selection criteria were comfort, sound quality, and ability to block out outside noise (note that for this reason I first tried the Bose QuietComfort 20i's, but the active noise canceling pressure made my ears hurt).

SHORT SUMMARY: I easily recommend the SE215's in terms of price-performance; but, if you have more to spend then get the SE425's. The ER-4PT's are very crisp, but they have some significant physical downsides.

LONGER REVIEW:

First of all, I hear that it's important to choose headphones based on the kind of music that you listen to. So, for my tests, I used ten songs representing my favorite genres of EDM (house/trance), synthpop, and pop rock. Songs included Instant Crush (Daft Punk), Good Morning Kaia (BT), Crush (Dave Matthews Band), and A Sky Full of Stars (Coldplay).

Overall, the SE215's are excellent, especially for the price. When switching back and forth between them and the 425's, I could notice a clear difference, but not necessarily a $200 difference. If $200 isn't a huge deal to you, definitely get the 425's; but, I think you'd have to be a very discerning listener to really appreciate the increase in quality.

So what's better about them? Everything is clearer. After listening to the 425's, the 215's feel almost like a light blanket was thrown over the speaker -- everything is just a little muddier and the individual instruments are less clear. There's less separation between the layers. But again, this wasn't a dramatic difference, so you'd still be very safe with the 215's (and I understand that $300 is an insane amount of money for most people to spend on earbuds).

What about the ER-4PT's? They were even clearer, but almost clinically so. It felt a bit like I was in a perfectly empty room listening to every little nuance of the sound, but that sound was less warm than that of the Shures. To be honest, though, this difference was minimal -- in most cases, there wasn't a hugely noticeable difference between the ER-4PT's and the SE425's. I most preferred the Etymotics in songs involving crisp cymbals and complex background noises; but again, it wasn't a huge difference, and overall I slightly preferred the warmer bass of the Shures.

More importantly, I found two dealbreakers that meant I couldn't keep the Etymotics: (1) That crisp clarity of sound sadly translated to the wire as well; every time I moved my head I could powerfully feel/hear the wire moving, to the point that it was quite distracting. I believe that this is called microphonics. (2) The plastic piece connecting the wire going to each ear was surprisingly heavy, to the point that its weight very quickly became annoying compared to the other earbuds.

The other nice thing about the Shures is how easily they slip into your ears. Fair warning that it took me a while to figure out how to get them in right -- I was about to return them because it was so confusing at first, but I watched a youtube video and realized you have to actually significantly bend the rubbery part. Once you get the hang of it, it's extremely fast and easy to fit them in compared to the Etymotics that I really had to work in every time while holding my ear open with my other hand.

So, like I said, I recommend either one of the Shures depending on how much money you can spare on headphones. One other tip, by the way: Be very careful about trying all the different types of tips that are included. I noticed a dramatic difference when I finally found the right set that made a truly tight seal in my ear canal -- the bass became significantly stronger and the overall sound became tighter and cleaner.

Overall, I definitely recommend IEMs over regular earbuds (unless you're riding a bike or something that demands attention), but keep in mind that none of these will fully block out nearby voices on their own -- I needed to play white noise or music to achieve the true isolation I was looking for.

UPDATE AFTER ANOTHER WEEK:

After going back and forth some more between these and the 215's, I can safely say that the 425's are clearly better for anything but casual background listening. For certain songs especially, the 215's now sound like they're covered in a blanket when immediately compared to the 425's -- they're just much duller, muted, and bass-heavy. I'd still certainly recommend them for the price, but I've decided to spend a little more and keep the 425's."
1,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these in December 2014, upgrading after owning the SE215-K and SE315-K. The sound quality is great, and a distinct improvement over the prior two. But other reviewers have spoken to that.

Yesterday when I went to remove the earbuds from my ear, the plastic at the base of the sleeve where it connects to the main body broke. This happened a few months ago, to the left side. I was able to send it in to be repaired, and I expect to be able to do so again under the 2-year warantee. However, this seems to be a weakness in the design that causes it to wear out after a bit over a year.

UPDATE: Original purchase: 12/2014 ; Left side sent for repair: 11/2015 ; Right side sent for repair: 9/2016

For $300, I expect the ear buds themselves to last for many years even if I have to replace the cables. So I would not buy these again."
2,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have now owned these, the 215 and 315. I still have and use the 315's as my work headphones. I noticed a difference between the 215 and 315, but honestly, I can't tell the difference between the 315 and 425, except that I paid an extra $100 for them.

That said, the 315 sounds great and is all-day comfortable. I wore them for 8+ hours a day on multiple weekends last summer while working on a project in the backyard. I was running a table, mitre or circular saw all day long, and not only did they effectively block the noise from my saws, I could clearly hear the music above the noise of those saws without ever having to increase the volume of my music beyond what was comfortable without the saws running.

In short, the 425 is a nice earbud, but I can't say it's a dramatic leap in build or sound quality over the 315. As a tip, the black cable is less durable than the clear cable. Go for the clear."
3,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great. If you have done your homework you know these are not big heavy bass filled buds, and that is completely true. But the audio is crisp and clean, and I have never felt/experienced such a great and comfortable fit- in terms of both comfort and sound isolation. The cord wrapping around your ear design is very cool, though a little less convenient for those with glasses I found.

The replaceable cord is an awesome idea. In reality I found my left earbud in particular would disconnect quite easily. I could easily slide the right one in but about half the time on the left one the cord would pop out. A couple times while quickly wrapping the cord up after work a bud would fling off. For this reason I ended up returning them- I suspect my pair was defective because of how much easier the left bud came disconnected, but even still I found it a nuisance.

Verdict: If you are not worried about the price tag, and are looking for fantastic ear buds for the home or use with an instrument, I would definitely recommend these. If you are looking for earbuds to wear daily on the go, I would avoid. I bought them hoping to do double duty, but I was hoping for too much, will buy separate piano headphones and music earbuds :)"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally broke my Shure E3C earbuds after almost seven years of faithful service. I crazy glued the stem back onto the earbud and the buds still work, but I felt nervous about the stem breaking again and getting stuck in my ear. So I decided to get a new set and was wavering between the SE315's and the SE425's. The 315's are probably close to the equivalent to what I was replacing, but the other reviews I read for the 425's praised their better bass response (deep, but clean), the wider range, and the superior noise isolation. So I decided to spend the extra hundred dollars to upgrade to the 425's. I am very happy that I did. My old E3C's were great, and I would guess the SE315's would be equally good, but the 425's are a significant step up. I have a wide taste in music but at least half the time I am listening to classical, so strong, clean bass, and a wide range to handle every orchestra instrument and the occasional classical vocal piece are essential. I'm also in airplanes every week so sound isolation is important.

I might mention that in addition to my old E3C's I also have a set of Bose Quiet Comfort 15's, bought when I thought noise cancellation might be better than noise isolation. I was wrong. The Bose are great at killing jet engine noise, and are truly eye-watering in a turboprop, but they don't cancel out babies and rude adults. The E3C's did a pretty good job of those problems, but the 425's are really amazing when it comes to sound isolation. With no music playing, I can still hear conversations, but they are very muffled. With music playing, even at fairly low levels, there is no ambient noise to intrude. Somehow, Shure tweaked the angle of the earbuds so they get a perfect seal. That being said, the 425's would be truly dangerous to wear while jogging or cycling.

So about the sound quality of the 425's. Better than the E3C's; better than the Bose QC15's - but not quite at the audiophile level. My guess is you need to spend considerably more to get something that will sound as good as a quality THX-certified home surround system. On my home system, I can pick out exactly where a particular orchestra instrument is placed. Can't do that with the 425's but the stereo separation is very good and gives you the full depth you would expect. The quality of the 425's allow me to listen at lower volume levels, which is far less fatiguing (and quite a bit better for the ears!). The quality of the bass presentation I noticed when I played my Boston Pops recording of 76 Trombones. This piece has bass and kettle drums plus a tuba. On my E3C's and the Bose QC15's all three instruments sound the same and kind of mush together. On the 425's I can hear the difference between the drums and the tuba, and the sounds remain distinct. If you've never used noise isolating earbuds before, it is absolutely critical to get a good seal in your ear - otherwise the bass will be very weak. If you can clearly hear the conversations around you, you don't have a good seal. Conversations should sound almost like you're under water if you have the earbuds inserted correctly.

A couple quibble points. As other reviewers mention, getting the foam sleeves off that the 425's ship with is no small task. Even using the trick of putting them in the freezer isn't a quick fix. Knowing that the stems the sleeves fit on are fragile, it took me almost 15 minutes of gentle twisting and pulling to get the foam sleeves off. Hey Shure, how about shipping the 425's without the sleeves installed? The good news is, if you don't use foam sleeves, the other sleeves (soft rubber in three sizes, and yellow memory foam) are much easier to get on and off. And once you find the right sleeve for you, you will never have to mess with that problem again. The other quibble I have is the semi-rigid, 3"" wire cover adjacent to the bud. This wire should be bent to the curvature of the outside of your ear to help keep the bud securely installed. It absolutely does that; there is no way these buds are going to fall out accidentally. But the wire also makes the buds much harder to install in the first place. Getting the buds inserted and secured is a two-hand task, and takes a while even once you think you have the hang of it.

If the quality of sound and excellent noise isolation are critical to you,and you don't plan to use them for jogging or cycling, and you can live with the quibbles I mentioned, these are the earbuds to buy!"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I still marvel at it! A phenomenal achievement. NOT for bassheads. Dual balanced armature (not dynamic) driver, with a very capable, built in cross-over network, the SE425's offers an analytical interpretation of the audiophile experience. Bass is ample, when it is indicated in the mastering of the track, but it shines in its above average rendering of upper-mids to highs. Shure's signature sound is to emphasis the uppers and high mids, so it is true to that sound. To this day, after owning it for over 6 months now, I still marvel at its capability. It is accurate and detailed, without being fatiguing, and the sound stage, tho not vast, is good enough. My only reservation is to perhaps invest in the SE535's for a fuller expression of the low mids, to lows. I often tinker with the idea of upgrading to the 535's or even the SE846's."
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, very accurate sound from an earphone. They have a more realistic spacious sound than the SE210s I had before these. Other headphones that emphasize bass or some other range make some music sound great and other music sound really crummy. These ones make all music sound great. Some might complain that the bass sounds weak, but that's because they're used to 'phones that exaggerate bass. Bass can be made to *almost* thump on these using equalizer settings on a player, but most of the time it sounds better without.

I've had them for close to a year and a half now. It takes some practice before you get used to putting them in, but once you've got it down, the new shape is great and lets them lie flatter in your ear. Having the wire go around your ear reduces cable noise when you move around. The included selection of sleeves is excellent, though after trying a bunch I ended up using the ones that came pre-installed, the 2-dot black foam ones. They can be a little finicky to get in correctly, but if done right they stay comfortable for extended listening sessions.

Having the cable be replaceable is brilliant, and more high end headphones need to start doing it. Headphone wires always seem to eventually get brittle when I use them, something about my skin oil I think. This one is the only one I've used for this long that hasn't, so it's an excellent quality cable, but I'm still very glad it will be replaceable when something finally does happen to it.

The cable is absurdly long at 60 inches. This would be great for use with a stereo or desktop computer. For portable use you end up with quite a bit of extra cable. I preferred the older way, where the cable is just long enough for a phone or iPod in a shirt pocket, and an extension wire is included for when you want it longer. I ultimately ended up cutting it to a more sensible length and splicing it together. If they offered a shorter one as an accessory, I'd have bought that."
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. They are, by far, the best headphones I have ever owned, or even used for that matter. My only complaint is that I wish they produced more bass, but I was warned and made aware of that before I bought them. They are comfortable for hours on end; although for the first few days to a week, after a few hours they become uncomfortable, but after that you get used to them and it is no longer an issue. They also stay put. They will not fall out even if you pull, hard, on them. To really appreciate these, you need a high quality audio source, but they offer an improvement with any audio source. Also, removing the foam tips that come attached from the factory is very difficult, but once you change them the first time it gets easier after that. I had to pull so hard I thought I was going to break the headphones or tear the foam tips. My complaints are pretty minor though and the pros far outweigh any minor issues. I would highly recommend these to anyone. I will always buy Shure headphones in the future, as long as I can afford them."
8,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After all the rave reviews I was looking forward to getting these. I have never had in-the-ear phones before, so maybe it is just me, but I could get practically no bass out of these. I tried several of different size/type of ""inserts"" with them, but unless I forcibly kept them pushed into my ear canal, no bass. Tried all different types of music/songs. I was only able to get fairly decent low end when I hooked up my mp3 player through a FiiO A5 headphone amp, with output boost and bass boost on. Also had bass boosted in my mp3 player EQ. They did have excellent clear high and mid range (and bass when I forced the issue). So these headphones didn't work out for me and I returned them."
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love these headphones. I am a drummer and use them for personal playing, gigs and in church. The dual drives are great for my needs, I wouldn't want a single drive for my needs. The amount of tips it comes with are nice to have, it gives you options for a comfortable fit or different places you are playing in.

The fit and comfort is superb. I found initially they didn't pick up the low ends, but after using them more and breaking them in they pick up the low ends better. Really making a nice balanced sound; which is great playing live as you want to hear all the instruments and vocalists.

I would buy again, but with shure's quality they should last quite awhile."
10,5.0 out of 5 stars,"BACKGROUND: I owned the SE310 headphones in 2009 and had them replaced with a Best Buy gift card because the cable split at the ear loop while the headphones were under warranty. I can attest that it was a thin, brittle cable on otherwise very good sounding headphones.

REVIEW: Out of the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of the SE425-CL. The cable and connectors have been reinforce, particularly around the ear loop. These ship with the pictured foam tips installed. When I listened to the headphones for the first time with these tips, I was disappointed in nearly all aspects except for the mid-range. The headphones didn't make a good seal in my ear canal.

I cannot stress enough, these headphones, and others in the Shure SE line, REQUIRE a very good seal to sound their best. They should fit like very firm ear plugs so that you will literally have to pinch the casing and pull the tip out of your ear. Once I switched out the small foam tips with the large ones, the sound was excellent. They block out so much sound. You will not hear your neighbor in the gym on the treadmill. In fact, it takes a some adjustment to only being able to hear the impact of your feet on the ground when you're walking with these on.

The bass is entirely adequate and balanced with the mid range and highs. It won't rumble your ears or sound like a 10"" home stereo subwoofer or a car subwoofer, but it's enough to vibrate your ears a little and they faithfully reproduce all the low notes in a song like ""Put On"" by Jeezy, which I always use to test out bass."
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would not consider myself an audiophile, but I do believe to have a discerning ear. The Shure SE425-V's would represent the most that I have ever paid for a set of ear bud's and or head phones, but here goes.
These are a bit tricky to get in your ear correctly, but once you have figured out which little foam pieces fit properly in your ear and with a bit of practice they seem to drop in and fit very and I mean very comfortably and for the first time I now have a pair of ear buds that actually stay put as opposed to falling out of the ear while your hands are occupied. I have read that one must be careful not to remove these by pulling on the cable as this will provide the user with premature failures of the cable and I can see this happening as the cables look to be a bit on the delicate side.
As for ambient sound blocking they do a wonderful job, as I purchased these to use while on the motorcycle I am now having doubts as to whether that is a good idea, having the surrounding sounds dampened so much, may leave one in a state of isolation, you can hear loud noises (such as a blast from a horn), but they are subdued quite a bit, which says much for design of these ear pieces, but also may leave one enjoying the listening rather than paying attention to the surrounding traffic (while driving).
I have read that these ear buds lack the bass response that one would be looking for while listening to some styles of music, I did have success in adjust the EQ to increase the bass response to my listening pleasure, but I am in the grey hair crowd so my bass distinction may
be quite different than yours.
Sound quality is spectacular in my humble opinion, sound is full of rich detail from the highs to the lows, would I purchase these again, shure would, opps sure would as well as recommend them to a friend."
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things are amazing. For those who want to pump as much bass as possible into an earphone, look elsewhere. For anyone else who wants a solid, warm, balanced sound that does an accurate job of reproducing music, these are some magnificent earphones, even at this high price tag.

Fit: Great (after a while)
Those who are unaccustomed to the Shure wearing experience, this may be an initial turn-off, as you really need to place them deep into the ear canal to get a good isolation to achieve maximum sound clarity. The SE 425 deep in-ear canal feel will feel a bit uncomfortable at first (your ears need to get used to the pressure,) but once you are used to it, you can't live without the secure feeling of never having to worry about the earphones falling out, and you no longer feel any discomfort.

Sound: Wonderful (for a balanced sound experience)
Again these are not for bass junkies, but offer a more balanced sound reproduction for all levels. The sound is beautiful, rich and warm, and can offer a great listening experience with different genres of music. I myself use a portable amp with earphones and can adjust the EQ to whatever I want, and the SE 425s perform even better at many levels."
13,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a prior statement before I write this review these are my first IEMS. I am no audio genius, nor am I an audio electronics expert; my understanding is limited to basic principles and applications.

Now that everything is out of the way, let's move onto the review; first, these headphones are extremely analytical and clean-sounding. These are not bassy IEMS, nor are they a sparkly-sounding"" treble IEMS—these are natural, balanced sounding headphones with a fast and punchy bass sound. To some, this may make the in-ears sound ""weak"". However, I would disagree and say the bass is sufficient and exists to a point where you know it is there—but you also know that the bass would not bleed into the treble. These in-ears sound fantastic with just about every genre in my opinion; but they particularly shine with classical music, traditional musics, (particularly from Japan and China) music with an emphasis on vocals such as folk, gospel, and choir—as well as rock music. Electronic musics also sounds good; even bassy tracks sounded fantastic, and you can hear sounds you never would of noticed with basic headphones or headphones with an emphasis on lows and bass. I suppose that is the trade-off; clarity over power. That would most likely sum up the IEMS as a whole; they are IEMS for someone who wants clarity and neutrality in sound above all else—perhaps you are someone who listens to a large variety of music and cannot decide on a particular sound signature—or perhaps you just listen to music without an emphasis on bass. The choice is up to you my friend."
14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had some Sure E3's that failed after many years of abuse, so I thought I'd try the sure brand again. I was looking for the E4's on a recommendation of a friend and found these as the upgraded option. Overall, I'm extremely happy with this purchase. I play the bass and wanted to have something that would give an accurate bass response. These are absolutely great for bass! But they shine in all areas.

PROS: The music quality is great to me. I have had several brands over the years including Bose, Sony, Monster, etc. These sound great compared to all of those. I expected a high quality sound for the price and I wan't disappointed. Since these are stage quality headphones they really need to be able to seal off well and reduce the outside noise. The headphones come with several options for ear pieces, the foamy black rubber ones work best for me. I sit right behind the drum set and very close to the piano but I still have control of their volume levels with these headphones in. I used to have the piano turned all the way down on our AVIOM system b/c the noise would bleed through my E3's but now I can actually use the volume knob on the piano as it should be. I also use these when flying to block out sound and watch movies. It's like having a surround system in your head. Very, very nice.

A big pro that I haven't used yet is the detachable cords. Often times the cord is the weak link in a pair of headphones. With these, if the cord breaks you can just replace it. Very nice.

CONS: These things are not jogging headphones! They are big and relatively heavy. Don't misunderstand, they are perfect for a stage or sitting and watching a movie or listening to music. But they are large and wouldn't be a great workout headphone in my opinion. That's not their design. Plus, they block out too much noise to be safe when running down the road.

The headphone jack is large. I wouldn't fit my iphone case so I whittled it out a little. I know it's for durability, just saying so you'd be aware.

OVERALL: These headphones are GREAT at what they are designed to be. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend these to anyone who want a higher end headphone to block out the outside world and provide awesome sound for music or movies."
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound Isolation is almost complete. This can be problematic when walking around and should be taken into account. The sound quality is fantastic. You will hear details in your favorite music you had never heard before. As for the sound profile I'd say its pretty balanced from mid to high but lacks in bass. The bass is present and very tight but again it is not bass heavy. The fit is great but there is a bit of a learning curve as to how they fit into your ears. I could see these being very uncomfortable for people with smaller ears as there is quite a lot of headphone to stuff in there. The build quality is high in accordance with their price. Something to add is that mid range vocals sound especially good. The only genre that didn't sound as good for me is Jazz. Because of the lack of bass and warmth it just doesn't really blow my mind. Electronic music is finding its way into my library as these headphones are stellar for this genre in particular. The precision and dynamic response to these headphones really provides a good amount of pep into some tracks.
16,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bottom line, for headset sound, you can't do much better than Shure. These are replacing my old SE310's which sounded fantastic held up for 4 or 5 years (so long I can't quite remember when I purchased them). With the dual drivers, the new SE425s sound much richer and definitely better, The sound isolation is probably 10-15 db better as well. The headset probably exceeds the quality of the decoding on my iPhone but for direct connect to my stereo or as a headset for my radio show, they are perfect.

Here's whats missing: My SE310 had a cord that separated in the middle. This was a great feature for the times when the cord gets caught in something when you turn your head or stand up. The separator would detach which would prevent any damage to my iPhone and/or potential injury to my ears. The new SE425s do not have this great feature. I wish Shure would have included the inline mic with volume control on the cord. I'm sure they will make an extra $30-$40 wholesale by selling a separate cord, but really, if I buy the separate cord I am not going to switch back and forth to the original cord, so it is a waste. Why not offer the SE425 with or without the inline mic as separate SKUs? Its almost inconceivable to me that Shure did not make the 3.5mm mini plug with a narrow offset for plugging into an iPhone that has a thick case on it. Really? Come on, the iPhone has been out for how many years now? Shame on you.

If not for these three missing features, I'd rate them 5 star.

Finally, I've only had these for about one week. The longest I've worn them is 4 hours and they have been very comfortable. Time will tell if they are less comfortable as they get used or when I am wearing them for 6-8 hours."
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got my Shure SE425 earbuds......wow! So I don't normally write reviews because I don't want to take the time to, but I just got these in the mail and felled compelled to write one. I have been waiting for a solid week, and they finally came, the tension was building up and I am not disappointed at all! These are absolutely amazing.

I am no audiophile, but even I can tell the difference in sound compared to anything else I've listened to. The have really clear sound and claim to be sound-isolating...depending on the ear sleeves you use, I could argue that they are sound cancelling. They have beautiful sound; the basses are pronounced, but don't drown the music (especially if you listen to rap). They sound amazing with classical, and best of all, they are amazing for country that typically has a neutral sound.

The fit is absolutely perfect. Play around with the ear tips to find the perfect fit....trust me, the perfect fit is included, just try them all on. Because they fit flush against your ear, they are super comfy to fall asleep in; they don't dig into your ear and hurt after a while like other earbuds that stick out do. Although they are a little pricy, there is a reason....they are worth every penny if you have the money! It was way past my budget as a student, but I could not resist and I do not regret the purchase at all!"
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I play bass at my church and they have the Aviom systems for in ear monitoring. They have several pairs of the SE315 model ear phones which are single driver and they aren't too bad but can sound a little thin. I was mostly getting grossed out by sharing monitors with other people so I decided to get my own and upgrade to Shure's next highest model while I was at it. First of all these aren't going to thump your ears out like Beats headphones. They are very clear, detailed monitors. They have more bottom end then the SE315 models but they are crystal clear and not muddy. I would say there is more bass presence but not necessarily booming bass. I can clearly hear everything that is going on on the stage without ringing ears afterwards. In my opinion these are the best in ears you can get for the money before getting into custom models. For live monitoring music performance situations they work perfectly for me. I play bass without an on stage amp and I can hear the bass loud and clear with these. The SE315's have distortion with lower frequencies but I do not experience that with these in ears."
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've played with Sennheisers, beyerdynamics, Vic Firth, . . I could go on and on for over the ear isolation headphones. These are hands down so much better. The sound quality is amazing, you don't loose any bass, the EQ is very flat, and the attenuation is better than any over the ears, so you don't need the volume as loud. The quick release makes it easy to just plug them in when you walk on stage. Also, over the ear headphones let a lot of sound in if you rock out, open your mouth so your jaw bone shifts, or move your head too much. Over the ears cord also gets in the way more. This wire goes over your ears and behind, or under you chin tightly. The only down side is if your band members speak to you, you can't just slide your headphones off. Signals must be visual, or in the mic."

28,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow these earphones are truly incredible! I actually prefer them over my Bose Quietcomfort 3 Noise cancelling headphones; music at all levels is significantly crisper and cleaner (they actually block out more noise too). Lots of people complain about the lack of bass in these but once you have them properly inserted I found the bass to be nearly perfect, not over powering but it certainly has a presence while still being accurate. Also I was worried about the in ear design not being comfortable, but once you find the right tip you can wear them for hours on end. I love to ski while listening to some good music and with my old Skullcandy's I would always find myself cranking up the volume so I could hear my music clearly, in turn drowning out my surroundings. With the Shure's they sit so well in the ear canal that I leave my volume all the way down and can hear every beat and lyric clearly, which is perfect for helping you maintain your rhythm but still safely hear the skiers around you. The ability to switch cords to the MPA cord which controls your iphone is also a huge plus while skiing or working out. You really can't say enough about these earphones, I thought I was stupid for spending $300 on earphones but after a couple uses it is totally justified."
29,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to replace my broken SE420's which sounded amazing.

31,4.0 out of 5 stars,These phones are what you pay for. They are not cheap nor cheaply made. Sounds are much better than the $30 specials. One must get accustomed to installing the earpiece in the ear canal.
32,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Leí mucho antes de comprar este auricular. Son muchos los atributos que tiene el 425: cable reforzado y reemplazable, jack de primera clase y un sonido balanceado, sólo por citar algunos. No obstante, si debo resaltar algo, es la claridad del sonido y la excelente separación de los instrumentos; cada uno puede escucharse con una nitidez impresionante. En cuanto a las quejas por la falta de graves, a mí no me afecta. Encontré el capuchita perfecta para lograr un sellado adecuado del canal auditivo y listo; los bajos están muy presentes, pero sin restarle nada a los medios y agudos -prefiero un sonido balanceado y plano, a uno exagerado y agresivo que bloquea al resto-.
Resulta increíblemente emocionante volver a escuchar mis discos con el SE425; siempre descubro algo nuevo, un matiz, una pizca sonora que antes no estaba y que ahora sí. Es como redescubrir la música. Escucho un poco de todo: clásica, rock, punk, etc. y la verdad es que lo estoy disfrutando, y mucho. La música clásica suena simplemente inmaculada, no puedo encontrar otro adjetivo para describir lo que oigo, mientras que los clásicos como Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin y otros ganan en nitidez y fuerza. Discos más nuevos como los de Tv on The Radio LCD Soundsystem, simplemente te van a volar la cabeza. No le pongo 5 porque no existe nada perfecto, y en ese sentido debo decir que un aspecto a mejorar del auricular es la comodidad y el confort ya que no puedes tenerlo puesto de seguido más de dos horas. Por el resto, recomendaría este auricular a cualquiera que de verdad le gusta la música como para gastar unos dólares más."

35,3.0 out of 5 stars,Difficult to get them to fit (using the optional mobil cables). If they don't fit perfectly the bass is very weak.
36,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality sound so for that it's 5 stars. The drawback is that there are zero controls on these headphones which means I have to go back to the device to control music/answer call/change volume. I think if you are looking for a pure audio in-ear headset these are very good but there's no frills beyond that.
37,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I understand the purpose of these is monitoring and so they have more of a flat response, but it does bother me how little bass they can put out. Messing with the EQ resulted in more of a rattle than deep bass even at low volumes. But, they are comfortable and do what I need them to do when used as IEMs."
38,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great durable earphones from Shure comes at a price but is well worth the investment.

41,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected. The base is lacking severely. Would have expected much more from a $400.00 in ear headphone. Definitely not worth the money.
42,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Add me to the list of people who had the SE-425s break right out of the box. This is my third pair of Shures. I'm sure the sound would have been more than adequate with this set, but I never got to try them. I prefer the silicone tips, so the first thing I did was try to remove the foam tips that were installed. The plastic tube snapped off almost immediately.

I bought these to replace a stolen set of SE-530s. The tube on my 530s got slightly twisted when I replaced the tips on those. The sound was still excellent, so I kept them. On the 425s the tube snapped. I don't know what they use to attach these tips at the factory, but it seems like superglue!

Well, this is ridiculous for a $300 set of earbuds, and it seems to be a not so rare condition. Thanks to Amazon for a quick & easy refund. Time to look at another brand."
43,1.0 out of 5 stars,This top of the earbuds literaly break
44,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi Everyone,
I just received my SE425's 2 days ago, and have had ample time to ""break them in"". After spending almost $300, I'm not sure if they're exactly as I expected. I previously had the Shure E2C, SE210, and SE310; all of them were wonderful in their own ways at their price points.

However, the SE425 have very similar sound to the now-discontinued and discounted SE310 even with two discrete drivers, while costing more (after SE310 price discounts). The cables are too rigid near the ears, making for uncomfortable wearing. Also, the nozzles/earpieces don't go as deep in the ear canal as previous models, but surprisingly without sacrificing sound isolation. The bass is too understated, even compared to Shure's ""flat-sound"" standards. The detachable cables are an amazing innovation (finally implemented), especially since my previous models have gone through 3-4 cable warranty repairs (crackling sound) while the drivers themselves were perfectly fine.

Beware, the earphone plug-in piece is quite large, making it very difficult to fit in iPhone/MP3 player cases (especially the iPhone 1st gen and iPhone 4 w/ bumper). The previous Shure models didn't have this problem, as their plug points were quite narrow.

Overall, the Shure SE425 seems more durable than previous models, but their high price point with only marginal improvements makes it slightly difficult to justify over previous Shure models, which are now heavily discounted.

I'm do not claim to be an audiophile who listens to music only through Amps and such, though I do value and understand quality audio. I mainly use these headphones with my iPhone 4 and laptop with higher bitrate songs (320 KPBS+ VBR).

Hopefully this helps, and good luck in your earphone search!!"

46,2.0 out of 5 stars,"There is virtually NO BASS. For the most part, all high end. I had a pair of SE225's with a single driver that produced more bass. I don't expect a boom box but more than I'm getting. I'll probably be sending them back! Over priced for lack of quality."
47,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have SE530 and gave it 5 stars. I tried both the new SE535 and this SE435. These new earphones fit more snug therefore produce more bass. As a result the SE535 has overwhelming bass drowning out everything else while the original SE530 have a much better balance. The SE435 has a much better balance than the SE535. I have tried many other in ear headphones in the past. I tried top of the line from Sony,audio technica, Etomotics and I have even owned $1000 custom molded UE10 but I like both the SE435 and SE530 better. Shure simply has the technology down and produce the best balance among all in ear headphone which I have tried. Others simply do not sound natural nor are they musical. In my opinion the Shure SE435 and SE530 are the best available."
48,4.0 out of 5 stars,good
49,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Having owned a pair of Shure e2c's and Monster Turbine earphones (not to mention countless cheap pairs and an okay set of Sennheiser CX300's), I decided I was going to treat myself with some holiday money and get these 425's.

Like my beloved e2c's, they came with a variety of different earpieces and a nice carrying case. I went straight for the foam, plugged these in to my iPod, and experienced... well... disappointment. Thinking that this was clearly my fault, I decided to break them in, knowing full well that the benefits of doing so with earphones is not very well substantiated. Then I decided to try again with DVD audio and vinyl tracks on my Yamaha receiver to ensure it wasn't just the compression that was ruining the experience.

What I've concluded is that the 425's are absolutely stellar for live, choral, and jazz music. Seriously, Dave Brubeck has never sounded so good. But I had to temper that with the fact that pop, rock, and electronic music really suffer on the low end. And, I found myself continually pushing on the earphones, as though they weren't in as far as they needed to be. Sure, the seal was perfect, but for some reason, I just wasn't getting the bass. I tried other earpieces, but they generally sounded the same or worse -- keeping in mind too, that my ear canals aren't unusually shaped, and I know how to form a proper seal.

As far as highs and mids, the 425's absolutely sparkle. But there's an almost unnerving lack of ""presence"" that only seems to come with a lot of EQ changes. So while they're certainly some of the clearest earphones I've ever used, they're not the best. Yes, you can hear the floor creaking on a John Coltrane track, and it's pretty amazing. But that in itself doesn't make a song more enjoyable to listen to. And frankly, I don't think that the sound reproduction of a finished track is more ""true"" with the 425's so much as the mids are very detailed.

If you were using these as monitors (which admittedly, Shure loosely suggests), you're getting a great deal on great earphones. But for the vast majority of purchasers who want to plug these in to an iPod or stereo receiver, they're just not very impressive for general use."
50,4.0 out of 5 stars,They got to me with-in the time promised.. The pictures showed had a case for the headphone that was different from the one it came with.
51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having been an audiophile for years, let me tell you that these headphones are nothing short of amazing. I did my fair share of research on multiple sets before determining these were the ones I wanted. In the discussion were the Grado GR8, Klipsch Image X10, Shure SE535, Shure SE425, Monster Miles Davis Tributes, and Monster Turbine Pro Gold. After weighing out price, value for the price, and general consensus based on hundreds of reviews, I settled on these guys and am by NO MEANS disappointed at all. One of the biggest things I was afraid of was a supposed drop in the low end frequency response according to quite a few reviews. I'm not the kind of person that demands over-bearing bass, I just want it to be there in the amount that its supposed to be there (For reference, I listen mostly to rock/jazz and a little bit of rap/hip-hop). My suspicions are that those who claim there is a lack of bass did not have a proper seal, because I experienced the same problem until I found my ideal tips (Triple-flange sleeves or the medium foam tips, triple flange sleeves provide a better seal but aren't as comfortable which is the reason for the loss of one star in the ""Fit"" category but they are still great). Once I got this seal, the SQ just popped and everything sounded just as it should. Not only was I pleasantly surprised by the low end but the mids and highs lived up to my expectations that had been built up by the many reviews. These guys really perform at a high level like the reviews say and they really do epitomize what Shure SQ is all about. Aside from SQ, the new cord is awesome, nice and sturdy, I have virtually no expectation that this will break, and even if by some freak accident it did, Shure has made them replaceable! Though I cant comment on the SE535's honestly as I have not heard them myself, I cannot imagine they are significantly better than these and definitely not for the $200 price jump. My decision was primarily between the SE535's and the SE425's and I am glad I saved myself the extra 200 bucks and got these. These are no doubt my new favorite earbuds and will serve me well for many years to come."
52,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I travel a lot, and I go through earphones once every year or so because I lose them or break them. I've had Shure SE530, SE535, UE Triple.Fi 10 and now these SE425. I'd have to say, out of all those earphones, SE425s are probably the best combination of cost and performance. I did buy SE535 thinking that the newer model would be a perfect replacement for my lost set of SE530, and it was. However, Shure made the SE535's bass noticeably richer than SE530, the perfect balance of SE530 was gone. They still sounded fantastic, so I used them for a few months until my yorkie puppy chewed them to bits. Deciding whether to shell out almost $200 for repair or try out another model, Amazon was running Black Friday promotion where UE Triple.Fi 10 was under 100 bucks, so I ordered them. Well it was a good thing it was under $100, because I would have thrown a fit if I had paid for them at list price. UE Triple.Fi 10 sounded AWFUL! All the reviews said the sound clarity was fantastic, but it just sounded very muddy to me compared to Shure. So I pondered returning it but decided to ""gift"" the UE 10 to my ""audiophile"" friend, and I immediately looked for an alternative, and I ordered the SE425.

Surprisingly the sound coming out from the SE425 is as clear and rich as the SE535, but without that overwhelming bass that I didn't like. Balance-wise I think the SE425 is closer to the SE530 than SE535, and I'd say the overall sound quality from the SE425 is just as good as the SE530. The fit for SE425 is identical to the SE535, but not as comfortable as the SE530. The SE535/425 and SE530 requires different foam tips. I initially used the same foam tips as SE530 (medium black olive type) which made the earbuds fall out constantly, but changing it to yellow foam tips made huge difference in comfort and fit, and my SE535/425 never fell out of my ears.

The fantastic improvement on SE535/425 compared to the venerable SE530 is the cord. The cord is much much sturdier and more flexible than the ones on SE530, and they are detachable from the ""buds"" part. And because the plugs are round, the buds can rotate so that wearing them is much easier than with the SE530.

Well, if my dog chews up my SE425, I'm repairing the SE425, not the SE535. I think I found the perfect earbuds for price and performance. For some people who might have been wanting more bass sound, SE535 would be a better choice but for anyone like me who want clarity and better balance of all ranges, the SE425 seems like a great choice, especially at $200 less than the SE535."

While these are some fantastic sounding IEM's, I need to hold back a star simply because I haven't found them to be worth the hefty price tag. I purchased a set of SE 215's a year ago -- along with some custom molds -- and was very impressed with the clarity and bass; in a quest to achieve an even better listening experience, I shelled out another $300 for the 425's. As I said, they sound great, but I'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the 215's and the 425's in a blinded test. My advice? For the money, get the SE215's -- you won't be disappointed."

56,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am pretty disappointed with these iems. I own the 215s and was looking for an upgrade, but decided to return the 425s. The 425s have better clarity in the mid and upper mid range but the sound as a whole is unpleasant to my ears. The high end is lacking and so are the low mids. Like other reviewers have stated, the low end is severely understated. And I'm not a bass head. I will admit that I do prefer a slight V sound signature. People rave about the 425 mids but to me they are far too forward. I compared the overall sound signature of the 425s to my JBL LSR305s, which are known to be accurate studio monitors, and they sounded nothing alike. I did not compare soundstage etc. because iems cannot compete with studio monitors. For the price I do not recommend."

58,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am just your average music listener, but my take on these earphones is that there is very little (to no) low end sound, which makes for a very lack-luster listening experience. The disproportion of high to low does not provide a full, rich sound. I tried all of the combinations of earpieces to try get the best fit but no earpieces really helped. For the price, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
59,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm completely blown away by the reviews on this. I recently broke a pair of Westone U3 (triple driver) headphones and decided I'd give these Shure SE425-CL a shot and must say they're extremely flat. It honestly sounds like a low end pair of $60-$100 price ranged headphones. The sound isolation is decent but these earphones sound extremely mediocre on most common styles of music. I'm not expecting a ridiculous amount of bass as if I were buying cheap gimmick headphones like Beats by Dre but for the price, there is nothing I can justify keeping these for. The sound quality is just sub-par and totally not inline w/ how much money out of pocket these cost.

Still blown away by the reviews. I'm very weary that these are actual customers compared to what I hear and read."

61,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Good:
- Sound sound quality is EXCELLENT -- I have owned SE115, SE215 and the SE425, and while the SE215's are great, you can definitely hear more detail with the SE425, so it is worth the extra money if you are want the additional fidelity.
- Fit is perfect, very comfortable with the soft foam rubber tips, fully seal and provide for good isolation and bass
- The clear ones look AWESOME

The Bad:
- Don't wear well: I have babied mine -- always place in case and handle gently -- however before long you will find your self replacing the cables (3 times now @ ~30 ea), and sending back the earbud for out-of-warranty replacement when the casing separates (about to send back for second time @ ~70)

For nearly $300, the warranty should be longer."
62,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure SE425 is an excellent detailed IEM for Hi Res music.

I started out a year ago with the great all around quality Shure SE215 IEM with single dynamic full range drivers to use with my Pono Hi Res music player. The thing with playing top quality music files on my excellent Pono Hi Res player or any other brand Hi Res player is that you will want the highest quality ears on that you can get for hearing all that extra sound detail. I prefer IEMs, as full around ear headphones kind of heat me up too much. I find Shure IEMs to be more comfortable. Balanced armature drivers power most of the best audiophile quality IEMs, and the Shure SE425 has 2 separate balanced armature drivers in each ear to better separate out the lows from the highs. The result is more sound depth, more detailed sound, and a wider perceived soundstage using the SE425 than I could hear with the SE215. I was also delighted in the strong amount of bass from the SE425 despite many bass critics... You just need to use a sleeve size and type that fits tight to seal your ear canal so you hear all of the bass. Bass is there exactly as it should be with the right foam sleeve, and I listen to all forms of blues, rock, alternative, country... The sound delivered is very detailed & accurate. I can hear much better separation in all of the instruments & different voices on Hi Res tracks using just the Pono - and I am not altering the sound output with an external amp or equalizer, hearing tracks just as the artists intended them to be heard. Instead of every voice being compressed together, now I can better hear and ID the separate voices of a bands vocalists singing in the background. After about 20 hours of use, I can also confirm the comments of some other reviewers....you do benefit after breaking them in for about 10-12 hours and they will begin to sound even better. I bought the clear version SE425 with the clear stock cable, and I found the clear wire a bit stiffer than the black cables that came with the SE215...but two weeks of use later they are a bit more pliable. I appreciated the color coded dots at the coax connectors to identify red for R and blue for L The included hard shell zip case offers good protection for your IEMs plus some spare sleeves, an adapter 1/4"" plug and a cleaning tool. Think the dual balanced armature driver Shure SE425 IEM at $280-299 is the common-sense value sweet spot in the Shure SE series lineup...as adding that much desired 3rd balanced armature driver of the SE535 considerably jacks up the price another $150-200. I have no doubt I would love the SE535 as well, but the better price of the SE425 is much more reasonable.
I can highly recommend the Shure SE425!"
63,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I need to say that I'm a little bit dissapointed. SE425 is a new level of earphones for me since I was using SE215, clarity is a evident improvement, however I stil find the SE 215 to be more useful for me as they seem to handle better higher SPL. I'm a drummer and I was all exited about having my new SE425 earphones, but when I pluged them in my headphones amp I noticed that the low frequencies where not as full as the ones in the SE215. The 425 has more clarity than the 215, but the high frequencies tend to be more ""sensitive"" and to clip in a lower level, same for the low end freq. If you are decided to used them in low level volume, they are definettly good, however from mid and upper levels they didn't work for me. I'll now go and test them in another amp, however, using the exact same amp, I switched inmmediately from the 425 to the 215 when playing and noticed a real improvement with the 215 that I would never think of. As I said, I need to test them with different equipement, but I think that shouldn't be the ideal situation."
64,2.0 out of 5 stars,I'm a Shure fan. These are not a great fit.
65,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Initially I hated these. Then I turned them on and played a burn in playlist from Spotify for 10 hours and left them. After they have been burned in I can honestly say they are awesome. For comparison I find them to be much more satisfying across all music genres then my Westone W40’s. I have previously owned se215, 315s, Westone um pro 30’s and se 535 ltds. Honestly I like the soundstage better on these then the 535s and the umpros. Miles better then 315s. Great choice if you’ve got the cash"
66,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 425's after being disappointed with the 215's and returning them. The dedicated separate drivers seemed to be the difference; the 425 was in a different league. I highly recommend using the triple flange stoppers for the best noise isolation for commuting. Be sure to trim the nipple of the flange that fits over the nozzle so that the molded body of the headphone fits snugly once fully ""screwed"" into the ear canal. If you don't trim it, the body will hang outside the ear cartilage once screwed in - letting unnecessary ambient noise in. Trim it gradually and cautiously to get just the right combination of depth and fit.
Becoming skilled at the insertion of the flanges takes a bit of practice - but it is totally worth it. Lift up ear cartilage and screw the body in about 1/4 turn. Crying babies on the train are no match for the isolation of these wonderful earphones. The $300 are well worth it.
I matched these 425's with the Sony NWZ-A17 MP3 player...what a beautifully matched combination!
I'm a very happy musician who has access to most of my entire music collection for my commute!"
67,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these to this is a bit knee-jerk but so far I'm extremely happy with these headphones! I had the Shure E4c before and after 2-3 years use the cable started to fail. The new 4-series design has a replaceable cable for about $20, so that won't be a problem going forward. But I was worried about the sound quality of the SE425 the larger earpieces, and the rigid wire that wraps around the ear. Here's what I found:

The earbuds fit very nicely into my ear. Even though they are larger than the E4c the shape is contoured to the ear so they lie flatter. The rigid cable also helps keep them right in place.

The sound is even better! The 4-series is designed to be flat, meaning not overly bassy. Perception of sound ""quality"" depends heavily on the type of music and the user preference. I've tried some of my favs covering the spectrum - Beatles ""Come Together"", Jay-Z ""Hard Knock Life"", Trentemoller ""Moan"", Otis Redding ""Just One More Day"", and Broken Bells ""Holding On for Life"". You can hear the recording imperfections of the older Redding and Beatles tracks. Bass is perfect, punch but not TKO on Jay-Z and Trentemoller. In terms of bass vs. treble, I think the bass is just right but on Hard Knock Life the treble seems a bit too accentuated. Makes me wonder what Jay-Z and Co. were listening to in the studio, or what type of speakers they intended the track to be played on. Anyway, these baby's sound great IMO.

The cable! This was a major weakness on the E4c and has been significantly upgraded for the SE425. The cable is now thinner and more pliable, making it far less cumbersome that the previous model. Also, the 3.5mm jack is recessed so it works with the original iPhone (2G). I know, a bit old school but still, considerate for those of us stuck in 2007. BTW, they also improved the y-connection (lighter) and the slider to tighten the cable under your chin. Good job Shure engineers!

Color - I opted for the clear. Accidentally, actually. Anyway, I couldn't be happier! The cord is slivery and really cool looking, and I think the clear plastic on the earpieces makes them a little more subtle. Can't comment on the black ones.

As for the overall benefits of these vs. say an over-the-ear style... These are extremely small and portable. They also do a great job of blocking other sounds - basically earplugs. That can be unnerving if you're walking down the street with these in. It also means you can ""hear"" vibrations such as the cable rubbing on your zipper, your own footsteps, or if you're chewing food. Another plus is that they don't leak sound so you can crank them up and not bother the person sitting next to you.

Regarding comfort, I think they take a little getting used to. The black foam tips work really well for me, but my ears get ""tired"" after an hour or so. Tough call here since I think you need to try them for a while to know if it works for you, but to do that you need to buy them first...

Happy researching and I hope you find a pair you like as much I like my new SE425s! :D"
68,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these earbuds

I would describe these as very accurate. They don't emphasize the highs or lows...they give you a very accurate representation of the music you're listening to. If like the emphasized bass of many earbuds you will not like these. HOWEVER...if you listen to music that has actual low frequency content it will be heard just not over emphasized.

Like many earbuds, these benefit from a good seal. There is a good variety of included ear tips, take the time and find the one that gives you the best seal, it's worth the time and effort.

The build quality of these is very nice and It's awesome to have a replaceable cord...that's been the primary reason I've had to purchase new head phone...the cord always dies.

So far after one month of use, I have no complaints at all.

*** UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW ***

After about 3 months with these one of the earbuds broke.

The tip of the right earbud broke when inserting it into my ear. In looking at the broken piece it's a pretty fragile piece. I didn't see any issues like mine in scanning the reviews, so I was more than a little shocked when it happened.

Needless to say this changes my opinion of the product drastically. These are pretty expensive and now I'm looking at a new pair."
69,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Shure SE420’s stopped working last month. Not so much a catastrophe as a whimper, as the left ear bud volume got dimmer and dimmer I tried everything to fix them. Well, sadly, these guys went back to Shure. And it was not as traumatic as expected. I bought and reviewed these guys back in August 2007. I wore them almost daily. Long useful life. Digging out my backup Shure E3’s (slightly shrill high end, but still great compared to the preferred SE420), I packed up my SE420’s under Shure’s repair and/or replacement policy. I expected and allowed them to replace the SE420’s with the updated SE425 at a reduced cost vs. new. Service provided quick turnaround, along with emails along the way to show status. (Thanks Shure).

Upon receipt, so much was familiar. The plastic bubble box contained the earphones, a package with a variety of earplug styles and sizes, and an instruction manual. I removed the foam earplug installed on the earphone, struggling to not damage the underlying structure upon which it sits. Age and use broke one of these posts on a prior pair of earphones so I am sensitive to this potential weak spot. Under the removed earplug was the plastic post, undamaged, but also untested in regards to any “new” strength it may have gained over prior generations. Having tried a variety of earplugs in the past, I knew what I preferred for ease of use, good seal, and comfort for my own ear. Most users should be able to settle on a suitable plug for their own use.

The differences among the E3, SE420, and the SE425 is the configuration of the earphone sitting much closer to the surface of your ear and head, the removable and twistable connection post to the cable, the stiffer cable into the connection post allowing a harder but flexible loop over the back and top of the ear, and the way insertion occurs.

For many users of prior earbuds some of these issues may present difficulties. These SE425’s are similar to the more professional models that musicians wear sitting against and inside the folds of the ear. This means that there is only one way to wear them—over the top of the ear, with the cable wrapped around and “molded” to the back of the ear. The insertion can be confusing with no marking to indicate L(eft) or R(ight) on each piece, but it quickly becomes easier once you realize that the whole assembly twists providing a way to wrap and warp the whole thing into the proper position. I cannot say I like this better than prior designs, but I am getting used to it, and the way the earphone sits in your ear is very ergonomic and flat against your head. With wires and phones and buds almost flat against your head, someone could fall asleep in these with no problem. The stiffer upper cable is appreciated, as it helps set the position in your ear, helps hold the earphones in place, and also helps the user figure out which bud goes into what ear over repeated removals and reinsertions.

The durability of this new configuration will bear out with usage. On one hand the stiffer cord should mean less wear, but the twisting connection might not hold over time. There is no perceived static during listening and rotating your head that causes some twist in the connection—so far so good over a couple of weeks of listening.

As for sound, these SE425’s provide the expected well balanced sound I preferred in the SE420’s. Listening on both the computer using a Firefly decoder and an ipod with 320 kps MP3 files, all expectations were met. Bass is balanced and for earphones, strong enough to be noticeable but not as (obviously and potentially) ear shattering as one might experience from headphones or speakers. The SE425’s shine in the seamless transition from mid range to higher end frequencies. A rich and even warm middle makes vocals and the majority of instrumentation that falls into these frequencies very pleasant. The higher frequencies are not shrill or over done. A cymbal sounds like a cymbal not hiss.

Dependent on recording engineering, there is no muddiness in the sound for rock, symphonic, noisy independent rock, and electronic ambient music. Sound stage placement and sound field is wide and well within the parameters expected for this mode of listening. Over the past weeks of listening on drives to work, the sound isolation is very good. While these earphones do not have any active noise reduction, most users should be able to find a suitable fit to knock down a majority of the external noise, maybe even as this user has observed, making these earphones a potential replacement for active noise reduction that many prefer for air travel.

There is no doubt that if you are considering earphones you recognize that higher end ear phones can effectively compete with headphones (both less and more expensive), providing a balanced and great sound over many different music types, portability, ease of storage, along with a less visible alternative. The SE425, like its siblings, can provide most users a satisfying listening experience and come recommended for the price point."
70,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great iem's. The mid range frequencies are highlighted nicely. The highs and lows are pretty neutral imho. Making them perfect for musicians who are looking for honest interpretations of live performances. I'm a drummer and that's what I use them for. However if you are looking for just a great set of in ears that sweeten and hype the sound skip these and look into others. These are more honest than that but still sound crystal clear and quite nice still. Flat low end response, so if you like a lot of bass in your mix steer clear of these. They are comfortable and isolate sound very well."
71,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, before beginning, I have a few disclosures regarding this review: Even though I will focus my review on the sound I am not an audiophile. I would describe myself as an audio enthusiast more than audiophile. This review is based on music ripped to MP3 format, no lower than 256kbps (most of my music is on 320kbps). In addition, my music players are mainly my Samsung Ativ Book 9 (NP900X3E-K01US) and the mobile phone HTC One M8 (Google Play Edition, rooted, no EQ, BoomSound OFF!!!! and low power audio profile disabled)... Finally, I mainly listen to Rock/Heavy Metal, Jazz, and Latin music (SALSA) genres. Hopefully these details will give you a better perspective about my review:
I have used several earphones over my life. Among my favorites are: Altec Lansing UHP306 (loved these with passion!) and UHP326 (nice ones too), Sennheiser CX 300 II (sounded as ""V"" shaped curve), Shure SE215LTD (I still have these). After getting frustrated about getting my cables messed up with time and having to replace/buy new headphones I came along the Shure SE215LTD which offers a replaceable cable. For me, it was the deal maker and as soon I had the opportunity, I got them for a fair price. At first, compared to the Sennheiser CX 300 II, I did not like them that much. The CX 300 II are way brighter and louder than the Shure SE215LTD. At the moment I was still using my old Samsung Galaxy Nexus with an audio mod (Viper4Android if you're curious about it). After giving the SE215LTD a chance and tweaking the EQ on my Galaxy Nexus, I actually got a sweet sound out of them... and with time I started liking them more than Sennheiser's. They have a more mid-centric sound with a strong bass response but lacked a little bit of clarity (musical instrument resolution was somewhat absent). I upgraded my phone to the HTC One M8 and the sound got a lot better. The Shure SE215LTD came to a different level of sound. But still, they lacked crispness to my taste! Then, I decided to jump my price limit of less than $100 and get something different. I bought the Shure SE425-V and WOW!
Compared to other headphones, and specially the SE215LTD, the SE425 are very balanced. The highs these reproduce are great. About the low freq. response, I frankly do not understand some complains about low to no bass reproduction on other reviews. The bass is really tight and properly balanced. In fact, what I love about these headphones is precisely the bass. It is not exaggerated and does not distract you from other sounds! Everything is there and you can actually tell! The mids are awesome; vocals sound like somebody is singing in your ears! Guitars, drums, bass, vocals... everything is there as long as the mix (the music track) is properly done. Unfortunately, some mixes exaggerate some instruments more than others... These headphones will give you a more realistic sound, if the bass was not properly mixed in the tracks of the album (I am talking to you Metallica - ...And Justice for All) you will not hear it as clear as others (Bruce Dickinson - Accident of Birth). With these headphones you will be able to listen new sounds (more details) that you might have not listened before. I do not listen to HIP-HOP/RAP but these headphones make me like this genres; the bass is really tight and the highs sound absolutely awesome. The same is true for R&B/Soul. The music gets full of details but not overwhelming on any frequency!
Having said that, if you are a bass head you might not like these (perhaps the Shure SE215 may be a good fit..?!). Again, these headphones can be better described as neutral/flat. The better the quality of your audio source and the mix of the track, the better sound you'll get from these. With the 425 I do not have to rely on EQ’s anymore. Compared to other earphones I have had, I can say that the Shure 425 are far more superior in every aspect of audio. Quality wise, I cannot complain (replaceable cable, two years warranty, built strong enough to hold everyday usage, including gym!). The difficult part is the price… and frankly, they are worth every penny, especially for audiophile and enthusiasts (like me). However, if you do not want/cannot spend $300 on earphones, I would say there are plenty of great options under $100. I would say that the Sennheiser CX 300 II are a great option for their price (cheap and nice sound!). If you want a little bit more value for your money, the Shure SE215LTD (or the regular SE215) will give you a lot more (replaceable cable is a huge plus for me). Regarding the comfort, the SE425 are comfortable enough to wear them long hours (up to 3 hours) without problems; even when working out I do not have any problems. Even though the SE215LTD and the SE425 share similar design, I feel the latter is more comfortable.
On a side note, I had the opportunity to try for a couple of minutes another dual driver earphones, the Westone W20. Compared to the Shure425, the W20 are may be a little bit brighter. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to properly compare these two. I just wanted to mention it since my initial impressions were really positive; it might be wise to check these too if you are looking to break your wallet for earphones ;)
I will try to keep this review updated if I can get other earphones and compare them with these. If you have some specific questions I will be happy to answer them as soon as I can; I understand that buying new earphones can be really hard and difficult!"
72,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just a few things for the potential buyer.

I have used every Shure SE model from the 215s to the 535s (I haven't found a need for the 846s yet), so take my review only as a comparison to other similar level Shure models.

425's are nice. I use them every day for my daily routine. I keep a pair of 535s at home for use on my computer. I do not consider myself an audiophile, but I do appreciate good sound. That's what you'll get with Shure.

If you are new to higher-end in ear models, you might want to take a look at a step down from the SE425's to the SE315's. They have similar performance, although I do think the lows are quite clearer and the highs aren't as overpowering in the 425's. If you have the extra cash, take a leap and get the 425's. They are great for everyday use. You won't hear what's going on around you, so just make sure you are aware and don't get hit by a train. That's how powerful the isolation is on these models. You end up listening to your music much quieter, which could help preserver your hearing down the line.

Ok, let's do pros and cons of the SE425 (from my perspective):

Pros: Sound, durability, comfort, sound isolation

Cons: color (my preference), ease of first time use (it takes a few times to learn how to put them on), price (I'm reaching for this one, good value, and it depends on where you buy it from)

Other thoughts: Learning how to put them on isn't actually that hard, but it seems awkward at first. Find the left and right buds, squeeze the foam, and stick it in your ear so that the earpiece is inside your ear. The cord goes over and behind your ear, and the foam expands to seal your ear canal. If you don't get the seal right, you lose a huge amount of the performance of these buds. Then I run the cord down my back through my shirt and into my pocket. The buds have never fallen out, and the cord is protected so you can't get snagged and have them ripped out of your ear."
73,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth set of Shure buds over the decades and after 18 months of use, I remain well pleased. Unlike earlier designs, the cables seem to be good quality and haven't shorted out on their own. No static at the connections to the buds and I find the added swivel increases ear comfort and noise isolation. Reinforced cable ends fit comfortably behind my ears so I can jog without dislodging them. To my ears, the 500 series with triple drivers have even better sound, but only incrementally better so I wasn't willing to pay the extra $100.

As with all canal phones, you must find the size & shape of flanges to make a good seal to create the bass notes. Sound is very flat and pure with a nice good balance of highs, mids, and lows.

Like others, I cracked the plastic sound tube on one side the first day removing the shipping flanges that were fused to the material. From hindsight, it may be best to carefully slice off the rubber rather than twisting. This is one of the maddening design flaws that Shure is prone to keep repeating. But, their warranty service is excellent so this isn't a major concern. It would be nice if the cable ends were color coded as the molded ""R"" & ""L"" are hard to see.

For the price, it's disappointing that the phone control cables are not included. If they were, I'd rate these as 4.6 phones."
74,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE425 earbuds I am reviewing may be an older model. Mine are clear with a clear cable, and it has the easily-unplugged modular cable.

I have used several earbuds over the years. it's less that i'm fickle about the sound and more that i tend to damage or lose them. i have used Klipsch s4i, monster turbine, powerbeats (the wired version), bose, sennheiser ie4, etymotic hf5, and shure 200 earbuds, as well folding bose and sennheiser on-ear headphones.

Sound Quality: excellent, unless heavy bass suits your listening habits and unless you primarily use them for working out. Public Image Limited's ""Albatross,"" a bass-heavy tune from Metal Box, has very sharp, well-defined highs and lows. So does Charles Mingus's 'Haitian Fight Song"" the balance between horns, piano and bass is outstanding. in the bass-treble comparison, these are about neutral for me, equally weighted as opposed to leaning toward the high or low. The accuracy of these earbuds is better than pretty much anything else i have tried. there are better choices if you prefer a very strong bass response - the old Monster Turbines are outstanding for that, as are the Powerbeats. One cost of this kind of sound precision is that moving the cable around, if you're wearing earbuds and on the go, creates a bit of rustling noise. short of very actively working out, running for example, it's not that noticeable.

Build quality: extremely solid. the buds themselves are substantial, though they have a plastic housing. The clear cable is robust, so is the stereo plug. the cable has a bendable wire near the ear, no doubt made so you wear the cable over the ear. the cables can easily unplug from each earbud, a real plus if you tend to wreck your cabling. On the downside, wearing these earbuds while working out and sweating can create substantial interference if sweat invades the plug-in connection between the cable and the earbud. it's enough of an issue that i don't use these for long walks or runs.

fit: once you find the right ear tip, they fit really well. Shure provides these with a variety of earplugs, so most people should be able to find a solution that works. I prefer the triple-flange poly tips. getting these inserted into your ear canal and situated on your ear takes a little bit of work. But, once inserted, they feel very comfortable, keep most outside noise out, and don't jostle around because the earbud fits so well in the contour of my ear. i like the bendable wire for where the cable loops over my ear.

Cost: on the higher end of the kinds of earbuds most consumers will pay for, I think, at $299 retail. (I would never spend a thousand bucks on earbuds, but there are a number of them available for that and more....and i'll bet they sound awesome). I found mine used for testing purposes for well less than that. Worth it? absolutely. These are the earbuds I reach for on any work trip or in any situation where I want headphones and happen to be sitting around or walking around and want to listen to music. Basically, for any situation where i'm not working out."
75,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve owned a pair for a year and three times the stem which holds the foam tip has sheared off, each time without me noticing them undergoing any abnormal stress. I’ll pull them out of my pocket and it’s just gone. At this point I’m not willing to pay to fix them again. I no longer have any faith in this product. I’d be willing to take some share of the blame, except I have owned 3 different pairs of Shure SE215s (and their predecessor) over the last decade and have never had this issue. I went from loving Shure products to no longer trusting them. I don’t know if it’s an issue with design or material, but it’s really ridiculous."
76,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are by far the best earphones I've ever owned or worn. The sound reproduction is simply stunning. I was particularly impressed by the amazing depth and richness of the bass response. It's definitely a constant source of 'WOW' to hear such crystal clear, non-distorted thumping bass coming out of such a tiny little package! I have, like many other audiophiles I suppose, been under the misconception that, where bass sound reproduction is concerned at least, bigger is better. You know, that a15"" woofer just HAS to be better than a 12"" woofer, which in turn must be an order of magnitude better than a 10"" woofer, and an 8"" woofer, and so on. Well, these tiny little ear phones have certainly dispelled and shattered that notion for me! Shure has built these puppies with separate speakers and channels for bass and midrange/highs. How they managed to actually jam and cram 2 different speakers into such a tiny space is completely beyond me, but one listen to these earphones will absolutely blow you away, and you too will become a believer and most likely an evangelist. Expensive? Well, that depends... They are certainly more than your average $20-$30 sony earbuds that you can get at 711, for sure. But honestly, these earphones aren't even in the same league with those typical ' value' buds. They are totally pro quality, no compromise products that represent the state of the art. And you definitely CAN and WILL hear the difference, its obvious. So, great value for money, in my opinion. And extremely comfortable, in every way. I've worn them for 5-6 hours at a time on overseas flights with no pain or soreness whatsoever. And what's better yet, they're noise canceling, so they are perfect for plane flights and blocking out all of that annoying and loud jet noise, not to mention the screaming baby noise etc. I've worn these on flights with no music playing thru them just to sleep better, and they do the job beautifully. And so much better and less obtrusive than having to strap on those huge over-ear Bose headphones that you see people wearing and having to haul around with them... If you're an audiophile or just picky about hearing your music sound as good as it can be, I'd highly recommend these earphones."
77,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought mine at a local retailer that has a price match guarantee. That was over six months ago. I waited enough time for them to break-in properly, and also to make up my mind as I went back and forth on what I think about these ear buds. After all they are not inexpensive and similar sound can be had for much less. In the end, I give these Shure SE425 four stars. Here's why:

Fit - It is not easy to get the proper fit. Over the ear cords may not be for everyone and to get proper bass response, these need to be fit carefully and deeply into the ear. When they are properly in place they sound awesome. But when they slide even a bit out of the ear, the bass falls off fast and the balance becomes pretty bad. I've tried different rubber tips and still struggle with the fit but can get it right most of the time now.

Sound - I've read all the reviews here and it is easy for someone thinking about these to be confused. Some people state these are the best ear buds they've ever heard, others say they are horrible. My background is in music and my home audio system is very high-end. I can talk in terms of ""Bloom"" ""Micro-dynamics"" ""Sound-stage"" and ""Tonality"" as these are terms audiophiles often use to describe high-end systems. It took me a few hundred hours of use for the sound to settle in properly and during that period I questioned the sound quality. After six months of use I can now say these come fairly close to what a home high-end system can do....most of the time. I feel at times that there is a slight overemphasis of the mid-range which others have pointed out. I fixed that by using the Jazz EQ setting on my iPod Classic which raises the high and low end a bit over the mid-range. But I also feel that with proper fit, the tone quality is exceptional. Overall they are very neutral. For those who like things bass heavy, you may be disappointed. But if you are looking for true reproduction of the sound as it was originally recorded, these do great from rock to classical.

Quality - Here is where I can say you get what you pay for. Is it worth it to buy a $80 set of ear buds that will break in a year? That has happened to me all too often. From the quality of the replaceable cord, to the two-year warranty, it seems to me these can last several years. Thus the overall cost of ownership seems to make these a good value.

Should you buy? This is the bottom line. If you value the quality of the sound over ease of use and price, I would say with no hesitation that these are great ear buds. If you are concerned about the over-the-ear fit and also the price then you probably want to look somewhere else. Remember though, that these should last much longer than most of the sub $100 ear buds on the market today."
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having an active lifestyle and good ear for music is not necessarily a favorable combination when searching for in-ear headphones. Over the past several years, I've spent anywhere from $60-$200 on in ear headphones that never lasted me more than a few months. Furthermore, I found that either the bass was too heavy, the highs were too high, or you couldn't hear the lows. Basically, the sound was never balanced.

These headphones are extremely balanced. Those complaining about the lack of bass clearly didn't read the instructions. It's all about the fit. If you fit the headphones correctly, the bass is perfect, might even be much when listening to the more bass heavy... not to say that it overpowers in any way. These are the clearest, most well-balanced headphones out there. I've had the Monster Turbines, the Bowers and Wilkins, the Beats, and the Klipsich. I never got the bose ones because the cord was too delicate and would likely break after a short period of time.

Many of the headphones I listed about had problems with the cord anywhere from a week to 3 months into owning them. This is what happens when you use headphones for snowboarding, hiking, the gym, and other active hobbies. The major plus about the Shure's are that the cord is detachable and replaceable. Although this is the sturdiest cord I have ever come across, should there ever be any issues, all I would need to do is replace the cord, which saves me the $270 I spent on them.

The price is a bit hefty, but if you are a stickler about your music and an active listener, you will appreciate these. It's really annoying when I know there are certain elements of music I am not hearing or are overexagerated/understated because of faulty headphones. You will hear aspects of your favorite songs that you never knew existed with these. They are worth every penny.

One negative, they can be quite overwhelming at times. They are not your typical, light, in ear headphones. The sound is powerful and so is the presence of it in your ear. You will have to get used to them. The first time I had them in for about an hour and had to take them off because I was getting slightly dizzy."
79,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Frankly, I miss the low ends with this earphones and don't really enjoy listening to music with them. Also it isn't so comfortable for long periods of time - but I guess it depends on your ear shape/size. Luckily, I can use it at a different angle (see photo) which works much better for me and still seals quite well / sounds the same. Another issue is the cable. It is bulky and one would think they make them tougher - it doesn't. It constantly gets in the way and I had to replace one after 4-5 months (luckily through the warranty - which is a plus I guess. They responded quite fast). The second one showed signs of cracking after about the same period of time and eventually the plastic wrap started to come of in pieces. I liked the idea of being able to change the cable with a spare one - that's basically why I thought it is worth spending the money for a good pair of earphones. If you also think the same, check the price of the spare cable first. I used the ones with built-in iphone controller and they are surprisingly expensive. Anyway, it's still a decent set of headphones, if you have more money then sense."
80,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these primarily to use when playing guitar at church as an in-ear monitor. For this purpose, I couldn't be happier. These are a huge step up from the Westone UM1's I've used in the past. I also like the fact that the cable is replaceable as this is usually the first thing to fail. I'd rather spend around $40 to replace the cable instead of $300 to replace the set.

I will say that the sound with my iPod is very good. Great clarity in the mid-range and upper frequencies, but not as punchy in the bass as I would like. I've owned several sets of in-ear headphones and know the value of a proper fit in the ear canal (this is not the problem). I suspect that drivers in the Shure SE425s require a bit more power than my iPod can dish out.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with the SE 425s.

Update - Feb 24, 2012: After using these for a few weeks they have definitely opened up. The bass is much better when playing through my iPod/iPhone. I'm very happy with these!"
81,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure has definitely outdone themselves with this wonderful product. Never have I experienced more clarity in a pair of IEMs. For someone who listens to alternative rock, pop, and an assorted array of indie music, I say that few IEMs can do better. The amount of detail displayed is extraordinary. Vocals are crystal clear and forward, especially female vocals. However, the bass is lacking a bit in quantity, but they're by no means flat. It's still punchy enough to satisfy most listeners. No, these IEMs are not for bass-heads, but for those who want precision. If you're someone who prefer to have lows that accentuate exceptional mids and highs, these are the headphones for you. They're the quintessential headphone for the intimate listener."
82,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These in ears just don't sound good. Simply put, and coming from someone to whom I tried to sell them as well. I don't know if my pair was a dud, but the mids are recessed and the overall tone is just not appealing.
They isolate fine and work for drumming, but I wouldn't use them for studio monitoring or for just listening to music."
83,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned both the SE110 and SE425 earphones over the past 5 years and I can't say enough good things about them. The first time I put in the SE425s I heard things in my music that I never thought I could hear! Very rich and clear sound. Seriously, listen to The Dark Knight soundtrack on these and just feel a grin spread from ear to ear. :) They have held up very well to daily use in the office and during runs. I use the medium foam sleeves, which are extremely comfortable to use all day and block out ambient sound as advertised. Now if only Shure would include a sign to put up at my desk that I'm listening to music so people wouldn't walk up behind me and scare the crap out of me while I have them in..."
84,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Literally have failed on me 3 times since buying them less than a year ago. I'm a professional musician. The company supervisor, Antonio Torres, is insisting that I pay shipping on this item AGAIN to have it replaced. Despite my persistence, to him, it seemed par for the course for them to have failed so much. I am flabbergasted at the negligence of this company. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THESE. Don't get caught in the middle of a tour, show, festival with these absolute pieces of garbage."
85,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh wow!!! A little bit of me regrets buying these headphones, since now I will no longer be able to go back to any headphones under $200 or anything that doesn't offer the sound quality offered with the Shure SE425. As a long time Shure user (E2C, I2C+m, SE115+m and SE215), I'm well that Shure makes quality products, but have never bought anything over $125.00. So stepping up to the SE425, is actually a big jump and I was hesitate to believe that there would be that much of a difference. But since I'm a heavy business traveler and prefer noise isolating over noise canceling headphones, I decided to treat myself to a premium set of headphones and decided on the SE425. And now...WOW!!! I'm now hearing things in songs that I never heard using other headphones. Separation is the musical instruments and vocals that are so crisp and clear. What a great set of headphones...well worth the price if you're a music lover."
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,"just replaced a pair of (much-loved) westone earbuds. have had these for less than an hour (so no 'burn-in' yet), but, out of the box, they sound great. tight, deep bass (and not exaggerated), clean, clear, crisp. a little bright perhaps, but will see how it all sounds after i run them a while. seem to have more 'air' than the westones; nice.

well worth the investment, i needed earbuds for pro audio work (when i'm not in monitors), and am already happy with these...."
87,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought these earphones are a great bang for their buck. I found them for $225 and you couldn't ask for anything better. They hit the highs with perfect tone and have excellent isolation of the instruments. Being a drummer, the drums are usually faded in the background, but with the SE425's I can actually head every drum being hit, the different volumes and still pay attention to the other aspects of the song. 5/5 in my book. I would like to see how these stack up to the 535's, but for the cost you can't go wrong."
88,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't decide between the 315's and the 425's, mainly because I wasn't sure the 425s could actually be worth $100 more. The only difference between the two models are 1-sound quality, 2-adaptor and 3-carrying case. The case thing is easy, because who cares what case it is? The 425s have a hard case, the 315s have a soft case. The soft case is actually a little cooler, but the hard case is probably more useful in protecting the buds. I'm not one to use a case unless I'm traveling or such anyway. The 425s come with the adapter for standard headphone jacks. If you really need one you likely already have it, and since they only cost a couple of bucks to buy, I don't think that should count in the comparison. So that leaves us with sound quality. Ok, funny story: When I first tried out the 425s my husband came by and asked why I had that awful look on my face. I was so disappointed! They were tinny and made the music sound cold and dead. I took them out, very disappointed, and tried the 315s, which sounded a bit warmer. When I put the 425s back in a few minutes later I realized that if my fingers were on them, they sounded amazing. Well, a bit of fiddling with the different sleeves and I found a set that fit my ear well. These aren't slam-in-your-ear-and-go earbuds. It takes a moment to get them on and adjusted (tho I can see that getting easier with practice) but when you do - WOW. Here is my best tip: Get them in the way you think they are supposed to go, then push on the housing and see if they sound better. If so, you're not getting a good fit and you should try a different sleeve or re-seat them. The foam versions of the sleeves can be rather hard to get on and off, but it is worth it.

So, which ones did I keep? The 425s. Yeah, there really is $100 difference in the sound. Now, everyone is different, and I'm using these as iPod/computer earbuds, not for reference or monitoring, but for me the detail produced by the 425s is excellent.

I've been through a LOT of headphones and earbuds over the years. I have returned more pairs of earbuds than I care to admit in the $100 range, too. These 425s are better than any earbuds I've ever tried (tho NOT more comfortable, at least not yet). The 425s are actually better than my very expensive Sony over-ear, full size headphones, too.

I like the cord design. I was concerned about the detachable cord, given some of the other reviews here, but I hear no static so maybe they've fixed that issue.

And as for sound-isolation. I don't feel like I'm deaf to the world with them on, but I certainly can't hear a lot of external noise. For example, I'm sitting in a room 10 feet from a TV on which there is a loud football game playing. With the music on I cannot hear the game at all. If I turn the music off, I can hear the TV. It's pretty much the same effect as having a pair of the sort of foam earplugs ya wear to a concert on, so, ya know, set your phone to vibrate.

I'm very satisfied with them Day 1 (this is all not having burned them in yet). The 315s are on their way back."
89,2.0 out of 5 stars,"For the very steep price tag plus the track record and history of a known brand, the sound on these earphones was horrendous. My other $20 set was literally way better. Then I tried the Apple ones and some others and there was no comparison. I don't know what Shure messed up with these but the sound wasn't clear, virtually no bass."
90,2.0 out of 5 stars,"BUYER BEWARE
The sound quality is good but my eartip broke while in its case very easily, and when I contacted customer service, they suggested a minimum $70 per ear charge for this. Pls see photo and decide for yourself."
91,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am currently using these earphones installed custom silicon sleeves custom made by Sensaphonics. For the record the earphones come with lots of tips (much better than my IE7 which are horrible). To me, these things are too bassy. Other words to describe the sound is rich, or colored. They don't have a flat studio monitor sound that I was expecting. Also the treble leaves much to be desired. Either the low end obscures the treble, or the treble is just not strong enough. For example the chicks and crashes of a cymbal are not reproduced very well. I have reduced the bass by using the equalizer in my ipod and it made the sound more acceptable to me.

The cord that comes with it are top notch. The cables are braided and extra long. I like how it has the ear wrap around built into the cord (unlike my IE7). The one strange thing is the cables can be disconnected at the earpiece and because of this when they aren't installed the ear piece is free to spin around so it takes a while to figure out the position you need to put them in before sticking them in you ear. This issue is probably more pronounced since I am using the custom sleeves, but I am getting better at installing them over time. I think I prefer the sound of my IE7 over these, but since the IE7 have such a poor fit I will probably be using the 425 more often."
92,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good!!!
93,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have not heard any of the higher end Shure models I can promise you are missing out. In the age of ""beats"" and emphasis on bass heavy `phones, Shure remains an underrated secret formally only known by the pros. In fact, long ago shure sold only to the professional market, but once portable listening devices started to become prominent the company realized that there was a growing number of people that bought their sets and took them outside the studio. Keep in mind that no product bearing the Shure name is going to do anything besides try to reproduce your music as faithfully as possible (read: no more bass than the guy who mastered the music heard)

There is a great review on here that describes many of the characteristics of these models that incorporate the ""MicroDriver"" technology. To sum what was said there,

Obviously these have the ability to make all the noise in the 20-20k range that you can hear, while this is important and not all earphones can do it, it is a given that these can. That is just boring specs, and doesn't mean much at this price point unless you just like graphs.

There are a few things you will notice between a pair of $100 in ear ""beats"" or equivalent. You will find that your music has a sort of ""space"" in it. That is to say that different sounds almost sound like they have their own earphone, as if there is one tiny speaker for each sound inside the bud. This is alone a spectacular feat and is extremely difficult to achieve in sound reproduction because of the mass of the speaker itself and the fact that one or a few speaker elements have to make the sounds at the same time where as live there are different things making their own noise completely independent of each other. This is a unique phenomenon that most people will never hear due to the expense but it is the single most important thing to make music sound real.

Also, the signature Shure sound is such that no one sound overpowers another, which is another difficult trick. I have not heard a sound reproduction device of any kind or at any cost that does it better than the Shure SE 530. 99% of the earphones on the market lie about what they are capable of, and by that I mean they are bass heavy to make them sound like they have good low frequency characteristics but this causes an unclear sound and an overpowering feeling that drowns out detail in your music. This is the gimmick that Bose made famous in the past 15 years.

Finally, and most importantly is the most difficult trick of them all. It is very difficult to make a speaker that can move fast enough to give you a dynamic and realistic high definition sound. For example, a note plucked on a bass will first incorporate a transient pluck sound which momentarily accompanies the actual noise of the string vibrating. This is very difficult for a speaker because it must first deliver the first noise but quickly and transparently stop making that noise while still making the actual note as the instrument does. This is also very well demonstrated by a piano. Try it out on what you're listening to music on, and if it's not a Shure earphone that starts with 4 or 5 then these can do it better.

On those three points, the Shure SE 530 may just be the best sounding thing you have ever heard next to a live performance, and the 425 is a close second with a strong family resemblance. The difference is, quite simply, everything the 425s do so well the 530s do just a bit better. I have not yet heard the 535 model but some that have claim it has lost the balanced sound of the 530 and now the 425 is the best in the lineup."
94,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Obtained these as a replacement for my beloved e3c's. Sound quality is overall very good. Very clear mid's and high's. The bass is a bit thin compared to the e3c. Build quality is excellent. I love the idea of a detachable cord, which would make replacement a snap. I am a bit surprised a volume control is not included in 2014, and I take issue with the $50 cost of a replacement cord to add this functionality.

I would rate this 3.5 stars if I could, but because it's SHURE, I'm rounding up."
95,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Have used Shure earbuds for years. My previous pair of scl4's broke and I sent them back to Shure, who offered me a huge discount to get this model, so I did so. Well, the 425 has the advantage of great sound, but it takes a LONG time to put them in place each and every time I use them. It is a real pain to do so, since it becomes a project instead of 'plug in and play'. Given that I've used earbuds for a decade or so, I am having a hard time getting used to how long it takes to orient these suckers.... Also, the best ""seal"" for me is with the triple flange, but that provides the worst sound isolation. Nonetheless, the sound quality (not the isolation) is terrific. I also like that the buds don't stick out past my ear, so I can put my head sideways on a pillow and listen without feeling pressure from the earbud. So bottom line: some real pluses, but also some real minuses... a bit disappointing b/c Shure usually has only positives, imo."
96,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been blessed (or cursed) with ears that detect subtle differences in audio quality, so I have always considered the higher-end Shure Earphones to be the cream of the crop, vs. Sennheiser and other ""solid"" providers. My beef with Shure earphones has been over durability, as I have replaced three pair due to frayed connectors. Hopefully the newer ""modular"" style from Shure will be more durable and at least will be less expensive to repair (all of the older SE's were one piece construction).

I own an older pair of E4's, a pair of 535's, and recently purchased the SE 425-V. I use the E4's for working out/running and the 535's for travel and personal listening. I also have a set of Grado PS1000 Professional Headphones for sound editing and mixing. (Shure also sells headphones now - but they are garbage. It's simply a rebranded headphone stamped with the Shure name and sold at a price point to complete with the even trashier Bose headphone line. It's sad to see Shure tarnishing its rich pro-audio history by trying to be a ""me too"" in the headphone market).

I've performed a side by side comparison of the old E4's, the SE 535's, and the new SE-425-V. Using the same equipment and file formats (AU-PCM, FLAC, & MP3). Performance of all 3 was fairly relative across the various formats. (AU-PCM provides the truest reproduction). The SE-425-V is inferior to the old E4's IMO. Highs are a bit grainy at low volumes and turn grungy at louder volumes. In the mids (btw 2-6kHz), the SE425 sound is hollow. They perform a bit better in the low ranges with a warm and sturdy sound, but still sounds a bit thicker at lower volumes than the E4's.

My order of preference are the 535's (although I still favor the old E5's), the E4's, and lastly the SE-425V. The story seems to be that Shure is addressing the durability issue, but I am beginning to wonder if the company is lowering its standards in the development and production of micro drivers in the earphones. The newer versions may test out technically sound, but the test is in the perception of the human ear.

As a long-time user of Shure pro-audio equipment, I have to say I am disappointed in the direction of the earphone line, and in the future will open up my ears to other options out there. The SE425-V is solid, but not at the Shure price point."
97,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these as a replacement for some SCL4's that were broken. A few things I noticed right away: the cable and the earphones feel really solid. I don't see this falling apart anytime soon. It seems like most of the price went into the construction. I prefer the white triple flange sleeves so immediately put those on and as usual, got a great comfortable fit. The design of these earphones keeps them from sticking out too far which I like and I felt like these would stay in my ears until I wanted to remove them rather than them falling out as I've experienced with other brands of earphones. However, my gripe with these is the sound. The midrange is just too far forward. It's not that these are incapable of producing clear highs or solid tight lows, it's just that the midrange seems to overpower everything else to the point that they can end up sounding nasal. I tried a few songs and then switched these out for my ultimate ears triple fi 10's and I found that they are the exact opposite of each other. I think the fit on the UE's is terrible which is why I got these but the sound is clear and powerful while the midrange honk on the 425's makes me wonder how these can cost as much as they do. If I could only have one set of earphones, it would not be these."
98,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all the sound quality is no better than any standard headphones. I do not mean chinese quality random brands but let's say a 3200 philips (which is around 15 $) give the same sound with Shure SE 425. Maybe it gives better sound when you connect it to a speaker or an amplifier but with Iphone, the sound quality of Shure is limited.

Secondly - and more importantly - trying to put these on your ears is a s*** experience and yes each time it is like that. You need to spend 15 minutes shaping the cables for your ear. Sticking the headphones down to your ear is like making a surgical operation. It is not easy to use these headphones. Shaping the cables, putting them out and putting them properly back in is a certain hassle. After you put them on you pray that you will not see on the street someone you know so that you wont need to get them off again. If you want to have blood polyps in your ass or if you have an anger management problem then Shure 425 is the product you are looking for. It takes ages for a proper sound.

If you like big headphones try DNA Monster - fantastic sound. If you want something smaller try Logitech which is around the same price. BUT Shure 425 for an iphone is not a good headphone. The sound is standard and the usability is perfectly crap."
99,2.0 out of 5 stars,"TL/DR: For trust fund hippies only. Returning these because of the awkward fitting process due to the curved wire that's require to curve around your ear for proper fit each and every time, blindly. I just wanted simple but high quality ear phones. I'm not in an indie rock band as their website would like me to be... When I HAVE to look in a mirror just to fit these silly ear phones to fit right, I know I've made a poor purchase decision and have to return these asap. The real issue is that the pliable wire that is supposed to curve around your outer ear swivels during removal and proper storage between use. So it's near impossible for me to easily insert these at the next use without looking in a mirror since the wire curve angle and positioning has since changed after carefully loosely winding them in their handy storage case. For man-bun drummers, only I suppose. I'll keep searching for something that works easily and simply for me. Other than that, these are of high quality throughout..not enough resonant bass response for my taste, too. And yes, I do listen to college radio rock using an iPhone 6s. I just can't deal with mounting these in under 2 mins each time, or without a mirror to visualize proper fit.

The se215 feels more relaxed (nice bass) and efficient to play music while the se425 puts forward the mids and makes music kind of acid. The last Metronomy album that has an analog feeling seems stiff through this headphone. On the other side, those who like an analytic earing may like it on orchestral pieces where it will deliver more details. Not for me i am afraid.. I will stick to its cheaper se 215 brother.

105,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Used to own Shure SCL4s. They were amazing, but the wire shredded up by the earbud after a few years and they stopped working. Recently bought these new SE 425s because of the removable/durable wire and it seemed like they would be a good, if not better, follow-up to the SCL4s. After giving them a week, I returned the 425s because they crackled when I moved my head (due to detachable wire) and because the new/bigger earbud style made the music seem a little distant (I tried every earbud size). Went back a generation and ordered the SE 420s and they are amazing. I think it has less to do with the quality of the earphones and more to do with the fact that with the SE 425s, you can't press the buds into your ear as far as the old style (like the SE 420 and SCL4s). I commend Shure for adding the cool new detachable wire (even though it crackles) and trying to advance the earbud fit, but for me, the SE 420 sound is far superior to the newer SE 425s, not to mention way cheaper at $199.

QUICK AND DIRTY: Seems to me Shure focused more on adding new features and forgot to make sure the sound finds its way through all of it. Even though they are the older model, I HIGHLY recommend going for the SE 420 over the these SE 425s due to the sound quality. Plus, you'll end up with an extra $100 because of Amazon's drastic markdown on the 420s."

They are much more comfortable in your ear compared to the Philips and feel much more durable. Also, should your earbuds ever break or malfunction, there is a 2 year warranty. These are quality earbuds that will last a long time and make your audio experience more enjoyable. I happy to use them, but if I had to do it again, I would probably stick with the Philips SHS8100 and save the money."
116,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got my Shure SE425's today and I was very excited to get them. After doing a bit a research, I had selected the 425's for the sound quality and nose isolation. The excitement came to a quick end as I am already sending them in for replacement. The first time I tried to change the foam sleeve to a different size the nozzle/tube that the sleeve fits on broke. $300 earphones lasted a total of 10 minutes. The whole plastic casing appears to be very cheap and the tubes that hold the foam or plastic inserts are small and very thin. After looking at the construction I am not sure that they wouldn't break if you put them into your pocket. Not the quality I expect for $300. Very disappointed in the product."
117,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this product and the left ear piece didn't work. For the money i spent on these earphones i wanted a quality piece of equipment. Unfortunately, it doesn't work!!! I have contacted the sellers and hopefully they can fix this issue or return my money!! It's so frustrating as consumers to spend a lot of money and receive crap!! Right now i guess i will have to use the crappy ear phones that came with my iPod!! $300 wasted!!"
118,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good response, clear mids and well balanced bass. Plenty of earbuds for just about anybody.

119,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got new shure 425v's today and when I went to replace the sleaves, one of the plastic tubes that hold them just broke off.Just like that. $300 earphones ...So I don't know what they sound like ,don't know even if I would whant an other pair anymore :(.Very upsetting ........ Oh I forgot to add: I am a jeweler by trade and I looked how the Shure 425's are made under the microscope,the plastic tubes I am talking about are so thin and so easy to brake that got me thinking that this is just a metter of time when this was going to happen.In two years when whe warranty runs out you will buy a NEW pair becose I'm sure they sound good and you will not whant to step dawn to a cheaper brand.( Shure don't whant you to have the same pair forever )"
120,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried a number of different in-ear earphones and have been disappointed by all of them in the past. I have a difficult ear to match, big ears but a tiny ear canal. I was reluctant to spend this much money on earphones as I rarely spend this much money to achieve audiophile quality. So after going through most of the sleeve options in the fit kit I found one that, while not perfectly comfortable, provides a great sound balance.

What is particularly enjoyable is the clear sound definition and flat frequency response. Yes, I judge these to accurately reproduce source material as the artists intended. I have been able to hear things that I have never heard before in musical sources. Critics will claim that it lacks bass response, but that is most likely in comparison to earphones/headphones with substantial bass enhancement. Those products actually give me headaches and I appreciate a flatter bass response. In fact the clarity of the response and sound isolation actually allows me to turn the volume down substantially with as much or more listening enjoyment, protecting my longer-term listening pleasure."
121,5.0 out of 5 stars,I play drums and use this as my in-ear monitor - they work wonderful. The sound is clear without be so loud as to hurt my ears. They sound great!
122,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I REALLY wanted to like these but I couldn't find a way to wear them that they didn't hurt, and have them still isolate surrounding sound. I tried all the different ear tips, I even watched a video on inserting these correctly, but nothing worked. The 'tree' tips worked the best as far as quieting the surrounding noise, but they hurt terribly after 5 minutes. Maybe I have odd shaped or sensitive ears, but there was no way these were going to work.

I'm hoping wearing the combination of the Bose CQ35 and foam earplugs works better. I suffer from Misophonia so I'm desperate to quiet the noise in my open office."
123,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are just what everyone else says about them, Super accurate, Super isolating, and very comfortable. Unfortunately they lacked bass for my taste. I used to have some 200 series, and they had more thump. You can coax bass out of these 425s, but you have to play with the eq. In the end I returned them and bought some 535s for about $70 more (look around). I just received the 535s about an hour ago, and they are every bit as clear (read amazing) as the 425, but they can get slightly louder, and they aren't missing any bass. I am now super happy."
124,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of Shure headphones. The previous pair was the SE215, which were also great.

Part of my job involves a lot of thinking and planning, often alone, so I plug these babies into my ears for hours at a time. I've never had issues with comfort, and the sound quality is the best I've experienced thus far -- not surprising since these are the best quality headphones I've ever purchased."
125,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these at work to block out the low drone of people's lives slowly wasting away and when I'm behind my drum kit beating the hell out of various cymbals and skins. These provide excellent isolation. I find I'm not having to turn up the music or mix to monitor so loud to overcome the volume of the acoustic drums in my fairly small room. Quite a bit better than my over-the-ear Vic Firth sound isolation phones. Plus these stay put and don't get all sweaty like the over the ears.That is really why I got these.
But I also really enjoy the fairly flat response and accurate music reproduction. Easily the best set of headphones I've ever owned sound-wise. All of my previous in-ear headphones had cable failures so I'm glad that these are replaceable. These also fit really well and stay put because of the moldable over the ear cable part.
Hopefully this will be the last pair of headphones I need to buy for many years to come and I expect that will be the case."
126,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently purchased these to replace previous generation that I lost at DFW. I endure many long haul flights every year. I utilize the sound isolation ear buds to eliminate airplane noise and produce incredible sound detail. The new design fits inside the bowl of the ear, instead of sticking out. Thus, it is much more comfortable when laying down and sleeping on your side. I like the replaceable cords ( though has never been a problem for me with Shure). I do not like the stiff wire near the ear, but understand its function...

Bottom line why I buy these...the sound is incredible. The noise isolation and sound quality really leaves you alone with the music."
127,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pair of headphones. You need to take them apart after vigorous exercise, otherwise parts will corode."
128,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound, may deliver the BEST sound of all my earbuds.
the only downside is its short life span,
after 18 months the sound fades in and out on the left and right channel.
the issue is with the connection between the detachable cable and earbud piece.
seems like the connection port deteriorates after sweat sipping into the connection,
regular cleaning of the connection port helps but does not deliver a sustainable fix."
129,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave these headphones 4 stars because they really do sound great, and for the price, they better. The drawback to me was that the words ""left"" and ""right"" are so small, you can barely read them so it is hard to figure out which ear is which. They can also be a bit tough to get wrapped around your ear. This has made me, on more than one occasion, opt for an older pair of in-ear headphones simply because I didn't want to deal with dealing with these. However, they do sound great. The bass response is really terrific and overall these are very balanced and superior sounding headphones. They make listening to music on an iPod or your iPhone really enjoyable. The foam ends are also really good and help you find a snug fit. I would recommend these headphones, but just know, they can also be a bit frustrating when you are trying to put them on."
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing In-ear monitors and definitely the most bang for the buck!
131,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not my favorites I have used. Fo No them to be harsh and if you are playing 4 sets a night 6 nights a week it's not ideal for your ears to hurt even after turning the volume down
132,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to put in my ears. Takes a lot of work for ear buds. Kind'a regretting the purchase now that I've been using it awhile. I find myself using an older pair just because they are easier to use .The sound quality is very good.
133,2.0 out of 5 stars,"There is minimal low end on these in ear monitors. I don't listen to rap or electronic music, so I have to adjust the eq to extreme settings to get some punch out of bass drums or other low end warmth. Doing so makes the music sound muddy. Also, I used these once for a short run and they crapped out on me. Galaxy and iPhone headphones still work after a few thousand miles. I had previously used M-audio in ear monitors for about 7 years. They covered the majority of my workouts and commutes and never skipped a beat until my toddler got ahold of them. I can't make any recommendations, but I'd try before I buy these."
134,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned over 30 pairs of IEM's and earphones (up to the $1500 AKG K3003I), and I can honestly say that the previous generation shures (i.e. the SE420) are better than the current generation shures (i.e. the SE425).

In my opinion, Shure cheaped out on their new models, and made a worse driver in their SE425 (replacement of the SE420) to save money. Moreover, a lot of people, not just me, on headphone forums agree that the SE420 (and the previous generation of shures, e.g. SE420, SE530) have a much more comfortable fit and seals better, which translates into better sound quality. The new version (SE425) doesn't go as much into your ear, and it doesn't fit at all with a lot of people...

Honestly, just because of the fit issues, the SE420 sounds much better than the SE425. It's kinda like windows vista when it first launched. The previous generation is better. Period."
135,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Difficult to place on the ear and uncomfortable to wear. Bass was was a real let-down.
Good quality construction.
Should have gone for Sony or some other brand for the high price."
136,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The connectors to the individual earbuds are junk! First it starts out with a little bit of static when you move your head,then the sound fully cuts in and out, and then nothing... no sound.. nada! Consider yourself lucky if they last a month. I cannot believe these made it through any sort of product testing. I loved my previous Sures but these are useless junk and customer services is non existent, I feel ripped off. Never again will I buy a Sure product!"
137,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I agree with others -- these have virtually no base at all. I've tried various buds to no avail.
I suspect they need to be jammed into the ear so tightly that's its uncomfortable/painful. It seems that the tighter they are jammed into the ear, the better is the base. But to have reasonable base for my ears, is impossible with these. I have a couple of top quality on-ear headphones and compared to those, these sound cheap and nasty.
Also, the cable running over the ear is cumbersome.
For the price I cannot recommend them."
138,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They're disappointing in that they sound the same as my first pair of single drivers ten years ago, and are only 20hz-19Khz. I've progressed further into audio, and my tube amplifier produces 5hz-65Khz, and my pre-amp is 10Hz-100Khz. I've also used an Onkyo DAC-HA200 with them which helps, but I wouldn't purchase either again. High Resolution ear cans, in 2017, can be had for the same and much less. FLAC files are becoming popular (sorry Anton Newcom for taking so long) with the public, and audio can sound amazing. Again, these SE-425 are limited to <CD quality. Also,, I can't seem to keep them around my ears like I could with the softer cabled versions."
139,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are an absolute waste of money. If you're looking for earphones with decent sound quality, look elsewhere."
140,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these things. Totally helped with sound fatigue. One of the best purchases I've made. They have a mid-rangy tone which is great for guitarist. The only way I would improve these is to upgrade to the 3 drive model but that's a lot more $$$$$
141,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was on the verge of returning these and going back to my old SE215s. The bass response was terrible on the iPhone and even my FiiO X5 portable DAC. I was convinced they were defective. But then I discovered the high gain output setting on the X5. Made all the difference in the world. The SE425s require more power. Would be nice if that bit of information had been available before buying. Even with the extra power, the bass response is not overwhelming and/or distorted. It's clear and crisp with enough ""punch"" for any kind of music. At least for my taste. If you want big, boomy bass then these are not for you. I still think the SE215s are great headphones at a good price. But for me the extra cost of the SE425s is worth the money.

I'm not in the habit of writing product reviews but I noticesd several reviews complaining about the poor bass response of the SE425's and thought this review might be useful."
142,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned more than a few Shure in ear phones. I had a pair of E2Cs back in the day that gave me a whole new idea of audio. I upgraded to the E3C later on. When the SE models came out, I bought the SE215. In fact, I bought them three times because one pair got lost, another pair broke, and a third pair was replaced by Shure under warranty. I loved my SE215s until they were accidentally washed in my shorts. You see, I work out with these headphones as well as listen to them casually. And they've always been good for that.
Cut to Christmas this past year and my mom wanted earphones for casual listening and work outs. I bought her the SE315s and was myself satisfied with the better low range sound it had. I hadn't planned on upgrading my SE215s until they were washed and even then, I'm sure they still work (still drying out), but I love my audio and had a few gift cards to burn. Now the SE425s are in my ears and let me say, they are extraordinary.
I've listened to top end ear phones of the past. The E5c was a particular favorite of mine. And I'm sure the SE535 and SE846 are incredible listening experiences, but I am blown away. Certain songs don't work well with in ear phones. A lot of dance tunes get mixed with stereo sounds mixed poorly....you'll hear more on the right then on the left and think you're going deaf. The SE425 doesn't do much to improve on this flaw, but the sound is SO crisp that you can tell exactly what you're listening to. All my listening is done through Tidal with HiFi lossless audio for the purest streaming experience. The pure monitor sound is a great listening experience to me. Listening to Sia's ""Cheap Thrills"" on decent speakers is pretty good. On my SE215s, you can hear more of the layering and what makes the song so enjoyable. On the SE425, it's another level. It didn't change how I heard the song, but the details were more crisp. It sounded like the music was being made for my ears. Very clear, very crisp, and I imagine very accurate to what the producer wanted listeners to hear. On to a song I didn't used to like but have since been able to appreciate more, Justin Timerblake's ""Suit & Tie"". There's a lot going on in this song. I imagine the SE846 would really shine with this song because you have a lot of range happening all at the same time. In my SE215s, it gets washed out a little bit. On speakers, it's just noise. But for the first time since it came out, listening on the SE425, I can hear so much more of the song. Justin's high end range is really crisp and the layers of the background that were washed out on my augioengine speakers now twinkle in my ears. I still can't tell what exactly is happening, sounds like chimes layered on a synthesizer and a few others but the important part is I can hear what it's supposed to sound like. Having the dual drivers lets Justin do his thing on the top range and JayZ master his more tenor timbre. There's a part of me that still misses the extra space that a real subwoofer would give you, and at $300 you can definitely find a relatively decent pair of circumaurol headphones that would give you the bass...but the earphones are not starved for bass. It's there, it's just not the most prominent feature. One last note, the SE425s seem to be much louder at lower settings than my SE215s. I used to listen at 80% volume or more...but with my LG V20 with the DAC turned on, 50% volume was pure bliss.
For the average consumer, if you're working out or running or just need a pair of headphones that will drown out the airplane or train noise, the SE215s are ideal. A hundred dollars gives you sound isolation second to none and an audio experience that I would call enlightening if you've never tried a pair of Shure earphones before. I find wearing the foam inserts for a few hours starts to strain my ears a bit...but I mean listening to music for 2 hours would strain your ears no matter what you're using. I've fallen asleep with them on, so they are comfortable enough. If, however, you decide you want a richer sound with more bass and crisper highs and balanced mids, the SE425 experience is sublime. I have no regrets spending the money on these. It was well worth the upgrade. Next on my list is the SE846...if a grand ever falls in my lap."
143,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like them. Great sound, very natural, well balanced. Not too much bass. They provide great detail in the music. I compared against the Sennheiser iE80 (I love Sennheiser) but these seemed like a better deal and so far, so good.

Only issue I had was getting the sleeves off, which were stuck on the post that the sleeve sites on. I ended up breaking the post right off on the first set I got. Fortunately, Amazon made returning it so easy and got me a replacement 3 days later. I did contact Shure and they sent this link http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3788/track/AvNu_QquDv8S~brxGkQe~yL3NvkqaS75Mv~M~zj~PP8F

144,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave this one star less because I am a long time Shure user and I was slightly disappointed in the frequency response range. Only reason I say this is because I had just used the 315 series for almost 3 years and enjoyed the rather round sound on these headphones which included decent but not perfect bass. The 425 series seems to learn towards brighter highs and leaves the lows behind, which surprised me. I figured a more expensive set would have a slightly better rounding of sound than the less expensive version (while obviously leaving room for improvement for the even more expensive models). As it stands I have been able to get better bass response from these units using some creative tuning through both software equalizer on the source unit as well as a headphone amp (FiiO) bass boost settings. I expect to get plenty of use out these, sound great with tripple flange tips. If I could re-buy I would spend the extra $$ for the next version up. I paid retail price and have not been solicited to write this review. I will continue to be a Shure user for a long, long time."
145,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For those looking for an upgrade from the Shure SE215s, these WILL have a lot more detail and sound nicer, but personally, I was disappointed with the amount of bass (especially how much punch it didn't have) and the SE215s for sure had more bass. I ended up picking up some SE535s used on eBay for slightly cheaper and they are very satisfying. I'm sure they have their place, but there was a big lac of bass in my opinion."
146,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Here's my review after two months of using the SE425.

First of all, I'm not an audiophile but I do appreciate good quality sound. My previous earphone was the Audio-Technica ATH ANC3BK NoiseCancel Earphone BK! but it was bulky because of the battery compartment. I also have a Shure SE530 Sound Isolating Earphones which I use mostly at home because the wiring looks fragile.

Anyway, my Audio Technica set broke (wiring problem) and I decided to get the new SE425.

Sound quality -
I can't really differentiate between this and my SE530. In that respect, I'm really happy about this purchase. I listen mostly to instrumental music, soundtracks and orchestra, and the clarity is amazing. I also listen to podcasts and the voice quality is great as well.

Sound Isolation -
The foam buds are fantastic at blocking out noise provided if you fit them properly in the ear. On the train, you can see people talking, but you won't hear anything coming out from their mouths. The only noise comes from the vibration of the train. Sometimes, when not listening to music, I put it on just to block out noise.

Be careful when crossing the streets with the earphone on. You won't be able hear the traffic coming.

Detachable cable -
The cable detachable now and the bud swivels freely from it, just like a door knob. The cable looks thicker, and upon looking closely, you can see the additional Kevlar wiring intertwining cable, making it look really durable. The cable near the bud has additional coating which makes the cable retain the shape (after going round the ear). Let's just say that the cable won't be subject to wear and tear anytime soon. The cable is also quite long.

Fit -
The bud has a more block-like design, compared to the SE530 which is rounder. I think the bud is designed to fit in the ear with cavity around it holding it in place. My ear is a bit small so if it doesn't fit well, the bud will come out of the cavity (but with the foam still in the earhole). How well it fits will affect the sound isolation.

It takes some time to get used to the over-the-ear way it's meant to be worn. It is better to wear it that way because it minimizes the cable shaking in front of the chest.

Other stuff -
It comes with a casing for keeping the cable which I thought is very useful.

Conclusion -
I can't differentiate the sound quality between this and the pricier SE530 (possibly the SE535 as well). Having said that, I ""saved"" some money from not buying that. The SE425 is still expensive but it's worth it because I know I'll be using it for a long time.

My rating is 4.5 out of 5 stars."
147,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to own the Shure E3s, but accidentally left them on a plane after a trip. :-(

I was quickly looking to replace them, as I am *always* using my headphones. On the subway, bus, at home, flights... everywhere!

The SE425s looked like the approximate equivalents of what I owned, so that's what I ended up buying.

In comparison:
- they sound great. I normally listen either from my laptop direct out or from my phone. If I'm using my phone, I have a graphic EQ preset to balance out the poor driving power of my phone's headphone-out.
- they fit a little less well. These use a foam earpiece instead of the tri-flange I was used to on the E3, and it took some time to get used to. After a year of use, I recognize that the seal tends to be better once you achieve it, but it's harder to achieve.
- they stay in put while walking/moving around. I had problems with my E3s coming out.

If you liked previous models of Shure in-ears, you'll probably like these."
148,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very expensive earphones by most people standards. But SE425s are the best I've owned. The sound isolation is much better than my previous phones, the SE210s. The flexibIe wire allows you to wear these more like the IEMs that musicians wear on stage. They also provide a very secure fit too. I prefer a flatter, balanced sound in my in-ear earphones, and these fit the bill to a tee. I tend to use these with a headphone amp and software eq if I want more bass and treble. But the flatness allows me to listen to all genres of music, whether it's hip-hop, metal, jazz, classical or electronica with little to no tinkering.

If you have the money and a love for reference headphones with great sound isolation, these are the headphones for you."
149,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose IE2i and Bose AE2
I had a pair of Bose IE2i to listen to music when in my office, studying, running, gym, etc. I also had a pair of Bose AE2 that I used to play my electric drum set. I got tired of the IE2i and stopped using them altogether because those do not isolate any noises whatsoever. Like the new Bose SoundSport the earphone tips/buds are extremely comfortable, but you can hear every single noise from outside. I tried to use the IE2i in several 5-hr flights and they are useless. The AE2 sounded very good and isolated some noise. Enough to enjoy using them with my drumkit, but not enough to use on a plane ride.

SE425
Fantastic mid-range, poor bass and low-end; low impedance; long and strong cord; ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. Given their lack of low-range these could not satisfy my needs. Expensive.

Bose SoundTrue Ultra in-ear STIE
Great balanced sound; strong bass; short and thin/flimsy cord; includes iPhone controls. Very comfortable silicone tips that provide great noise isolation, but you can hear the cord touching against any surface. Easy and fast to take on/off. The earphones wiggle a bit when running, though not enough to break the sound seal. Relatively expensive.

SE215
Great balanced sound; strong bass; low impedance; long and strong cord, ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. I can hear comfortably with 2/16 volume bars from the iPhone. Used 5/16 volume bars on the iPhone when running with 15 mph winds and was amazing. After a learning curve, you get used to quickly putting them on/off. Inexpensive.

Overall

I got the SE425 first and discarded them for their lack of bass. I couldn't notice much of a sound difference between the STIE and the SE215. The SE215 have a lower impedance and thus sound louder but the quality is, to me, quite comparable (My suggestion: get a tight seal, don't go too deep into your ear). The benefits of the SE215 suit my overall needs better and ended up choosing these.

Notes

1. I will post this same review in all three products hoping others will find it useful.

2. I am traveling in a couple of days and if I find a good store in an airport that will let me try the SE535 I will make an update to this post. The SE535 are supposed to be as good as the SE425 with the bass that the latter so deeply lack.

******UPDATE******

A store at the Chicage O'Hare airport let me try the SE535. Here is my short review:

SE535
Fantastic balanced sound; great bass and low-end; low-enough impedance; long and strong cord, ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. Many eartips to try for different occassions (e.g. biking, office, airplane). I can hear comfortably with 2/16 volume bars from the iPhone. With 3/16 volume bars on iPhone 5S the sound is astonishing, lead guitar doesn't sound over rythm guitar, bass and drums sound great and all sounds are complimenting one another as opposed to fighting over which is the primary sounding one. I use them for running, biking, skating, working out, in the office, at the library, coffee shop, in the car (passenger), on airplanes, and with my Roland TD30-KV electric drumkit. I never need more than 4/16 volume bars on my iPhone 5S. I specially like the versatility of these IEMs and quality of their sound. Expensive.

I sincerely hope you find this review helpful!"
150,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comes with a variety of ear inserts. Comfortable once dialed in with the right insert. Seem to provide excellent blocking of outside sound and I'm happy with the sound they produce.
151,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tony Tiger would find these in-ear monitors to be wonderful. They do a pretty darn good job of noise cancelleing, and you can feel the bass frequencies in your chest somehow! I love them.

If you sing and/or smile while you play, you may experience a little moment of silence in your head, but of course you must try all the ear tips (included) so that you might find the ones that suit you best. You won't want to use any standard headphones in your iPod or record player or CD player... Or whatever!!"
152,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are totally worth the money, but keep in mind that these are for audiophiles, not bassheads. The mids and highs are incredibly clear and detailed, and the soundstage is the best of any earbuds or headphones I have ever worn; you will hear thing in songs that you have never heard before. The bass is somewhat lacking on all the earpieces but the yellow ones (which are very slightly uncomfortable). The yellow ones form an amazing seal and deliver the accuracy of all the other ones as well as some extra bass. Deadmau5, Noisia and Koan sound sound really good on these, but these are definitely not for listening to Skrillex."
153,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my new se425's and have listened to just 3 of my favorite CD's. All I can say is wow! Excellent audio quality and they will only get better as they break-in over time. I'm glad I didn't pop for the se535's for an extra $200.00. (More bass I don't need.) I couldn't be happier with the se425's. I would say that the se425's are 5-6 times better than the old e3c's I had back in 04.

BTW, I always use the 3-flange white rubber ear stems. They seem to make the best seal and produce the best low frequency effect. I'm a happy camper! :-)

One more thing . . . when placed in the ear with 3-flange in-ear earpiece, the unit sits flush / flat and does not protrude outside the ear -- making it perfect for use with motorcycle helmets."
154,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent quality , wonderful mids and highs. Bass is ok but the lack of it drove me to purchase the se535's where I finally found complete satisfaction . It worth the extra cost in my opinion to go with the se535's. Even the se315 provided me better bass and excellent sound quality, but it uses a dynamic drivers and lacks the accuracy of the se425 & se535's balanced armature speakers."
155,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The dual drivers provide good sound reproduction with very little distortion. The supplied buds provide excellent noise cancellation and keep the music clear and unobstructed by ambient noise. The formable upper wire conforms and holds to any shape which helps to keep the ear pieces in the canal and rarely comes out on it's own on the stage or while moving about.

As pertaining to stage use, I highly recommend using an extension of some sort, as the included cable is far too short. The fit is exceptional, and I am able to move freely without concern of having the buds forced out of the ear canal, since the formable wire really helps hold them in place over the ear lobe. I run the cable up my back, and pull on the plastic clip to secure the cable in place, by pulling against the back of my head. The clip holds well, and keeps everything in place as it should.

The amount of different earbuds is almost obscene; there's many fitment options that should allow one to custom-tailor each ear piece to fit perfectly in the ear canal, even if one of your ear canals is of a different size than the other (should that ever be a factor).

The sound:

Bass Frequency: The lows are not overly bass-y - it is more of a reference sound that does not attenuate any one frequency compared to another, and seems to accurately represent the low end without being boomy, and so the mids and highs are nice and clear, without having any distortion since the low-mids/bass are separate from the highs, by design.

Mid Frequency: The mids are clearly defined and I would say that the SE425 really focuses the sound where it should be for vocals, guitars and toms, snares and symbols. There is a nice big, spacious sound stage that is pleasing to the ear, without sacrificing clarity.

High Frequency: The highs are slightly mellowed to the point that they are clearly audible, but not overly amplified or painful to listen to. Symbols are present without being too ""tinny"" sounding; guitars are as good as can be coming from our church's mics, console, and amplifiers, though I do not blame the ear phones for the stripping away of the tone that guitars should have. But, in mastered recordings, guitars come through clearly and sound as they ought to with an organic feel.

Overall Impression:

If this pair got lost or stolen, I would probably not want to afford to replace them, and would settle for the SE215 instead, since they have the same outer plastic and formable wire, though the driver technology and amount of drivers is different, having only one driver. When listening to recordings, the sound is pleasant and provides a full spectrum of audio that exceeds most cans that I have used (though I must confess that I have only auditioned a few decent cans). The ""size"" of the sound is big and spacious and affords the listener a rewarding experience so long as the canal is sealed properly. And since there are plenty of options for sealing the canal, there should be no issue in finding the right size of bud to use to seal off the canal from ambient sound. If the seal is not secure, a lot of bass is removed from the experience, and so sealing off the canal is vital to getting the most out of these in-ears."
156,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own this earphone for a week and my amazement forced me to write about it, First impression was kinda disappointing for me maybe because its my first In-Ear monitor to try but shortly after i realized how wonderful the listening experience on the shure se425 is. I'm the kinda person who like loud and punchy sound but the shure soft of changed the way i think, now i don't tend to turn the volume all the way up and i can listen and be very satisfied from the lowest volume because i can hear every element of the music very defined and present in my head, its like audio signal wired to my brain directly.

I'm 100% satisfied."
157,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My fiancé asked me to purchase these for his job. He's a band leader who has taken his group to total wireless. All members of the group have wireless earphones. Price is high, but that's the manufacturer, not Amazon. Arrived on time. Good packaging. Decent earphones. Shure makes a good product."
158,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is what allows me to forget my surroundings and get lost in the music or listening to my favorite audio book. Shure has a very straightforward approach....keep it simple and provide the highest quality of sound. You will pay premium but it is worth every penny. With a million miles of flying this was my #1 tool to block out outside noise while i listened to my favorite tunes or not listening to any music at all
159,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first set of mid priced ear buds, I am blown away with what I am hearing, if you are on the line about forking over the cash for these little gems, don't be,"
160,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok so here's the straight on these headphones. Most importantly- they are not meant for every day use with your ipod, ect. I know Shure markets them as such, but let's be honest, they're personal monitors and should not be used for anything else. All you have to do is look at them to know- they look like hearing-aids and they wrap around the back of your ears... like hearing-aids. This said, they look cool when you're wearing them on stage- they make you look like a real performer without having to pay the price for a pair of custom in-ear monitors.

Specifics:

Pros:

-Extremely clear (perfect for monitoring a mix or playing live). You can hear everything you will most likely hear instruments or parts you never heard before when you listen to music.

-Comfortable: If you put them in right, they can be comfortable for 2-3 hours before they start to wear on your ears a bit.

-Excellent sound reduction: These will cut out basically all ambient noise when you form a good seal. Also, they are great to wear while practicing drums or playing live. They cut out enough noise to let you hear your music/mix and protect your hearing.

-Cables are detachable, meaning you only have to buy a new cable if it breaks instead of a whole new pair of headphones. The construction looks great to me so I don't think this will be a problem any time soon.

Cons:

-Takes some time to get a good fit if you use the foam ear buds, but it gets easier when you get better at putting them in.

-Lacks bass. Like I said, these headphones should be used for monitoring, not casual listening. The response is very accurate and tight, but even so I could use some more bass."
161,4.0 out of 5 stars,Compared to the westones and price not bad for drums and bass. Not keys or vocals. They are warm.
162,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very upset....with myself for not getting them any time sooner. A friend let me listen to his 425 and I was sold. Same night ordered. I happen to fly a lot and never could hear well due to airplane noise what I was listening to even at maximum volume which became painful to ears. So flew 4 times with the 425 ....what can i say once they are on you forget where you are. I like loud music and now I dont even go past 75% volume.Clean sound of music, very clear and have plenty of bass for me."
163,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They were not my first pair, I discovered Shure a few years back and owned 530 and other models, I have always enjoyed the sound quality they can give you. The one problem I had was that after heavy use around 1.5 year or more they wire would wear off and sometimes break right around the connection to the earphone. Luckily they offered a two year warranty and would always replace them with a new pair. Now with this new design, you can easily swap the wires for new ones and if you purchase (like I did) the remote/mic wire, it's a perfect combo to use with your cellphone or ipod. The price is certainly not cheap but compared to a pair of Bose headphones with sound isolation I would go with Shure without a doubt."
164,5.0 out of 5 stars,liked them so well bough another pair
165,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am on my 4th set of the SHURE SE425 headphones over the last 7 years and the only reason is because I lost them or the dog ate one set.
166,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sleeves were stuck to the drivers, but a quick web search fixed that. Just pop 'em in the freezer for a few hours and they come off. It takes some patience.

The plug is larger than the provided hole in my iPhone case, so I can't plug it in without removing the case. Solved with a small file to modify the case.

The sound is great. I had a few test songs picked out to decide whether to keep or return them, and 20 seconds into the first song they are keepers.

I look forward to ignoring the rest of the world, insulated from the screeching masses."
167,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I have quite a few years of audio experience and this set is great compared to all of the in-ears I have had.. My primary music I listen to is Electronic, Jazz, Orchestra, Classic rock, and a little pop. My favorite has to be vocal trance music (electronic trance music with vocals).

Sound:
Highs are clear and very nice. Not too shrill or exaggerated. Right where I feel a good sound is supposed to be. Hi hats and others at that level are clear and crisp.
Mids are SUPERB and vocals sound like the artist is right there in my ear. Synths are bright and feel almost emotional with the vocals. Guitar riffs sound swell and like it is from my personal amp.
Low: Good and not overpowering. Bass is tight and comfortable. People on various review complain about the lack of bass. It even says on the box that a GOOD SEAL IS HOW TO GET GOOD LOW END. With the Comply tips I get a great seal that does not hinder sound due to a a poor seal from other tips.

**note that the tips that come with the Shures didn't seal right for me and the best sound came from the Isolation Plus tips made by Comply**

With the Comply tips people complain of muffled sound. I read that the tips have to be cut so that the end is flush with the earwax guard and this has made the sound so good that the Shure headphones are in the top 2 in ears that I have ever owned.

People say that the yellow foam tips that come with the headphones work great but get dirty and don't poof up as well. I stick them in a sock and throw it in the washer and they come out like new after letting them air dry for 10-12 hours. I learned this trick from a Shure thread on a forum.

tl;dr: Top sound i have ever heard but need a good seal to get good bass. Comply makes Isolation Plus that do the trick. Can wear for hours."
168,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these buds to replace an older pair of Shure E3's. I play drums in a rock cover band that gigs up to 7 times a month and use these with my personal in-ear monitoring system. So far, these 425's have been GREAT! They do a tremendous job with sound isolation and even with all the moving around I do, stay firmly sealed and in place. I particularly like the idea of detachable cables from each bud so that you don't have to buy an entirely new rig if you blow a driver or break a cable."
169,4.0 out of 5 stars,Quality performance is entirely dependent on the earpieces you choose. Choose wisely! ;-)
170,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are well constructed, the cable is very well made and replaceable.

If you've not worn this type before, be aware the cable routes over your ear and is a different fit than most headphones and are more like monitors in their design.

The sound isolation is perfect, I love not hearing others while I listen to music.

I personally found the bass to be just right and did not feel it was lacking.

Overall sound clarity is great but I am no audiophile.

The case is kind of bulky and I won't use it as a result."

I always thought their quality of sound was amazing, and couldn't be beat. So, I went and bought the BOSE noise canceling ear buds. I thought they sucked for what they were suppose to do, and did some more research and found these. The quality is amazing, and you can hear every little bit of the music. Great product which I will use for years to come."

174,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally had to buy a replacement for my trusty E2C's that I've had for years. Although I loved the Shure brande and was sold on the E2C's I had a hard time spending this kind of money on earphones..... But let me tell you they are worth every penny and then some!!!! They even have better ambient noise suppression than my brother's BOSE Quiet Conforts! And now that they have replaceable cords, I won't have to throw them out when the cord dies. Would buy them again in a heartbeat though. (And the new design fits MUCH better than the old one, can't even feel them when they're on!)"
175,4.0 out of 5 stars,The clarity of these is stunning. Without a doubt the best listening experience I have had thus far. Two notes of caution: 1) the instructions will tell you this too but you *MUST* get them seated in your ears properly for them to sound right. And 2) they aren't amazing in the bass department. So if you're looking for something to rock hard then you need to pair a headphone amp with them. I am planning to do just that. The audiophile's quest never ends...
176,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent
177,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a review of both the Shure 535s and 425s. I have previously owned the Shure E5s and 530s. I am replacing my 530s because I accidentally left them on a plane in a rush between flights, bummer.

So after reading other peoples Amazon reviews of the 425s and the 535s I decided to try the 425s to save some money. My first impressions were: Nice build. Cool detachable wires. I am glad they brought back the formable wire around the ears. The cord is lighter, stronger, and nicer. The cord is not modular anymore. I like the silver color under the clear plastic. They fit kinda differently, mildly uncomfortable in my concha (not the ear canal). The sound is the clearest yet. Where is the BASS? (yes I know how to make a proper seal in my ear canal)

I hoped maybe the 425s needed to be broken in properly, though I previously haven't had a need to break in my other Shure headphones. So I let them play for a few days and then tried again, but as I had feared the 425s still sounded very lacking in the low end. The odd part is they can reproduce frequencies all the way down to 20Hz, but they really roll off in volume at about 100Hz. If the music had any mids or highs the bass felt lacking. So I ordered the 535s.

First impressions of the 535s: Exactly the same shape as the 425s, the cords are interchangeable and the dimensions are identical. I like having the clear plastic option again but think I prefer the new color on the inside of the plastic style. Here is the bass the 425s lack. The 535s sound very much like the 530s but even clearer. With the increased clarity, they also sound brighter than the 530s.

To my ears the 425s and 535s sound the same above about 100Hz. In fact, to me, the 425s sound like a great pair of bookshelf speakers with a misplaced subwoofer. Keeping with the speaker analogy, the 535s would be towers in the same line with the same tweeter and mids but also integrated subs. In terms of production I cannot imagine the 535s cost $200 more to make, but to my ears the 535s are the only way to go. As someone else mentioned if you only listened to older recordings or classical music (without timpani or cannons) the 425s would most likely work well, but they do not work for rock, rap, or electronica.

I think I actually would choose the 530s over the 535s or the 425s. The reason is, I find the 535s a bit too bright despite them being clearer (I am the type of listener who prefers tubes and electrostatic speakers). And while the new cables are better, have the formable wire around the ear again, and are replaceable I miss the modular design and don't like how the headphones rotate. Since they rotate around where the wire connects to the headphone it is harder to use the formable wire to maintain the proper alignment in my ear and insert them. All of my comparisons to the 530s are based on memory, because I lost them. I will be returning the 425s and keeping the 535s.

I did most of my listening using my zune 120 and hp laptop with a nuforce icon mobile headphone amp using high bitrate ripped wmas and amazon bought mp3s."
178,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great set of earphones. Pricey but the quality is great, don't get caught up in the beats hype (I've had beats) go with a quality set like these."
179,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used these daily on the subway and the make my commute so much nicer. I had the Bose headphones which don't provide a tight seal so I always had to turn them up to compensate for outside noice but these block out noice so I can enjoy music or audio books without worrying about damaging my hearing. The only compalint I have is that the Bose earbuds had more bass which I liked, but I guess these are more balanced."
180,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound coming from these small earphones is spectacular. However the wire that goes over the ear is too stiff to mold over the ear. I am hoping that with more use the wire becomes more pliable. There is no clip to attach the long and heavy cord to your shirt or clothes. I used the earphones on a long flight and the noise cancellation feature worked extremely well. Once the earphones are correctly fit into the ear they work quite nicely.
181,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm a retired musician and video producer. I've been using Shure earphones for years and have had only one complaint. When the cable went so did the earbud. So this time I spent a little more and upgraded the sound quality and design. The dual hi-def driver is awesome. I'm hearing things in my music and movies I never heard before. Plus I'm no longer worried about my investment being a total loss because a cable breaks. Just order a new cable. Buy them.
182,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound terrific. The ear piece is not as comfortable as I would like. This maybe just personal preference.

190,5.0 out of 5 stars,As a bass player I was wondering if these would provide the low end response that I like to hear.. They do... Very clear through the entire frequency range. I also have the SE215 which are good but these are a nice step above those.
191,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had Shure earphones for 6 years and I have always been impressed with the sound quality. I just received these headphones and they are amazing.

192,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these as an upgrade to some old SE210's. The SE425's make the SE210's sound like beats by dr.dre. haha. But seriously, the SE425's have an incredible level of detail without just having boosted treble. They are significantly more articulate.

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BASS??
yes, the bass SEEMS weak, just like the SE210's. The treble isn't boosted either, but you don't hear complaints about that. They're reference earphones, so they just reproduce what's there with no hype. I like that. No hype means I get to enjoy what's actually there. This is great for checking mixes, auditioning channels, or monitoring audio.

To each his own, but if you like stunningly accurate sounding earphones, these are pretty sweet. If you liked the SE210's, you'll love these."

195,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comparing these with previous sets of Etymotics and Ultimate Ear Triple-Fi in-ear headphones, I think these are the best combination of fit and sound. Getting the fit right is the critical factor for in-ear headphones, and the particular design of these Shure headphones nests them inside the ear in a natural way that is both comfortable and functional, because the headphone stays put in the ear and bass response stays clear. I found that Etymotics have a weak bass and really go deep into the ear, which is a feeling that I imagine a lot of people will find uncomfortable. I know I did. The Triple-Fi headphones have outstanding sound quality--about the best I've heard--but start to hurt pretty quickly (I found 45 minutes to be about my threshold). And they do not have replaceable cords, a nice feature of the Shures.

The Shure headphones do have some issues; the cord needs to wrap around the outside of the ear in a particular way to keep them fitting correctly and it takes some time to get them right. But once the cord is fitted, it remembers the shape and they are easier to get on after that. It's not clear which one is 'left' and which one is 'right' and it's possible to put them in the wrong ear; I've done it. (The Triple-Fis don't really go into the wrong ear because of their shape.) And, of course, it takes a few attempts with the different sizes of foam pads to figure out the right one. These mostly are issues about getting the fit right. Also, my first purchase of these headphones had an issue with one channel cutting out when I moved my head. Amazon took care of getting a replacement with its usual fast speed, but it suggests some quality control problems."

203,4.0 out of 5 stars,"....I purchased a pair of SE425 ear buds to replace a set of Shure e4c earbuds that died a premature death from wire insulation ""rot"" thinking that the replaceable cords would solve the problem. Well they do, but there is another problem inherent in the design that is not readily apparent....until you try to replace the sleeves with new ones. With my pair, the sleeves(only had them for 5 weeks)had become fused to the stems. So upon trying to remove them following the instructions in the manual, the stems snapped off!!! Well, with e4c buds they are replaceable but with the SE425 buds the stems are an integral part of the earbud and are NOT replaceable. My suggestion to those who purchase these is that the 1st thing you do when you get them is to try to swap out the sleeves sometime before the Amazon 30 day return policy expires. Hopefully the 2 year warranty will save the day for me. I will keep you posted!

OK.... its 2/24/11 and I got my replacements already from Shure. Great turn-around! Raised the star value up to a 4 from a 1. They sound great but I am still disappointed in the fact that the stems are not replaceable. Although the sleeves remove easier on this pair, I would guess that this will happen again sometime in the future. Maybe with the next generation of earbuds, they will get it right.

In comparing them to the SE215s the lows are just a little deeper and the highs are much clearer. These headphones are phenomenal. I've owned beats by dre, Bose Mie2s, and many other sets of eat buds. No other set of ear buds compare.

I had a pair of Bose IE2i to listen to music when in my office, studying, running, gym, etc. I also had a pair of Bose AE2 that I used to play my electric drum set. I got tired of the IE2i and stopped using them altogether because those do not isolate any noises whatsoever. Like the new Bose SoundSport the earphone tips/buds are extremely comfortable, but you can hear every single noise from outside. I tried to use the IE2i in several 5-hr flights and they are useless. The AE2 sounded very good and isolated some noise. Enough to enjoy using them with my drumkit, but not enough to use on a plane ride.

SE425
Fantastic mid-range, poor bass and low-end; low impedance; long and strong cord; ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. Given their lack of low-range these could not satisfy my needs. Expensive.

Great balanced sound; strong bass; short and thin/flimsy cord; includes iPhone controls. Very comfortable silicone tips that provide great noise isolation, but you can hear the cord touching against any surface. Easy and fast to take on/off.

Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. I can hear comfortably with 2/16 volume bars from the iPhone. Used 5/16 volume bars on the iPhone when running with 15 mph winds and was amazing. After a learning curve, you get used to quickly putting them on/off. Inexpensive.

Overall

I got the SE425 first and discarded them for their lack of bass. I couldn't notice much of a sound difference between the STIE and the SE215. The SE215 have a lower impedance and thus sound louder but the quality is, to me, quite comparable (My suggestion: get a tight seal, don't go too deep into your ear). The benefits of the SE215 suit my overall needs better and ended up choosing these.

Notes

1. I will post this same review in all three products hoping others will find it useful.

2. I am traveling in a couple of days and if I find a good store in an airport that will let me try the SE535 I will make an update to this post. The SE535 are supposed to be as good as the SE425 with the bass that the latter so deeply lack.

******UPDATE******

A store at the Chicage O'Hare airport let me try the SE535. Here is my short review:

SE535
Fantastic balanced sound; great bass and low-end; low-enough impedance; long and strong cord, ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. Many eartips to try for different occassions (e.g. biking, office, airplane). I can hear comfortably with 2/16 volume bars from the iPhone. With 3/16 volume bars on iPhone 5S the sound is astonishing, lead guitar doesn't sound over rythm guitar, bass and drums sound great and all sounds are complimenting one another as opposed to fighting over which is the primary sounding one. I use them for running, biking, skating, working out, in the office, at the library, coffee shop, in the car (passenger), on airplanes, and with my Roland TD30-KV electric drumkit. I never need more than 4/16 volume bars on my iPhone 5S. I specially like the versatility of these IEMs and quality of their sound. Expensive.

I sincerely hope you find this review helpful!"
1,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an audiophile that likes to get out and walk around while listening to music, so I've always aimed to get the most I can out of portable equipment. Using my iPhone 6 Plus with Spotify and Tidal Lossless, I listened through a pair of Beyerdynamic DT-990s (250ohm) powered by a FiiO E12 I carry around in my back pocket. This setup, for me, remains unbeatable in terms of audio quality; it's like a concert on your head. But unforeseen circumstances made me seek out my first pair of IEMs in a long time.

The last IEM I owned was the Klipsch Image S4, a popular one at the time that was widely praised for sounding 10x what it cost. But I knew I'd need something at least as good as my DT-990s if I really wanted to be satisfied; or at least, I'd need something that could give me that ""Wow"" when a song comes on I haven't heard before and I can hear every detail.

I'll tell it to you straight, if you're a fan of open-back headphones - hell, any headphones that sit on your ears at all - odds are you aren't going to find an IEM that can live up to that experience, at least not without paying an insane price for it. At $500, the Shure SE535 should be the headphone that at least meets you halfway, and I can say that it just about does. But this is not an IEM with that ""Wow!"" factor.. actually it seems to be an actively anti-""Wow"" pair of headphones. Take these out of the box and (after fiddling for several minutes) get them in your ear, the first thing you'll notice: they're damn comfortable for IEMs, mostly thanks to their smart but annoying design by which they basically hang on your ears. Now, turn on your favorite song, here it comes!... annnd... fizzle. Wait... what is this? Is this what I paid $500 for..? Are you kidding me?! This is the point where you have to have a little patience, giving your brain time to adjust to the new sound and the headphones time to show you what they can really do. Two words that should be printed on the bottom of the box: Keep Listening. Play song after song, and oddly enough, you'll find they start sounding better and better, and the SE535's character really starts to come out. The most forward, gorgeous rocking mids I've heard in probably any pair of headphones. The highs are so wonderfully detailed and flavorful, when singers hit those super high notes that would normally make you cringe in fear of pain, you instead feel an almost orgasmic sensation in the center of your brain, like their voice is reaching all the way into your brain and bouncing around in your skull. The lows and bass are understated, but certainly there, and they come out when they need to.. but hardly ever otherwise. This kind of sound profile actually has the unusual effect of making old, say pre-1940s vinyl recordings and mono mixes, sound amazing; listening to Jimmie Rodgers yodeling T For Texas sounds like having him right in front of you (don't let him sneeze on you). I was impressed by how much character these IEMs have, despite my initial disappointment that they didn't live up to my (perhaps absurd) expectations. All in all, I'll just break it down into pros and cons, so you can decide for yourself whether these are right for you in 2015.

Pros:
-Quite comfortable, and the box includes a ton of different ear tips to choose from. The box, by the way, includes many useful accessories, like cables and a well built hard case that can easily fit in your pocket.
-Orgasmic mids and highs
-Great soundstage for an IEM with good isolation as well, a rare combination.
-Full of character, but not overstated; the music sounds fun, without compromising the detail.

Cons:
-Same design that makes it so comfortable makes it incredibly annoying to put on, as you have to lay the cord over your ear; this becomes profoundly more irritating if you have long hair.
-Lows are understated and this seems to cost on sharpness and detail; instruments, for example, are more difficult to tell apart despite the 535's good soundstage. Bass is there, but has little punch or character.
-A little too expensive for what you're getting. But this is also the best IEM I've ever owned, and I haven't owned many.

Recommendations:

I strongly recommend using an amplifier with the 535. It will bring out MUCH more detail and really push the IEMs to their full advantage. Not all headphones, particularly IEMs, benefit from amping but these definitely do. The lacking of bass can be corrected entirely with a proper amp, and the 535 handles a thumping bass excellently. I'm using the FiiO E12 I was using previously with my DT-990s, which is sort of overkill for a pair of IEMs, but it does sound heavenly- just be sure to be careful with the volume on any amplifier, as the 535's are low impendence and don't need much juice to get them going."
2,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my third Shure earphones. First purchase was the SE530PTH back in 2010. Upgraded to SE535-CL in 2012. I fly a lot and usually on long flights (10+ hours) and found these to be the best for sound, comfort, and for blocking out all the noise on a plane. I like that they are in-ear and not over the ear like other noise-cancelling headphones. I often fall asleep on a plane while listening to music. I can get comfortable and twist and turn and not have to worry about what position my head is in. I've tried the Bose and Sennheiser earbuds and think the Shure are much better for sound and fit.

Shure's customer service is great. Over the past 8 years I've only had a couple of issues. Fortunately, it happened while the earphones were covered by their warranty. Shure replaced earphone assemblies without any hassle. I lost my SE535-CL last week and had to get them replaced before my next trip. I decided to pay $50 more to get the limited edition SE535LTD because they have a slim volume control in the photo on Amazon. The SE530PTH I bought back in 2010 had volume controls, but they were very bulky.

The SE535LTD comes with 2 sets of cables. One has the slim in-line volume controls and one with a single button for ""Media phones"". There's isn't a cable with no controls. First improvement I noticed were with the new cables. They aren't as stiff as the SE535-CL cables and there's a nice bend in the connector (see photo). The bent connector rests comfortably on my ear, and the softer cables go over and behind my ear without having to tug on them. With the previous cables I had to occasionally tug them down to keep them over my ear. It comes with a bunch accessories including different sleeves, an adapter for the 2-pin plugs found on some aircraft, and an analog volume control. I used them for a couple hours with my Galaxy S7 Edge and, as expected, they sound great.

That being said, I can only give the SE535LTD 4 stars. I'm annoyed that for the super high price, Shure still doesn't include a cable with in-line volume controls that work with Android phones. One cable has only one button and is meant for placing calls (no volume controls). The other cable with the in-line volume control buttons only work with iPhones. I understand that back in 2010 iPhones had these fancy features and the Android phones didn't. It's 2018 and you can get in-line volume controls with cheap $10 earbuds, but I can't get them in my $500 Shure earphones? The analog volume control Shure provides is clunky and it's on a short ""leash"" (see photo). I would like to control the volume without having to pull my phone out my backpack or coat pocket. I would give the SE535LTD 5 stars if it wasn't for the lack of a good volume control option."
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful clear realistic multilayered sound! Super comfortable. I’m a budding home recording artist, with a head injury that makes over-the-ear phones painful to wear. Being able to hear the subtleties of interwoven parts is so key to my work. If these weren’t so expensive I would wear them everywhere. Love the interchangeability with cords. I’ve tried the Klipsch headphones at the same price point. The klipsch had beautiful sound, but were heavy and very fragile feeling. These have equal if not better sound differentiation and superior volume control. They are also much more compatible with all my devices than the klipsch were. They are super comfortable for long sessions, and cancel out the noise, while still allowing you to hear your vocals and volume clearly.

I’m giving this 5 stars even though... As usual, Amazon’s idiot packing department packaged them in an oversized box with insufficient padding for electronics (one small piece of deflated plastic). Thankfully, these do not seem to have been damaged during shipping by their incompetence, unlike 2/3 of the electronics I’ve had to return to them due to crappy packing, resulting in product damage. FYI, Amazon’s packing department doesn’t care if your products are damaged during shipping, so just expect that you may have to return anything electronic at least once. Which is sad, because if they took more care with their shipping department, they would not have as many returns due to product malfunctions:("
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I felt compelled to write a review of these IEMs having obsessed about them for months now.
They are all very good!
They should be for the price! Haha.

So where do I begin?
Most important, above all is sound quality.
They are all good with certain signature differences.

I have been using Etymotics for years.
Using the Etymotic hf3.
Excellent overall. Very accurate. Just not a lot of punch or presence to the bass.
It's there but doesn’t hit you over the head.

I tried other brands of phones and found them to sound inaccurate or sloppy.
I had some older Shure IEMs and I wanted to see if their newer models sounded better.
I tried the Shure SE315. and the Shure SE425.
Didn’t sound as good as my old model. Back they went.
Decided I would need triple drivers to get a significantly better sound.
Bought the Shure SE535. Lots of money!
And wow! Very impressive!
Having come from the Etymotics, the sound is very different.
Its warmer and slicker sounding. The voice range is a little less forward, which may be simply because the bass presence and detail is huge compared to the Etymotics.
The Shure SE535s are very entertaining to listen to.
More so than the Etymotics.
With the Shures, you feel more like you are being washed with music.
With the Etymotics, it just feels more like you are analyzing the sound.
There is way more punch and space to the sound in the Shure SE535s. Almost too much punch on certain tracks. 😳

Let me go back to the Etymotics.
I tried out the Etymotic ER4XR and the Etymotic ER4SR.
Very little discernible difference. Maybe slightly more bass presence with the XR.
I have been using the Etymotic hf3 for many years.
In my opinion, the hf3 sounds as good if not better than the ER4XR.
The reason is that the ER4XR has a higher impedance than the hf3.
On an iPhone, you have to turn up the volume essentially all the way to get the full sound out of the ER4XR.
This is not the case with the hf3s. They are good at 3/4 volume.
Makes a significant difference!
Other than that, there is maybe a slightly discernible improvement in separation on the ER4XR. But I mean slight.
Overall the hf3 sounds better. And they cost way less!

And there is another point.
Comfort.
This is a tricky issue when it comes to IEMs.
After trying to use the triple flange cone tips, I gave up do to discomfort and the scariness of sticking a little plastic Christmas tree up your ear canal.
I found that using the cylindrical foam tips created just as good a sealed fit and bass response as the ""tree"" did. So that is what I use.
The Soft Flex Sleeves are also an excellent alternative. Really good isolation and amazing bass response!
That brings me to the difference between the Etymotics and the Shures.
The Etymotics are simply more comfortable.
The drivers are smaller and weigh less than the Shures. Less of a pull on your ear structure.
Shures design is supposed to route the wire over and behind your ear.
I find this distracting and annoying in addition to being uncomfortable.
My solution is to let the wires remain in front of my ears, hanging down in front of me.
Much more comfortable. (See photos)
This however, necessitates using a shirt clip to cancel out the weight of the cord pulling on your ears. I bought some from Amazon. Works well to make the phones as weightless as possible.
With the Etymotics, this is less of an issue because the earpieces weigh so much less and the foam goes straight into your ear canal.
The Shures have to kind of sit on your ear structure. Not so comfortable.
I'm hoping over time that I will be bothered less and less by this slight pressure.
It is worth it to get the sonic results that the 535s deliver.

Back to the Shures.
I payed a very large amount for the 535s. For me they are worth it for the spectacular performance they deliver. I can only imagine how nice the Shure SE846s sound.
I just couldn't bring myself to spend one thousand dollars on IEMs. I do after all have a family to support! 😛

So I am happy I have both.
I will probably usually use my 535s for my daily commute to Manhattan.
But it's nice to switch out to the Etymotics for a lighter more Spartan sound signature.

Hope this review helps some of you out there.

With streaming music, it's like being a kid in a candy store every day.
And with these headphones, You can hear the candy really really well! 😊

Edit to this review: October 9, 2016

This is an important addition to this review!
I made a discovery about the importance of source input to the performance of the se535s.
I had been listening to my music with Apple Music.
I had been detecting a slight stridency to the overall sound of the headphones.
Thought it was the phones.
But then I tried using Spotify Premium with the 535s.
No stridency!
Virtually perfect reproduction of vocals, piano, strings, bass!
As much as it pains me to say it, looks like Spotify delivers a more accurate dynamic signal.
Both great music systems. But Spotify has a slightly warmer, more realistic sound.
Wow!"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earphones because I play electric guitar, and needed something good for in-ear monitoring. I had some older Shure earbuds, and those are good, but they don't have much bass. I was doing a recording recently, and was really struggling to hear the bass line. Not ok. So I did a bunch of research and decided on these. I think this was a good choice. Their sound is very clear, and covers the whole range. They are so forward and almost a little harsh that I find it a little difficult to listen to regular music with them, because they cause me some listening fatigue. I don't have this issue with my old earbuds, so that's a bit unexpected. However, I will say they are very clear, with crisp treble and good bass response. They are fantastic for in-ear monitoring of live music, which is what I got them for. So I'm happy. It was a good choice.

The only thing I don't like about these is they are a little difficult to put on. They have a bit of a funny shape, and it takes some practice to figure out the right orientation to put them on. Once they're on though, they fit snugly, and they're comfortable. They come with an assortment of earpieces. I ended up choosing the yellow foam earpieces, which are comfortable and give me a good seal, which is critical for getting good bass. They come with a little zipper case. There is not too much cord noise when wearing them, which is nice.

These easily get 5 stars."
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love these IEM's. One of the best purchases I have ever made. I have used them for 6 months now, for 6 plus hours a day, as IEMs, as a sound engineer, and at home for casual listening. They get better everyday. The response is amazing!"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought I'd pay $100 for a set of in-ear earphones when I bought a pair of Shure SE215s several years ago. I'm still enjoying the 215s to this day, but the roll off on the high end was noticeable. I liked the comfort and the sound so much I wanted to try their bigger brother the SE535s to see if it improved on the high end. I wasn't disappointed - the 535s have a much better high end and a fuller mid-range. I really like them. However, there are some serious diminishing returns compared to their little brother. The 215s are 80% of the sound of these IEMs for about 25% of the price."
8,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these phones. They have an excellent, full-range response. I use them with a Sennheiser EW300 system, and they're great. HOWEVER, you only get low-end on them if they're well-sealed. I had leaky, smaller tip on them so I could hear the un-microphoned pared of the band (drums and bass) and the bass from my guitar and vocals disappeared.

The reason I wouldn't give them five stars is that I got a pair of the new Westone AM30, and they just blow the 535s away in bass response, tonal quality, and have the added advantage of attenuated, ambient sound. If you're working in large performance venues where the whole band is coming through the mixer, and there are ambient microphones, these will work fine. However, if, like most musicians, you play in smaller places, there are better options."
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For three years, I owned the Shure 500PTH model, which is almost the same thing but without the detachable wires from the earbuds themselves and - based on reviews - slightly less acoustic clarity. I loved them, but after daily use (and careful TLC), the right earbud wire was exposed at the end, and although it wasn't shorting out yet, I got the Westone 4R as a replacement.

That was two years ago. I wanted to treat myself to something that I have missed for quite some time. The Westones are outstanding as well, but I find the highs aren't as crisp as with the Shure 535s. Also, on few instances, the mids would feel a just SLIGHTLY muddy in ways that I never noticed with the 500PTH.
There is ""sufficient"" bass with the 535s, but I don't like headphones/buds that emphasize bass just to provide a false sense of more dynamic sound than what's actually produced by the source material. If there IS more bass, then it should be tight, pronounced and do a good job of not bleeding away texture and fidelity in the mids or highs. Thankfully, there is enough bass to add depth and oompth to most music... and if you really want some more kick, change to foam tips and/or use an amp - such as the Fiio E18 - to hit the bass boost.
A proper DAC/amp will only make these sound that much better.

These earbuds are an outstanding representation of what good inner ear monitors can offer. They don't drive too hard power-wise, so you can plug directly into an iPhone, iPod, Android phone/tablet or whatever. Play it with regular and boring MP3s, it sounds fine.
However, it's with lossless audio tracks that the Shures shine. Coupled with a proper DAC, you'll find sonic bliss. Especially if you only used cheap buds and/or headphones (including Beats by Dre, which are horrible) in the past.

NOTE:
Make sure they are fit properly into the ears. Change around the different earbud types/sizes to find what fits your tastes the most. Different types (foam, rubber, etc..) will produce a different sonic texture. A lot of it depends on personal preference and ear size/type."
10,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For more bass, step up to the SE846. If you decide to get the SE535, make sure you go for the red limited edition. It has a slightly improved sound signature than the clear and bronze ones. (Look it up on the web for more info on that.) Despite what people may think, some IEMs such as the SE535 do require some burn-in time to get them to sound their best.

I actually started with the SE846 and came away disappointed with it at first. I've never used IEMs before other than the typical cheap stock earbuds that come bundled with some devices. I've always been a full-size headphones guy. I decided to downgrade to the SE535 because I felt the SE846's bass was a little bit overwhelming for my taste. BIG MISTAKE in downgrading. I should've kept the SE846. The sound signature on it is worlds apart from the SE535 and not just the bass but everything else. To give you a sense of what I mean, let's just say the SE846 sounded much closer to full-size headphones than the SE535 did. If you can afford it, definitely make the jump to the SE846 without looking back. I didn't realize what I was sacrificing by downgrading. On the plus side, the SE535 is more comfortable in the ears due to it being smaller and lighter."
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are simply amazing! The level of depth and detail they add are nothing short of stunning. I have tried all the Shure in ear monitors below this model and you can detect the difference the triple drivers add. One regret I do have is that I probably will not be able to fully enjoy anything less at this point. When listening to songs you think you know, you are exposed to sounds on the track you previously never heard. My music library is in essence all new. It is actually hard to pull myself away from my music with these.

The most accurate description I can currently think of is this: They actually give the perception of hearing guitar and bass strings vibrate.

Pros:

Truly beautiful and amazing sound
Discrete (I prefer to not have people know I am wearing or carrying around headphones this expensive. Most people don't seem to know what these are as opposed to Beats which I am sure would walk off if you left them around at the wrong time)

Cons:

Price
Can be uncomfortable with long wear (this is more me still trying to find the right foam size. You get a ton of options)"
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say, these are pretty amazing. The sound is so clear and balanced, it's a joy listening to music in nearly any setting. The bass is more pronounced than in the SE420s, which I had for about seven years (and really liked). These are a notch up, which should be expected given the price. But if you listen to music a lot, and can afford to shell out nearly 500 bucks, I don't think you will be disappointed. My only negative comment is that the sound isolation on these is a little bit lacking, even after experimenting with all of the tips that are supplied. They sound very nice with my iPhone, but when I'm listening with the 535s connected to a dedicated Onkyo amp, wow I'm impressed!"
13,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing the Limited Edition, red version. My office recently moved from a cubicle model to an open office. I do work that at times requires several hours straight of quiet concentration time, so I knew I would need something to allow me to get it. I read reviews on all kinds of noise cancelling and noise isolating headphones and decided that active noise cancellation didn't appeal to me. I wanted something that would sound amazing while helping to block out the sound from my now very nearby coworkers, but from what I read about active noise cancellation, it works best on steady sound like airplane engines and not sporadic sounds like people talking. So I decided to give these a try given that they were well reviewed by several different sites.
These fit the bill perfectly. After trying out all of the different tips, I have settled on the triple flange. I also prefer to wear the cord straight in front...the product literature mentions something about a formable/moldable cable, but I find the cable too unwieldy when worn behind the ears; it just doesn't stay in place well enough for me. Maybe if there was a cable cinch it would work better, but I don't detract for this because now that I've found a way that works for me, I really love these.
I actually have one problem with these though, which is what really spurred me to write this review. I recently decided to spend some time in my living listening to music on my stereo. I use a Marantz receiver powering Klipsch speakers, so it's not a cheap setup, and as I sat there listening, I realized I was missing some of the clarity I get from the Shures. My speakers aren't the latest and greatest, they aren't the reference line, but up until now I always thought they sounded amazing. But these headphones could end up making me want to upgrade my system. I could see this being a dangerous, slippery slope for some folks.
Oh, and as far as any kind of ""lack of bass"" is concerned (I've seen it mentioned in places) I don't find these lacking at all."
14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After searching and researching I found myself continuing to gravitate back to these earbuds. Happily I chose to purchase them and now I wear them everyday. I chose the Limited Edition Red over the others for no other reason than desire. But rest assured that these earbuds (in any color) are far superior to any I have had in the past. While I would love to have wireless for my running sessions I just can't sacrifice the quality of the sound these provide. Also, included in the package there are a choice of MANY ear sizes to chose from so you are certain to get a perfect fit. The ear pieces are also available for a very reasonable price if you later find you need to replace the ones you love the most. There is a convenient section on the cord which allows you to pause, skip, and even adjust the sound level. If you love your music as I do you will not be disappointed for choosing these. I LOVE mine."
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very pleased with these earphones. They sound amazing. The earphones are lightweight and well built. High quality materials used throughout.

Very comfortable fit once you find the right size sleeves for your ears. There are many choices and you should be able to find one that is right for you. Finding the correct fit is imperative to getting the most out of these as far as sound goes.

This is my second pair of Shure Earphones and I am sure I will be sticking with this brand for years to come.

HiDEF Lifestyle offered the best price for these and they were quick to deliver."
16,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The cord is designed to wrap over the top of your ears. This makes the earbud come loose, A LOT, since there is no wire on these cords. You need a tight seal to enjoy the quality sound, which means you'll be fooling with the cords constantly. I took some heavy wire and wrapped it around my ear with a bit of a hook at the top, and taped the cords to those and that helped considerably. I also ordered Comply S-100 Active earbud covers, and that helps too. (The yellow covers that come with this SE535LTD are good, but feel a bit cheap.)

Once you have them in place, the sound is EXCELLENT. If there's a lot going on in the music it tends to overwhelm the earbuds if you crank the volume too high, but hey; THEY'RE EARBUDS. If you want reference quality sound at high volume, get reference quality HEADPHONES.

I'm using a Fiio E17 headphone amp with these at 6db gain, and as long as I don't crank the sound up to ridiculous levels the sound is bright, with clear bass even at low volume. With classical or most pop, I can put the volume pretty high without distortion. Dance is clear without the bass distorting the midrange.

I would rate these earbuds a SEVEN on a scale of five if it weren't for the stupid cord design, but if you can put a bit of wire on the cords near the buds and get some secure covers you won't regret the price."
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like many others started by purchasing the SE425's only to be disappointed by the sound reproduction more specifically the low end of the sound frequency range.

I really didn't want to spend the $$ to purchase ear buds, but man oh man was I pleasantly surprised at the sound quality these units produce, I am not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, but from my perspective these reproduce sound like I have never heard before, from the clean crisp bass all the way through the high end.

Once the right fitting seal has been selected the 535's really are pleasant to listen to and comfortable to wear and they do block out ambient sound quite well, allowing for unobstructed listening to your favorite music what ever it would be, nice job Shure on these little marvels."
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easily the best in-ear headphones ever owned.....and better by a wide margin. I have tried many ever since the first iPhone came out in 2007. The stock in-in ear just never worked for me for reasons of both sound but also lack of ability to get a good fit. Tried Etymotic, B&O, Bose/Senheiser and various others over the years but between lack of fit, poor sound quality but often merely cables or other malfunctions forced me to new ones. This time around, with my purchase of an iPhone 6 that has a very good build in DAC, it was an opportunity to step it up a bit. An important factor for me in choosing the Shure 535's was obviously reputation but also that these are modular, include cables for IOS or Android, as well as plugs for stereo and airplane travel. Now if a cable breaks you can spend $45 for a cable.

Performance is astounding. As many reviews point out, this is not about bass but about purity of the sound. On any device, I have found that I play music at significantly lower levels then previously and more clarity along the full range. I do a lot of sport activities and use Bose Sport in-ear but can't wait to get to an occasion to use the Shure's. They are hugely anti-social as the sound immerses you and outside sounds are almost non existent with a good fit. The experience has been so good that I was going to spend another $150 for custom fit ear plugs but the fit with standard provided plugs have been phenomenal and for my purposes there just did not seem to a reason to go this extra step.

Certainly, my expectations for spending this amount of money on headphones were high, but the reason for this 5 star review are because they SO much exceeded my expectations and totally changed my perspective of what is possible.....Is it over the top, probably. Are there even better headphones out there, probably, but I doubt many in this price range.

If you afford them.....get them....you will not be disappointed."
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these IEMs for a few years now and they're still going strong. I considered getting a different pair that had a bass, mid, and treble but decided to go this route since it has the dual bass and one treble. I leaned this way since I'm a professional bass player and I really wanted to have the clarity in the low end and not get that flubbing flat tire sound you can sometimes get when pushing an IEM with low end. These do not disappoint. The low end is very clear, no flat tire sound here! And the mid range and highs come through great as well but it's the ability to have the low end clear to hear the bass and drums that really make these IEMs stand out to me.

22,4.0 out of 5 stars,"(First and foremost, I'd like to give these a 4.75 instead of 4. They are far better than a 4.)

My Shure SE535s just arrived yesterday. I've done a fair amount of research on these, and I knew off the bat I needed to replace the tips to get the right seal. The medium size foam tips that came stock on the earbuds felt like they were SUPERGLUED on. I almost thought I was about to break the product getting them off...

It took a little while to get used to the way they're worn (this is after finding the silicon tips a much better fit). I see no reason as to why the over-the-ear shape is a necessity. I've owned many pairs of earbuds before these, all with the ""regular"" structure that I feel works better. Putting these earbuds on is neither fun or easy. I have to finnegle with the cord over the ear, and that occasionally moves the tip out of my ear canal, ruining the seal. Frustrating.

To get down to quality of the sound: Yes, it is in fact utterly fantastic. You can clearly see that from the 100+ 5 star reviews on the 535s. However, these do not fully satisfy my taste in music. Why? I was just looking for slight bit more bass response (a reason I chose the 535 instead of the 425)

On a regular basis I usually like to listed to EDM, liquidstep, electronic trance music, kaskade, blackmill, etc. And those types of songs do sound incredible through these 535s. But I feel like there could be a slight bit more punch. a little less high and mid, and a little more bass.

Many would argue this is not a ""real"" sound. I disagree. More warmth through bass would make these perfect in my mind.

So, are these worth $450? That's a difficult decision. I do not feel they are worth 4.5x my ""UrBeats"" earbuds (Yes, laugh it up people. I own a pair of beats). Additionally I feel that they are not early as comfortable as they could be. However these aside, they really do give life to my music. The clarity and precision is just outrageous. You can hear every minute detail of your music.I had to resync all my spotify songs in 320kbs for these!"
23,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a review of both the Shure 535s and 425s. I have previously owned the Shure E5s and 530s. I am replacing my 530s because I accidentally left them on a plane in a rush between flights, bummer.

So after reading other peoples Amazon reviews of the 425s and the 535s I decided to try the 425s to save some money. My first impressions were: Nice build. Cool detachable wires. I am glad they brought back the formable wire around the ears. The cord is lighter, stronger, and nicer. The cord is not modular anymore. I like the silver color under the clear plastic. They fit kinda differently, mildly uncomfortable in my concha (not the ear canal). The sound is the clearest yet. Where is the BASS? (yes I know how to make a proper seal in my ear canal)

I hoped maybe the 425s needed to be broken in properly, though I previously haven't had a need to break in my other Shure headphones. So I let them play for a few days and then tried again, but as I had feared the 425s still sounded very lacking in the low end. The odd part is they can reproduce frequencies all the way down to 20Hz, but they really roll off in volume at about 100Hz. If the music had any mids or highs the bass felt lacking. So I ordered the 535s.

First impressions of the 535s: Exactly the same shape as the 425s, the cords are interchangeable and the dimensions are identical. I like having the clear plastic option again but think I prefer the new color on the inside of the plastic style. Here is the bass the 425s lack. The 535s sound very much like the 530s but even clearer. With the increased clarity, they also sound brighter than the 530s.

To my ears the 425s and 535s sound the same above about 100Hz. In fact, to me, the 425s sound like a great pair of bookshelf speakers with a misplaced subwoofer. Keeping with the speaker analogy, the 535s would be towers in the same line with the same tweeter and mids but also integrated subs. In terms of production I cannot imagine the 535s cost $200 more to make, but to my ears the 535s are the only way to go. As someone else mentioned if you only listened to older recordings or classical music (without timpani or cannons) the 425s would most likely work well, but they do not work for rock, rap, or electronica.

I think I actually would choose the 530s over the 535s or the 425s. The reason is, I find the 535s a bit too bright despite them being clearer (I am the type of listener who prefers tubes and electrostatic speakers). And while the new cables are better, have the formable wire around the ear again, and are replaceable I miss the modular design and don't like how the headphones rotate. Since they rotate around where the wire connects to the headphone it is harder to use the formable wire to maintain the proper alignment in my ear and insert them. All of my comparisons to the 530s are based on memory, because I lost them. I will be returning the 425s and keeping the 535s.

I did most of my listening using my zune 120 and hp laptop with a nuforce icon mobile headphone amp using high bitrate ripped wmas and amazon bought mp3s."
24,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I moved from stock earbuds to the Shure 535s on my iPhone 4 to listen to classical and pop encoded at 320kbps. I'm a slight sound snob, but by no means an expert. After plunking down the cash for the earbuds, I decided to go all the way and get custom-fit sleeves. Here's what you can expect:

1) Rich, spatial sound that you can listen to at low volume. With my stock earbuds, I'd be constantly fiddling with the volume control, lowering it when the high-frequency parts got piercing, raising it in pianissimo passages. It's fantastic to just *listen* and be awash in pure euphony.

2) Noise isolation. Now, you won't be enveloped in a complete cone of silence, but the setup goes a long way (think earplugs or pressing your tragus to cover the ear canal) to block out ambient noise. You can just barely hear people talking, but you won't understand them unless they're a foot away from you and you are reading their lips. On my transatlantic flight, the airplane engine hiss was dramatically reduced and I was able to enjoy the movie without futzing with the volume. Make sure you're extra careful when crossing the street with these on!

3) New life into old tunes. As other readers have commented, you'll hear subtleties you hadn't previously noticed, so you'll enjoy even well-worn songs. I rediscovered both classical pieces and pop songs alike, such as a faintly tinkling triangle or a vocal harmony that gets overpowered.

I would recommend getting custom sleeves, for which you'll pay about $50 to an audiologist for the impressions and another $150 for the sleeves themselves. Inside the box, there's an information leaflet on how to order these from Sensaphonics. My first pair, it took me a while to figure out how to put them in my ears (duh), but I find they create a very good seal and are more comfortable for me than the stock earpads, though to Shure's credit, they give you a bunch of shapes and sizes to experiment with.

Bottom line: Is this whole set-up a must-have, and is it worth the expense? I would say 'yes' if you're looking for a way to treat yourself if you just got a bonus, or a raise, or birthday money. I wouldn't live off peanut butter sandwiches for a month to scrimp, but maybe grilled cheese...."

Astounding sound quality, big sound stage
No listener fatigue
Isolates well enough to tune out noisy environments
Comfortable for long sessions (paired with Comply foam ear tips)

Cons
I can't get a good enough seal for appreciable bass unless I'm actively pressing the earbuds into my ears.
I appreciate their quality as an in-ear monitor though I found the sound less ""fun"" using the earbuds for casual listening
The size and shape are awkward for my ears. When they're flush they hurt the concha part of my ear despite the rounded edges. Rotating them up a little alleviates this but then makes the formable wires jut forward before wrapping behind my ear.
They don't stay in as well as other earbuds I've used, even using an ear tip that's a perfect fit.

I bought these when I misplaced my long discontinued Shure e2c earbuds. Though the Shure SE535 has significant improvement in audiophile grade sound quality, the Shure e2c has better seal, more bass, and less analytical sound. I eventually found my old earbuds and decided to keep both for different kinds of music listening."

29,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They messed up and changed the cord design so it detaches AT the earbud portion and not like older models where it detached down lower, so the fit is weird and doesn't fee comfortable at all. What a shame because my old set that I lost was superior."

31,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an audiophile, but I do have a music background in cello, oboe, and piano. The music I listen to is mostly MP3s. I am upgrading from Shure 215, which I was impressed with, but wanted more.

The SE535 truly delivers with crisp highs, strong but warm mids, and punchy lows. Succinctly, this is about the best IEMs I've ever heard.

Only problem is, the SE215 is still pretty good for $400 less! Yes, between the two, the 215 sounds muddier and weaker, but does the 535 justify the sizeable price gap? You will have to decide that.

However, I am not returning my 535 if that says anything, though I doubt I would buy this again. For listening to MP3s and playing video games, this seems overkill, and I imagine some of its potential is lost on these basic tasks. The 215 still sounds quite good for the money, provided that you get a solid but comfortable seal. Even on the 535, a good seal is critical to hear its full potential.

For audiophiles seeking a truly good pair of IEMs, look no further.

Lastly, my pair required at least several hours of burn-in time before the sound started to come alive."
32,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I paid a lot for these earphones, and was concerned. Why? Thought to myself, this is a tough act to follow (after the payment).

Once I got the ""L"" and the ""R"" right, i was good to go lol!

Nice set of earphones, however they will set you back in price. Nicely done, small enough, just make sure that you have a solid connection n the ear, i.e. noise cancelling and the sound takes over. I have heard some things on instruments that were not clear in the past or even evident. It is now!

33,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this headphones 🎧 after hearing great reviews from everyone especially when I was quite interested in klipsch x20i. Guess what Shure 535 is worth every penny. I still plan to get Klipsch too later on. Both are incomparable on sound quality. Klipsch goes for complete sound clarity with complete range in sounds crisp and clear. Shure empowers the music with deep strength full and complete fills you with another experience of music. It designs for you to enjoy music without the absolute clarity like klipsch that takes every nuances of sound. Shure take the music to another level. Klipsch takes on sound details. Shure takes music 🎵 to a deeper meaning giving it life and immersion. I want to get klipsch next round because I want to hear the complete range of then sound in the music every detail and every note. Right now I am enjoying Shure. I love both of them because they are different in sounds. I love Shures design. The ear piece is definitely cool and take plenty of design and science to bring out practicality and aesthetics. Hands down I cant go back to cheap headphones 🎧. Cheap buyers beware this product will drain your wallet and you will love every moment enjoying music with it. I am broke and lovin it! No regrets! My God I might be buying Klipsch X20i next. Shure 535 right now is giving me a good drug dose of music 🎶. Highly recommend! Klipsch vs Shure?
Both are pretty good!

Ps:
The first impression, I was disappointed at the beginning because it wasn’t as good. You need to get the headphone 🎧 playing the music to warm up the speakers for a day or two before it really show off it’s true performance. From a single star 🌟 to five stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 after a few days listening. Give the headphone a chance before concluding. Cheers 🍻"

You've probably not read a review that describes an electronic device as such but this describes what I've been experiencing ever since getting this new pair of Shure SE535's. I own many pairs of headphones as well as IEM's and I'm telling you that I'm having fun listening to all types of music again. So you ask me why and what is different than what I have now (which I won't mention). These IEM's really bring back the joy in listening to music again. First, pretty flat response. Bass not too emphasized, Highs not too bright or pronounced, Mids just right. Second, nice soundstage, music seems to ""pop"" and I can hear individual instruments and ""black"" (you know what I mean)... lots of space. Right now I'm listening with Schiit Modi DAC and Vali AMP... wow. Get some..."

36,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's fabulous !! I love listening to music with this earphone. I never experience anything like this. It's well balance. I could hear a lot of details in music I never heard before. I always use it with my audioengine d1. They work great together. I mainly use this earphone for acoustic and country. It sounds amazing. I would highly recommend this earphone. However, the con to this is that it takes some time to put on. Once I have them on, I really hate taking it off because I have to go through the problem of putting it on again. I use it for exercise sometime and I like the feature where I can bring the wire behind my back. It takes it out of the way when I workout. Overall, this is a awesome earphone. Maybe one day I would consider getting the shure se846, the $1000 earphone.
Ps. Get the clear one if you don't want to attract too many attention if you plan to use it everywhere such as the bus, bart, library, etc because the shure logo is not as noticeable with the clear drivers. I like using this earphone in public because people usually don't know that I have a $500 earphone. I feel safe with it compare to other headphones I owe (V-moda and Bose). I live in a bad area so being flashy is not good."

40,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really didn't want to spend so much for a pair of earphones, and so I bought many, many cheaper ones in a quest to find a pair that produce hi-fi quality sound. For the most point, the search was in vain (did find a few cheaper that did pretty good, such as Urbanfun dual drivers). It seemed that the earphones I tried did one or two things well, but lacked in some other way. And I have a certain ""standard"" of sound I am looking for. And so with reservations I forked over an obscene (in my opinion) amount for these. Are they worth it? Yes. But I would say if I had found the Urbanfun earphones earlier on, I might have been quite content with those (a tenth of the price). But alas, as I kept trying this or those, I found myself getting pickier and pickier, until I . . . Shure.

My annoyance at the price aside, these have fantastic sound. From lows to high the sound is even and pure. I would perhaps like a bit more on the high end (Something the Urbanfun do well--but not so well in the midrange). . . but for now, I'm done with my ""experiment."" These are the ones I go to when I want the best sound.

One word of caution, you may have to experiment a lot with the ear sleeves and position of the earphones to get the right fit for sound and comfort--getting both together is a bit of a trick (in fact, I don't wear them the way they are ""supposed to"" with the cords over the ears).

Sounds like I almost hate them? It's like that rock star everyone would hate--and eventually does--but gets away with it because they sound so good on stage. That's my analogy of these. They earned 5 stars, but only because they deliver.

[Update]

I ended up upgrading to the SE846--and glad I did (the sticker shock withstanding). The SE535 are amazing earphones, but I found the bass lacked the ""drama"" I was looking for (the SE846 exceeds my desire in that regard), and the treble could be better (again, the SE846 delivers on that). And the final niggle that led me to the upgrade was the high impedance that made them unusable with my portable devices, without an external amp; the SE846 has low impedance and works fine with my phone or tablet.

So my advice to anyone who is considering the SE535, go with the SE846 instead (if you can stomach the price)."

59,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sticker shock that the shure se535-cl delivers is nothing compared to the audio quality this timy package delivers. I like the noise isolating more than the noise canceling ear phones for a couple of reasons. Noise isolating is a passive technique, the form factor is small, and the weight is negligable. The noise cancelling headphones require a power source, actually create sound to cancel the incoming sound, and are much larger and heavier than their noise isolating counterparts. The se535's deliver excellent bass from such a small size. I primarily use mine while flying, working out, and during yard work. They easily block out the whining and crying kids found on most commercial flights, they are even excellent at blocking the hum of the lawn mower as I cut my grass.

Sure you could buy an adapter, but then you were left with a hodgepodge unmanageable mess of cords which still cost you a fortune.

I suspect some people will complain about the cost and suggest you stick with the SE530s, but I would respond that 1 - if you want to use it with an iPhone, the marginal cost is worth it to have the inline controller and 2 - once these things go out of warranty the marginal cost will justify itself real quick. Overall, these are fantastic and put my old E4Cs to shame (which were also fantastic). The replaceable cord means I don't have to baby these things all of the time for fear of damaging the cable (which will happen eventually with any earphone), which means I can use them more often and get more enjoyment out of them. But the sound quality is the biggest selling point obviously, it just doesn't compare to earphones even in the $200 price range that I've listened to. If you can't tell the difference, I suggest listening to a song with good base - I recommend ""Temple Caves"" by Mickey Hart - you won't even be able to hear the most powerful drum in the song with the vast majority of sound systems."

64,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was so happy with my purchase! Music sounds like I have never heard before!! Would recommend to anyone that plays or listens to music seriously!
65,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of Shure earphones and I couldn't be happier. The sound is phenomenal, clear and you can hear sounds and other instruments I couldn't hear before. The only drawback is the price, I am a little reluctant to take the earphones with me anywhere."
66,5.0 out of 5 stars,Upgraded from SE215. Much better treble and highs. You will lose tuned bass response but gain true bass sound.
67,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so freaking excited when my Shure se535s arrived. I tore the box open and pulled them from the cool metal case. I selected a song that I thought would be a good test and...I wasn't blown away. Okay, I just dropped $395 on a pair of earphones and they didn't sound much better than my broken in Shure se215s? I was beginning to panic a bit inside. My plan was to plug them into my iPod, crank up the volume and walk away so they could get burned in.

Two battery charges later and 20 hours later I tried again...

This time started by listening to my Shure se215s. Once again I listened to James Taylor - Enough to Be on Your Way. This song is a variety of highs, lows and mids. Once the song was over, I switched to the se535s and I heard it, I heard what $400 buys you. Wow! Once properly burned in, and compared to a $100 pair of earphones, my wallet sighed a breath of relief. These things really to sound wonderful but $400 worth?

Songs I used to critically test the se535s:
James Taylor - Enough To Be On Your Way. The kettle drum was tight, deep and defined. On my Shure e3c it was almost non-existent, on my se215s it was audible but faint, on the se535 it was very present. Though not as present as my Sennheiser over ear HD 280 Pros. The pluck of the metal guitar strings was crisp and detailed while Mr. Taylor's light breathy voice was crystal clear.

Enrique - Do You Know What It Feels Like (Ping Pong Song) - the ping pong ball lively bounced back and forth from one ear to the other. It's really a cool effect. Actually, there was very little noticeable difference between the se215 and se535 at the beginning of the song but as the song gets fuller, the 535s out perform the 215s.

West Bound Rangers - In Tall Buildings - Even if you don't like Bluegrass, you might like these guys. The 535s really give the acoustic, stand up bass a defined, rich sound. In the 215s, the bass sounds more like someone plucking a nice cello. The detail of the banjo and mandolin is amazing. I've never heard such a nice mix of detailed mid-range and full bass as presented to my ears in this song through the 535s. It's a real delight.

Goo Goo Dolls - Notbroken. This song can really sound muddy in lesser earphones. The driving kettle drums and dynamic instrumentations is just too much for most earphones. The song is best heard on full-range speakers like Definitive Technology BP7000s, the second best is a full, over the ear headphone but for in-ear earphones, the 535s are the only ones that can replicate the sound as is was meant to be heard.

Bella Sonus - Rincon de Espana. This instrumental guitar piece has some of the lowest bass I've ever heard in a song and completely destroys most ear buds. Even good ones sound weak once the bass hits. It appears for the first time at :48 and on a great stereo system or full-sized Sennheiser or Bose headphones, it's awesome! You should buy the song just to use as a test piece for your audio gear. But, I've never heard a pair of in-ear phones that can get close to doing the song justice. Even the 535s struggle but they do an impressive job for such tiny drivers.

John Powell - Test Drive from How To Train Your Dragon. Another instrumental piece that really gets full and at one point really throws a lot of sound at you. The thing I liked about listening to this song was my ability to hear individual instruments, not just a wall or orchestral sound and as the instruments get cranking mid-way though, the 535s keep up...easily.

Comfort, I've had them in my ears for a little over an hour listening to the above songs (and others while I type this). They are in my ears now and it's right at this point that I'm ready to take them out. They are very comfortable (using medium black olive tips), but not the most comfortable I've worn or own. That award belongs to my little white Klipsch S4i. Those little bud are really comfortable, also using Shure medium black olive tips.

Putting them on isn't all that hard. You get used to it and you'll find a system that works for you. I put them in my ear canal before looping the wire over my ears but you might do the opposite.

To me, the quality is top notch. My S4i's were so flimsy, they broke right over the stress relief attached to the plug after 9 months of use. I replaced them with the 215s.

I love the 535s. I wish Shure made a good iPhone cord. The iPhone cord they make is complete junk. One of the wires from the ""v"" to the connecting point is longer than the other side. Not intentional non-symmetry like Sony or Sennheiser buds, but only about an inch. It sucks. The quality feels cheap and...well, why put a crappy cord on a $400 set of earphones? I hope Shure fixes this and puts out a quality iPhone cord. I'd buy it.

Are these things worth $400? I say, four out of five stars worth. On a value scale, the $99 215s deliver more bang for your buck. Those things are hard to beat at under $100. The 535s are amazing giving you real bass, perfect mids and crisp highs that never stop, but they are indeed expensive. If you have the money, stop reading reviews and buy them, burn them in and love `em. They're awesome. If you have to give plasma to buy them, just get the 215s. You'll be impressed and will have money left over to buy more music.

I hope this helps."
68,5.0 out of 5 stars,After three years of very heavy use my old Shure headphones wiring became too frayed and I had to get new ones. The sound on these babies is unbelievably crisp and detailed and they are LOUD. I listen to a lot of techno and there is PLENTY of deep bass in these headphones. I'm very glad I made the choice to get these. My only complaint is that the cord does not include a mic/play/pause button on it.
69,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After leaving my late Shure SE315 earphone in a hotel, not to be returned, I waited a few weeks to anti up the steep price for the SE535-CL. The sound and fit are perfect. The only thing I don't get is the long connection wire with no upper connection place to put the volume control."

74,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love to listen with this headphone for many hours in a day.
This is the best one I have owned so far in the price range that I can afford."
75,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I know a lot of people will disagree with me but audio is very subjective and every set of ears is different when it comes to calling something a good sound. To me, the Sony MDR-7502 (I know they cost only US$50) have an amazing, amazing sound. I have four pairs, plugged permanently in places I am found the most. But I needed something for travel and after a lot of research and sadly no chance of a demo, I locked the Shure SE535 based on reviews.

Lets start with a big huge thank you to Amazon and Bestseller21 for delivering it well before the expected date. Now to the first thing you interact with, the packaging. The outer box and the metal one inside it are very nice. Things get not so nice after that for a bit. Being in advertising myself, if I were to sell something for $500, I would have added a little bit of drama to the experience of being introduced to and holding your earphones for the first time, perhaps a nicer presentation at par with the metal box which is brilliant.

The earphones themselves have a super solid feel to them, the cable feels robust to the touch. The earpieces have a finesse in their finishing, full marks. The carrying case is hard enough to protect your precious 535's inside a laptop bag as it gets tossed around through X-Ray machines at the airports. The volume control thing is a complete opposite and feels like a bulk purchase made in a hurry. The B&O A8 definitely sound much inferior but the attention to detail in the overall packaging is something to be inspired by. Perhaps Shure wanted to invest where it matters and that is how the earphones sound which is completely fair.

The tips are the same story, on the rubber ones, there is a rough wedge and once again, for a decent priced item, little details like these should not be missed. The finishing could have been much better.

Now that you are ready to plug the 535's into your music player (iPod Touch 4th Gen 64GB + AAC music converted from original audio CDs/FLAC in my case), if your heart sinks at the tinny sound, worry not, its just that you need to check the other tips. The one that creates the best seal creates the best sound. And they sound very good. I wouldn't say I was blown away immediately because for years my ears have been tuned to the Sony MDR-7502's. BUT! I have never been a fan of iPod/compressed music and the reasons I bought one was because I have a severe fear of flying and need something to reduce the drone of the engines and for use in the car. Unfortunately an iPod cannot drive the 7502's but boy do the SE535 completely transform your iPod or what!

I have tried the B&O A8 and the B&W P5's but none of them are sound isolating. The SE535 make you think you are in space with absolutely no sound in the surrounding (be very careful while using them in traffic areas, the sound isolation of the SE535 is way beyond anything else and you may not hear sounds that normally you won't miss). The vocals are amazingly clear. May be there should have been a little more bass and treble but that's up to individual taste. I listened to Pink Floyd, Annie Lennox, The Cure, Percy Faith, John Mayer, Led Zeppelin, Dire Straits and Sting. The sound is excellent I have ever heard from the iPod.

Plug them into your MacBook Pro and listen to the same tracks on VLC and its even better sound.

I request everyone here to shed some light on a peculiar thing. Different tips result in different sounds. The rubber tips allows for higher treble as compared to the rest but I found them VERY uncomfortable due to that rough ring.

If someone from Shure is reading this, please make the tips more comfortable. I like the sound of the rubber tips but they're really painful. The soft foam are alright but somehow none fit my ears, if I don't push them hard, I don't get the sound, if I push them hard, I can feel my heartbeat in my ears and sense a pressure on my eyeballs.

There is a warning in the user manual about a chemical ""known to the State of California to cause cancer"" and birth complication. Shure MUST elaborate on that and not let it drop down like a sledgehammer on the customer AFTER the purchase has been made. The warning is stupendously vague with no detailed information i.e. if it is known to the State of California, does the rest of the world not know about it or does it disagree with it? Can there be a line, if it is the case, ""The State of California is in a paranoid state"" written next to that warning?

So far the Shure SE535 are doing what I required them to do extremely well which was to provide sound isolation and excellent audio quality on the go. I will stick to my Sony MDR-7502's when I am stationary. Both of them are completely different products with their own respective roles. If you are looking for floor standing speakers like sound while moving around, go for the Shure SE535.

I will update as I experience them more.

Thank you for reading, hope it has been of some help."
76,5.0 out of 5 stars,A substantial upgrade over the SE-425's. I use them every day. Would easily buy again if I lost them.
77,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had the Shure e5c before and I can tell you that this is far better than it. The bass is stronger and more distinct. I recommend it with everyone.
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pricey but worth the cost.
They are durable, the sound quality is mind blowing, and it's so comfortable you forget you have them on.

Only one issue, is that after 3 years of using them 7 days a week (and often having them on while I fall asleep), the metallic wire that help keep them around your hears broke, on both side, making them not so comfortable anymore. But still no regret. Best $500 I ever spent."
79,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I moved up to the Shure SE535V earphones from the Shure SE210s, which are very good. The improvement in sound reproduction is quite remarkable. I am hearing things in music that is very familiar to me that I had not heard before. I use these earphones for listening to my iPod when on travel. I prefer the cable set up on the SE210s but that is a minor quibble. The price is a bit daunting but the quality of sound is worth the price.

88,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones a couple of months ago and when the left driver started acting funny I sent the pair back. Two weeks (!) later I received a package containing the left earphone from an SE425, the right from an SE535, and a less robust looking cord from some other model. I sent them all back and am now closing in on four weeks without headphones. Despite the awesome sound (particularly around the midrange), I can help but give these earbuds two stars due to the sheer incompetence of Shure's service department."

But after only one and a half years of normal use, the right phone, after a period of erratic function, finally fizzled out altogether.

93,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent sound.
94,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a mobile replacement for my long-running Sennheiser HD650s. I wanted something pretty good to listen on the go, and something that provided excellent sound isolation. I paid $433 for these on Amazon, and here is my bottom-line, no-nonsense review.

First off, I have to admit that using these on popular mobile players like iPods, iPhones, smart phones, etc are overkill. Chances are, these are much more capable than your run-of-the-mill players, and probably deserve much better audio files than the typical 192kbps (or worse, 128kbps) compressions on most players, although space is becoming more than adequate for uncompressed or lossless versions. If you're buying these, chances are you're not short on cash for affording the space.

In terms of sound quality, I've been desiring something that can really match my Sennheiser HD650s (which used to be a pretty good overall reference headphone, but now much overshadowed [in price only, and not truly by performance] by HD800s and a flood of other competitors). I've been using an Arcam rPac USB DAC for the laptop when traveling, and a Wooaudio WA7 for home use, so in terms of amps they at least match what these headphones are capable of.

Overall, here's the bottom-line: if you're looking for earbuds that can replace reference-class headphones, then you will be disappointed. The Shures do NOT match the HD650s in terms of overall capability, sound clarity, bass and mid-range depth. But this is like saying, for example, a BMW M5 is disappointing because it does not quite match a Ferrari F430 in performance. This is really an unfair comparison: both are designed completely differently, and both have completely different intentions. I would say that in terms of portability, isolation (hands down excellent), and overall sound delivery, the Shures are worth the money IF you have the right equipment to play them. On the sound, the Shures are ""relaxed"" and do not shove things down your throat quite like the HD650s do, which tend to reveal pretty much everything with sharp detail and can be tiring to listen to at times. The Shures just deliver a good balance of highs, lows (surprisingly good for earbuds), and mids which give just enough clarity without being tiring. If you've been listening to music for a long time, you will know what I'm describing. The HDs are just that: high-def, but tiring. They're too sharp (think of it this way: cymbals clanging in-person is actually pretty nasty to listen to, and the same goes for many instruments). The Shures, on the other hand, give you musical depth and clarity without shouting about it. They offer a great balance.

I personally would prefer a little more clarity though, but I'm figuring that if my wish were fulfilled, they WOULD become tiring like the HD650s. In addition, I must admit that the Shures are already on a very high performance level. If you're upgrading from, say, Bose earbuds (""blows,"" in my humble opinion - I can't believe that a company like that gets away with selling junk like those; then again, there IS a company called Monster Cable...), you will be entering a new world. Hidden details will suddenly be revealed, but that's if you have the right equipment to drive these. On typical iPhones or SoundBlaster XFi cards probably not as much as they deserve, but they're still a discernable step up from most earbuds in the $100-200 dollar range.

Overall, I would definitely buy these again. I find myself listening to these for hours on end because of their comfort and incredible sound isolation. I could just wear these on planes and sleep because the foam buds are very comfortable. And the sound is just about right for long term listening without being harsh or too detailed. I can turn up the sound high and really relax and enjoy the music without my ears aching.

One more CRUCIAL POINT: the cables are detachable and replaceable, adding substantial service life to these. If you wreck the cable (which might eventually happen from normal wear/tear), you just have to pay ~$60 for a replacement and snap them onto the buds = problem solved. This is a major bonus point.

Overall: If you are looking for isolation, good enough sound clarity, and something unique, then these are for you. However, if you are looking for a complete mobile replacement for your big cans, then you will be disappointed. It's probably unrealistic to expect so. Trust me, I've even blown $1,300 on AKG's K3003s, and it was by far the biggest disappointment of my life - it's simply unrealistic to expect small buds to deliver the way big cans do (I returned them - I won't discuss them here because they belong in another review)."
95,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best ! Fit perfectly in my ears and sounds perfect. on stage is the best ear phone i ever had

97,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i think i will tell my whole story with earphones over 10 years and hope you understand how worthy it is to spend over 500$ for an earphone set.

i really think that my sin is keep buying cheap earphones. I buy an earphone about every 3 months and never found something decent. Used to buy low to mid-end price range. my most expensive set was around 75$. I really though its silly or should I too stupid to buy an earphone for over 100$ ( its just an earphone for God sake), but I was absolutely mistaken.

i am using earphone for gym, running, ipod, PC audio music and gaming ( pc and handheld console PSP and DS). and I never found a decent set for my use. when i heard about noise cancelling / isolating sets, I tried one from Bose (headphone) and I was shocked. i really had great experience with that tech, but I found headphone is useless for me since i need earphone ( size matter for me ) I can't go outside and be like a nerd outside with headphone top of my head. i tried noise cancelling from bose ( they got one model ) and one from monster. they were great but i didn't think They do the job especially for gym and running since they can't be really fixed over my ear ( maybe its my problem).

i went online searching for reasonable price and the the Klipsch Image S4 earphones price got my eye. i saw the shure set and the crazy price ( and i was totally mistaken for even think about it). i went deeper into shure and i was curious why would it cost that much. most gadgets sites gave it incredible reviews. i was really hesitating but what make risking my own money is the size and features, you can fix the shure 535 into your ears and do hard sports ( running and aerobics). moreover, it got triple driver ( base and speaker ) so i went to amazon and order it. what the heck, i can sell them later if it disappoint me.

when i receive the set. set my gear and play music in my ipod and lost my mind. extremely perfect sound with base ( i like alternative music), couldn't believe an earphone could do that, kept playing my musics, went to the gym and test it on my console and never been happy like that. the 500$ didn't gone with the wind. what make me wrote this review is my crazy test. I got a 7.1 set in my pc. I playback a linkin park music on my pc, set the volume to the maximum and the shure set was in my ear with my ipod. the most tremendous isolating gear i heard in my life. i couldn't hear a single tone from my pc ( except the base that was booming my stomach :). this test made me wrote this review, i never wrote a review in my life for my stuff, But i really like to share my experience this time. i repeat again, you will never regret. this set worth every penny."

But it can fit all music in a acceptable way. BTW I like the appearance. Not to mention, it looks so much like those used by performers on stage."
108,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
Sound quality is very good in the mid range. Vocals are very clear. Percussive attack and decay is well defined. The overall sound stage is very good. Highs are slightly harsh but not unpleasant. Bass is relatively non-existent, even with an optimum ear piece fit (which is part of the design problem). Sonicially, these are very good for vocal and acoustic performances, providing you don't move around much. If you like deep bass, look elsewhere.

Comfort is pretty good given their size, but the tradeoffs made by Shure in order to provide a reasonable fit are poor.

Cons:
The physical design is awful IMHO. After 6 months of nearly daily use, I've gotten pretty good at inserting them (requires a push and twist motion sort of like screwing them into your ears), but regardless of the ear bud material choice and size, there is never a sufficient seal or fit to give good bass response. Placement and insertion is very particular, and beats up the ear buds due to the need to slightly twist, or screw in the buds to get them to seat properly, which brings me to the cheap manufacturing..

First, I bought a pair of Shure earbuds some 15+ years ago, and the ear bud selection was virtually identical to what is provided with the SE 535s. None of them worked particularly well back then. One would hope after over a decade they might have done a little R&D to figure out a better solution. The nozzle/mount for the buds is a narrow, cheap plastic piece of junk. Today, one of them broke off (see attached picture) while changing out buds. A really bad design and manufacturing choice to be sure IMHO. It doesn't take much imagination to see the fragility of such a design. For the cost of these, this design is remarkable in its short sightedness.

Also in the image is the triple flange bud (I find they seem to work best for my ears - all other options just fall out regardless of size). If look carefully, you'll see a pinch in the outer flange, which probably accounts for the unsatisfactory seal. That pinch is caused by the need to actually twist the earphones in order to get a proper fit. Another bad design choice.

Over all, after 6 months, I'd say go to another vendor. These don't hold up given their cost."
109,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Hugely expensive but these sound like the music is originating from inside your own head, as other reviews have said.

My go-to earphones have been Shures since SCL210's, and I've had SE215's and 315s. These are clearly a cut above. It's hard to describe how much cleaner the sound is.

Two downsides are the price, if you're spending $500 on earphones you'd better get your worth out of them and the earpiece cords seem to hang more awkwardly than the other models. The included handset controls didn't seem to work with my HTC one m8 phone either.

110,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these based on the great reviews. I am definitely not an audiophile but I know what I like hearing and what I don't. Perhaps it was my fault for not listening more closely to reviews but without trying headphones on it's really hard to know.

Like many reviewers have stated, these headphones lack bass. It's not completely devoid of bass but it's definitely not a main point of emphasis. I listen to a lot of modern pop music (Taylor Swift, John Mayer, Ed Sheeran, Josh Turner, Chris Young, Ariana Grande, Maroon 5, Brad Paisley, Aerosmith, Def Leppard...) and I just didn't like the way my music sounded with these headphones. I wouldn't classify myself as a basshead but I definitely like bass. These just lacked the punch I desired.

To be fair, I only used them for a bit over 48 hours or so but I wasn't happy with them so I felt it was best to just return them. They fit pretty well considering I have relatively small ears and the cord is very flexible. The cord does not utilize the flexible metal wire near the ear pieces so that's either a positive or a negative depending on your preference. The construction quality is solid too although the use of plastic nozzles is a downside for something so expensive.

In the end, I exchanged them for the Shure se846. Wow!!!!! is all I can say. Worth the upgrade for me? Yes, but your mileage may vary."
111,5.0 out of 5 stars,As a touring musician I have the luxury if using the finest in ear monitors in the world. I must say that this product sounds as nice as my UE's and my Alien Ears monitors. I would recommend for any working musician or anyone that just loves to listen to music with pure clarity and separation.
112,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantasmagical! Only non-real words can describe these ear buds! I could talk about these forever but, I'll widdle it down to just a few facts to influence your decision ;)

Pros:
1. EVERYTHING.
2. 2 subwoofer drivers per bud
3. 1 tweeter per bud.
4. crossover in between them all (No matter what sound level you select they will deliver with zero distortion and acoustical perfection).
5. Industrial strength shielded cord.
6. Solidly built splitter.
7. Gold contacts at ear bud swivels and jack.
8. Ear buds swivel to minimize cord tangle.
9. Replaceable cord.
10. Comfortable in the ear when worn correctly.
11. 6 different ear bud grommets to suit each individual ear hole size and depth.
12. 37dB of insulation. So say a F-18 Super Hornet is landing right above your berthing - you'll feel the vibrations, but won't hear the noise!! HURRAY!

Cons: dun dun dun
1. Price. They are worth every penny and you'll be SOL if you have to switch to a lower standard for some unGodly reason.
2. The cord. Although it's one of the best I've played with, the shielding inside will make for this little loop to form. One must untwist in the was its wrapped. It isn't that big of a pain, but you want to keep it straight so the cord won't get kinked.
3. Swivel ear buds. Fantasmical idea and I wouldn't go back to the other style...EVER. But one should clean it occasionally. (Exceptionally gentle though - theres a mini gold wire centered for the electric to flow through.
4. The around the ear loop doesn't hold it's shape very well. It will re-bend when it goes around your ear but it'd be easier if it just stayed.

All 4 of the cons aren't really cons. Their just nuances of an amazing piece of technical marvel. These are by far the best ear buds I've used and the best personal sound instruments I've heard - in general! Meaning their better then even the over the ear and around your head types."
113,3.0 out of 5 stars,"In my humble opinion, a product is only as good as it's relative competitors. For example, If I have $500 to $600 to spend what else could I buy? Could I get something better for the same price or maybe a little more or maybe a little less?

I bought this to Compare with my Audio-Technica ath-ckr9 & ckr10 because I noticed people were saying the Audio Technicas are clearer and have better bass. Not a bassy headphone, but people are comparing the audio-technicas with the shure se846. They're saying it's better or the closest competitor.

Also, I purchased this because I was really impressed with the se112 which only cost 50 bucks.

Here's what I'm using to compare:

I'm Biased:

First I would like to say that I'm biased. I really love the ckr9 and ckr10. With an equalizer, you can get just about any type of sound you want out of these puppies. Whether it's bright, warm, bass heavy, no bass etc.....

Often, I feel like I got duped by the marketing department after purchasing headphones but with the audio technicas, I feel like I robbed Audio Technica because they are way underpriced....

For some crazy reason, the audio technicas really shine and even seem to sound better outside. After souping up my phone, I remember one day I was walking on a main street in Chicago and my music volume was on level 15 out of 75. Before I could think, I said to myself:

""Yeah they sound good now, but lets see how good they sound in a noisy environment."" Then I quickly said to myself, ""duh... you are in a noisy environment"". Needless to say I was amazed....

The only headphones for around the same price as the ckr9/10 I've found that compare to the audio technica's is the Dunno 2000J. Those puppies are really good although I missed the bass, loudness and sound isolation of my Audio Technica's. But if someone said they liked the Dunno's better than the Audio Technicas, I would understand.

Equalizer:
I Always Use An Equalizer... Always!!!!! This is where the iphone was really limited for me. On the contrary, this is where the Audiotechnica's usually outshine all the other brands. They respond extremely well to amplification. Whatever you can through at them, they can handle without getting distorted.

My Review:

I can sum it up by saying:

""Grand Opening, Grand Closing""

First, these things are uncomfortable for my ears. At $500 sorry but comfort should be a given especially when I can get the audio technica's for only $100 to $300.

Sorry..."
114,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 5th pair of Shure headphones. Simply the best.
115,2.0 out of 5 stars,hurts my ears!! Uncomfortable so despite the good sound quality I cant enjoy the music. Returned.
116,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me a long time to decide to actually spend the money on these. I consider myself somewhat of an amateur audiophile, at least when it comes to headphones, so these were at the top of my wish list. I'm so happy I made the plunge because now that I have them, I'll have trouble going back to anything else."
117,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best quality in ear headphones available worth every penny, deep bass, excellent treble, a vast array that can pleasantly accommodate any taste of music. Sound isolating technology as well with triple-bass woofers, absolutely incredible!!!!"
118,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product. The only downside, the cable for the iphone attachment should be the same quality as the original cable which comes with the earphone."
119,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound coming from these little gems is phenomenal. I love how they lay flat in your ear. You can lay on your side with your ear to the ground and there is no discomfort. Pricey, but well engineered."
120,5.0 out of 5 stars,"big fan of headphones, I think I have worn more head phones than my head can handle. After realizing I was starting to thin out on top I switch to a nice pair of ear buds. I had crappy earbuds and long periods of time your ears ache from them being in place, this is not the case for these. It took me a while to pick the right one reading the different reviews. but If you like sound, and all the lows and highs. This is a good set to get. I I could afford the nicer one I would have purchased them. but I keep them in there case and dig them out when I want to listen to music they way they should be listen too. If I can't blast it through my stereo."
121,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always had an appreciation for good sound, with headphones I am still learning whats out there, I also have a pair of B&O A8 headphones which I thought were pretty good. When I first came over these on Amazon, I thought that that the price was pretty high so I put them on my wish list for a while and 'thought about it.' Finally the other day I pulled the trigger on them, with the mindset that if these werent the best headphones I had ever used, bar none I would return them. After a couple days use I can say that I am going to keep them, they are unbelievable. (You know how Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear on BBC says ""they are UNBELEIVABLE!"" thats what I mean here)

First and formost these things fit like earplugs, so they block out all other sound. They have great bass, and unbelievable sound clarity. To compare these to my B&O headphones is like comparing a 3 series BMW to a Lamborghini. It is night and day.

Even when I walk down the streets of NYC I feel like I am in my own world. They do take a little getting used to fit wise, and they are not something you can easily remove and put back in. But the sound quality is worth it, especially if you like classical music.

This is my first set of serious headphones, and I am very pleased. I would purchase these agian."
122,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile, to the point that I recognize every detail (soundstage, presence, etc.), but I am able to hear imperfections in some of my favorite music. Things that I didn't hear before. And as crazy as it sounds, I love that! Things like hearing a guitarist miss a strum pattern. These bring out the ""human-ness"" of music rather than the mastering. Don't get me wrong, the music still sounds incredible. With a little EQ, I still get the full range that I was hoping for. But being able to hear the music for what it actually is, is very cool to me.

For the past several years, I've been using Shure e4c buds with custom ear molds from Sensaphonics. They were very good, but didn't hold a candle to these. When my e4cs died, I was looking for another less expensive set to get me by, as I was looking at getting another more expensive custom pair (JH Audio). The e4cs spoiled me, so anything less was not going to be acceptable. So I ""settled"" for the Shure SE535s, and was greatly surprised at how I wasn't actually settling at all. And while I'm sure the higher end IEMs are better (JH Audio, Westone, UE, etc.), these are more than satisfactory. I'll definitely be getting custom ear molds for these as well, but have found that the triple-flange sleeves, cut down to fit, work great. I'll be using these for casual listening, as well as IEMs while playing guitar.

The only thing keeping me from giving these 5 stars is the cable. It comes with 2 cables. One is for volume control only, and the other is for volume control and phone accessibility. The one for phone accessibility only works on iPhones, and I have an Android. On top of that, since these already come with an attenuator for volume control, the controls on the cables are unnecessary, and add to unnecessary ""bulk"". I might look into getting some better after-market cables for these.

But overall, great little IEMs."
123,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do you love music? Are you a crazy audiophile? Do you love putting headphones on and turning the rest of the world off? Are you absolutely nuts for high-def audio with 320+kbps streams? Then this is the pair of headphones for you ... IF you have the spare cash to spend. Here are some pro's and con's first, and then I'll explain:

Pro's:

* Large selection of ear buds
* Majestic highs, balanced mids and perfect bass.
* If these headphones where a religious icon, they would be the Dalai Lama for their perfect balance and harmony.
* Light weight enough so they don't bother you at all.
* Heavy enough to have a decent feel to them.
* The cord is think and durable.
* The cord is also decently long! Several feet!
* Very good at sound insulation assuming you use a ear piece that fits you.
* The 'detachable' part of the cable (right next to the actual drivers) swivels / rotates so it's super easy to fit over your ear or in any other position.
* Did I mention the sound is absolutely amazing?
* You will be very hard pressed to 'max' out these in-ear headphones.
* Beautifully crisp.

Con's:
* Price. Yeah ... they really are a bit of a hit on the wallet.
* While the cable is rather durable and seems well made, mine is starting to develop a kink near the left driver.
* No cable clip. For a cable this long, is really does need something to clip to yourself ... or maybe it did come with one and I lost it, but currently, when I walk it's a long cable dangling around randomly. Annoying at times (and at other times I'm thankful it's that long).
* If you play any low quality audio, you will REALLY notice it being low quality.

Recommendations:
* Don't 'curl' the cable much (just leave it out on the table or something).
* For best results, use an AMP/DAC. It'll get you better quality audio than your regular headphone plug. And yes, with these headphones there is a significant quality/sound different with and without the DAC.
* For best audio insulation: try the black foamy plugs. Of course make sure to use the right size! Very important! Or if you're more adventurous, try the triple flange plug ... It works wonders once you get used to it.

Explanations about audio quality:

I'm no audio expert, but I can tell you this: if you're currently using something like the iPhone headphones or $40 store bought ones ... you really will notice a huge difference in audio quality with these headphones. That said, they also take a little bit of time getting used to due to their 'natural' sound.

Unlike other headphones which try to over power the bass (yeah, I'm looking at your cheap quality headphones!), the SHURE SE535's are balanced ... balanced almost to a fault. Not too much bass, not too high highs and sprinkled with just a right about of mid-tones.

Nothing will ever be 'washed' out, 'bland' or boring with these. You will hear every nuance, cello, and pin drop in the song all in a nice 'natural' way.

Why do I say 'natural' with quotes? Because at this price range for these types of headphones, this is as close as sitting infront of a real band/orchestra that you'll get. It really is amazingly crisp, clean and un-filtered audio. It's pure.

My conclusion: if you have the cash, get these."
124,5.0 out of 5 stars,"IMPORTANT: I've owned several pairs of IEMs before these that I've enjoyed (Shure SE310, Etymotic MC5, Sennheiser CX880), but recently decided it was time for an upgrade. When I received these I was incredibly disappointed. The ergonomics were terrible and I couldn't get the isolation I was used to with my other IEMs. None of the provided tips nor my Comply Tx-100 eartips allowed me to get deep insertion, and the great isolation I was used to, due to the large size of these headphones coupled with the nearly 90 degree angle between the body and the eartip. The large olives provided an acceptable solution, UNTIL I ordered and received the Comply P Series eartips. They are longer than any of the provided eartips and longer than the other Comply tips, as well, allowing me to deeply insert the eartips and get an excellent seal and great isolation.

Anyways, once you have a good fit these are stunning little headphones -- vastly outperforming my other IEMS (Shure SE310, Etymotic MC5, Sennheiser CX880) and sounding excellent straight from my iPhone 5. Being a bit of a headphone enthusiast, I can't help but compare them to my other headphones. I also own the Audez'e LCD-2, and the SE535s really can't compete with those, but I would never expect them to given the price and size difference. However, they really do give my Sennheiser HD650s a decent run for their money in terms of sound quality, while having the distinct advantages of being tiny, portable, and easily driven by an iPhone.

For anyone who cares about such things, I'm comparing my SE535s out of my iPhone to my full size phones when plugged into an AMB M^3 headphone amplifier, and fed by an old Parasound DAC 1500. Given that the 535s sound as good as they do completely unamped, they're killer little headphones when you can get a proper seal. Highly recommended.

SUMMARY: If you're unable to get a good seal (the most obvious way to tell is if there isn't much bass), try the Comply P series eartips. They are longer and will essentially guarantee a great fit as long as you're comfortable with something hanging out in your ear canal (and if you're not, stop buying expensive IEMs)."
125,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure Warranty will only honor their 2 year agreement if you purchase from an authorized retailer. I have spoken to their customer service and they said that Amazon is an authorized retailer, but some of the other sellers here are not. That means you'd have to buy right from Amazon themselves.

Take that into consideration when you buy, it looks like several reviewers here have relied on the warranty. Shure says they also won't do repairs on purchases from non-authorized retailers. I will post a link to their authorized retailer list when I can find it.

As for quality, they are nice but I don't think I have a source good enough to allow me to fully appreciate them. I love my 215's."
126,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received my order yesterday, and couldn't wait get it out of the box. First off, I was impressed with the packaging of this product... (Steel box) and the supplied accessories (Airplane adapter, volume adjustment adapter, extra ear plugs and cleaner)...Then, we come to the meat of the matter, the headphone set itself. My tunes never.. and I mean NEVER sounded so full, rich, deep, high, vibrant and just plain beautiful. I had to turn the sound down on my iPod touch, which I'm use to playing in the halfway point of the devices volume control... This, of course has the effect of cutting down on the drain on my iPod's battery. This rig is EXACTLY what I needed to be able to enjoy hard core Rock and roll, mellow jazz, rhythm and blues, and old school funk. While the price is not for the squeamish, the rewards for paying that price are well worth it to me... I recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good back-beat, driving bass, and bun-kicking vocals...These headphones deliver!"
127,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these buds for over a year and love them. I try to take care of them, but they can certainly handle some abuse as well.

The sound quality is crisp, neutral and has sound imaging that I get goosebumps over. One piece of advice though before you pull the trigger, get a nice audio player with DAC or amp and you will see what the full potential is. Someone gave this product 3 stars because it does not sound good with his LG G3.....no crap. It's not the best device to deliver audio or power these buds. I enjoy listening out of my Fiio X1 or my iP6. Yeah believe it or not, lossless music sounds almost as good through my iP6 as my X1. My life pretty much changed the minute I started using these headphones and I will never go back to Beats/Bose/[insert new popular brand here].

Buy it, there will be no regrets."
128,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned Shure ear buds forever. My last one was the SE530, which I thought was pretty good. I've also bought Ultimate Ears 10 Pro earphones, which was great for low ranges but was missing the highs. I just put on the SE535 which arrived today. My music has never sounded better. I listen to a lot of jazz, classical, and rock. The SE535s has remarkable fidelity; I'm hearing details I did not catch before. At least for my ear, and I would consider myself an average audiophile, the SE535s are the best in-ear phones I've heard. Pricey, but because I now consume 90% of my music through my iPod, these are most definitely worth it."
129,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Shure 535 earphones about a month ago and the total verdict is a full page of +'s. The sound is amazing (after having custom ear molds made....My ears are weird....difficult fit with standard earphones has always plagued me). The bass is deep, smooth and balanced. The mids and highs are crisp and sweet with no coloring. One of the most amazing things about these earphones is the effect that their near perfect attack of a cymbal or drums or anything has on the listening experience. I'm not an expert..just a guy who loves good sound and these are the first earphones I would rate with Grado PS1000 or Sennheiser HD800's and at less than a third their cost. If you love music and need excellent earphones I cannot recommend the Shure 535's more highly. OH ...and to the point of build quality, I simply don't understand statements by others that criticize the 535's build quality. I find them to be excellent in this regard. They feature sturdy replaceable cables in case yours become damaged with use and they are in every way solidly built as far as I can see."
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a Christmas gift for my 21 year old grandson who is a drummer in a rock band. He was extremely pleased with the ear buds.
131,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best set of earphones you could get. I tried Sennheiser PX450 and these are way better. You can read my review of PX450.

At $400, I'd say it is worth every penny."
132,5.0 out of 5 stars,You'll want to invest in a good DAC in order to really hear how amazing these earphones are. I highly recommend a DAC from Nuforce. The bass is incredible for the small size.
133,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure SE535 has the good sound for every level, the one disappointed point is that this IEM has narrower field."
134,5.0 out of 5 stars,They blew me away. Do not regret my purchase.
135,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Most people are looking for assurances that the reviewer of a product is qualified, so allow me to indulge briefly: I'm a lifelong musician, sound engineer, and headphone enthusiast/general audiophile. I love music not only for the artistry and quality of arrangement, musicianship, etc, but also for the beauty of sound that comes from the recording/mastering process, ultimately delivered through your speakers or headphones.

The first thing most listeners will notice with the 535's is their phenomenal mid-range response, which is largely out of style in most of today's popular (read: crap) audio products. The tight, clean bass is delightfully present in the mix without clouding over other ranges. The treble is bright and organic, not harsh and overpowering. The improved bass response, build design, and crossover sets these apart from earlier and lower models (I actually did an A/B test with the 425s vs 535s since I own both - the 535s won by a huge margin). I love cranking these puppies up...it feels like the music is emanating FROM MY BRAIN. Make sure you get a good seal on the 535's and they will change your life. Boom.

I have been very loyal to Shure for the past 5 years or so for their honest sound, quality builds, and great customer service. I had the E4G's and SE425s for several years, and when the cord broke on the former pair, they shipped me a brand new pair without question.

Bottom line: these aren't for ""pop"" audio listeners looking for destructively rumbling bass and over-cranked, shimmery highs. Try Bose, you will be more happy with the inaccurate replication of the music. For those seeking full, powerful, honest sound with a great build and innovative features, buy these and don't look back."
136,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was surprised how good sound it was for vocal, it feels like the singers are whispering at me. However, that's not a only genre I listen.
I listen lots of orchestra, instr. included music, new era, heavy base, progressive music as well.

I guess giving you specific example would make more sense.
I am currently really into ""Pianoguys"". One of their songs: ""What makes you beautiful"" , there is low-tone piano sounds at the beinning 0:00~0:13.
When I listen that song with this, the sound just get shattered with static sounds, and it was just total-failure.

And there are also constant-static sounds when you don't listen anything.
And the design, although it looks fancy and phenomenal, I do see that it will break quickly unless you put extra care on it.

So I went for Atomic Floyd Superdarts Titanium, which has superior durability.

However, I do see that this will suit for some specific people, but it wasn't just for me.

But I see this will definitely satisfy for some certain people. So my suggestion is, try it first if you can.

And if you read thru other reviews, people often complain about the durability issues. This was just no-no for me.

Any recommendation/suggestions/comments are welcomed."
137,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is utterly amazing. Exercising in the wee hours of every morning with these in my ears feels like an indulgence, exactly the polar opposite of the boredom I had previously. BUT, my second pair in less than two years seems already to be biting the dust. As someone else wrote, ""it was not the cable itself but the input point on the ear phone! "" For my first pair, this happened slightly after the one-year warranty had expired (goodbye $415!). For my second pair, the warranty is 2 years, so presumably I can get a replacement, but what a pain after only 6 months to have to forego my earbuds to wait for a replacement. Sound quality is 6, but having experienced the exact same problem twice, Shure quality control deserves from me at best a score of 1/2, which upon rounding the average gives 3 stars. To Shure: ""Fool me twice, shame on you, but fool me thrice, shame on me."" For me, there will not be a thrice. You've lost a customer who had dearly loved your product."
138,5.0 out of 5 stars,what else needs to be said?
139,5.0 out of 5 stars,no other words just fantastic. i already have the classic ue10's and these are better go figure. Not worth my time saying any more. sound - noise cancelling the best available and i possess every type of headset in the ultra high end side......
140,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been listening to headphones of many different kinds for many years, from ancient AKGs to the amazing Sennheiser 800's. Maybe I've been spoiled by superior headphones ( the best of which for me are Sennheiser HD 800, Sennheiser HD 650, Ultrasone Edition 8 and even Grado SR-1 ), but these Shure headphones are very disappointing. The midrange is actually quite good and the top end isn't bad. The trouble is with the bass. They tell you that the bottom end is very good if you get a decent fit. That certainly is not my experience. The bottom is, at best, barely satisfactory when compared to the first rate headphones I mentioned. There are many headphones that are much better for the price. I very much regret this purchase and would not recommend them unless you absolutely need an in-ear set of cans - in which case this may be the best available outside of the much more expensive customs."
141,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Insanely Great headphones. The Bass does lack when you first listen to them, but stay with it for a few songs and the unyielding clarity in all ranges makes these an obvious choice for all you audiophiles. It took a long time of research and reading to finally choose these and I could not be happier I did. They do not crackle distort or lose clarity with volume. I am a Runner so having a great sound for many miles is so important to me. The amount of noise suppression these have makes them a great choice as you already can't hear the world around you with no music playing. They make a completely isolated personal concert hall in which you can live. They are really comfortable, secure fit even with sweat. They require regular cleaning. The smallest amount of water, dirt, ear gross, etc will completely disrupt the sound and make you think they are broken. They do however have a nice filter to prevent any dirt, grime, or moisture from entering the actual bud and ruining it. Buy em, don't wait, buy em."

It has always had a looser conection than the right to the point of worring about it falling off when hanging around my neck waiting to get to 10,000 feet(air travel). Well it happened, left ear piece is gone, 500 bucks down the drain. Never again. Time to find out just how good customer support is with Shure. Incredible sound but beware of the connectors."

When I saw the newer 535s come out with the detachable cables I thought that was perfect since I wear them a lot and it would make replacing them a lot cheaper should the need arise.

First the reason for the 1 star. The detachable cables lead to significant problems. The fact that they're not a permanent connection means they lose contact between the cable and the ear piece. When you lose contact, obviously, you lose sound. The left and right channels cut in and out continuously unless I keep my head and body perfectly still. If I'm on the bus the jostling means I can't listen to a single song without frequent cuts. If I'm at my desk and I turn my head ever so slightly to look from my main monitor to the monitor to the right, same thing.

The sound quality is great. If these were solid and permanent connections, like my previous pair, I'm sure I'd have nothing bad to say. But what good is the quality if it cuts out? That's worse in a lot of ways.

Search online (head-fi dot org in particular) and you'll find copious reports of the same problem. I thought I'd just put up with it and I did for a long while but I'm just sick of it now. Unfortunately I'm past my warranty. I tried contacting Shure customer support and they just gave me the run around so I have no idea if they'll replace them. It's clearly a manufacturing/design flaw and should be a no-questions asked replacement. Damned if they'll tell me that.

I even bought high quality after-market cables and while that improved the sound quality tremendously and the cutting out problems a little bit it did not solve the problem.

I wish I could say order these but at this price, with the high probability for having the same problem, I'd say move on to another company.

-- UPDATE 9/30 --
I've taken to pulling the buds off the cables and cleaning both the male and female parts of the connection with alcohol every couple of days. This seems to improve the consistency of contact between the cable and buds. Still not perfect, but much better. I'm bumping up to 2 stars since it's more bearable but, still, for something of this price that's hardly acceptable.

-- UPDATE 10/10 --
Well, with the increase in removing the buds to clean the connections I guess it was inevitable. The cables have a single wire centered in the connection end. The buds have a ""tube"" that the cable slides into. The tube is actually two pieces, two half-pipes, if you will. Well, after cleaning just a few minutes ago I reinserted the cable and gently snapped it into place. Not so quick! Something happened and it wouldn't click into place. I looked inside and one of the half-pipes was broken away.

At present I'm looking into getting custom IEMs. If I'm going to spend a lot of money I may as well get something exceptional. Right now I'm looking at JH Audio JH13. Considerably more expensive but generally rated higher for sound quality and build quality."
147,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a good, solid set to buy. $400+ & so they better be, but if you can afford it you can't go wrong."
148,2.0 out of 5 stars,Serious lack of bass. Acurate but simply lacking emotion and power. Mids and highs are spectacular. Comfort for my ears was terrible. Unit pressed on ear cartilage and caused pain within 20 minutes.
149,5.0 out of 5 stars,simply amazing! sound is unbelievable; se535 are my first high-end earphones and i just love them. These are very comfortable to use for long time periods and the quality of sound is exquisite!
150,4.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive but worth it. cord too long.
151,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The real test for any earphone is Up in the Air, This Earphone: in the ground... in a quite place... has an amazing sound, but once you are in noisy place like a GYM or in a Plane you start losing that pure sound, I keep squeezing them in my ears all the time to reduce the surrounding noise effect, so my point is: Shure needs to ad noise canceling button just like Bose Headphones,which I don't own because they are too big to carry.
Finally $450 is too much money for (not perfect Earphone), I wish I didn't buy it.."
152,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones. I had the SE 530's and this new enhanced model doesn't have a great improvement in sound quality but the fit is much better. I like that the cord can be replaced with out having to replace the earphones just like my UE Triple Fi 10's. My only complaint would be that the cord is to long which would be down to personal taste. I'm very happy with these overall.
153,3.0 out of 5 stars,The Shure SE535-V Triple High-Definition MicroDriver Earphone is a huge disappointment. Very difficult to keep in your ears. When they do stay in - should you turn your head ever so slightly ... one ear cuts out for a moment. Very cheaply made. There was a time when the Shure name meant quality ... not anymore. Way overpriced!!! Basically unusable. Don't make the same mistake I did.
154,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny.
155,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Warning: if you are a drummer or use these to exercise, they WILL break quickly - as the swivel design allows a gap between the cable and IEMs which cause sweat or liquid to seep in. The design is flawed. The first pair broke in less than 2 weeks, second pair broke in less than 3 days of usage. Move on to JH or something better without this awful swivel design unless you only use for recreational use (but who would do that with a pair of $500 IEMs)?"
156,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heavy bass better. Amazing bass heavy but not overdone like beat deez nutz. Lol. Quality so far so good held up against jogging. But now time to upgrade to SE846 or wait til new beats apple lightning cable smart. headphones come out
157,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had given 2 stars in the same week my earphones were delivered to me ...
The first impression was the following:

""The sound is louder than the average earphones but there's a lack of bass
Clumsy adjustment on the ear.
I do prefer my B&W/Bose/Sennheiser cheaper earphones.
It's not worth $400""

However I must change these statements after 4 months, because the sound of the earphones changed due to the so called BURN IN or BROKE IN...These expressions really do make a lot of difference and they mean that your headphones and your earphones need some time of effective use to deliver the sound that you expect from them.
That is what happened to my SE 535...
100 hours of intensive listening and the bass shows up...the sound pressure is magnificent now....the sound stage unique !!!
Considering that it's an earphone it's amazing how involving the music comes into your ears, with deep bass, clear mids and highs, and a lot of resolution....you get a real connection to the music.
The sound is much higher than you can bear if you plug it to your Ipod or your pc.
I changed the plugs to a minor size, thar comes in the phones package, and got a better fit in my ears."
158,5.0 out of 5 stars,DAAAAAMMMMNNNN，DAWWWWG

If you love music, you must love Shure.

This is an investment.....a sensual and hedonistic investment."
163,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are amazing!!!!
164,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice but not to to the extent of justifying up to 4 times the cost of other high end more common ear phones. It is hard to conclude that the quality is better by a factor of 4.
165,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the SE530 and I gave it 5 stars. However, The fit here is more snug and the bass is way too overwhelming drowning everything. Hence, What worked great for the SE530 does not work here for me."
166,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They don't sound natural and the bass is weak.

I'm ok with the fact that they are a little uncomfortable. I'm looking for great sound. I tried various shells and was able to get a good seal, but that didn't help the sound enough.

I don't recommend these."

168,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great but too big for my female ears
169,2.0 out of 5 stars,The sound seemed wonderful. A little difficult to get set in ears. Deal killer was I could NOT replace the sleeves (tips). It is like slipping a size 5 shoe on a size 10 foot--impossible! Am I the only one with this problem? Had to return them.
170,3.0 out of 5 stars,I was a little apprehensive about purchasing these earphone because of the price but I love listening to music and I like good quality sound. But unfortunately I had trouble with getting the right fit for the earphones. Doctors have told me that my ear canals are narrow and this may have something to do with it. But I tried different earpieces and they never felt comfortable or seem to stay put. The little amount of music I did hear sounded pretty good but never had enough real time to hear their real potential. I had to return the earphones because they just don't work for me.
171,5.0 out of 5 stars,"but the best for outdoors active wear (once u get the fit right)! I still prefer a one piece set for outdoor use, but the quality is not there."
172,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are outstanding.... and I mean outstanding!!! Clear and detail
173,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had waited for a while until I needed to replace my Shure SE530 earbuds, which I think is an incredible earbud. I realized the new Shure SE535 earbuds had a detachable cable, so I ordered the new earbuds with the greatest of expectations. A word to the wise. The new Shure SE535 earbuds have a new design from the previous model, Shure SE530. The cable is detachable, however the angle of wiring from the casing is different and causes a major problem with people like me who have an interferance with a ridge of ear cartilage that does not provide a seal due to the change in design. If you look at images of the new Shure SE535 earbuds you'll realize the major difference. I cannot use the new model because of the change. I was very dissapointed when I realized the difference. I was surprised that there wasn't more complaints concerning the change. You only have the option of returning the item or having earmolds built for the earbuds. Be warned if you buy these earbuds from a merchant other than Amazon, you'll be hit with a ridiculous restocking fee which will frustrate you into never using an outside merchant again to save a little money. Do your research."
174,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my first pair of Shure's I wanted to upgrade to one of their better earbuds. These were a good balance between value and cost. The base-quality could be a little more rich i.e. I listen to a lot of trance, etc. (the mids and highs are great e.g. you will hear stuff in your music you have never heard before). Most importantly, this allows me to tune-out the world and focus on graft. ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS i.e. I could not live without these and they have become completely indispensable to me."
175,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones sound AMAZING! They are exactly what I would expect to hear after paying $500. But, (and it's a big ""But"") after using these for slightly over one month the supposed durable cable connector (the part that connects to the ear phone itself) became loose distorting and cutting off sound every time I moved the cable. I figured it was just the cable so I paid an additional $40 for a replacement cable, and quickly discovered it was not the cable itself but the input point on the ear phone! Now I have to send them back to Shure for repair! This in my opinion is simply unacceptable for a pair of $500 earphones hence the 2 star rating! And just a caveat, I in no way mistreated the earphones. They were kept in the case (the case is poor quality btw) when not in use, and were handled exactly as instructed! So, I recommend if you buy these, make sure the connection is not loose, and wiggle the cable while music is playing to make sure there is no break in sound! If so send them back immediately or you'll be stuck having to deal with Shure directly!
Got the new pair and they were awesome, so much so, they got stolen. Now I'll have to fork over another $500...geez..."
176,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good, my boyfriend likes it very much!"
177,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's something to the saying ""You only know what you know."". Before my purchase of the Shure SE535-CL, the best earbuds I'd owned were the Bose Noise Cancelling QC20i models, which I can not live without the noise cancellation feature, because I travel a lot for business. I've always read in reviews where pure audiophile types were always bashing Bose earphone products for there manufactured synthetic sound, which for me was the best I'd heard, so I always took it with a grain of salt. Curious, I recently purchased the Shure SE535s, because you only live once and I wanted to at least put the notion to rest and support my suspicion that some people are too finicky.

Well I've got to eat some crow, because as most have attested to, when you try the Shure SE530 or SE535 on for the first time, you hear things in music you never heard before with other earbuds. I have to say though, when I first tried them on out of the box, I was immediately going to send them back, because when I first tried them on with the medium sized black foam ear pieces, I did not get a good seal. I tried on various other ear pieces with crappy results also, until I tried on the large sized black memory foam ear pieces, which sealed perfectly and to my surprise actually cancelled more noise than the active noise cancelling function of the Bose QC20i, albeit, a bit less comfortable than the Bose.

The sound quality is impeccable and well worth the money! When I move up in the world, maybe one day I'll get a chance to try out the SE846 series, but I know what I know now and the Shure SE535s are the best I've owned and heard so far. It's crazy how the technology and quality for a pair of earbuds have stood the test of time. This model has been out for over six years and is a testament to the quality that goes into the research and innovation at Shure!! Don't hesitate, get these! If you don't like them, I'm sure you did not get a proper fitting with the proper ear piece. Kudos Shure!! I'm a new fan!"
178,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried multiple in-ear monitors including Westone 20, 40 and 50. The Shure 535 was the best to my ears. It is a matter of taste but the Shure 535 was the most neutral without exaggerating either end of the spectrum. Many ear phones often push the bass fairly heavily and sound great at first but are often masking more subtle details. The Shure has a good sound stage. The fit is fantastic and they can be worn for long periods of time. They are amazing in the isolation from noise. I recommended them without hesitation. The Shure 435 is nice but is rather thin in the lower ranges and are not as satisfying."
179,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After having my SE-315s lose sound in the right ear I wasn't sure whether to repair or replace them. In the end I did both. Shure have a very good warranty program and even though my 315s were themselves replacements from a previous repair (E3Cs), they completely replaced again them after 18 months of use and all I had to pay for was the cost of shipping them to Shure.

In the meantime though I bought the 535s and also got some custom sleeves made by Sensaphonics. The 535s blew me away with how good they are. Even with standard sleeves they produce so much more power than the 315s (which I now have back from repair), and the bass is so much tighter and more defined. Listening to some of my best recorded tracks (Peter White - Perfect Moment SACD, Fourplay-Fourplay DVD Audio) is just heaven on a stick with these. The custom sleeves make a great pair of headphones even better, although be warned they are quite temperamental and it took quite a few tries to insert them so that I didn't end up with the sound tubes blocked. Putting them in and out of your ears is also a major undertaking but once in you're in for a real treat.

Sad to say the 315s sit in the drawer now as they just sound flat and dead by comparison. Even my over the ear HD-650s can't compete with the 535s. It just makes me wonder how good the SE-846s are ... maybe one day ..."
180,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Impressive sound and impressive construction.
These are well made, thoughtfully designed and marvelous sound; specifically, neutral-ish fidelity, soundstage, bass, mids and highs.
These are built to last and with most in ear headphones giving way at the cables, $30 buys a replacement as these are detachable cords.
At this price, no headphones should be purchased with one or two year life expectancy. These are
built to withstand sweat, rigor, daily use and when the cable gives out, they are readily replaceable.

I have not experienced Shure's customer service, but I have read enough to know that they are a company that is consumer driven and responsive to complaints.
I have the Beyerdynamic T1 headphones and when I walk or exercise, it is all but impossible to enjoy music through poor quality in ear monitors after hearing the beauty of Beyerdynamic. I sought out in ear monitors that would not let me down after listening for hours through the T1s.
The Shure 535 fits the bill."
181,5.0 out of 5 stars,"why pay this much for you headphones? Ask yourself this: how much do you like music? how much have you spent on music as in i pods, i phones, downloading time, externals, etc. you owe it to yourself to get some good headphones. You think beats by dre are good? step up to a real company. If you do not want to spend this much then DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE or you will want them real bad. The ""plug"" style is the only ones i have found on the market that stay in during a workout. And they block the noise of the helicopters while i am working on the tarmac. But in Iraq heat, your ears will sweat. But not as much as over the ear headphones will. And at over 160 degrees F. with reflection off the aircraft, you cannot help to sweat. Best purchase of a headphones yet. no broken wires after over a year of hard use. loud as hell too. They are even better ones out there, but they cost $1,000! I will stick with these. After almost two years of daily use the one plug ripped. easy replacement though. I cannot recommend these enough. My wife tried them after just listening to the ones that come with her phone and her remark was ""oh my god! I did not know there was this much base in this song!"" enough said."
182,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The 535's are a near perfect earbud for most people. They offer a high quality sound at all frequencies, good bass reproduction and a good fit. The high sensitivity is a nice feature as well to allow people on their phones to conserve a little more battery. The 535's also have a replaceable cord in the event that it wears out, which at some point they all do.

How I use them:

Primarily for me, these are used at work in my cube and at the gym. They fit comfortably, but I did south out the fitting to a three tier silicone tip made by Etymotic. I have narrow ear canals so the drivers need to be small to fit right and seal correctly and the foam tips don't do it for me. I'm giving these 4 stars for the robustness off the product. The two things they begin to act up with are high heat and moisture. If I'm doing cardio at the gym, these can't be worn. The sweat accumulates in the filter and severely attenuates the signal. If you like the sauna, even though it's dry, the heat can destroy some if the more delicate parts in the driver. For those days I rely on an old pair of Etymotics that didn't cost me much. On the days I lift, I don't sweat nearly as much and these work great. They give a lot of isolation for the surroundings, stay in place and I can wear the cord on the inside of my shirt so it's not in the way. Overall these are very good and I would recommend them as long as your not going to push the limits."
183,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure has a stellar reputation within the music community. Very few musicians are not aware of their awesome mics and mixers. I own no less than 3 mics and 2 portable mixers. That is why I had zero reservations getting these. Shure would simply not offer these unless they were fantastic, right?

When I first put the Shure SE 535s in, I was underwhelmed. The sound was on the tinny side and the bass was weak. No matter which (included) ear buds I used ( and Shure includes many) nothing seemed to help. I was about to return them when I read some of the reviews on Amazon. How could so many people rave about this and yet they sounded so bad? It is not like the construction is cheap or the design is lagging. On the contrary, the construction and design are top notch, they are beautiful. Which makes it all the more painful that they sounded so cheap and hollow. Maybe it was my overly high expectations? I own many high-end reference quality head phones, how could an IEM come close? Other than my iPhone factory ear units, I do not own any other IEM's.

Then I saw one review in which the person said that ""not everybody's ears will fit the vast array of ear buds Shure supplies, and if you are one of these people - it will sound like s***."" He recommended a few other aftermarket ear bud companies. These companies offer a crazy array of diameters and - more importantly - LENGTHS.

I found one that fits and was super comfortable. Unlike the Shure supplied units, this one went far deeper into my ear. I was listing to some Jazz ""In the element"" by Emmet Cohen"" at the time and.... WOW!!!! Like a heavenly chorus, I heard the full sound for the first time. I quickly pulled out some Mozart, and Zepp., and it just got better. Clear, reference quality, sound with perfect mids and thick clean bass. Just what I expected - a professional reference sound instrument to sound like. I highly - highly recommend, but make sure your ear buds allow the IEM to go far enough into your ears so you can hear the full sound.

One last point. Some reviewers on Amazon thought the cord was a little thick. This is totally a Shure thing. These are designed to take abuse and keep working. That is what a professional music product is all about. After 3 years of very hard use ( and abuse) they are still in perfect condition. Thanks Shure!!!!!!!!!

***Thanks Ken S for your feedback on this review*** The after market foam tips I use are the Comply Professional P-100. I got the mix pack so I could try S M L. These guys clearly know what they are doing. There ear tips are custom made for most IEM. So they fit and work perfectly. Comply's have 3 great features: 1) The P-100 go go deeper into the ear for better bass. 2) The foam softens up as it reaches body temp and seals the ear canal (again for better sound). This is by far the quietest tips I have ever tried. 3) As it softens with your body heat, the foam becomes so compliant that you forget they are there ( except for the fact you can't hear anything) :-)"
184,2.0 out of 5 stars,"$500 for this piece of scrap? You can't be serious. I'm absolutely furious with the design and product quality. My first time with the series and I honestly dislike it. Really hard to get into your ears because of its design and the quality is cheap for the price you pay. Cheap materials like hard plastic. What's really upsetting is the design, it's flawed, bound to break within a year or less(2 years at most). You can only go so far with warranty. Just unbelievable, I can't believe anyone would think this is a good idea. I wanna meet the person who designed this and uppercut their jaw for this frustrating buy. Sure, the sound is good... but for the money? Better options. $500, I feel like a f###### idiot. Buyers beware, not worth the price in my perspective."
185,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me preface by saying that I'm not a hardcore audiophile but that I do enjoy listening to music and travel quite a bit for work and am constantly on the hunt for new IEM's and headphones to use when traveling on planes/etc. That being said, I'd probably describe myself more as an enthusiast rather than a hardcore audiophile.

I was in the market for some high end IEM's and was choosing between the Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad HiDef MicroDrivers, Crystal Clear and Sennheiser IE 800 High-Performance In-Ear Headphones (Black). I was looking to upgrade from my Shure SE535-CL Triple High-Definition MicroDriver Earphone with Detachable Cable (Clear) and Westone UM 3X In-Ear Musician's Monitor, Universal Fit Earphone with Removable Cable, Clear, 79292 (I have the RC removable cable version of the UM3x's). Anyway, I ended up buying the SE846's and found a pair of used IE800's on another site so now I have all four of these IEM's and plan on selling the SE535's and UM3x's. I know I really don't need two sets of IEM's but with the SE846 and IE800 I love them both so much that I don't really want to sacrifice one or the other. In any case, since I have all four of them now I thought it'd be helpful to some of you out there who may want to know a bit more about these at least in terms of how I rank them.

I'll be ranking them using the following criteria (which I adapted from a well known user on head-fi) on a scale from 1-10 each:

Bundled Accessories - Which ones come with the best and most comprehensive list of accessories
Build Quality - How well I feel they will hold up over time
Isolation - How well they block out ambient noise
Microphonics - How much cable noise you hear when moving around
Comfort - How comfortable each one are after wearing for extended use (over an hour on plane for example)
Sound - This is a bit subjective as all people tend to hear details differently in the sound so I'll do my best to describe why I rank them the way I do
Value - For the money which one is best?

::Shure SE846:: - 65/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
9.5/10 - Shure really didn't leave anything out when they put this package together. It comes with a large plastic case like a pelican case as well as a zippered case. It also comes with a plethora of tips and most interestingly a set of 2 additional tubes that can be inserted in to the IEM's that change the sound of the SE846's. I opted to stay with the pre-installed neutral tubes. The only thing that would have been nice is if they included an iPhone/Android compatible cable. At the price they are asking it should be a throw in...

::Build Quality::
10/10 - All plastic with the exception of the ear nozzle which is metal. From what I hear this is the most susceptible part to break so it's nice they changed them to metal from the previous generations plastic nozzles.

::Isolation::
10/10 - I use some Comply Tsx-100 Comfort PLUS Earphone Tips (Black, 3 Pair, Small) with these and they isolate noise very well.

::Microphonics::
9/10 - Shure cables are long and slightly thick. Microphonics are generally not that big of an issue unless you're really moving around a lot.

::Comfort::
8.5/10 - These are LARGE IEM's. With everything packed in to the SE846's I suppose you could say that they are small but compared to the SE535's these are noticeably larger and if you have smaller ears you may have some comfort issues with these. I've found that I can wear these for extended periods of use but find myself adjusting them from time to time depending on how much I am moving around.

::Sound::
10/10 - The sub bass is incredible in these little IEM's. I thought I could hear bass in some of my other IEM's but these take it to another level with the low frequencies it can go down to. The bass is there and not overwhelming and the highs are crisp and clear. I find the soundstage to be wide on these but not as wide as the Sennheiser IE800's. Overall, the sound on these is excellent! Also worth noting is the VERY low impedance of only 9 ohms! This means that they can easily be driven from mobile devices and get good volume without having to turn it all the way up!

::Value::
8/10 - At the price they ask for these, I can't say that they are the best value but they are some seriously great sounding IEM's.

::CONCLUSION::
The SE846's seem to be an evolutionary step in a long line of IEM's. I've had many Shure's dating back to the e2c's, SE425's, SE535's and now the SE846's. As time progressed and Shure refined and improved their products I've been with them along for the ride and I'm happy to say that the SE846's have many welcome evolutionary steps above and beyond what they've done before. The sub bass is amazing in an IEM and the other improvements like the metal nozzles and removable tubes to change the sound are great. Coming from their previous flagships, the SE535's, I can see that they've put a lot of thought and effort in to these and can say that the higher price is fully justified... if only they'd redesigned the iPhone compatible cable and included it with them too! Honestly, though, that's the ONLY downside I see in these IEM's is that they don't include an iPhone compatible cable like their competitors. Other than that, these are some of the best IEM's on the market today and I highly recommend them.

::Sennheiser IE800:: - 60/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
9/10 - Not a lot comes with these but what it does come with is REALLY nice. The case is by far one of the best cases I've ever used for IEM's. The case has a cutout inside the case to put them in and the cable wraps around the case nicely so you never have to deal with tangled cords. The IE800's come with a set of replaceable silicone tips that can be cleaned and reused by just running them under the sink with some soap and water... NICE! The only thing as with all of these is that at the price they ask for them they should include an iPhone/Android compatible cable. The other thing you should know is that the tips are proprietary so there are no officially documented comply tips that will work but I hear that some of the comply tips will work.

::Build Quality::
10/10 - Ceramic housings and a kevlar cable... no other IEM on the market can say that as far as I know... built like a tank

::Isolation::
8/10 - The bundled silicone tips do an adequate job of blocking ambient noise but they aren't going to block noise as well as others.

::Microphonics::
5/10 - By far the worst microphonics I've heard out of an IEM. Try not to move much when using these... I think it's mostly due to the downward position of the IE800's when inserted in to your ears. If you're lucky enough to be able to wrap the cord around your ear so you can use them as over ear IEM's then do it. It vastly improves the microphics of the cable. Unfortunately it's a bit uncomfortable when I wear them this way as the upper part of the cable past the Y is only about 9.5 inches.

::Comfort::
10/10 - These are so small and light that they really disappear when you insert them in to your ears. I find that I can wear these for extended periods with ZERO problems. They may be the most comfortable IEM's I've had to date.

::Sound::
10/10 - The frequency response on these IEM's is really really nice! It's amazing you can get such rich sound out of a single driver IEM. I was skeptical at first since I'm used to multiple driver IEM's but after hearing these I can say that I'm convinced! I do feel that the mids are more pronounced on these than the SE846's which is nice for certain types of music. The bass is also good on these IEM's... Overall it's a nice and rich full sounding IEM. It's worth noting here that the designer of the acclaimed $1500 Sennheiser HD800 Over-Ear Circum-Aural Dynamic Premiere Headphone also designed these... I've never heard the HD800's but I've read that the IE800's are like mini HD800's. Also, the low impedance of 16 ohms means that it can be driven relatively easily by mobile devices. On my iPhone I can get more than adequate volume from these without having to turn it up too much.

::Value::
8/10 - Yes they are expensive but they sound great and are extremely comfortable to wear.

::CONCLUSION::
These are great little IEM's and I mean little! I'm wearing these right now going on over an hour with them on at my desk and I don't feel any fatigue at all... and the sound!! The sound is nice and crisp with good bass response and instrument separation despite being driven only by a single driver. Although the Shure SE846's do have some more bass response in the low low end, sound wise I still put these on the same level for it's overall richness and sound. Great IEM's and highly recommended!!

::Shure SE535:: - 60.5/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
8/10 - Comes with a case, tips, and various other accessories that I don't use... The bundled accessories are acceptable for an IEM in this price range but I feel like they could have included a bit more like an iPhone/Android cable.

::Build Quality::
8/10 - All plastic but I've had no issues with them in the year+ use I've had with them.

::Isolation::
10/10 - I use some Comply Tsx-100 with these and they isolate noise very well.

::Microphonics::
9/10 - Shure cables are long and slightly thick. Microphonics are generally not that big of an issue unless you're really moving around a lot.

::Comfort::
9/10 - These are fairly light IEM's and feel great in the ear and I have had no issues with them wearing them for extended periods.

::Sound::
8/10 - Nice and crisp highs and mids! The bass lacks a bit when compared to the Westone UM3x's and of course when compared to the Shure SE846's it will be lacking too but nonetheless if you're more in to mids and highs then you can't go wrong with these. These are some nice and neutral IEM's IMHO. These impedance on these is 36 ohms which means that it can be driven from most mobile devices without the need for much amplification.

::Value::
8.5/10 - If you're in the market for a pair of neutral IEM's these are the ones to go with.

::CONCLUSION::
The SE535's have now been eclipsed by the SE846's but not everyone will want to spend that kind of $$ on the SE846's. At their price the SE535's are still a tremendous IEM that has a great neutral sound with good mids and highs but lacking a bit in the bass department. They are still enjoyable to listen to and are actually more comfortable (to me) than the SE846's due to their smaller design. Recommended for those looking for a really good, neutral IEM.

::Westone UM3x RC:: - 63/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
7/10 Comes with the standard case, tips, and various other accessories that I don't use. The zippered case is nice and compact but I feel like they should have also included their Westone Monitor Vault - Smoke Gray for them as well. Also, like all of these, they should include an iPhone/Android cable.

::Build Quality::
8/10 - All plastic but I've had no issues with them in the year+ use I've had with them.

::Isolation::
10/10 - I use some Comply Tsx-100 with these and they isolate noise very well.

::Microphonics::
10/10 - The Westone Epic cable is by far the best I've used in terms of microphonics. The cable is thin and light so it really causes no issues in this regard.

::Comfort::
9/10 - These feel about the same to me in ear as the Shure SE535's... great for extended use.

::Sound::
9/10 - The mids and highs on these IEM's are crisp and clear but these also pack a punch when it comes to bass. They don't pack as much punch as say the Shure SE846's or even the Sennheiser IE800's but at this price point they are very nice full sounding IEM's. These IEM's have an impedance of 56 ohms... they can be driven from mobile devices but you'll definitely find yourself turning it up a bit.

::Value::
10/10 - For the price I feel that these are a very good value... good sound, good comfort, and good price!

::CONCLUSION::
I initially bought the UM3x's on a whim at the airport mostly because I craved something with a bit more low end bass over the SE535's... this was of course before the SE846's came out and the Sennheiser IE800's... nonetheless, after auditioning these I bought them on the spot. The highs and mids sound good (not as good as the Shure SE535's but good enough for me) and these IEM's do provide the bass response that I was looking for that the SE535's were lacking. They're warmer sounding to me than the SE535's and more fun because of it. Depending on my mood (before I got the SE846's and IE800's) I'd switch between the SE535's and UM3x's. I recommend these highly!

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------
As you can see from above these are ALL really nice IEM's and for various reasons I've ranked them all very highly.

HIGH OF THE HIGH END MARKET
If you have the money definitely go for the Shure SE846's or Sennheiser IE800's... They are both well worth the money IMO. The SE846's may be better for those of you on the go a lot (because of the low impedance and low microphonics in the cable) while the IE800's are probably better suited for at home use or for people who won't be moving around much (due to the microphonics issue).

LOWER OF THE HIGH END MARKET
If you're budget is on the lower end of the high end IEM market then I have no hesitation in recommending either the Westone UM3x RC's or Shure SE535's... the difference between those is mostly in the sound signature. The SE535's are more neutral sounding to me while the UM3x's have a bit more umph when it comes to bass response.

It should be noted that Westone has recently released the Westone UM Pro 30 Smoke (Universal Monitor Earphones) and Westone UM Pro 20 High Performance Dual Driver in-ear Headphone of which I auditioned both at a store... These would definitely both be worth looking in to... the accessory bundles alone would be worth it over the competition. They come with a regular cable and iPhone/Android compatible cable and a nice plastic pelican case-like case. My wife got the UM Pro 20's and she's very happy with them and uses them every day."
186,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Being a life long techie, most things don't amaze me. I recently started to do indepth research about the best in ear headphones money could buy. All indications pointed to the Shure se535 headphones. At $500.00 I had serious doubts. I added up all the money I've spent over the years on ok headphones and it way exceded $500 so I decided to take the plunge. All I can say is holy s***! How is it possible that this sound quality could come out of a 1/16"" tube? If you close your eyes it sounds like you are sitting with the orchestra. I hear things I've never heard before. I find it hard to believe it could get any better. Also, these are very comfortable (after many ear tip changes). I opted for the iPhone wire which does not have the molded around ear wire. I prefer not to put them around my ears. If you use a shirt clip to take the tension off the wire, that works just fine. I'm surprised Shure does not supply that option.

I take good care of my stuff and I expect to have these for many years to come (for $500 plus, I hope so). I guess you can chalk this experience up to, you get what you pay for."
187,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simply the best earphones/IEM I have tried. Neutral, great bass response but not bassheadpunchy, VERY detailed sound stage, comfortable when you know how to fit them in to your ear. Takes a few tries but when in I forget them. Cable attachable and that is great. But the sound is most important and it reflects exactly what you put in. So good quality music ir reproduced 100% accurate. Used to have a pair of BOSE and they sound good to but not realistic. Put the 535 in, close your eyes and you actually are on row 3 in front of the band!

I use them for jazz, rock and classic. Maybe not so good if you need a lot of artificial bass. I don't (anymore)."
188,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I Love these earbuds. I have had them for about 6 years at this point. I had used several of the previous models, and had them wear in some way or another for me. These are modular, so I can replace the part that is a problem without losing the whole pair.

First of they sound really good. I have used a number of different models, of earbuds in the $100+ range, and these have been my favorite. They don't have over hyped bass, so some people may not enjoy them. I have used them for In-Ear-Monitors, and as my standard listening vehicle. I really like the accuracy of these, they provide a full range sound, and I have even used them in some mixing situations when nothing else was available.

They offer a number of different inserts so you can get a comfortable find. Keep in mind that not all earbuds work for all people. Ears are as unique as fingerprints, and because of these may not work for some people. I have relatively small ears, and the small foam inserts work well for me. There are a few silicone options available as well, if that's your thing. The cable have a harder sleeve by the earbuds which allows you to train the cable to your ears. It can take a little time, but once you do it, they stay for the life of the cable.

Cable durability can an issue, and I have run into problems getting the earbuds to release from the cable (I actually broke one due to an extra firm connection). I have had to send these in twice, which is a little annoying, but the warranty was honored by Shure and they sent me back brand new replacements (one time outside of warranty, due connection breaking them issue). The last time they sent them back, they included a soft case which has kept them in far better shape. I had been keeping them in my pocket, and keeping them away from all the other stuff has kept them in pretty good condition. The last time I sent them in was over two years ago, and while i have replaced the cable to a newer one that can fit into my phone case, I haven't had problems with them.

The only reason I have given these a 4 star rating is because I have had to send them in for service, and because of the price. I got a very good deal on mine through my job, but at full retail I don't feel like they are made for the general public who are used to spending $20-$50 on a set of earbuds.

When these finally bite the bullet beyond me being able to get replacements at a reasonable price from Shure, I'm not sure what model I'll end up going with, but I definitely wouldn't rule out purchasing these again."
189,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE535 are simply amazing. As they should be fore the price. Are they over priced? Of course they are it's just a pair of headphones right? Consider this when buying them how often do you listen to music on your headphones? 5, 8, 10+ hours per day? if you are dedicating that much of your life to a task in my opinion the price may be a little more justified. If it's a quality product and you are going to spend a lot of time every day of your life using it then putting a lot of money on that product doesn't sting as much this is just the way I see it. If your buying a pair of headphones to toss in the Gym bag and use while your working out look elsewhere.

I'm a networking engineer and spend a good part of my day either behind a desk or in a noisy data center with thousands of servers. I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile and have own and still own several pairs of high end headphones. I've owned the Bose IE series 1 2 and the MIE they're great for acoustic & live music it sounds like you are sitting beside the stage they're comfortable but the fail in some of the other everyday music listening habits I have such as Rock, Heavy rock and rap. The bose headphones bottom out on bass so I got a pair of beats the Urbeats they were OK more powerful bass and could produce a lower thump than the Bose but the overall sound quality was not on par with the Bose. I then tried the Beats Tour & Power Beats.
I liked these, the same powerful teeth rattling low end thump but the highs and mids were present as well still maybe not quite the overall sound quality of Bose for some music I think on avg I used these more just because they did a much better job isolating the sound and producing a powerful good quality sound. I also own several on the ear headphones a pair of Bose, Turtle Beach and 2 pair of Razer the Tiamat 7.1 and Razer megalodon After a LONG time researching and reading reviews looking at spec sheet comparisons to what I already owned I talked myself into purchasing a pair of these and I'm glad that I did. The sound quality is simply amazing they sound like no earphones you've ever had in your ears hands down. A large over the head extreme studio monitor headset *might* have them beat in some departments but it wouldn't be by much and you aren't sitting at a desk or walking around all day wearing one of those... They're comfortable as the bose IE series you can easily wear these all day long with no issues. The bass is there when you want it a good EQ like viper can make them produce the same low end thump that any beats produce only cleaner it's not a loud drowned out thump it's a powerful clean bass hit and you can feel it going down your spine it's incredible. With most sound isolating headphones when you are running you may hear yourself breathing or the sound of your feet pounding the ground as you run I don't get that with these. They fit in a way that you can still hear the outside world when the music isn't playing but when it is that's all you hear. Even in the noisy data center at lower listening volumes the servers don't intrude on the music all I hear is the song.

The price might be justified to some but I think they're still a bit over priced. for $500 I'd like to see the mobile headphone wire /w mic included in the box and the box is metal while that's cool it's a waste of money and you are paying for it. You won't be storing these in the box after you open them so what's the point?

in the end If you are willing to spend this kind of money on a pair of headsets I would recommend them you won't be disappointed."
190,2.0 out of 5 stars,I personally did not like them. They sound really good but I just couldn't justify spending that much money. I thought they would provide me with a listening experience like I had never heard. They didn't stay in my ears that well either.
191,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a happy 215 user, I was reluctant to spring for the 535s. Could they really be enough of an improvement to justify the cost?

After a week with them, my answer is an unqualified yes.

I am an audiophile, and my music listening is based in large part in listening for the subtleties. The 535s do not disappoint. The basses are SO much tighter. (The engineer in me would say rise-time is faster.) I can honestly say I never expected this kind of bass response from an in-the-ear device. It seriously seems to defy physics.

Trebles are equally impressive to me. There is a subtle discrimination of high frequencies that on the 215s kind of ran together.

Mid-range to me is, well, typical mid-range. I've never listened much to that range of frequencies, but it is as good as any I've heard.

I'm very happy with them and look forward to listening as I never have."
192,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the headphones sound stage, crisp and clear instruments and fit. The only reason I took a star away was because of its price and discomfort of the loop around the ear when moving around with the earphones in. The bendable plastic can irritate some listeners, but I can't say for all. The fit is great however. Owning the Triple Fi-10, I couldn't justify its price at 4 times, as I couldn't hear that major difference after switching through it several times. If you need an upgrade, may be worth trying, but make sure you're comfortable with it before you settle as it is quite a big investment."
193,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bounced around to quite a few brands out there and while the costs of these are hard to justify, from a audio point of view, there is no downgrading possible once you've spent some time with these.

I tried some of the higher end etymotics thruout the years and even had a lesser shure pair, eventually over time in the hunt for a supreme audio experience I ended up with a 500 series shure and for me, the difference was night and day. As small inovations were made within the 500 series, I adopted an upgrade or two mostly due to wear and tear on the device(lost a pair once)...my last pair before these where the push to talk series they had with the awfully big attachment piece. over time, the wires frayed and while i did look into it, i wasn't covered. I went on a oddysee out of spite to find a better yet cheaper solution. It was pointless. The monster line does not have a equal line, i tried and spent, monsters don't equal shure. Finally I had a birthday coming up and decided I was going to spoil myself in a royal way so I figured out what the latest 500 series was and grabbed em...

for the 500 series upgrades I have done, this was the biggest upgrade of em all. the detachable earphone from the primary wire line setup would have solved my problems years ago and eliminated the need for future upgrades. for those that have not used 500 series shure earphones, it involves a ridiculously weird bending excercise for a proper fit that over time just leads to frayed ends. That is still going to happen with these but the difference now is you can buy a replacement set of wires and just plug em in to the detachable earphone units and be as good as gold for the fraction of an upgrade price.

also, the default wires provided are finally built to a better quality that catches up to the competition, they don't fray as easily, they have a better quality to them, the earpiece bend part of it has a molding plastic to it to keep the proper bend better then has been possible before. in retrospect, it's hard to believe that shure asked you to spend 500$ for a set of their earphones and while it gave you the stellar audio, the fact that it gave such a subpar build quality to it is astounding.

from an audio standpoint, they sound like the same shure 500 series from 4 years back so if you took care of your 500 series shure from back then, no need to upgrade from an audio standpoint. I've had fairly expensive etymotic sets, i've gone to the 300$ range for monster sets, even fell for the apple in ear set, tried a few others as well. You have to spend 500$ plus to get these, that said, there is no spending 100$, 200$, 300$ 400$ and getting comparable sound. If you love your music, it'll never sound better then with a 500 series shure.

my one last complaint of them though is the default wires have no mobile phone buttons solution to them. For that, you need to spend a bit more for a another set of wires which I could fully accept but when you buy those mobile phone compatible wires, the build quality goes back downhill again. it's cheap wire, no form fitting earside wiring, no kevlar coating, its crap. It basically gets to the point you buy them for the times you want the mobile controls but you stick to the default wires for primary listening. To force that on a consumer spending 500$ plus is pathetic. I have stuck to the default and have found myself reaching for the control pod only to remember this defiency. these are in everyway 5 star earphones because for what i have ever tried, the competition is nothing more then 3 stars in comparison but this one fault of these set force me to drop a star mainly because it was a easy fix, it was a ignorant omission."
194,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me first say that it is difficult to rely on reviews for something like earphones. So, I will try to write this review with that in mind.

I have owned and used these earphones for almost a year now, and would buy them again in a heartbeat. They are superior to any earphone or headphone I have listened to.

I recently set-up a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort IIs, Dr. Dre Beats Studios, Sony MDR-7506s, Sennheiser CX 880s, and my Shure SE535-Vs. Myself and two others were listening to a variety of music through a fantastic headphone amp setup. In short, there was no comparison - SE535s were CLEARLY above and beyond everything else in every category.

I am a budding sound engineer and look for quality. These are quality - let there be no doubt.

If you are looking for an upgrade to your iPod earbuds to listen to your mp3 files on, these are going to be more than you need, but will still be a drastic improvement. If you will be using them for musical instruments, audio work, live-concert mastering, or listening to music through a quality amplified set-up, you cannot buy a better pair of earphones or headphones."
195,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Truly awesome sound. Definitely a difference between this and others. Is it worth it? That is up to you, but I don't regret it. I used to have the SE535 but lost it. Those had the behind the neck wires. I liked that better because you could cinch them and they held in one place...and out of your way. These, because of the controllers, go in the front of your neck. Great headphones, either way, just pick your poison.

They are expensive, but they are awesome."
196,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok. So I tried the 425 and immediately returned since the bass wasn't very pronounce. OMG!! the 535 is crisp clear on more instruments I can distinguish compared to my 3yr old SE215. Bass is good. Can focus on each instrument. I feel I'm in the studio recording or on stage playing with the artists. I'll keep these for a while before I eventually try the 835's.
Can't go wrong with the 535."
197,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my 3rd pair of Shure earbuds. I started out several years ago with the 100 series ones. When they eventually died, I picked up the SE530s. My first set broke during warranty and Shure promptly replaced them. The replacement pair went on to last for nearly 5 years with regular mountain biking, running, gym workouts, and constant listening. When they finally kicked the bucket two months ago, I contacted Shure to see if they could be repaired (loss wires, drivers still worked fine), they informed me that while they were outside of warranty and could not be repaired, they would offer me a really good deal on the current version SE535. Well, the 535's just arrived and I they sound every bit as good as the 530's. I've read from another review that he found the 530's to be warmer - I agree, but I'm also guessing that the 535's will get a little warmer as they break in (most speaker type things need a break in period). Unlike several other reviewers, I actually found the shape of the 530s to fit better in my ear. With the 535s I have to use the largest foam tips and they still don't feel as snug as the 530s. That said, I went jogging with the 535s and they stayed in for 4 miles without adjustment.

Now... anybody who says these sound thin and have no bass either has a broken pair, bad hearing, bad taste, or doesn't know how to wear them regardless of whether they claim they do or not. These earbuds are stunning and pretty much make all other headphones and earbuds a compromise to use. If you have never tried something like this, you are in for an exceptionally cool treat, because the first time you use them is like hearing all your favorite music for the first time. They are very revealing to your music, you can hear fingers on strings, natural decay of drums and other percussive instruments. Truly magical."
198,1.0 out of 5 stars,Was very happy until after not very intensive use they started to lose contact between the cable and the ear piece. When you lose contact - you lose sound. The left and right channels cut in and out continuously unless I keep my head and body perfectly still...
199,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Im not an artist nor am I a producer im just someone who listens to a wide array of music and instruments. These headphones are without a doubt worth the price. They might cost as much as the device you will use them for (or even more) but if any time in your life the phrase (you get what you pay for) has been truth, then im sure this is why. I started usin shure back with the E2c'S which was around 2008. Those were $100 dollars and up to that point the biggest investment i had made for headphones. They lasted a while, i ended up gifting them to my little brother and he broke them last year. Then i moved to the $299 E4C's which were simply amazing but had a problem with the cable.it broke twice right where the cable meets the monitors... thankfully, shure repaired them both for me free. Last may i decided that everytime i spent more money on headphones the quality went up (i was hesitant because i honestly thought it would not get better than what the E4C's reproduced no matter how much more i paid), and then came the SE535's. for the first week i didn't notice any more dynamics and i wasnt so pleased with the extra cash i had spent. i went between them both exchanging them to bring up comparisons. that was only during the first week. after that i really started noticing the details and its been amazing. You hear things you never did before, a drum, a effect, a guitar.... and it feels so intimate. These headphones block so much noise, and if you really crank up the volume i promise you wont hear a train, a plane, a truck, anything.... they are that good. Because of that they really excel reproducing uninterrupted and uncontaminated sounds. its really explendid. the cables on these are also removable. this is amazing because most of the time the headphones work its just the cables (which go through most of the hassle since they are the ones dangling around) so that makes them easier to just buy a $50 cable, rather than send them in for repairs. I have a year and 7 month with them.... no issues yet. (once i was running with them and some of my perspiration appeared to go inside the opening between the cable and the unit itself rendering my left earpiece not sounding. after grabbing a napkin and blowing some air they functioned fine and have been ever since.) all in all, i highly recommend these headphones base on my experiences.Great buy!!"
200,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are by far the best headphones that I ever owned. Please keep in mind that they come with many ear tips. It took me a while to find the right size for my ears. I use the smallest size of the rubber ear tips to get a full seal fit when I put them in my ears. Once you get over that,the sound quality will blow you away...and yes there is plenty of bass. Why only 4 stars?.. I think is are a little overpriced in my own opinion. I've read other reviews,are they said they are a investment. Hopefully these earphones will last for a long time. Other then that,if you want one of the best earphones,buy them,you won't regret it."

I fly a lot. So much that I'm at the top tier (1K) of United's program. I've never flown without some headphonese and I've gone through a good bit of them. I'm always looking for noise cancelling due to spending so much time in the air. In the past, I've always gone for active noise cancelling (the 535's are passive) with fair success. In the past I've owned 3 different set's of sony's, the MDRNC13(Crap), Sony MDR-NC40 (great NC for the price), and their top-of-the-line MDR-1RNC (Overpriced and Overrated) and a set of the Sennheiser CXC 700's (decent).

All of the above are Active Noise Cancelling which means they need a power source to activate the NC electronics. A big drawback of the actives is that they require a battery and usually have a big bulky switch and battery compartment hanging somewhere on the cord (exception being the Sony 1RNC).

The 535's, being passive, do not need the battery and thus are less bulky. I've found that the passives also seem to cause less fatigue on my ears, except for the expandable foam in your ear canal that blocks out the external noise. I want to try the custom fitted earpieces, maybe that will take care of that issue. If fitted correctly, these 535's give me nearly the same level of noise blockage (technicaly Noise Isolation) from any other set I've ever used. I haven't tried any of the other earpieces that came with this set - they may provide an even greater level of noise blockage. However the reduction in noise level is good enough for me as shipped from the factory.

Sound quality: These phones bring my music to another level. I hear things in music that I've never heard before. Just listening to oldies that I've heard a thousand times like Hey Nineteen or FM by Steely Dan, to my hawaiian music like Iz Kamakawiwo`ole, is almost like re-introducing me to these songs. Absolutely beautiful sound. I can't say that about any other headphones I've owned which also includes non-NC types like Grado's and Bower's and Wilkins.

I'm far from having the ears of an audiophile. When I read some of the self-proclaimed experts and their descrips, I'm thinking ""what?"" I really can't relate. Good for them for having those ears, I don't have them. But these are the first phones I've had that I can say ""I've never heard anything like them."" Last year I reviewed the New Sony active NC cans. I paid about the same that I did for the 535's, and I was sorely disappointed (and wrote an Amazone review saying as much). I'm so glad I came accross these phones, Hopefully these will be the last because I've spent a small fortune on headphones, maybe I'm finally done!

Another positive thing to note is the carrying case that comes with these 535's. The case is a nice looking hard case with a zipper. Having a hard case is the best, especially for these very expensive small things. You don't want them getting crushed or damaged like they could be from a bag or soft case. A soft case came with my Bowers & Wilkins C5 in-ear headphones and it is so poorly exectuted (from engineering to manufacturing) that I can't even use it.

CONS:
Made in China.

Not the coolest looking things, almost looks like a medical device (I've got the clear, I think the Bronze or Red would look better). However they look a lot better than that stupid looking ""b"" :-)

They are a bit light on the bass, but that's not a biggie for me.

Great job overall Shure!!!!"
203,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are amazing! Incredibly clear, crisp, rich, deep, full, balanced sound. As another reviewer said, the sound seems to cascade from inside your brain. These were factory replacements for older, damaged SCL5CL. The wires on these are a little less bulky and more user friendly. The wire connections to the various components are reinforced and much better quality than older models. I had been using the SE315 while I procrastinated in sending the old ones in for service. The 315s are really nice but the 535s are out of this world. I gave the 315s to my daughter so finally sent the older, damaged set of SCL5s in for service. Great service from Shure, about an 8 day turn around. If you love your music, these are a must have treat!"
204,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a highly subjective review. I'm no audiophile , but I know when I can make out a difference in what I can hear and taste and these are a WORLD Of difference to my ears

I owned my first shure IEMs ( in ear monitors ) in 2007. They were Shure E4cs and at the time , they cost me an arm and a leg. I bought them from Hong Kong duty free after reading the glowing reviews at Amazon, and I wasn't disappointed . They sounded amazing, I truly heard instruments, sounds that I had never heard in my favourite songs and I was in bliss.

Then the cords started fraying . I taped them up, but eventually had to surrender to the fact that they were dead. I contacted shure and they told me that they were out of warranty and would need replacement. I couldn't afford to then , so I managed with a succession of average earphones.

I made some money and I bought a pair of Bose QC15 headphones . I loved the noise cancelling , which works well in planes, but is also good to grab a nap when the kids are noisy ... My wife uses them more than I do for this. Anyways, they sounded good, and the noise cancelling was great, but the sound was not mind blowing.

I remembered with nostalgia , my old Shure e4Cs and thought.. Maybe shure has something as good, or better and started research . Most of the reviews pointed to the SE 535s... They had triple drivers and everyone said they gave you the holy grail I sought.. New sounds in music I already loved, new instruments, new nuances.. A new experience

So, they cost almost twice what my E4cs cost.. But this was 5 years later and inflation happens.. I deliberated for 4 months and finally bought them

I'm just starting using them now , I haven't ""burnt"" them in for a 100 hours as I'm supposed to, but they still sound great. The music sounds more "" wholesome"", I can hear new sounds in my old music. What I feel even better, is that I don't have to stuff the foam sleeves ( the best sleeves, IMO) into my ear canals, they are way more comfortable than my old shures, and I can still feel the pulse of my heartbeat in my ears without any discomfort at all. These are very comfortable and don't come with what I had come to expect as a standard sacrifice for in ear phones.

The cables.. the Achilles heel of my old Shures,is now more sturdy, has memory on he upper third (plus..is that Kevlar?) AND is user replaceable!

The Shures also come with all the right sleeves, the black foams ( my favorite ), the yellow foams, also good and the other triple flange ones , adaptor and case.

I'll be back for an update, once I've reached a good burn in... But they already sound great. My Boses are nowhere close, neither is a pair of 400$ Beats cans I tried for an hour at the shop.

So, in short:

1. The SE535a sound magnificent
2. The bass is really good and this is without a really tight seal like I had to make with my old E4cs, I don't understand the reviews that say otherwise
3. Each instrument is clear and I can appreciate sounds I never noticed before
4. They are unlike my other experience with IEMs in that they are comfortable, very much so.. I notice these sort of subjective feelings, are very much in line with your pre-existing expectations . I expected some discomfort and experienced none, and hence I am very happy.
5. They are far more robust and should last a while.

A great buy if you value your music experience as much as you value your new smartphone. Expensive , as there are cheaper options that might sound as good, but I think that they are worth the 500$"
205,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these today because I needed in-earphones for live guitar on stage, I haven't yet used them for these however I can safely say I'm very happy with the sound and know they will do a good job blocking out the sound on stage.

I have been using cheap speakers and they are so good in comparison. Tested a variety for earphones including the Bose QC20i (not ideal for musicians, not true flat earphones ideal for a more honest sound) and was considering purchasing the SE315 however could justify the extra money because of the depth in the sound. You are able to clearly hear the different instruments in the music, as there are 3 speakers in each earphone stops alot of muffled sound when multiple instruments are blended loud together. Considering that cord is replaceable makes it a logical choice meaning that when the cable is broken it's simple replaceable (which I think is a must with expensive earphones).

Love listening to these earphones it's like listening to these songs in a new way entirely, sounds very 3-Demensional and has great depth, bass, mids and slightly rolled off highs (which is good for avoiding harsh highs at loud volume)."
206,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using many in ear headphones (Klipsch, Etymotic, Sennheiser, others) I thought it was finally time to try what may be the best you can get without custom molds, which add another $250 to the cost over and above the cost of the earphones which are very expensive themselves (think JH Audio). These 535s are very pricey at close to $500 but not as expensive as those.

My experience with headphones has taught me that fit is critical. Usually the most comfortable is not the best sounding. Usually. Getting that tight bass reinforcing seal is so important that without it, you could come to the conclusion that a pair of phones absolutely suck when the real problem is the earpad shape, size, material, etc. These come with an excellent ""fit-kit"" of 10 different kinds and sizes of pads. I found that the largest foam tip supplied gives me a very tight, sound isolating and, most importantly, comfortable fit for hours. Interestingly, none of the aftermarket tips that I prefer to use with my Klipsch S4s, the Comply TX-100s, work for me with these 535s. The point I am making is that it is well worth your time to find the best eartip to use for any in-ear headphone, no matter what the price. Also, when you get a good fit, the isolation is far superior to any ""sound-cancelling"" earphone anywhere.

These give me the clearest, most transparent sound I have ever heard in any earphone or speaker I have ever had the pleasure to try. The negative to this is that you can hear imperfections in the recordings very clearly but conversely, these earphones can really make your old recordings sound new as you hear nuances you had never heard before. Bass and treble are well balanced, bass is deep but not boomy, highs are delightful. These are also built like tanks and I would think they could last a long time. I am very pleased with my purchase although I could have saved a bit if I had ordered through Amazon.

I highly recommend these for those who want seriously good sound."
207,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Shure SE535 about two years ago because of a really good sale at the moment (and as a splurge present for myself that Christmas) I was an aspiring musician playing in the local church circuit where I could use these as in-ear monitors via Aviom Personal Monitors and since then I have never regretted my purchase.

These are some solid in-ear headphones for both personal and professional use. The range, accuracy, depth and power of these ""earbuds"" still makes me fall in love with music I've been listening to for years. Taking time to just listen to tracks over and over again continue to shock me because I can just experience all the minuteness of music production, be it light percussion in the background of a track, the finesse of a concert pianist, the complex synth and drum beats of a dance song or the powerhouse vocals of a diva. Enough cannot be said about the sonic performance of these in-ears.

Being (still) an aspiring musician, I play with other, much more talented musicians at the various churches I play at and most of them have custom-molded in-ears, mostly double or triple driver variations but what is amazing about these earbuds is that the isolation that these guarantee me even with just the silicone tips is amazing, I can sit next to an unshielded drummer and not be worried about hearing a clean mix out of my ears. Even the weeks I don't play the flexibility of being able to lend other musicians who may have forgotten their in-ears is worth it so that they don't have to go without ears or use earbuds.

I couldn't recommend these in-ears anymore highly to somebody on the fence. Whether you're somebody who just likes to appreciate well-recorded music on an audiophile basis or a musician looking for in-ears that you don't need custom-molds for (but you can get custom molds for these too!), Shure SE535s are the 'buds to beat."
208,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely hate these. Way overpriced. They hurt, they're hard to place in the ears."
209,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why I chose Shure 535 in-ear headphones (but also applies to their less expensive 425, 215 models) - they are the only brand that meet ALL the stringent criteria below:
1 Pro studio quality sound - flat balanced response that's not clinical or over-cooked
2 Max comfort fit earbuds with alternative earbud options
3 Generous (2yr) in-country warranty and support (sadly not available via Amazon-based sellers though, at least in the UK)
4 Replaceable cables - yes!!
5 iPhone-compatible cable control
6 In line controller has good button differentiation/response
7 Max gain headroom using iPhone (75% all you ever need)
8 Secure ear canal fit while on move
9 Max isolation for optimal bass extension
10 Robust build quality
11 Near zero cable whistle
12 Custom moulded earbuds available
Whatever you buy, please consider all these factors before making your final decision - I had three pairs of Etymotic HF3 and loved them but gave up on them as they only met about 3-4 of these requirements. Good luck!"
210,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I still have my prized SE530s, though 1 wire sheath (where it attaches to the body of the earphone) is gone and the other is super-glued on. I don't know how much longer they're going to last, so I ordered the SE535 intending to use the better sounding pair until one dies. This allowed me to perform a detailed A-B test between the two earphones.

Using the silicone tips I usually use, as well as the foam tips I usually don't, to my surprise, the old SE530s sounded superior to my ears. Though the SE535s were ""brighter"", I thought the 530s were clearer. I felt the bass was punchier from the 530s as well. Don't get me wrong. The SE535s are good earphones, but for the price, I was expecting better performance than the ""n-1"" version. I realize the cables are now detachable, etc., though I'm addressing sound quality only.

I'm not sure if my experience is due to an internal design change, or rather, if (as I suspect) the problem is that the body of the earphone itself prevents as deep an insertion into my ear canal as the SE530 did.

For this price, I don't think I need to settle for being anything less than enchanted. I'm going to send these back, hold on to my SE530s, and explore other earphones. YMMV"
211,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you buy this product expecting it to make your iphone, ipod, or android sound amazing you may be somewhat disappointed. It will be an improvement over the earbuds supplied with the device obviously, but you'll feel as if you may have wasted $500 just because your device isn't meant to drive earbuds of this type of quality. If you really want to take advantage of this amazing product you need to have a player that can play lossless (FLAC) files and has either a line out to which you connect to a portable amplifier or buy a portable high resolution player that can play FLAC files and/or other equivalent files. An example of this type of player that is reasonably affordable is the Sony Walkman NWZ-A17 ($300). You'll be amazed at what the E535s (with the correct ear piece) and the walkman (with the correct equalizer settings) can do. You'll never want to take these out of your ears. You get to the point to where you are disappointed when your flight or your workout is ending just because you don't want the music to stop. Educate yourself a little about high end audio and you'll not be disappointed with this entry level (into high end audio) product."
212,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These will blow you away. Worth every penny. My only issue: You'll pick one pair of ear tips, one set or the other of cables....maybe you'll keep the airplane adapter and case if you fly alot. The rest you'll pretty much throw a way and wonder how much they charged you for the extra stuff.

Eventually you'll even upgrade the cable. The word is...the reds DO sound better than the clear or bronze so in that regard the opinion is that they are worth it.

I travel every week and use the largest ear tips included along with the android cable via a samsung galaxy 6.

These are orders of magnitude better in every way than a set of bose QC 25s. Easier to carry, better sound isolation, better sound quality."
213,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Had the older version for 4 years or so, and this newer version for about 2 years at this point.

Sound quality is exceptional. Really rich, full and enveloping. The removable cable is also great, since they always end up breaking after a few years and need replacing. I had an older version that I loved, excellent sound quality and very comfortable to wear, but after the cable broke, I took advantage of the shure upgrade offer and sent them back, and purchase this version with the removable cables. Nice, right... brand new headphones. Not so great. I do not know why they redesigned the exterior of these. It is all hard and square edged in places... actually really uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The removable cable comes with this pre formed flexible loop that goes over your ear, which makes for a secure fit, but the problem with these loops is that they get tangled in every wire they come in contact with. I listen to music at night and my headphones are on the floor next to my bed, where I also charge my phone. If I try to get my phone and plug in the headphones, the charging wire and the headphones always get tangled up, and you can't just shake a little to get them undone because the loop are like hooks that get, well hooked on everything around them and themsleves. Half the time I spend a few minutes untangling it all before I can put them on. PITB

So sound wise they are great (***** Five Star)
Comfort (** 2 Star)
Ease of use (** 2 star)

I would not recommend these to my friends at this point, and I will certainly look for another model by shure or a completely different brand next time I decide to buy a pair. Unfortunately given the cost of these and the fact that the cable is now replaceable, I don't see that happening anytime soon."
214,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my pair of Shure's SE535CL. I had the E5C's for some time, and the cable finally gave out. One feature that I really like about 535's is the replaceable cables, even though it's Kevlar, It's nice to know it can be replaced. I was very happy with the E5C's, and that's why I opted for Shure again. I always want the best, and these don't disappoint. Hooked up to my Ipod, they sound great. Hooked up to my Amp, playing my SG, they're amazing...(Caution: The Ipod is limiting as far as volume goes, a 100w amp is not.
I consider myself an Audophile, but I'm finding it difficult to notice the difference in sound quality between the SE535's and the older E5C's. I would love to do a side by side challange, but Shure replaced my defective E5C's with the 535's. They were out of warranty, but Shure will give you a replacement for Wholesale priceing. I got mine for 250.00....Thanks Shure....You Rock."
215,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned the previous model of this high-end set, the SE530. After two and a half year, the cord finally broke at the connection point between the cable and the ear piece. It is a known issue with that and similar Shure sets. Shure corrected the problem in the SE535 (newer model) by adopting detachable cables, so that if the cable needs replacement you do not need to throw away the whole set, which is what I had to do. Shure replaced my out of warranty old set with the new model for a flat fee of about $250 - no bad if you consider the price of a new set of SE535.

In comparison to the SE530, the SE535 produces the same fantastic sound I got used to, possibly even better. Bass seems to be just a tad more prominent (a welcome addition, in my opinion). The level of discrimination of these earphones is hard to believe. You can hear the movement of the guitarist's hands on the instrument. No matter what type of music I throw at it - classical, jazz, rock, pop - the set does not stop to impress me.

So why is this marvel not for everybody? First of all, this is a closed set that requires a tight seal into your ear canal. While I have grown used to this, and in fact, I love the effect that the seal produces, some people find it uncomfortable. My wife, for one, cannot stand this ear set for more than a couple of minutes. I can go for hours and hours, such as on a long plane ride, and still have no fatigue (in fact, in a loud environment, the seal will isolate you from the loud noise, so it will diminish the hearing fatigue effect).

Also, achieving a tight seal can be tricky at the beginning. Follow the instructions in the manual and in the reviews from other users (drive the earpiece OVER your ear, not from below) and you should learn pretty quickly. Just a little tip: if you feel that you are struggling to insert the earpiece into your ear canal and keep it in position, you may be tempted to use a larger foam tip. Don't. Try to move to a smaller tip first. The smaller the tip, the deeper you can insert the piece in the canal, and the more stable the piece will be. You will also achieve better overall sound quality. So my advice is, always use the SMALLEST tip that can produce a good, permanent, comfortable seal.

Finally, there is the price. But let me tell you - once you try and get used to this level of qualitgy, there is no way back to a cheaper set. You truly get what you pay for."
216,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great craftsmanship. First of all, let me just say, you will only ever truly benefit from these headphones if you import your music at a high bit rate or at least 256 vbr. The sound is just outstanding and Shure continues to make great sounding products so I wont't dwell on the sound. My only small complaint is the wire. The 3.5mm jack that connects to your mp3 device is in the form of an L shape. That means that when you put it in your pocket it will bend against itself. What does that mean? Eventually it'll short circuit on you and before you know it, it's time to replace the cord. Shure will do it for you but to have to go through that process over and over can be quite annoying. Other than that. These are great and worth every penny. AGAIN YOU MUST IMPORT YOUR MUSIC AT A HIGHER BIT RATE, PERHAPS IN THE 300'S."
217,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to the SE310s that I've owned for years, the response is excellent--I can finally appreciate the subtleties of choral music without getting my ears blasted by a fortissimo from the soprano section.

The excellent response can work against you if your audio source isn't high-quality, though. When I plugged the SE535s into my computer (an integrated sound system on the motherboard), there was a noticeable hiss, with spikes that coincided exactly with hard drive activity. These buds are sensitive! If you're looking for something to plug into your iPod, you may be better off buying a less sensitive set of IEMs.

I've read a few recommendations for dealing with a noisy source: using a discrete sound card in your computer, and a digital-to-analog converter for portable media players or smartphones. Until I have a chance to try out these recommendations, my quick n' dirty solution has been to set the source volume as high as it will go and use the included inline volume control dialed almost to 0. This filters out all but the worst of the hiss.

The sound isolation is about the same as the 310s.

A couple negatives: definitely not as comfortable as the 310s. The body of the IEM has a tendency to dig into various parts of the ear. In my case, it stopped being noticeable after a while, but was annoying at first. Also, the adjustable wire keeper has a tendency to get stuck on the wires, definitely a step back from the smooth action of the SE310 keeper.

All-in-all, I'm fairly pleased with them. The negatives are mostly annoyances. The sound quality is excellent, and the modular cable system means everything that can wear out can be replaced."
218,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the sound of the headphones but my concern is with their durability. I've owned these headphones for three years and have had to send one earbud or the other back for repairs a total of four times. The last repair was out of warranty which cost $90 because Shure says they replace the repaired earbud with a new one, not a refurbished one, but one provides a one year warranty. At this rate I'm looking at repair cost of $100-$200 every 18 months or so. Maybe its just me but I expect more durability from a product that sell for $500 and by the way Shure has the worst customer of any corporation that I've ever done business with..."
219,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First, about myself. I am not a audiophile by any stretch. I enjoy music and I primarily use a Zune HD or my PC with ZunePass. (BTW - ZunePass is AWESEOME.)

Prior to purchasing the SE535, I've had the Westone UM2 for about 5 years. The UM2 was my first entry in to the IEM world and it blew my mind at how great music can sound. It was like night and day difference between any earbud headphone and an In-Ear-Monitor (IEM) that completely shuts out ambient sound. The separation between the high and low frequencies were so incredible that I was amazed at the difference.

So after 5 years, I thought I give a 3-driver IEM a try. I could have purchased the new Westone UM3x but I had a great opportunity to pick up the Shure SE535 at a great price so I pulled the trigger. Thus my subjective review is based comparing the SE535 to the Westone UM2.

I listed to three songs on my Zune HD with a 3.5mm audio jack with 2 ports. I plugged in each IEM so I can switch back and forth.

First, I listened to David Guetta's Toyfriend from the One Love album. This is very bass beat driven song. In comparing the two, I couldn't tell the difference. My guess is because of the over powering bass, whether you have a 2 or 3 driver IEM, it will be difficult to hear the benefit of the 3-drivers.

Second, was Jason Marz's I'm Yours live version. Here I noticed some difference in the overall sound. It's hard to describe but the SE535's seemed more full where as the UM2's seems a bit muted. Don't get me wrong, the UM2 sounded great but I did notice that the SE535 sounded better.

Third, Eric Johnson's Cliff's of Dover live from Austin, TX performance. For those who don't know Eric Johnson, this is a Grammy-winning master piece of electric guitar performance. (Very subjective, I know.) This is where I think the SE535 separates from the UM2. In comparing the two, again the UM2 is great to listen to but I noticed that the SE535 was much more full. I don't know how better to describe the difference other than saying ""sounds more full"" but the sound seems more ""alive"". I wish I had better vocabulary to describe the difference, but I don't.

All in all, I will give the SE535 5 stars but if I could, I would give it 4.5 stars from an overall value/performance stand point. I feel like I have been spoiled with my first IEM being the UM2 but in comparison, although the SE535 sounds great, it wasn't tremendously better than the UM2. Thus the 4.5 star rating especially given how old my UM2 are and the fact that a 2-driver IEM will probably meet most people's needs.

With that said, the build quality of the SE535 is top notch. The cables are so much better than the UM2. The UM2 had breaded cable and while better than majority of the earbuds out there, the new design of the Shure's cables are very sturdy. However, they are a bit thicker and I haven't quite adjusted to popping in the IEM. I am still adjusting between the more flexible UM2 cable which I can fit in my ear very quickly to the thicker and rotating cable which I have yet to master. But I figure it's just a matter of time.

With that said, if price wasn't an issue, then I probably would have been more brand loyal and picked up the latest Westone IEM. However, like I said, I was able to pick up the SE535 for a very good price so I jumped on it. My biggest problem (if you want to call it that) is how to wind up the cord properly to put it in the case. I have no idea what the center plastic piece and how to use it in the inside of the case. :-P )

Hope this helps."
220,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an amazingly good product! Better reviews of the sound quality are already written here, so I'll focus on other features that matter greatly to me.

First, the many options for the ear cushions guarantees that you will find one that you really like. These earphones seal to your ear canal just like the foam ear protection that you might use during construction projects or at the gun range. You don't need ""noise cancelling"" when you seal the noise out of your ears.

Second, for those considering this product vs. the Bose products, the key advantage for me (besides the amazing sound quality) is the size. The hardsided carrying case is about the size of an iphone (but twice as thick). You can EASILY carry the carry case in a shirt pocket. What good are headphones that are too big to carry with you on every trip.

Lastly, I purchased the optional cable with mic and controls for my iPhone. It works perfectly. The strangest thing I noticed is that I can actually hear surrounding room noise in the room through the mic and earphones! A million times better than using the earbuds and mic that came with the iPhone!"
221,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a huge fan of Shure in ear headphones for a long time. I've tried about every mid-high end pair out there-- and these are the highest of the mid! My last pair were Shure E4c's that had the bad habit of losing connection after a year or two of abuse-- er-- hard listening. So I decided to move up in class to the 535s.

The first thing that struck me was the sound. These are quite simply the best sounding in ear buds I've heard, short of the $1000 dollar high end models. Bass is tight, but not missing. Mids are perfectly natural-- even on wind instruments and strings. Highs are brilliant-- as to be expected (Shure usually gets these right, no surprises here). From The Beatles Rubber Soul to Solti's CSO conducted Beethoven's 9th Symphony masterpiece-- then changing it up with Gene Harris' All-Stars Tribute to Count Basie-- it's total immersion-- everything you want from a set of earbuds.

Construction is terrific. Hard plastic casing but more important-- the cable is braided, making the wires tougher to snap under stress-- and at the critical joint between the cable and earbud-- where most ultimately fail-- there's a thick plastic shrink wrap for durability.

On the comfort side-- these fall a little short. After a few hours, I definitely need a break. My old E4c's were more comfortable. But if you're looking for the best-possible sound (which is, after all, what we want, right?) look no further. They cost more, but deliver."
222,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would purchase these again. If they ever wear out, I will happily do so. Along with my Focal K2 Power car speakers and my Totem 'The One' monitors at home, these round off the damn fine sounds I am fortunate enough to enjoy in my life.

I had originally purchased the SE210 model in '09, but after about 15 months, the cable on them began to fray and split. With the two year warranty I was able to put what I had originally spent on the 210s toward these. (I'm in Canada, and this was done through a distributor in Montreal I believe.) I'm glad I didn't settle for less. Though the 210s weren't too shabby for the price, I noticed a tremendous improvement with these. I have far too much music (over 180 days' worth in my iTunes library), and much of it is in lossless form. Music covering all genres. Some studio stuff, some recorded off soundboard, and some recorded from the audience. Some of it is 24 bit, and so on. Even through the iPhone's DAC, they sound great. I am saving up for an external DAC for my phone though. (At the time of writing, V-MODA didn't yet have a 'VAMP' for the iPhone 5. I wrote them and they said they are working on it.) Back to the cable issue, 27 months later, the superior construction of the cables on these has held up very nicely, in spite of very regular use. There are no signs of any real wear.

Apart from the fantastic audio reproduction (and improved cables), I really like how well they fit flush in your outer ears much like a proper IEM would. It's totally possible to have them in and say, sleep on your side in bed. And though these aren't the only 'phones with viscoelastic foam inserts, I really do appreciate how much they cut out ambient sound. Sometimes I do work for a friend's landscaping company, and particularly when music is playing through them, the gas-powered weed whacker in hand is virtually inaudible, for instance. As I'm sure others have mentioned though, I imagine riding a bike in traffic with these in could be potentially dangerous. Also, I find it's generally easy to move about a fair bit, without being concerned with the the cords coming out of place (from behind the ears, and down yer back and into the pockets of your pants, whatever the case may be), though initially it might take some perfecting before you get everything fitting and staying comfortably in place, yadda. I recall the instructions providing good tips on this.

Good stuff Shure. Good stuff indeed."
223,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these amazing headphones for about three or four weeks now. The sound is hands down, perfect. The only complaint that I have is the bass, (the headphones are perfect, but some of the songs that I used to love, I now realize how lacking they are) but it has nothing to do with the headphones, it is just the songs. In the month that I have had them, I have at least gotten 100 hours of use with them, I don't go anywhere with out them. I would have given them a 5 star. Had the wire for the heaphones not broken already. For a $500 retail. I was expecting a top of the line quality product (not just sound). So on top of the $440 that I had spent on them, I had to spend another $30 for the wire. It was a huge let down for me. I understand that all wires break, but for less then a month of use and having to get another wire. Maby it was just a faulty product or maby it was just my abuse. I am still very dissapointed anyhow. All in all, if you are looking for an amazing sound, these are the ones you want!"
224,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best earphones.If you have nice interest in sound engineering and want to listen quality music buy these earphones.

Sound quality :-
In order to get the best sound quality you need to find a nice fit . if base is weak means you didn't got proper fit.Best way to get a proper fit is trying different ear forms during the weekend , it might take half to one day to get an nice fit.Please note that human ear canal sizes are different you may spend other day for second ear.
I got perfect fit using two different forms , I used medium form tip for left ear and white 3 layer tip for right ear. It looks odd for 3rd person but you need to sacrifice couple of things to get an proper fit.

Noise blocking :
you can block the outside noise 100% by using the form tips. Like other companies like Bose and Sony , Shure didn't invested any money on sound isolation using artificial circuits and batteries , Shure used old human technique of closing your ears with finger ( finger is best pointing device as per Steve Jobs) in noisy environment.. What Shure is invented is form tips instead of fingers.

Value for Money :
Another innovation is detachable cable . Iphone user can buy and adopter and can use these earphones with I device."
225,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You will not regret this purchase! I previously used the Bose QuietComfort® 20i Acoustic Noise Cancelling® headphones. They were good but do not come close to achieving the sound quality of the SE535s. I also find the Shures to be more secure and comfortable fitting.

Important: I experimented with a variety of the included tips and now use the fattest ones possible. They are snug when I remove them. This fit is KEY to best sound isolation and quality. I also hear performance improving as they break in. Extremely happy with the SE535s!"
226,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not much of an audiophile... but I can assure you that these are the best sounding earphone/headphones/headset/speaker-in-your-ear-cause-i-dont-know-what-else-to-call-it I have ever used/heard. I've owned several Beats before, all of which has either ripped or broke, and several other budget in-ear headphones... none can compare to this bad boy.
Luckily for me, I did NOT have to spend the hefty price tag of $500+, and at first glance, I would not purchase an earphone for that kind of price either. But after sitting down and actually listening to my playlist, Holy Ginobli!!! These provide clarity and just the PERFECT amount of base to thorougly enjoy your music.
If I had the money, I WOULD purchase it, as it would be a great investment. Cables rip? Easy, purchase a new one and attach that sucker right into the earphones (one of the coolest features).
If you have the money and you're looking for some earphones that block out ALL NOISE and provide the BEST SOUND, GET THESE NOW!"
227,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth every penny. I find myself buying a new set of headphones every few months. I've been through most manufacturers: AKG, Beyerdynamic, Shure, Audio Technica, Bose, Sony, Denon, and more. There's nothing like a set of open-back design over the ear reference headphones set with a nice quality preamp in a quiet dim lit room, but how often do you find yourself in that scenario? I grabbed these and a Pelican Micro Case to keep them safe. Let me tell you: they're fantastic. With some minor equalization, you can get these things to sound like your favorite rig, but with the big benefit of doing that anywhere! Almost 30dB of sound isolation is more than enough to separate you from the environment and immerse you in your music. These are my first multi-driver headphones. The difference between this and the single and dual driver sets is astronomical. Accurate bass response, clear and open mids, with acceptable high end for small drivers. I encourage audiophiles that are tired of lugging around closed ear designs to try these out. They're a big investment, but very likely a lifelong one."
228,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an audiophile or expert. I like to,listen to chill out music, new age,ambient - soft with a variety of interesting sounds - the shure535 provide excellent range, clear and with sound isolating ear buds that work wonderfully well provided you have the right tip, fit and insert them correctly. I really love the sound I receive. I use Bose earbuds at work which are fine for the office but when I want to sit back and listen to my sounds the. I put on the shure. A lot of money but you do get what pay for with these."
229,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a musician, primarily in a church setting. I play drums, lead electric guitar, rhythm electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and do vocals. I went to these after using our standard dual driver Westones, and I am very impressed with these. The sound quality is quite good. It handles the lows very well, whereas on single or even dual drivers, I would occasionally get distortion when mixing the lows.

The only complaint I have about these is that the memory wire doesn't hold that well, but they hold them in place, which is enough for me. They sound very good, they seal off well (almost too well, if you want ambient sound), and they seem very well built.

If someone doesn't have super discriminating ears, they may not notice a huge difference compared to some decent dual driver IEMs, but for me, these are noticeable better. Especially since I often am mixing in specific channels (custom IEM mix) and want to get some of that low punch from the bass and the kick drum."
230,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a big fan of Shure earphones. This is my second pair. Unfortunately, my last pair were stolen. The sound quality is fantastic. They are pricey but worth it."
231,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tried the IE80, UE-900s, SE215, SE535 - and the SE535 was hands-down the best. Incredible audio clarity and good bass. Tried with movies and music on iPhone & iPad. However probably best bang for the buck was the SE215 - while not as crisp and clear, pretty good sound and better value than the IE80 and UE-900s"
232,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use Shure for several years and still love it, everytime I bought the same one SE535LTD because it's red and black. But I lost it again, trying to save money for another 535 because I believe 535 is my religion in my life."
233,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you love the sound of a reference-level (studio) headset, but don't want the bulk or the bleed-through of competing external noise in a car, a plane, a train or anywhere, I'd be surprised if you can do better than this.. I know they have a version with four MicroDrivers but I don't miss the recorded base or any other sound feature that the recording artists where trying to deliver with these.

I accidentally broke my prior S535s - and always buy up when I take a loss. This is definitely buying up. Deep base, crystal highs, full mid-range. If you want more base, you can always crank your input; but I seldom feel the need (unless the recording is weak).

I do use my pro-level reference full-size headsets at home some times, and while better, they're actually only marginally better. (and much more expensive). At home. you usually don't have noise - and often need to hear a phone ring or someone call you. So each has its place - but large headsets are not portable to most. The SE535-V Triple High-Definition MicroDriver Earphone give you almost the same thing as the high-end, pro headsets, yet provide portability and noise canceling without any noticeable degradation in pure, sound pass through such as hiss or any other impediments to your discerning listening pleasure. Save time: buy these and enjoy your moble listening pleasure sooner. Peter Heydt"
234,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are by far the best headphones I've ever owned, but lets not overlook they are, by far, the most expensive headphones I've ever owned. I've had them for just over 2 weeks and they're great. I use them all day at work (SWE), and on my commute on the train.

Before siding with these I ordered some Ultimate Ears 700 and Bose IE2 and they don't even come close. I was trying to decide between those 2 and still unsatisfied, I purchased these - once you spend >$100 you better be satisfied. There is no going back after listening to these.

The noise isolation is unmatched. The sound of the train is non existent. The bass is tight, the mids and highs are clear and crisp. A good seal in your ear is important for the bass to sound full.

When listening, you need to only click up the volume 1 -3 clicks on the device to block out any noise. Running these through my phone on my commute, I have it 3 ticks from the bottom. At work, through the computer, 1 tick up from the bottom. These really are amazing. I listen to a wide variety of music and these are great for all genres. I've listened to Beethoven, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Lil Jon, Adele, ZZ Top, Tool, 2 Pac, Van Morrison, Lady Gaga, Techno (Paul Oakenfold, Armin Van Buuren), O.A.R., Dave Mathews Band, Kenny Chesney, Moby,..... you get the idea - these headphones do a great job.

I use these for my commute, work, working out, and to keep quiet when my wife doesn't want to hear it. They stay in and in place when I go for my run.

My only 2 complaints - 1, price of course, but you get what you pay for. 2, after 6 or so hours of continuous wear my ears ache a little bit. This can probably be solved with custom fitted earbuds/tips - not for me, but a 20 minute break is all I need to finish out the day in them. I thought I would regret spending so much ($400ish) - because c'mon, that's expensive, but no buyer's remorse.

Really great product, but these are priced using the value based pricing model. So if you're debating about purchasing them, fret only over the price because Shure delivers on the quality side of the equation."
235,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me preface by mentioning that I also own the UE triple fi 10 and Sennheiser hd650s. (both excellent in their own ways)
Shure se535 = Balance, Balance, Balance! I had never understood what other reviewers meant when they talked about balanced sound. Well, now I do thanks to these iem. Didn't know what I was missing!! My insight is that balance definitely equals clarity imho.
I've had these for a week now. I ordered them right before going on a week long road trip (lots of ""wow"" moments). I researched for a while trying to decide on either these or the Sennheiser IE8s. I don't regret picking these one bit. They sound absolutely stellar. They have a very wide sound stage for an iem. A crisp, transparent, and detailed sound. They will bring out the tones in your music that you maybe had not even known were there (mid-tones). They put you right there in the room in an indescribable way. The beauty of the se535 is that they can be subtle and warm, yet bright, lush, and energetic. They are definitely expensive, but if you're into quality sound, the enjoyment you'll get out of these is worth every penny. Go for it! (coming from a musician who loves all kinds of music and is extremely picky about sound quality)"
236,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a perfectionist. I want what I heard when I listen to music to be as accurate to what the engineers heard in the studio as possible. The Shure SE535 accomplishes that goal better than any other IEM I have ever tried, and I have auditioned and/or owned hundreds of different IEM earphones in every price range. The tone is natural, smooth, realistic, dynamic, and real.

Comfort:
Since I travel internationally quite a bit (as well as spending hundreds of hours on domestic flights each year) I tend to plug these into my ears with the expanding foam sleeves and once settled not remove them for hours. I've been known to wear these for over 15 hours straight on long multi-segment flights. They are very comfortable, and aside from having to immediately deal with the wax build-up in my ear from lack of ventilation in my ear canal, they have no negative physical impact on me.

Sound Levels:
Because the foam sleeves block out sound as good as my 30dB foam earplugs I wear when sleeping, the noise from jets, terminals, cars, and such are vastly reduced and I can clearly hear what I am listening to without any need to turn up the volume. In fact, I can hear extremely subtle details in recordings with ease because the general noise floor of the environment is about 30dB SPL quieter with these IEMs in my ears. Also, since I don't have to turn up the music to hear all of it is all its glory, I do not experience listening fatigue from exposure to high SPLs over long periods of time. Great stuff!

Sound:
The overall balance is smooth, natural, and realistic. The treble is not bright and harsh like most headphones (which is popular because it gives the perception of higher definition and detail through boosted treble) and the bass is smooth and natural without drowning out the midrange (again, not popular because earphones cannot make your body vibrate like a real subwoofer so boosted bass is often an added feature of popular headphones to give the impression that a subwoofer is around). These IEMs sound like life, as best any earphone can offer. There is no irritating midrange dip that forces the brain to work hard to understand speech in movies. There is no brash presence often confused with loudness in concerts. There is no fatness in the bass to muddle up the nuance of a good recording. Just natural, smooth, realistic sound. If a cymbal shimmers on the recording you hear it, a bass drum rumbles the room, you can hear it (though no headphone can make your chest vibrate). I can go for a day with music constantly playing and never get tired of the sound. No listening fatigue at all.

Ease of Use:
I experimented with all of the sleeve options, even third party products, and settled on the Shure Large Foam version. With my older generation Shure IEMs I used the Medium size foam sleeves, so this was a surprising change for me. I carry a few spares in my bag for when the ones I am using get old. I generally get about a 30 to 45 days from a pair of sleeves before they lose their ability to expand and hold in my ear solidly. The cable is easy to manage, but it isn't as flexible as the older models. I use these as my phone headset as well, so I usually have the accessory cable attached to them, but on long trips I will swap out the cable for the standard stereo listening cable. I love the comfort of these things and have gotten very good and inserting and removing them rapidly.

Highly recommended!

Compared to the more affordable Shure IEMs, the SE535 has clearer and cleaner bass, silkier treble, and generally more precise sound which is so natural I sometimes forget I am wearing IEMs when listening to great recording or watching an interesting movie.

To me, that is the sign of an amazing sound reproducer - these completely disappear and you forget you are wearing them and are completely engaged in the music or movie you are listening to."
237,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great sounding in-ear monitors, but you should be forewarned that they are very good at isolating sound. It is very difficult to hear what a person is saying or to hear sounds in your environment (a phone ringing, a car driving by, a baby crying, etc.) while wearing these. It is pretty inconvenient to take them in and out in order to talk to people frequently. Some of the strengths of these monitors can also be weaknesses: secure fit and extreme noise isolation. Sometimes I find my self wishing the cable was shorter (or a shorter cable were available) as it can easily catch on things while walking around my apartment (like a doorknob) and they will try to come out of my ears in a painful way (but will not actually come out because of the secure fit)."
238,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm really glad I got these. Fantastic sound! I use them for home/mobile listening, plus as stage monitors in my band. Frequency response is very impressive...especially the bass. Really nice packing job by Amazon."
239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a bit of an audiophile and listen to music 4-6 hours per day. I own about 10 pairs of headphone, 5 or them would be considered ""high end"".

The balance of these headphones I find allows me to listen to them for hours and hours with very little ""listening fatigue"", and I have even fallen asleep with them on.

These headphones definitely have a breaking period of between 1 and 2 weeks...give them time to get there."
240,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cutting-edge technology, a unique design, and dramatic (functional) improvements toward durablility make these the choice for those who demand the very best. Sure, it's an investment, but these will no doubt pay for themselves in short time. Think of how often you replaced your ""made to break"" marshmellows, eye candy, klipsch, or other low quality earbuds. Also important is that Shure stands behind their product, and it's unlikely you'll find a Shure customer who can say different. Highly recommended!Shure SE535-V Triple High-Definition MicroDriver Earphone with Detachable Cable (Metallic Bronze)"
241,2.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price you pay, these are not a good deal in today’s market. While they are certainly better than your average earphone, the sound is incredibly hyped. The bass is deep and good for an IEM, but the midrange is so forward that it’s painful at higher volumes and the treble is severely lacking. I’ve owned many pairs of earphones and my 10-year-old UE Triple.Fi 10s sound light years better than these overall. They are not good for mixing and mastering as they are not flat enough. It is painful to watch movies or TV shows listening to them because the sibilance and midrange from these actually hurt my ears. Maybe they would be good for mixing vocals since the midrange is so sensitive, but overall the spectrum is not well represented. I love how they fit in my ears, but hate how they sound. I have $10 earbuds that sound better than these."
242,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just upgraded to these from a pair of Shure SCL5's for in-ear monitoring with my band, and also for personal music listening. I thought the SCL5's were hard to beat, but these SE535's are hands-down the best audio delivery devices I've ever owned. This new 3 driver setup makes a world of difference. They provide an extremely balanced, clear, and detailed sound. I'm hearing intricacies in my music library that I've never heard before with any other headphone. With the right EQ settings, these things will throw you so much rich and punchy low end you'll wonder how they can fit all that sonic goodness into such tiny packages. They're almost addictive... my music sounds so good that I don't want to stop listening. Aside from the sound quality, Shure gets high fives from me for some smarter design decisions, such as the detachable earbuds, lower profile crossover/splitter, and the little adjustable silicon cable split sleeve (not sure what it's actually called) that works WAAAY better than the slippery piece of PVC tubing they used on the SCL5's.

While they're a bit on the pricey side, these things deliver! Any working musician who demands clear and defined output from their in-ear monitors should highly consider these. I also recommend them for the audiophile who wants massive sound with a low profile form factor."
243,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read all of these reviews with curiosity. When I tried these in the store, they sounded tinny and cheap. After the sales rep's pitch and another customers insistence they were awesome I could not figure out what they were talking about, Then the rep changed ear fittings, I pressed them in to my canal and OMG! The audio response was full range and sensual. I have tried Bose, Sony, Skull Candy and a a few more - None, I repeat, none compare to these 535's.

Consider this... when we listed to MP3 players, the music is already compressed and the audio quality is reduced significantly as a result. When you listen via typical speakers and cheap headphones - the compression loss doesn't come close the the sound reproduction loss you get with these cheap speakers and headphones. BUT these Shure 535's reproduce the sound in a beautiful way - providing the richest reproduction of the compressed MP3 audio i've heard. It far exceeds my tuned home theatre surround should system in audio quality and performance. Embarrassing when I compare both investments.

Speaking of investment - these are an investment. So I hope they last a while. So far no issues with build quality, but I remain aware of the few concerns mentioned here."
244,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had quite a lot of expectation when I bought these. My other phone is a Samson SR850. Much cheaper than these.
The first impression that I had when I plugged it into my LG G3 is ""Noise"".
These phones are extremely sensible. The lousy sound card on my LG G3 cannot driver good quality sound.
Then I plugged it into my work PC (HP): less noise but still audible.
My wife's Iphone 6 can driver something better to it.
So if you want to have these for hearing music, first find a good source with noise signal ratio of about 120 db.
About the rest: comfort, sound quality, bass, medium, treble, they are as good as the price.

If you want some amazing sound, go for it. But also go for an amazing sound source."
245,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audio junkie. I have PortaPro by Koss which I've been using for the last 5 years or so. I loved it and didn't think the sound quality couldn't get any better when it comes to earphones. I was proved utterly wrong when I bought the Shure SE535-V. It's like comparing a BMW to a Ferrari, or a similar analogy, haha. The sound isolating technology makes the sounds even more crystal clear. The Bass on it is unmatched.

Some people seem to complain about the design. The suggested way to wear them is to put the cord over the back of the ear. It took me a while to figure it out. Initially, as I was attempting to figure out the fit, I was afraid that I might be disappointed in the fit and the design. When I finally got it in my ear, I was still like ""I have to keep doing this every time?"" But I have to say that the fit was REALLY good and snug. You could be headbanging while you listen to Rock music and it won't budge one bit. I know because I tried it. It's not uncomfortable at all. Just choose the right size earpiece that comes in the box and you should be fine. So getting back to putting the earphones on...I just put it on for the 4th time since I got it yesterday and I'm already used to it. It just takes a few extra seconds to adjust the wire over your ear and once it's there, as I mentioned, it's very comfortable. In fact, the aspect of the design where you put the cord over the back of the ear keeps the earphones securely in place. So I am completely spoiled now. I hope this review helped alleviate the fear of the design a little."
246,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my Bose Noise Canceling headphones fell apart from general wear and tear (putting them on and taking them off again), I decided to upgrade to the Shure 535, so far I'm very happy with the build quality.

Forget trying to cancel noise, just block it, seems so obvious. The noise isolation is fantastic and far superior in result.

The sound compared to the Bose are in another sport, never mind a different league, excellent indeed. Not that over accurate Bose sound at all, far more detailed and pleasing on the ear.

247,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm keeping the rating at 5 even with the complaints I have with the size of the drivers. I've owned a good number of Shure earbuds over the years. My first were the Shure e3c. They lasted about a year, then the cables started having issues with the area that goes over your ear. Then I upgraded to the SE210's. Same thing happened. Then upgraded to the SE530's. Fasntastic sound! I was hearing things in my music I've never heard before. But I had to get warranty work done on them. With such an investment, I sent them in (the others I didn't much care to replace, decided an upgrade was in order). They sent me back the 535's.

So, the SE53x line, for some reason, confuses me every time I try to put them in my ears. I know there are R/L's on the bud, but they're hard to read and I feel I should be able to know by feel, which one is which.

Also, the bud is a -lot- larger than all previous models I've worn. I know its because there is much more hardware, but its' noticeably larger. And was uncomfortable at first."
248,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own a pair of Shure SRH1840 Professional Open Back Headphones (which I paid more for) andI have been extremely pleased with... but these sound better. Other reviewers have mentioned it as well - it is like the sound is not in a speaker but in your head. I cannot imagine a more intimate and realistic listening experience than what these headphones provide. I had high expectations when I bought these and they have exceeded them.

I should also mention that I bought these because my iPhone and iPad can't drive my 1840's (although my MacBook Pro can) and I was looking for headphones that I could use with my iPad and iPhone. These deliver. They are very efficient and sound every bit as good with my iOS devices as with my MacBook Pro.. I would imagine the same is true of Android devices.

If you are looking for headphones to use with portable devices, I don't think there are better headphones."
249,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from SE212s that were getting a bit old. The price turned me off at first but I'm so glad I splurged. The low end is defined and not muddy at all. Mid-range is perfectly tuned. High end isn't tinny. These sound like my very expensive studio monitors. Other brands that pump up the bass end up destroying what the musician and producer originally intended. These earphones provide the truest experience.

The sound quality is so good that I canceled my Spotify account because I could hear how compressed and lacking everything sounded. These earphones will highlight the good and the bad in the music you're hearing."
250,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just upgraded from an old E500 to the newest SE535. E500 was an upgrade from e5c (hope I got the v# right, it was 10 years ago). Both earlier models were replaced due to worn cable, so the detachable cable on the new SE series is definitely addressing this historical issue. The reinforced curve on the SE535 is not only keeping the cable in shape but also comfortable to wear.

In the sound area, comparing to the old model, the base is crispier and bunchier reminding me a little bit Boss. The high is very sharp and the mid is full. Personally this is different from the sound I am used to listen to Shure for a long time (40 years).

I read a few reviews commenting the earbud does not stay in place. This new model does fit differently from the E500 round shape and a bit larger. However, once I got used to it, they stay in place pretty well for me. I also worried how tight the detached cable can be staying connected. I just got mine as new so have to give it some time to find out.

I give five star rating for the following reasons:

1. It is obvious that Shure and learned from the past models and improved the durability in both design and key frequently wear out areas. I have high hope that this pair of earbuds will last me a long time (my first pair lasted only 2 years and the second pair lasted 6 years). There are also improvements in the accessory area, the oval shape box is much bigger than the old round box and I don't have to gam the earbuds in and also bit the airplane adapter and one of my old microphone cables.
2. The sound quality is very modern and fast, it works with both music and games. I use this primary for my iphone so it is a good match. I tried it on my home stereo equipment which is Passlab amp + CD and turntable and the result is not what I would listen for a long time. My normal speakers are B&W D803 which share some sound characteristics with the older Shure models. SE535 is different but I like it.
3. The build quality of the product appears to be solid to me. The cable housing is thicker than the old model and the shape of the connector allows me to leave it at the bottom of the iphone 5 and not worry the possible bending the cable (old model has a 45 degree angle, new is 90 degree). The earbud itself has good sound isolation (the old E500 had an active noise cancelation piece that works well in flight; I have not tried SE535 in air yet).

Compare to Sennheiser IE80 and B&W C5, Shure SE535 is a pricier model so direct comparison is not fair. I have purchased Sennheiser, B&W & B&O and ended up giving them away and stayed with Shure for years. All of these other brands are great products and deliver good sound, but Shure provided me with not only good sound but also an overall solution for music, gaming, phone, travel through additional accessories which all work with SE535. I don't mean to imply others brands can't, but just like I stick with one camera brand because all the lenses I bought, I am confident that Shure will continue to evolve and expand this product line thus gives me the confidence to stay loyal with them.

In addition, Shure service is where I upgraded from E500 to SE535. I sent in my E500 to repair the worn cable, Shure charged a fair replacement fee and send me a new SE535. It's like a trade in, a smart way to keep customer. I don't claim to be any expert in audio or electronic equipment. This is one regular long time user's feedback for your reference."
251,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a longtime musician and I've never owned a high end set of IEMs until these. I was getting by on some $50 bass earphones until I stepped up to these babies. They are amazing. Durable, well built, and lightweight they scream quality. If bass is all you care about, these may not do it for you. I would describe the bass as rich, not overpowering. They deliver a clean distinguished range of sound from highs to lows. With my bass buds I was missing clarity. These deliver that in abundance. Highs, mids, and lows will come through beautifully to you. As a drummer, I needed to be able to blend many instruments, vocals, and my own drum mics together seamlessly. It's hard to believe how well they accomplish this. Now to me they are great because I need them to be. If you only listen to music casually or don't consider extreme audio clarity to be a must, you may find a less expensive option more viable. Like me, if you demand the best I'm not sure that you will find it anywhere else."
252,5.0 out of 5 stars,"decided to splurge and buy myself a xmas present, so shopped around and chose the shure se535's. these are far and away the best earbuds i have ever had the pleasure of listening to (and i've listened to a bunch). simply put, the music comes alive more so with these earbuds than any others i have previously listened to. very comfortable to wear, at least to me. and they block ambient sound out pretty damn well, so much so that i'm not going to wear them when i dog walk (spca volunteer) or ride my bike.
if you've got some extra money to burn on some damn fine earbuds, i don't think you can do much better than these. very happy with my purchase."
253,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off by saying, prior to this pair, I owned a pair of 5$ in ear headphones that worked properly for about two months. this was my first significant purchase of a pair of headphones, so if I don't sound like an expert, just know I'm not.

I'll start off by addressing my own complaint: I hate the color! I hate the color SO MUCH, I wish 1000x that they were at least moderately fashionable, the sickly sort of weirdish brown they get from the finish and then the casing it's put in make them look absolutely HORRID. they look atleast okay when looking at them in the picture but the picture doesn't do it justice, it's just awful.

now, you may be thinking, ""Why would you buy a pair of headphones like this if you cared so much about the color"" Answer, I don't care about the color, it's not why i bought them, it's literally the one thing I actually have to complain about.

The performance is PHENOMENAL, the surround sound, the depth of the bass the pitch of the treble and the noise canceling are like nothing I've experienced in my life. I was no more than 10 feet away from someone mowing the grass and literally the only indication I had that they were mowing the grass was because I was watching them do it. I heard every single last sound coming out of my headphones and not only that the sounds were clear, well developed and the volume was even low. I have always enjoyed classical music, and one of the most thrilling and exciting experiences about classical music is listening to every single part in perfect detail. when you hear the bow gently strike the cellos behind the roar of the drumbeat and the scream of the trumpets and you can hear every hair slide across that string watching the lawnmower pass you by, you KNOW you've got good headphones.

This being the first really high end pair i'd bought I'd done quite a bit of research and read quite a bit of reviews, and I'd like to allay the fears of anyone interested in buying them.

I'd read prior to purchasing these that the treble can become quite overwhelming while listening to these. Now, when you generically listen to whatever you're listening to this is very clearly true. with a triple micro driver system, it can be easy to become overwhelmed, but this is also exactly why equalizers were built, and after a quick fiddle with the equalizer on my computer, I was able to easily compensate for that, and while you might have difficulty with that if you're listening on an mp3 player that doesn't have an equalizer, it's easy enough on most smart phones to download an AP for that, and if your MP3 player doesn't have an equalizer that seems in my opinion to be more of a problem with the player than the headphones. Another visible reason why this is, is because since it's not a headset, and that it's small earbuds that sit in your ears, the bass doesn't really have the same sort of booming vibration it normally would, especially because it's much easier to listen to music at incredibly low volumes.

another complaint I've read and this one I've seen a lot, is that they're too good at shutting out noise, and that should you find yourself out for a walk or on a bike ride, you'll be unable to hear anything around you. this is less of a con and more of a pro. they are DESIGNED to cancel out noise, as well as the fact that I'm a cyclist myself, and over the years I've learned that listening to your surroundings can very easily save your life, whether it be someone driving too fast behind you or it being a dear or fox hiding in the bushes who just so happens to jump out right as you pass, the ability to hear these things in great detail is paramount. I'm certain much of the same could be said for going for a run or a walk, but as I don't do that very often I'll leave that area to anyone who does.

the last complaint I'm going to cover is the fact that they are a bit heavy. when you squeeze down on the foam tips and slide them into your ears there's an immediate noticeable pressure. the way they fit into your ears they feel bulky, which I'm sure is why they wrap around the ears for better stability. at first I found this a bit difficult to get used to, and I feel like, if I only occasionally used them for long periods of time, it would become tiresome quickly, but my primary use for them is when I'm either playing online games or working on writing my book, and I use them for a series of hours each time, after enough time getting used to that, they feel perfectly comfortable, and I have no problems anymore with it. so really it's just something you can adapt to and get used to.

Bottom line, as far as I'm concerned, I have no real complaints, and no buyers remorse at all. they were worth every single penny and I would buy them again should I somehow get caught in a time spiral and wind up having to do it all over again."
254,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is not much more I can say about the SE535 accept they are simply awesome!

If you are a bass head, look at the Beats by Dr. Dre brand. If you like to hear your music the way the artist intended, the SE535's are worth every dime. Also, I bet if you go to Dr. Dre's studio, they are most likely not wearing Beats.

The sound from the 535s is so precise, they will point out a poor recording. I listen to lossless .wav recordings (320kbs) and the SE535s make it seem like you are in the studio, making all of your music sound like the first time you've listen to them.

There is NO clipping of the Highs
The Mids are front and center. (Vocals are amazing)
Lows are accurate and super quick.

All I can say is I thought my UE SuperFI 5 Pros sounded good and they do but they tend to lean more towards a warmer sound. Compared to the SE535, no contest! I gave the Ultimate Ears to my wife."
255,3.0 out of 5 stars,I play drums in my worship band at church and have been using these. I started with some kind of UE in ears and liked them ok but then got this and was blown away. I could barely hear my drums which was what I was wanting and just turned up the mics on my snares and toms and it was perfect. My left ear has blown though which really disappoints me but I'm still using them. Hopefully I can get them fixed. Still a really good buy.
256,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality....until they break. Multiple times. Mine sound has gone bad (caused by the cheap cord) twice in the last 9 or so months. The model before this one that Shure discontinued had no issues for me and I have them for 5+ years. They got cheap.
257,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would probably rate this about 4 and a half stars, but I'm gonna round up because you can modify them to Perfection!! They are quite wonderful. Get High Quality audio and equalize them out to your needs and you'll see. I find without an equalizer they are weak on bass and have too much treble. But they pack a punch and can do the bass if you make them do it. Just EQ the bass up. They ARE TIGHT!! Make them yours and they ROCK!!!!

Okay.. umm. To add to this.

All the reviews on here are bugging me so incredibly much I'm going to add a little more now that I've actually owned these a little longer. The burn in time does make a difference in bringing out the bass, which is tight, can be deep-ish. But not always. I'm sure an amp would do them great justice. They may be Very pricy - yes. But the soundstage is absolutely freaking unreal and the listening experience you get from these is so personal. I become easily immersed in them, from both their sound, and their Stellar isolation.

My arguments against other reviewers who could set you off:

-The cables have NEVER broken. I've never once had a problem with them. Though I treat them nicely, wrapping the up not too tightly around two fingers before putting them in their case after every use.
-They fit very very well in my ear, once I found the right size silicon foam for my ear.
-They block out so much sound I can barely hear people when NO music is playing!!! They do Not need sound isolating technology whatsoEVER. So whoever says that is freaking bogus and put way too little effort into finding the right foam tips or learning how to put these in. Sure you Will suck at putting them in most likely for a couple weeks until you figure out the absolute best way to do it. It takes me about 3 seconds to squish the tips, 2 second to get the in my ear and put the cable over my ear, and another 7 seconds to let the foam expand. JEEEsHHH"
258,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using Shure earphones for the past few years (E5C, SE530, and now the SE535). Admittedly, I am hard on my earphones as I use them while running and working out. The performance of the Shure product speaks for itself. However, what really sets Shure apart, IMHO, is the way the company stands behind their product. If you purchased the product from an authorized dealer and ever have an issue with the product, Shure will take care of it without hesitation. Shure simply the best in terms of customer service and commitment to their customers! Other companies may offer nice products, but I cannot imagine anyone standing behind their product better than Shure and that is why I always buy their product!"
259,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a pair of SE530s a few years ago and absolutely loved them. The hype surrounding that model was definitely high but the headphones more than lived up to expectations. About two weeks ago I sent that pair back to Shure for a minor repair to the cabling, an issue that the 530s were prone to. Within 7 days, Shure sent me a brand new pair of SE535s -- not only a new pair of headphones but an upgraded model from the one I wanted repaired.

I have never seen a company stand by their products the way Shure does. And I know for a fact that mine is not an isolated incident; there are plenty of testimonials online speaking to the same level of care.

Buying high-end headphones was a big purchase for me. In the future I will always feel more comfortable making purchases like these knowing that the Shure name is standing behind them."
260,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these specifically to use as remote reference monitors for when i'm mixing on the road. I originally bought the Shure 425's and returned them because they were TOO flat. I totally understand you want true dry tone and no coloration when mixing, however, the 425's were too dry. The mids and highs were fine, but the bass was non-existent. (and I don't listen to bass heavy music either)I did, Love the 425's for live in-ear application. The 535's are extremely clear and accurately expose the tone of every musical element."
261,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Previously I wrote that Shure would not repair your earphones after the warranty period even if you are willing to pay for the repair cost. This is what I heard from Shure Canada when I asked them about reparing my SE530 earphones. They also told me that Shure US would not repair them either. I was frustrated that I had to throw away the $500 earphones just because of broken plastic pieces and wrote a negative review as below. However, when I contacted Shure US, I got a different answer that they would replace my earphones with new one at the cost of $150. I just received the replacement earphones and I am happy about how Shure US handled this. (I am still unhappy about Shure Canada though. They even tried to sell me a replacement earphones for a lower grade earphones (SCL5) at $200. This one does not even come with a package or a warranty.)

My previous review ============================
If you are thinking of buying this expensive pair of earphones, you should be aware that Shure will not repair your earphones after the warranty period (2 years) even if you are willing to pay the repair cost. This is their repair policy regarding earphones, that I confirmed with Shure Canada. (They told me that Shure US would not repair them either.) I wish I had known this when I was buying a previous version of these earphones. I thought that I could use them for long time on the presumptions that 1) these earphones would not break under normal use and 2) I could get them repaired even if they broke down. Apparently both of my presumptions were wrong. Something to think about if you plan to use the earphones for more than two years."
262,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hope that this review will help someone who is ""on the fence"" on investing in a pair of SE535s.

I have owned multiple pairs of Shure headphones, some middle of the line and also pair of top of the line SE530s. I use my headphones almost daily, for work and for pleasure, and when I use them I use them for many hours at a time. In fact, I think I place an extra level of use on my headphones, more than most people would. I travel the world for business and I take my headphones and Iphone with me where ever I go. I don't need to spend any time raving about the high quality and exceptional sound that Shure creates with their headphones, there are plenty of reviews that can attest to their superior fidelity and you should expect nothing less than perfection when laying out $500 for a pair of headphones, however I want to focus on the customer support.

After 6 months or so after my original purchase I started to have problems with my SE530s, specifically the left earbud would cut out at the lower connection. I sent the headphones in and they were immediately replaced with a new pair. All was good until about 6 months or so the problem happened again, so I sent that pair in for repair and they were replaced. All in all, I replaced these SE530s three times, the last time almost a year AFTER the original warranty ran out. Shure customer service were always courteous when I called, and replaced my product(s) without issue and almost immediately after receiving my old headphones at their department.

Now, don't take this review as a problem with Shure's products. I believe that anytime a company produces a product there can be problems that occur. What I experienced with my SE530s were an exceptional product, with exceptional sound, that had a hard time under exceptional usage. Now, this could have been bad luck, or hell a bad design for all I know. Shure stood by their product and looked out for me as a customer. That is what I want people to take away from my review.

In the end, I purchased the SE535s and decided to keep my SE530s as a backup. I felt the SE535s with the replaceable cables would function better under the extreme usage that I put my headphones though and so far they have performed as I expected them to.

There are few things in the world that you really get what you pay for. The Shure SE535 headphones are in a class by themselves within this group."
263,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The SE 535s are fantastic! By far the best monitors I've ever owned. I had doubts about paying hundreds of dollars for the 535s but now that I have them it was worth it! I never want to take them off. I've had them for about two months and now have a problem. The right monitor cuts in and out. It is probably the cable. Disappointing after reading all the reviews about the improvements in the cable. I'm sending them back to Shure for repairs tomorrow. Even though the warranty will cover it, it is still a pain to have to send these back for repairs especially this soon after buying them. I can't wait to get them back though. Even with this problem they are still worth it and by far the best sounding monitors IMHO."
264,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing for clarity. If you listen to jazz, classical music, vocal centered music, or anything where the bass is not the defining feature, you'll love them. I listen to a lot of metal and don't have an issue with these. The experience is next level. I can pick out tiny details in the music, and anything with reverb is amazing. Somewhat of a spiritual experience since I used $20 earphones all my life. These are not for bass-heads though, and they will disappoint anyone looking for a bass heavy experience.

Very sturdy as well. I've had them for about 6 months and they're still in great condition. Parts are replaceable but expensive. If I broke these, I'd probably just save up for the $1000 ones instead of buying new parts. Curious to know how those sound."
265,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an audiophile, but not the ""techy"" type. I can't tell you the numerical value of a sound frequency or the product specifics. I would refer you to read Shure website for this.

Instead I can tell you what I like and dislike about the SE535 from Shure.

Let's start with the dislike first:
1. The price is really expensive.
2. No built-in microphone (for iPhone users).
3. Cables are rather rigid. This may be to prevent the inner wires to break.

What I like about SE535:
1. Rich and deep bass - this can be easily tested with most dance music.
2. Amazing sound quality and character. Try listening to Sarah Brightman ""Figlio Perduto"" and you'll understand what an angelic voice is.
3. Great for workouts and running. Ear buds are comfortable and cables rest behind the neck.

Shure also provides a good warranty for this product. I previously owned the old 53C series for 3 years. The left earphone stopped working - probably because the inner wire broke. This was of course rather disappointing because the 53C was as expensive as the new SE535. I called Shure and they replaced the broken 53C with the new SE535."
266,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are extraordinary earbuds in that they truly isolate sound. Just be careful walking across busy intersections. Expensive, but given the fact the earbuds are detachable, along with amazing sound clarity, well worth the price."
267,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these 5 months ago and the tip connecting the right ear bud to the earphone broke off, I had owned two pairs of Westones prior and had problems with their cables.
The earphone itself sounds great and has a sturdy cable but the earphone connection seems to be very delicate."
268,1.0 out of 5 stars,"not shure what all the hype is about, but i'd rather spend the money on some customs. i don't care too much about the mic so the wires were pretty lame to me. If i would have kept them, i would definitely upgrade the cables, but even with all that, i would just go with some custom in ear monitors.

it does earn one star because amazon has a great return policy"
269,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had about 10 excellent earphones over $300 and this is simply the best. I have even had the SE530. The new design is absolutely amazing. It does well for the gym too if you run or workout intensely. The base and overall sound quality is superb. What else cannot say to make you buy it? yes it is expensive but a very very good investment, one that you will definitely not regret. If you are looking to spend between $200-700, I would reccomend this without a question. Stunning headphones look wise also. I have had these for over 6 months and they're as good as day one. What makes this superior to SE530 is the design, these will not have issues with the tearing at the top and that's what makes these a winner. Any question ask me. Buy and you will never look back."
270,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought my first SE530 about 5 years ago (for $500) but they had to be replaced just after 2 years because left bud worked eratically. Shure was great for not charging me anything even tho' the warranty had just expired. The second pair developed the same problem after 3 years (so $500/5years). I had to replace them with the new 535 (which are just redsigned 530s with the same sound) at an additional cost of $240. Obviously I'm not too thrilled that these last ONLY 2-3 years at these prices.

If these go in 2-3 years, then I'm switching brands or maybe replace them with the new $100 SE215 which, for the price, are pretty great sounding too!

Right ear piece split (REP) open even tho' always handled them very gently and carefully. FORKED OVER ANOTHER $100 to Shure to REP replaced. DEFINITELY NEVER BUYING THESE AGAIN!! BUYER BEWARE!
BTW: Knowing how fragile earphones are, I always handle all of mine very gently."
271,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just sent back a pair of the Se-530 with a broken wire.(purchased 1/10) The only thing Shure required was to fill out a one page return form and a copy of the reciept along with the broken ear buds. Four days later UPS shows up with a brand new set of Se535. Now thats customer service! I wish other company's would stand behind thier products like Shure did.As far as the ear buds performance same great sound but with a much heavier cable. I use my earbuds daily when i work out so they do get used! keep um clean and they will never let you down!
272,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The wires of my Shure 530's got frayed and I got the 535's this week and I couldnt be more blown away.
It is a huge step up from the 530's (didnt think that was possible) in terms of sound clarity and the fit.

With the 530s i rediscovered heaps of albums in my music collection and with the 535's I am re-discovering them all over again."
273,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The 535 has been improved in several areas from the earlier 530 model, the latter of which I have two samples. The build quality has been discussed elsewhere. It is substantially solid and commendable. The replaceable cord is almost indestructible, but it being replaceable it is a non-issue.

More important is the sound quality which has been dramatically improved in a number of ways due to refinements to the shaping of the cavity within which the balanced armatures are fitted (I speak about the ""speakers"" inside which are more comparable to tuning forks than typical electo-magnetic speakers.) The crossover points between these armatures may also have been refined and adjusted for flatter response - meaning audibly flat, rather than just measurably flat. The external shape of the device was changed too, and it should fit more comfortably for many ears once one gets used to inserting them.

While a few listeners reported hearing ""no difference"" between the 535 and Shure's earlier 530 model, I strongly disagree. Or given that many people really can't hear even dramatic differences, it is merely true for them, but not true for those who can hear minute but significant changes between designs of audio equipment. The 535 is different from the 530 physically period. And sonically in a number of areas any sophisticated golden ear can hear. Among my audiophile acquaintances we could easily hear the improvements as follows:
1. Increased clarity and ""transparency"" throughout the frequency range resulting in better delineating of instruments, one from the other, and the textures and shapes within the sound. For example, the airy whoosh of a flute, the tinkles in the distance of a softy struck triangle at the back of the stage, the rosiny draw of the bow of a string instrument, the brassy rasp of a trombone, and the shimmer and afterglow of a brushed cymbal.
2. Higher resolution of the soundspace, such that the leading edges of percussion instruments penetrate with greater force, impact and speed. The fading tails of sound decaying away are easily distinguishable and followed to its silence.
3. The sound images locked-in-the-head feeling has been reduced significantly and the soundscape is now wider, many sounds seem to exist outside the head, even at a distance from one's ears.
4. More spatial clues and sound reflections are audible, such as naturally recorded hall ambiance and slap echo against a stage wall.
5. The bass is important to most listeners, it being the foundation for the rest and the rhythmic underpinning of music. The 535 excels in this area, even over Shure's 530 earlier model which provided deep bass surely, but not with the 535's impact, solidity and tightness, definition and textures. There are other brands with seemingly MORE bass or lower bass capability. This may be an illusion. For plumbing the deepest bass we have the requirement for very high definition. The 535 is, by a long shot, superior - you need to seal the earbud to your ear canal to hear it in all its glory.
6. One can continue describing sonic improvements over earlier designs, but there are space limits. Conclusion: I have not yet heard a more enjoyable, and most importantly, accurate portable device to date. The price, understandably, will be a factor for most people. However for the discerning listener who demands the quality of sound the 535 can furnish and will install CD Redbook standard or higher resolution audio files in their music players/iPods, the Shure 535 will be a stunning addition to their musical enjoyment on the go, in a plane, while exercising, or at home."
274,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Couldn't be happier with these guys. They're pricey, but if you're willing to drop this amount of coin on quality audio equipment, I can assure you that you won't be disappointed. The top reviews as of 12/25/2014 describe my experience accurately."
275,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Updating my rating from 3 to 4 stars because Shure replaced my earbuds under the 2 year warranty at no charge.
---
I have had these headphones for 2 years. The sound is great. I'm not an audiophile, but I hear lyrics in songs from my childhood that I never understood before. That's all fine.
I am looking at replacing these earbuds soon though and I'm going to look at other brands first. Here's why:
1) I have never liked the connector wire. The plastic housing on the connector part is too large a diameter for iPhone covers. I had to drill out the hole on my cover to make it work. I tried to loan the earbuds to my daughter recently and she could not get her iPhone cover off and the headphones wouldn't plug in because of what I just described. I was driving, so I couldn't help her. Useless. I had to listen to PitBull, or whatever it is she listens to, while I drove. Annoying!
2) The connector wire is too stiff and took some getting used to. I got another wire that had a little mic on it for phone conversations, but it only lasted maybe 1/2 year before it frayed at an end and lost electrical contact. Now I'm back to the stiff connector wire with no mic. If only they made the stiff connector wire with a mic. Why not? I don't know.
3) I have had intermittent sound with the right earpiece for over a year. I bought a new connector wire and have the same problem. So it is obviously the right earpiece itself, IOW, the 1/2 of $350 part of the earbuds is intermittent, not the cheap part, the wire. Here's what happens, music, boogie, turn head - only sound in left ear, turn head back, sound in both ears. Wiggle slightly, sound in only left ear. Tap right ear, sound in both ears. The only thing I have found that temporarily fixes the problem is to spray electronic contact cleaner on the connectors of the right earbud. That 'fixes' it for a couple of weeks most of the time."
276,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for since Dec 2011 and I still love them. They sound fantastic. Durability has been great, a real step up from the SE530. I use them on the train, when flying or anywhere really and they great."
277,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I think this is the last time I'm trying in-ear headsets.

Pros
-Sound clarity is top-notch
-Clear separation of levels
-Wire looks durable
-Includes many accessories

Cons
-EXPENSIVE - and reason for low score. There is no way this is worth $500. Not even $300. For $300 you are better off with the B&W P5. If you don't mind the size, the AKG K271 will give you the best quality for a closed-back at under $200!

-Zero Sound Stage - Music is not all about super-clear quality. There is basically no sound stage with these buds. Perhaps that is a characteristic of all in-ear buds, but then they shouldn't rip people off with the outrageous price. Listening to a studio recorded piece is passable. However, when you listen to a live recording, fuhgettaboutit. Sounds horrible. Sounds quite tiny and in your face.

-Not Comfortable - For $500, i expect better comfort than other in-ear buds. But this is not the case.

Anyway, going back to on-ear or over-the-ear headsets. If you truly enjoy music, there is no substitute."
278,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these. Best listening experience I have ever had period. I actually shutter when I think that I might not have purchased these and missed out on the beautiful experience that owning these has given me!
279,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just wow never did I think earbuds could sound like your at a studio these are phenomenal 😁
280,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The onlything you need to know is this. If you like super sharp clean mids and highs along with rich deep base you will LOVE
the SE535."
281,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The mids are good but the lows and highs are both bad. It's not a fit issue; I've had IEM before and I know how to fit them. I got near total sound isolation with these, what better fitting could there be?
I have the HD650 and compared to it the Shure's highs are almost like noise, they aren't too bright, they're scratchy and muffled.

I listened to them on a COWON D2 with all sound enhancements off. After the initial shock, I tried to correct the sound a bit with the EQ on the D2. The highs became good enough (nowhere near the Sennheiser HD650), but acceptable.
No matter what I tried, I couldn't correct the lows. They still sounded distant and weak, and if pushed they loose definition becoming muddled and slightly distorted.

The sound is clearly not something out of a cheap headphones; you can hear the individual instruments and the mids are almost perfect. If you have a way of returning them for a refund, then by all means, try them for yourself. Maybe I have been spoiled by good headphones."
282,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After trying the SE425, the SE846, and now the SE535, I am happily wed to the Etymotic ER4SR.

Shure fanboys, do you call this lack of upper midrange response a sound signature?"
283,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before mine were stolen off a plane, these were the best ear buds that I've ever had. With the sound being so clear and balanced, these make Bose sound like a joke... I know because I had Bose earbuds and other $100+ headphones."
284,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The 535 has been improved in several areas from the earlier 530 model, the latter of which I have two samples. The build quality has been discussed elsewhere. It is substantially solid and commendable. The replaceable cord is almost indestructible, but it being replaceable it is a non-issue.

More important is the sound quality which has been dramatically improved in a number of ways due to refinements to the shaping of the cavity within which the balanced armatures are fitted (I speak about the ""speakers"" inside which are more comparable to tuning forks than typical electo-magnetic speakers.) The crossover points between these armatures may also have been refined and adjusted for flatter response - meaning audibly flat, rather than just measurably flat. The external shape of the device was changed too, and it should fit more comfortably for many ears once one gets used to inserting them.

While a few listeners reported hearing ""no difference"" between the 535 and Shure's earlier 530 model, I strongly disagree. Or given that many people really can't hear even dramatic differences, it is merely true for them, but not true for those who can hear minute but significant changes between designs of audio equipment. The 535 is different from the 530 physically period. And sonically in a number of areas any sophisticated golden ear can hear. Among my audiophile acquaintances we could easily hear the improvements as follows:
1. Increased clarity and ""transparency"" throughout the frequency range resulting in better delineating of instruments, one from the other, and the textures and shapes within the sound. For example, the airy whoosh of a flute, the tinkles in the distance of a softy struck triangle at the back of the stage, the rosiny draw of the bow of a string instrument, the brassy rasp of a trombone, and the shimmer and afterglow of a brushed cymbal.
2. Higher resolution of the soundspace, such that the leading edges of percussion instruments penetrate with greater force, impact and speed. The fading tails of sound decaying away are easily distinguishable and followed to its silence.
3. The sound images locked-in-the-head feeling has been reduced significantly and the soundscape is now wider, many sounds seem to exist outside the head, even at a distance from one's ears.
4. More spatial clues and sound reflections are audible, such as naturally recorded hall ambiance and slap echo against a stage wall.
5. The bass is important to most listeners, it being the foundation for the rest and the rhythmic underpinning of music. The 535 excels in this area, even over Shure's 530 earlier model which provided deep bass surely, but not with the 535's impact, solidity and tightness, definition and textures. There are other brands with seemingly MORE bass or lower bass capability. This may be an illusion. For plumbing the deepest bass we have the requirement for very high definition. The 535 is, by a long shot, superior - you need to seal the earbud to your ear canal to hear it in all its glory.
6. One can continue describing sonic improvements over earlier designs, but there are space limits. Conclusion: I have not yet heard a more enjoyable, and most importantly, accurate portable device to date. The price, understandably, will be a factor for most people. However for the discerning listener who demands the quality of sound the 535 can furnish and will install CD Redbook standard or higher resolution audio files in their music players/iPods, the Shure 535 will be a stunning addition to their musical enjoyment on the go, in a plane, while exercising, or at home."
285,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I own the SE530 and have been having sound quality issues, cracking and very low quality bass. I have made sure I am achieving a ""good seal"" and still same issues. So I contact Shure and advise of the issues I am having and they offered no solutions on repair of the SE530(maybe this is not an option) however they want to replace with the new SE535 for an additional $240.00 plus tax. I was already to send them back and a light went off....I paid $500.00-$600.00 retail for the SE530 and now they want an additional $240.00 for replacement. Yes that is a large discount off the normal retail price, however when I purchased the SE530 I have taken great care of the ear buds as not to damage them because of the price I paid I was counting on the SE530 lasting me for life and providing me hours of high quality sound enjoyment. Again I took care of the ear buds like they were a new baby. I feel the Shure is a sub-standard product because of the price paid I would like to think one would be able to be afforded high quality listening for many years, as long as they were maintained and cared for in the correct manor. So I would like to request that before you purchase the Shure ear buds that you make sure you are ready to replace them after the two year warranty expires. Shure quality is not equal to the premium price."
286,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE535 is my first pair of premium earphones. I love them! I listen to all kinds of music, but mostly rock and these earphones have shown me a new dimension in most of my favorite songs. The Mids are especially awesome, and the clarity is breathtaking. Again, I am new to high-end in ears so can't really say that these are the best for the price range, but I am happy with the purchase."
287,5.0 out of 5 stars,the earphone is lack in bass but the singers' voice stands out ftom the music. not suitable for bassheads. isolation is ok but not as good as etymotic
288,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My music never sounded so good. It's like being in the studio with the artists. If you can afford it, go for it."
289,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had these for 12 months now and had no problems. Highly recommend if you love your music
290,5.0 out of 5 stars, I would be lying if I said I had reservations on spending $500 for a pair of headphones... They all left after I tried them on... Check it out!
291,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After using the 535LTD for about 4 months, I feel compelled to write this review for other potential buyers. To preface, I have listened to a number of IMEs, including Etymotic ER4, HF5, Shure 215, UE TF10, Westone UM2, Westone Pro30, and most recently Sony XBA-A3.

Pro: for female vocals, the 535LTD produces absolutely heavenly sound. No other earphones can match it.

Cons: it has absolutely no bass/sub-bass. I'm not a bass-head by any measure, but I do enjoy defined and precise bass. The 535LTD has zero of that. As a result, it performs horribly for any type of music that's not female vocals (ok, maybe male vocals are also fine).

In conclusion. If female vocal is what you listen primarily, go for 535, otherwise I recommend trying out a few others first before buying."
292,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned over 30 pairs of IEM's and earphones (up to the $1500 AKG K3003I), and I can honestly say that the previous generation shures (i.e. the SE530) are better than the current generation shures (i.e. the SE535).

In my opinion, Shure cheaped out on their new models, and made a worse driver in their SE535 (replacement of the SE530) to save money. Moreover, a lot of people, not just me, on headphone forums agree that the SE530 (and the previous generation of shures, e.g. SE420, SE530) have a much more comfortable fit and seals better, which translates into better sound quality. The new version (SE535) doesn't go as much into your ear, and it doesn't fit at all with a lot of people...

Honestly, just because of the fit issues, the SE530 sounds much better than the SE535. It's kinda like windows vista when it first launched. The previous generation is better. Period.

Also the SE535 loses the PTH function, which was cool because it allowed you to hear your surroundings by pushing a button. Bummer."
293,1.0 out of 5 stars,"A good earphone should be comfortable for one's to wear at the very first place. This earphone first let you know that if you do not wear it correctly, then you will receive low frequency sound. The problem is that every time you wear it, you have to spent more time in adjusting the earphone position, rather than enjoying you music. The high price really does not mean that it is the best. I personally do not like the design; it has nothing to do with the sound quality, just the poor design makes you never enjoy it."
294,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I have been in the market for the finest ear buds for a while. I have tried the stock apple which I got good to great sound then the bose that I have stuck with which are a bit better than the apple. I have tried in this order v-mode, ditty beats, shure 535's and kilpsch si4.
After talking with people that said these are clearly better than Bose. They say you have to spend 1 to 5 days getting the right fit. Well I can tell you thats not happing for me when I spend 535.00 dollars and they sound like 9.95 ear buds.... True the shures were clear and I guess if your using them for speaking in a helmet on a nascar race track y not.
If someone can or has earbuds that they think sound great would love to try for free as I am not buying and returning anymore.....
Good luck to all...."
295,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this earphone last year from London I always want to buy fron shure I'm very disappointed because after a while there is no sound from the left earpiece From any audio source.
296,4.0 out of 5 stars,"EDIT: Based on comments from other users, I again approached Shure and this time received EXCELLENT customer service and had all issues solved swiftly and responsively. I am impressed by Shure's service and - despite the experience outlined below - am now very pleased the company and the headphones.

Before getting these earphones, it's worth considering Shure's customer service and build quality issues. I bought the top-of-the-line SE530s (now SE535s, with upgraded cable connectors) and found that the rubber surrounding the cables to both earphones cracked and broke within the first couple of months of use (very careful, gentle use! These are $500 earphones after all) -- if you search 'Shure cable cracking' in Google you'll find a LOT of reports of the exact same problem.

Okay, no drama, just warranty them right? Except the warranty ran out. Okay, no drama, pay Shure $150 to repair them (like it says on Shure's website). Except this is a manufacturing defect that affected a lot of consumers -- for instance, read all the complaints in the thread at [...](including one case where Shure actually sent out a rebadged old model to replace a defective $500 SE530!)

A couple of months ago I sent my defective SE530s to Shure with a paid repair form and my credit card details and a polite letter asking them to either fix the defective $500 SE530s or take the $150 repair/replacement fee and replace them with the model which corrects the defect, the SE535 (my reasoning being, who would reasonably pay $150 to replace the ones that broke with a pair that has the exact same defect, when Shure has now come out with a model with a replaceable cable designed to correct the problems with the SE530?).

Which is where it gets really awful: A month later, I was overjoyed to get a small parcel in the mail from Shure. I eagerly opened it and found... the broken earphones. Not even a note or a single word of explanation from Shure. I can't even write how upset I was by this. The basic message is, Shure just don't seem to care about customers or quality. Once they've sold us the product, they won't stand behind it or even bother talking to you. I found my Shure experience really upsetting and I don't think I'll be able to trust Shure again."
297,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had 3 of these now. Let's start with the first pair. The first pair actually lasted a couple of years. But then the wire that goes above the ear just got old and brittle and cracked...on both sides. I loved the sound, so I bought another pair. This one was defective and within a week, the stem cracked. Shure replaced them without cost. Now on my 3rd pair (the 2nd I've paid for), the sound in the left ear just vanished one day. I have no idea. They were well cared for (i.e. not exposed to moisture, heat, etc.). This would all be fine and good for $50 earphones, but not for something I paid $550...TWICE."
298,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these in November 2011 and the left earpiece just quit working.

At a cost of $439.00, that equates to about $27.00/month. Since on average I use the headphones about once/week - that equates to about $6.80 for EACH use.

I am absolutely certain the sound quality they provide is not worth THAT price!

My advice -- save you hard earned cash!!"
299,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible. Bad. It's not compatible with all the devices. Produces an annoying ""m"" noise and buzzing. I prefer my $20 over-the-ear headphones than this piece of crap."
300,5.0 out of 5 stars,these earphones are awesome their sound quality was really great until i flushed them down the toilet which was super sad
301,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using the Shure duel driver ear buds (with a custom fix wax ear piece from an audiologist) for aprox 10 years. It has saved my voice and it has saved my ears from the demands of a noisy stage. They finally wore down in sound quality they have broke on me 3 times. Time for a new pair. I chose the middle of the road like most of us do. Keep in mind I tried these one night. They sound a little better but the chord is a lot cheaper. I used the foam ear piece that was on it because it felt pretty good in my ear. But by the end of the night the inner rims of my ear were hurting pretty bad. May be I pushed them in too much. Do not buy these for personal listening. There is no low end. They work good on a stage because they are clear and light on mid range freq. They cut through the clutter like any good monitor mix. My son uses a $29 pair of buds while playing and singing and he is very happy with what he hears. When my old pair broke I used a $10 pair from the friggin airport and they did the job all night.
302,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was robbed. These headphones are crap.
303,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The connectors to the individual earbuds are junk! First it starts out with a little bit of static when you move your head,then the sound fully cuts in and out, and then nothing... no sound.. nada! Consider yourself lucky if they last a month. I cannot believe these made it through any sort of product testing. I loved my previous Sures but these are useless junk and customer services is non existent, I feel ripped off. Never again will I buy a Sure product!"
304,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased this model 3 times since 2005. When I first purchased it, I had to return it for repair every 6-8 months. After the second return, I started taking meticulous care of the earphones, exactly as the manual and repairman recommended. I never used them working out, I only used for 1-2 hours a day, I cleaned my ears regularly, and cleaned the earphones regularly. But this increased the time to malfunction to 12-22 months. Without fail, one of the earphones would stop broadcasting sound. Although Shure had been replacing my malfunctioned earphones with brand new ones the last 6 years (without charge), they have started charging ($250) for repair. I've also spent close to $200 on FedEx charges sending them back. I'm really upset b/c I've spent a total of about $1700 the past 6 years for this model. I believe Shure knows that this model is defective and cannot last more than 2 years. They probably realized how much money they were losing by constantly replacing these defective ones with new ones and recently decided to give every user one or two free replacements before charging them. I truly believe this is a fraud b/c I've asked their service department many times the exact malfunction/defect of my headphones and they always dance around the question. Although the sound quality is the best available for its category, the model will probably not last you more than 2 years, even with conservative wear and proper maintenance. You will have to maintain $250 replacement cost every 3-4 years."
305,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Regarding the Shure SE210 y SE530pth models and their cable problems.
It is supposed this earphones are the best IEMs in the in the market nowadays. Is it really?
Not at all¡¡.
Even the SE530pth model that costs around 300 euros is just rubbish. Why do I say that?
Because after a few more than the two years of warranty, the cables start to get degradation splits and cracks, and finally in less than a couple of months, one or both earphones are not more longer in use as consequence of the cable degradation...just a few months after warranty expired¡¡¡... CURIOUS.
If somebody consults the WEB, it is possible to find out that Shure replaces the damage, even out of warranty. Again... is it true?.
Not in my case. As mentioned above, I have two different shures-models with the same problem. I consulted Shure in Germany, (European headquarters). They lamented and referred me to the Spanish representative calls Earpo-Barcelona.
Upon I contacted them; they required my both earphones to be sent to their technical department for a warranty extension. I sent them. After two weeks, I had to contact again to Germany as a fault of courtesy by Earpro. Later some people from Earpro contacted me but nobody resolved me the problem, or said me where o how my damaged pair were....
Finally after another week, I contacted again with Germany, (Spanish very poor in courtesy), and again another staff of Barcelona's Earpro contacted with me for a advantage offer for the new ones?¿¿?...which to be totally honest still I am awaiting...they played to bored me...and they worked out very well in that...
As result of the last e-mail, I asked the following questions:
* A technical report in which I could identify why my both earphones were damaged in nearly two years. In fact, both earphones were at the technical disposal of Shure.
* An explanation why some customers, (in Amazon.UK there are a few examples...see for SE530 the one from S. Cole 20 Aug 2010 15:54:38 BDT, appointing ""Shure replaced them as a goodwill gesture"" ...), they had the earphone replaced, and myself with TWO NOT?¿?¿
* Another explanation, why if these products are badly designed, they are still on the marked and not have been completed retired.
To finish. Do not buy SE530/210. You will have to put in the trash in more than two years.
And, please, think twice for the new ones SE535-315 with detachable cables...in any case, after two years, you have to buy new cables....around 50 Euros each¡¡¡¡."

I am very very dissapointed by my purchase. This headphone fits badly on my years almost hurts everytime I put and remove it. My ears are soar now and I have to really think twice before trying it again. I have not gathered the strength to wear them again since last one month.

Sound quality is below average. Every other headphone I have used sound better. My cheap creative computer headphones sound better. Bass is missing.... badly missing... vocals are low.... only treble sounds are prominent.....and irritating.

308,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the se530s bought these headphones about 2 years ago, before i went on a trip. I ended up opening them up in the car and didn't know at the time that you had a limited time to register them to get warranty support. about 3 months later I found this tiny metal tube in the carrying case that they came with and thought maybe it was some junk from work but the right side had no bass. About 3 months after that I cleaned them with the supplied ear wax cleaner and the metal tube came out of the one side, so I checked the other side and the tube was gone. I realize that the piece that fell out of the case a few months before was part of the head phones amd now both sides have no bass. When I contacted Shure's customer support they ended up sending me an email saying that they would fix it but charge me $145.00 for an out of warranty repair since I didn't immediately register them. So I payed $400.00 for a pair of headphones that didn't last 3 months and now just sit in a drawer. They couldn't grant me a one time courtesy for a technicality and instead tried to shake me for another 145 for their mistake. What do they care they already have my money. I'm never buying anything from they again and I would highly recommend that you look at a better company that doesn't have a customer service that just disappoints."
309,1.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!!!
310,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first, I was skeptical to pay nearly $500 for a pair of in-ear headphones. I knew that SHURE has a reputable reputation among audiophiles and musicians in general, but I simply had never seen such a hefty price tag for such small headphones. In the past, I owned the BOSE QC 15, DR DRE STUDIOS, and then various cheap SONY headphones I take around sometimes.

Well, my conclusion about the SHURE SE-535V was made in about half a second. As soon as I figured out how to put them on they molded to my ear. When I chose my first song to play, I chose one with a deep bass to instantly test out the depth of the headphones. I was amazed. I had high expectations - only natural for such a high price - but the headphones honestly matched them. Right away I couldn't hear anything my roommates were trying to say to me. When you play the music loud with these headphones, you literally feel like you are in your own world. You can feel the beats of songs comfortably on the inner parts of your ear and you can feel the precision of the engineering. The cable that comes with the headphones is flat out the strongest cable I've ever had and it feels very durable.

Overall, by the end of my decision, I just had to make up my mind whether I felt comfortable dropping so much money on an item like headphones - which although I use every single day are easy to lose items. So far I've been very conscious of making sure I put my headphones back in my backpack so that I don't lose it among a pair of pants, jacket or just somewhere you don't even know.

If you love music, and if you listen to music constantly throughout the day studying, doing work, commuting or just relaxing, you can not find a more premium-quality sounding and feeling pair of headphones. These are like the AMEX Black Card of In-ear headphones. Also, Amazon offers $100/off so why not. Comes with 2-year warranty."
311,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The shipping came on time and it was well packed. I'm a shure's earphone user for years and I always love how gentle, distinctive and dynamic the mids are. The isolation has always been good and I once had a good time with my SE425 till I sold it to a good friend who wants a good earphone but couldn't pay enough for a first hand. Having used SE425 and SE535, I would say both are equally decent for their mids. However, SE425 does not give that much of bass as how SE535 does. 535 has a better balance with addtional bass than having the ""kick"" in comparison to westone 3 or 4. If you love music and earphones that you can listen for long hours, SE535 is definitely a earphone to go for compared to 425. 425 gets a little dull for it's a little too gentle but it's good for those who appreciate instrumental classical musics. Many will recommend to shell a custom fit earphone by paying a few hundred more for a better fitting and customized earphone than paying for 535. I would say no to that until I've discover enough for my knowledge in sound and my habit for sound. Not an audiophile, but a fan for good sound."
312,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I will not make this a review of the IEM (in-ear monitor). I will just say that these are the best headphones I have ever heard if you have a good recording. I use these on the iPhone 5s and it drives them just fine. The mids get a little flat on so-so recordings but the bass it strong, defined, and punchy. I can even hear the sub boom... not strong but audible. For what these cost I expected no less. I have a pair of E5s and these blows them away. The E5s sound flat compared the 535s."
313,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unlike some of the other reviews, these earbuds exceeded my expectations. (And they should, for over $500.) They're like a mini-surround sound system in your ears. The entire sound spectrum is crystal clear. The connection system on the SE535's are truly unique to Shure; the earbud wire that connects the earbuds to the audio source features a connection that is detachable on the earbud. So if the wire fails, you simply have to replace the wire, not the expensive earbud. Shure goes all out with the provided accessories. There are three different types of earbuds for your ears, whichever fits you best.

The sound isolation is superb. I can listen to music and can not hear myself pressing the keys on the keyboard as I am typing this review. I can have the television on at its highest volume, and while music is playing, I can not hear it. Sound stage is another highlight of the earbuds. When you listen, and close your eyes, you feel as if you are in the room with those singing and playing the accompanying instruments.

Rest assured, you will not regret the purchase. Shure customer service is top-notch, just make sure you register your product with them and keep your original purchase receipt."
314,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I found these headphones when they were on sale, so against my better judgement, I took the plunge once my Shure E2c earbuds completely died and I got sick of using my Beats Studio (a terrible purchase decision on my part, but college makes you do stupid things during your stay)to listen to music decidedly not hip hop. When comparing against the Beats, the SE535 wins hands down, and the results aren't even close. Compared to my old E2c headphones, the difference is still there, but not quite enough to justify the $400 I spent.

While the 535 sounds great and accurate, the difference is fairly subtle when comparing to other mid to high-end headphones. I realized that I had gotten so used to high bass on my Beats that the bass left me feeling thoroughly underwhelmed during my first three days of use. If you're looking for over-stimulation through bass especially, these earphones are not for you. Comparing the sound to that of my old E2c's, there is better clarity and separation, and I would say that the bass quality is improved. This is, however, not immediately apparent, and does require a fair amount of comparison.

For pop, these headphones are somewhat wasted. In classical music, however, the 535's really do shine, and after my purchase, I have started listening to classical music much more frequently.

TL;DR
If you are a huge enthusiast of music -- especially classical -- and you're in the market for new earbuds, these headphones won't fail you. Unfortunately, however, I haven't tried the SE425, so I can't say how much these earbuds are worth the actual cost. If you like pop, you should probably buy something cheaper or/and bass-heavy."
315,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, these are my first real IEM's. I have used the etymotic MC5's for a while, but let's be serious, they're not real IEM's. I was considering going for custom UE's, westone's or JH-Audio's. I decided on the shure se-535's after reading a review by another drummer using them for live performance.

First things first, I got them and it took me a little while to figure out how to put them on. Once I figured out red=right and I made sense of the images showing me how to insert them, I finally got good sound. It also took me a long time to figure out how to get the default black medium foam tips off. I ended up using my shirt as a grip and turned them several times to get them off. With the large foam tips, they form a perfect seal.

I used them for a couple of days with just my MP3 player. They seem to take a little while to ""break in"", but even right out of the gate, they sound pretty amazing.

I finally got to try them out for a live performance. During sound check I realized that they worked better than my regular ear plugs. I basically couldn't hear my kick at all. My snare was so quiet I couldn't tell how hard I was hitting. I had to have the sound guys put my drums back into my monitor for me to hear them. They are just as amazing on stage as they are with recorded music. I could hear the low thump of my kick and the growl of the bassist, every little movement of guitarists across their guitar, and voices came through perfectly clear. For the money, I have to say that these deliver just fine! Thanks Shure for making an amazing product."
316,4.0 out of 5 stars,This replaced my pair of Ultimate Ears IEMs and must say the SE535-V are even better. This particular purchase came with a $50 rebate making it a great bargain. Perfect while working out at the gym or going for a brisk run. The noise cancellation can be hazardous to you health if you live in the city and walk to get around. I was wearing mine at a reasonable level and almost got run over my a bus because I didn't hear it coming.
317,4.0 out of 5 stars,"There is no question but that these buds project incredible sound. The bass, mid and high ranges are all quite true. Also included is a great choice of alternative ear buds, so great fit is assured. Two caveats; the wires tend to get tangled and the phones can become uncomfortable to wear for protracted periods of time. If you are willing to sacrifice some degree of comfort and are willing to pay megabucks for incredible sound reproduction, this is the set for you."
318,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my Shure SC4's started dry rotting before my very eyes, I decided it was time to make another earphone purchase. I read a few reviews and condsidered several brands before deciding upon the SE535's. You have to hear them to really appreciate how goodthey sound. Clear, undistorted, accurate sound reproduction.You can actually hear details in music you never noticed before, such as the snare being slightly off center or the airyness of the reverb.There are many headphones with more bass (and also muddy sound) but none of them compare to these earbuds. The only issue I have is with the price. 500 bucks is a lot to spend on earphones. But if you have it to spend, I suggest you take a listen with these earphones. You won't be disappointed."
319,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's only one con, so let get that out of the way first:

The pair that I ordered (used, $420) did not come with the remote cable, but a light grey one. However, this light grey cable wasn't stupidly long (like default Shure cables) yet long enough to run it behind my head, down my back and under my arm into my jacket pocket (+ some wiggle room). I'd consider the reduced length a huge plus for me, but not for everyone.

As for the sound? JESUS CHRIST IT'S BEAUTIFUL

Right before testing them out I used the SE215s to listen to the main theme of Man of Steel (using Neutron MP on an Sony phone, no effects, filters or anything). As it was with the first time testing those, the audio was very crisp and the instrumental separation was very good, but the soundstage was small, the flavor was too warm, and they were very quiet. Also, level dynamics were a little weird. They were SO bass-biased that louder (actually louder, with a larger waveform) parts felt quieter simply because they were at a higher pitch. These were nice buds, but not the ones for me.

Then I put the 535LTDs in and my head exploded. You see, the first noticeable difference is that they are *much* louder. The soundstage is also far wider - not just left to right, even. It felt like it was making an indent between the back of my skull and my forehead. By far and away the loudest, biggest-sounding pair of headphones (over or in-ear) that I've ever laid ears on. I'm a huge volume addict and I frequently am frustrated by the quietness of the max volume on anything, always turning it up all the way and boosting it by at least 5dB, and I had to turn them *down*.

That's enough to satisfy the metalhead 17-year-olds with a death-wish out there, but what about clarity and texture?

While things were noticeably more treble-y (a given, as the frequency range goes up to 19.5KHz instead of 17), I didn't notice anything too wild throughout the quiet piano intro. But then, once things started to rev up I noticed something spectacular - everything was given much harder panning than on the SE215, yet instrument separation was somehow *better*. I could even make out a huge difference between droning bass guitar plucks and low piano key hit in the exact same L/R spot, when previously they had melded into one thing.

Everything was already much more clear, and much shinier - but then... Oh, then something happened that almost made me cry.

For this I'll need to reference the specific part of music; google ""What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?"", find a video, and take the playhead to about 2:22. Give it 17 seconds of buildup and listen to the ""chorus"" afterwards. That beautiful theme is incredibly nostalgic for me - when I was 14 that was the most inspiring, empowering thing I'd ever heard. Sadly, as with any song, the enjoyment I can take in it has deteriorated over time.

But, like meeting an old friend after a decade, when you've both grown and improved so much and the feelings and memories all come flooding back, the SE535LTDs brought ""Man of Steel"" back in full force. Not only was the soundstage incredibly wide, the frequency range bounding all over the place, the texture so smooth, soaring and heroic - it also, when taken in together, brought me close to tears and made me feel like Superman. That's what these headphones do - they take the emotion of any given track and amplify it to what you got the first time you heard it.

One thing I should warn you about though: These might make you dance. Or jump, or whatever it is that your song ""feels"" like. It's insane, and it's been happening to me *all the time*.

Something of note is that, while I always assume that I will have to make some wild EQ customizations for every pair of headphones, these were already at the standard that I try to get things to. The best way I could describe the sound flavor of the SE535LTDs is ""W shaped"" or ""Zig-Zag Shaped"". We all know about the classic, fun ""V Shape"" sound, boosting bass and treble and making everything kick and sparkle at the same time. And we know Shure is famous for the quality, clarity and near-prioritization they bring to their mids.

I am happy to tell you that this is the best of both worlds. It's tough to say whether you can call this ""free of coloration"", because nothing overpowers anything but there are frequency decisions made. You have to listen for a while to detect it, but once you do there is a clear sub-200Hz and 8000KHz-plus boost. Yet it feels almost like specific frequencies along the line between them get subtle boosts too. It manages to be ridiculously accurate, yet change the sonic flavor between individual tracks. I for one *love* this, because instead of adding a sweeping sound profile to everything you hear, it enhances the sonic differences that are already there - from album to album, track to track, even movement to movement. It's like an EQ version of dynamic range. i.e., this pair is to other IEMs what ""24/96 FLAC"" is to ""just below CD quality"".

For my more specific tastes I let the 1-2KHz and 15KHz+ areas fall to -2.5dB in my equalizer, but that was simply adding to something already pretty damn perfect for personal taste, not correcting an inaccuracy or sound flub.

If you're a basshead, know that these can ABSOLUTELY handle that - they just aren't doing it by default. Boost your low frequencies by 3 to 5 decibels and you'll see what I'm talking about.

What are you waiting for? BUY THE DAMN THINGS, YOU WON'T REGRET IT"
320,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased these as a replacement for my old Shure E2c earphones which had great clarity, but were a little short on bass. The Shure SE535-V earphones have unbelieveable clarity, and it is like listening to each of my tracks for the first time - like the difference between standard definition television and HDTV. There is significantly more detail to the sound and less distortion, making for a much more enjoyable listening experience. With the triple flange sleeves, and a slight trimming off of the stem to get a great fit, the phones are very comforatable and provide better isolation in noisy environments like the gym than any in-ear listeing device I have used. I would say that the sound is slightly warm with accurate bass - but I would not say overwhelming bass or bass heavy. Construction wise, these are solid. On an airplane, the Bose QC15 is a better choice since the low frequency plane noise tends to diminish bass somewhat and in-ear phones don't allow for pressure equalization. The earphones are worth the cost given the magnitude of difference they make in accuracy and listenability, and relative to the fact that they should last for a few years."
321,2.0 out of 5 stars,Already one side not working
322,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best sounding, most comfortable earbuds on the market. You are able to listen to your iPod with the sound at 25%, perfectly. Yes, they are expensive, but the fact that you can now replace the cords is huge. I had to replace a pair of E5 earbuds, a predecessor to the SE535-V because the cables went bad. Sure has solved this proble, and this will likely be the last earbuds I ever buy.

And you don't look like a dork with the a pair of huge headphones that are all bling and no sound."
323,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not going to take the time to type a long review here. So let me sum it up based on all the reviews and tests I have done.

These are excellent earbuds, they are well made, comfortable, and nice looking. They have a great soundstage, bright highs, full mid range, although lacking in Bass for Musical listeners. I don't mean that in a bad way, these are monitors, and they can handle Bass well, just expect to have to bring it out with your EQ and after break in. And don't expect to bring out there full potential directly connected to your portable device, they sound good, but not as good as through an audiophile grade DAC and Amp.

The Cable is a bit long for my tastes. I'd prefer some more color options. But these are worth the costs. Buy with confidence."
324,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones. They block out nearly all the sound outside and they sound amazing. Never had a pair of headphones comparable. I even work out in them and no problems with sweat or them coming out of ears. Would highly recommend for someone who wants to listen to music at amazing quality and not have to hear anything around him.
325,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these after a number of other earbuds including the Jaybird Bluebuds and Bose QC 20i. My trusty 5 year old Klipsch 10xi's were also still in good shape.

I figured if I were going to splurge, I'd go all the way - so I went with the limited red version.

I did quite a bit of research and bought these as a birthday present for myself. At first when I got them, I was taken aback by all the choices of ear tips. Of course I tried a bunch of them to determine which worked best for me. I get the best overall fit and feel with the gray soft tips -very similar to the ones in my Klipsch's.

At first, I thought what's the big deal with these earbuds? I truly didn't find anything special about their sound. So then I subscribed to a trial of the lossless music stream Tidal. Holy cow that's when the difference kicked in. At first it was - yeah the Shure's do sound better. But after a few days I can say that these are definitely my go to earbuds. There's no match to the comfort and sound of these earbuds. They offer just an overall superb listening experience. Absurdly expensive - yes, but so worth it."
326,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are, hands down, the best in-ear earphones I've ever owned. Crystal clear sound, snug fit, easily inserted, and comfortable for long term use. I use them while gardening and at work. I rarely give five star reviews, but this one Shurely deserves it. My only complaint is the cable. It does not last long with continued use. You will have to replace it, but that's the nice part. It can be easily replaced. Highly recommend these earphones."
327,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing. I was nervous about spending this amount of money on a pair of headphones because I had already bought two pairs of beats by dr dre. These are totally worth it. The clarity is amazing and I have heard things in songs I never heard before, and these were songs I listened to every day. The noise isolating is the way to go. I travel a lot and these will be my go-to headphones now. It's like putting ear plugs in and just hearing the music. No outside noise, nothing. They are also very comfortable; I have worn them for hours and hours with no discomfort at all."
328,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really accurate sound. I've read some people not very happy for the lack of Bass sound, I think this headphones has the exact amount of bass if you do your homework for properly fit the sleeves inside the ear canal, once reached, you will feel plenty immersed surrounded by your favorite musicians playing for you. Of course you must have good music quality recording to appreciate this headphones capabilities. Some times a little bit uncomfortable due to the need of tight ear canal sealing when wearing for long periods of time. I use it every day for exercise and when need concentration during my work. Really happy with them."
329,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Obviously ear buds will NOT shake your pant legs with bass, but these do make good sound all the way down. To get the full efffect you need to go really deep in your year and make a totally air tight seal. Good news they give you at least 5 different sizes and shapes of foam holders. THe bad news is I have unusually deep ears and had to ultimately get custom silicon holders. $500 more dollars."
330,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned the SE530 earphones and upgraded to these when the cord frayed right at the connection to the earphone on the left ear. I loved that pair and I love this pair. No major improvements to sound as the SE530's were already really well done. I do love the fact the connection to the earphone is now removable and the portion of the wire that goes over the ear is reinforced. With those upgrades I see these lasting me a very long time.

I wouldn't buy these if you are looking for earth shattering skull rattling bass; however, these do an excellent job all around on audio high, mid, and low all very proportional and smooth. Well worth the money for any of you in doubt. Everything seems really well build and no issues with the detachable cable crackling or losing its grip like others mention."
331,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best IEM I've ever used hands down.
332,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Go read the reviews on this product by T. Pines and Jed, and BELIEVE THEM. I have several pair of earphones around here and since I got these, they're the only ones I grab anymore; the others I've used before don't even remotely compare. Seriously, stop looking and just splurge. If sound is your thing, the Shure SE535 earphones are what you want. I laughed when I first saw T. Pines' review and read, ""They will change your life,"" and Jed's review where he refers to them as ""Fantasmagical,"" but you know what? They were both right. Costly or not, there's no going back now - not from earphones that sound this good."
333,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm one of the unusual people who gets a perfect fit with Shure's earphones, so I upgraded from my 215s to the 535s after trying these out at an InMotion store.

I kept hearing the sound signature wasn't balanced, but it sounds (mostly) balanced from my ear. Bass is present but won't suit the tastes of bassheads; these earphones use triple BA drivers and don't have that ""kick"" in the low range. Mids are excellently refined, and they always are with Shure. But, in typical Shure fashion, the 535s suffer from a treble roll-off (though not nearly as bad as the 215s), though this is easily correctible with an EQ. Treble is nowhere near sparkly or analytical, but is incredibly accurate.

In the U.S., the LTD version has no sound difference from the normal ones.

The greatest selling point to the sound signature is how intimate it is. The sound has a much longer decay than most other high-performance IEMs and the soundstage is incredible. Everything sounds like a live performance. In addition, it's the least-fatiguing sound I have ever experienced in an IEM.

One thing I really like about the new cables is you can now wear these cable-down (as long as you have a good seal to keep the earphones in place). In the box, you get an iOS cable and another cable for devices without integrated functions. Cable build quality is good, but I miss the cable clip thing above the splitter that lets me tighten the cables.

Accessories
1 set each of S/M/L Shure foam eartips. They must be using a different kind of foam, because I've found them softer, more durable, and more comfortable than Comply's. Comparing them to the perfect seal I get even with the silicone tips, they provide a hefty boost to the bass range while sacrificing a bit of the highest treble frequencies (EQ-fixable).
1 set each of S/M/L Shure silicone tips
1 set of yellow foam tips
1 set of triple-flange tips
1/4 to 1/8 adapter
Airline adapter
Volume control dongle (very cheap-feeling)

Final scores:
Sound 4.5/5 due to treble roll-off
Comfort 5/5
Build quality 4.5/5 for the earphones themselves + cables.
Value 4/5. Shure products are never a good value, but they're worth exactly what you pay (does that make any sense?)

I would recommend these but only if you can try them out first, especially if you've never owned a pair of Shure earphones before. They either fit or they don't, and there isn't much middle ground. $549 (from authorized sellers) is too much to spend on earphones without trying them first."
334,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic little earbuds. This review will not really focus on sound quality since I am no audio expert. Their sound reproduction is quite nice all around (mostly rock and hip-hop), though they are lacking in bass. Not complaining given their size though. I've used these while running and have had no problem with sweat. They are comfortable even after wearing for a long time and the build quality is solid. Only thing I didn't like is that the part that wraps around your ear doesn't really hold is shape between uses, however it does hold its shape once you wear it. The case gets the job done, nothing too fancy. The cable is long, in my opinion a bit too long, but not a deal breaker. The cord doesn't really tangle. I'm not worried about the cord breaking where it contacts the buds (some reviews on other sites listed this as a potential problem area). Overall I really like these and would recommend them if you have the money!"
335,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent quality earphones. These are the best sounding earphones I have ever experienced. I don't have golden ears, but I have had different sets of earphones over the years and they do not come up to the quality and sound of these."
336,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are truly a work of art. The detail throughout the entire audible spectrum is impeccable. Crystal clear treble, warm mids, and deep natural bass. The bass was a little strange at first; I am used to only hearing top of the line subwoofers reach these notes, and hearing them without feeling the rumble was alien. Also the sound isolating is very impressive. I haven't taken them on a plane yet, but have had a few fly over my head while wearing the earphones. When the planes were overhead, I could barely detect engine roar with the volume turned down. When the volume was raised to a moderate listening level, the jets were not at all audible. If you have the budget for these, you will not be disappointed.

One important note for professionals: If you are looking at these to edit videos/songs you may want to consider the SE425 instead. The 535s are incredible earphones; but due to their extra miniwoofer, the sound is a little warm colored. for critical listening, I've heard the 425s are extremely accurate. The 535s are simply modified 425s to produce a more enjoyable listening experience.

Pros: Comfortable, great sound quality and range, styling, sound isolating

Cons: Case doesn't have a cord manager, naturally price, not the most accurate sound, earphone body may be too large for people with small ear antitragus"
337,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I previously had the ultimate ears 10 and enjoyed those earphones until they recently broke and were out of warranty. I decided to spend a fair amount of money on these SE 535 and have not regretted the purchase since. The sound is incredible even compared to my UE's. The bass is there without being overwhelming. The Mids and highs are clear and crisp. The only drawback to these headphones is that they are extremely efficient and loud( it is very easy to turn the volume up without realizing the level because the headphones are low in distortion). You should not regret spending the money on these headphones if you enjoy listening to your music the way it was meant to be heard. I liken it to spending the money on a decent set of speakers; if you get a nice stereo and a lousy set of speaker, the sound will still be poor. Go ahead and get a decent set of speakers (headphones I mean)."
338,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Years ago, I owned a set of Shure e4c earphones that were absolutely fantastic. They eventually had cable breakdown and just got old (they lasted about 7 years). I have missed them ever since. These headphones are at least as good as the e4c's were, and they have replaceable cables! Yes, the cables are proprietary and cost $25+ to replace, but compared to multiple hundreds of dollars for new earphones, it's an absolute steal. The cable quality is also vastly better than my previous Shures, making me think I won't have to replace the cables in the foreseeable future.

So far so good!"
339,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're a musician, you must have!"
340,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i consider myself an audiophile, but also a pragmatic one. like with everything in life, i love a good bargain, but i also have great appreciation for all out quality.

as far as headphones go, for many years, at home i have been listening through trusty Grado RS-1 connected -as of last year- to Benchmark DAC2-HGC. for music i care about, i feed the Benchmark lossless FLAC files (jazz and classical). The Grado's have a great organic, warm quality to them, while providing all the clarity and stage i need.

for many years, i have used Shure's with foam sleeves as travel/gym/mobile earbuds. i like their linear, honest, revealing nature. i have owned quite a few, and currently own the 200/315 on top of the recently acquired SE535 we shall review here.

in a nutshell: i *love* the SE535. they are a phenomenal: the crystal clear balance and accuracy of the signature Shure sound, but it now extends lower without becoming ""fat"" and lazy in the bass. it does represent perfection. but i will point out that my requirements may not mirror others', because...

1. i make sure i get optimal positioning and seal. some people don't find tight earbuds comfortable, and rather sacrifice sound quality, which with the SE535 would be a waste.

2. i never plug the SE535 into a regular earphone port in my computer. you will always see a DAC-earphone USB device like the Dragonfly there. if you plug your earphones directly into the audio port of your computer or phone -or if your entire music library consists of 192kbps MP3s-, they are overkill. they need a clean source and well recorded music to show what they're made of. i think if you just want to plug these into your phone they represent a waste of money, a $200 pair will serve perfectly well for that (that's why i keep my Shure 200/300 series). just my opinion.

3. even though they do now have an extension in bass, Shure doesn't make earphones for bassheads. these are balanced and crystal clear, and honest. some might miss drama. i rejoice in their exact music reproduction.

4. maybe i have to get used and find optimal positioning for the cables, but they seem a tad stiff and heavy and uncomfortable when i have to move. i think they are designed for static use. they are simply wonderful to immerse yourself in music while you travel, and the isolation is the best i have experienced (with the entire SE line and the foam sleeves). i wouldn't use these in the gym, so not a problem for me. UPDATE: i ordered cables that don't have the bendable hooks at the end. i find those utterly uncomfortable, and have decided to stop fiddling with it. Shure - you ought to ship a more comfortable cable with a $400+ in ear monitor... that is my only dislike of the SE535, and it is easy to fix with another $30.

to sum it up: i think the SE535 are a fantastic investment if the rest of your chain is up to their standard. i think a good external DAC is mandatory, as is well-recorded and preferably >320k music. if not, there are probably more comfy earphones out there that aren't over $400..."
341,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent earphone monitors. A little pricey and not for most, but if you can appreciate the audio difference, it is well worth it."
342,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best ear buds I have ever owned. Sound reproduction is outstanding. Passive noise elimination works well. Base is awesome with midrange and upper registers crystal clear.

343,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Superb build quality, amazing sound that is rich and full of detail, neat features such as the remote, mic and replaceable cables. From the high quality packaging, sturdy carry case and range of earplugs, these IEMs have it all really well defined. I've tried the Shure 425 (amazing mids but lack of depth in bass), Monster Turbines (well rounded but lack crispness), X11s (great sound but very flimsy) and a range of Beats (overpowering bass, but good overall), and found that the Shure 535s are the best I've ever owned by a long way. Well worth the extra money, but still too pricey for a 5 star rating."
344,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these used from an Amazon member. So far I must say these have been very nice. They are comfortable in my ears for long periods of time and have very good noise isolation. When listening, the highs and the mids are outstanding. Acoustic guitars and vocals come though very warm sounding with loads of detail. I've listened to plenty of tracks I thought I was very familiar with only to find myself picking up on details and subtleties I've never heard before. Bass response is lacking in comparison to the mids and highs, even after ensuring they are getting a proper seal, however it is accurate and doesn't ruin the listening experience. It just may leave some wanting for more power in the lower frequencies. I would like to try the Westone 3s, but I wouldn't want to have to give these up just to have the opportunity to audition them."
345,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm more into vocals, classic, R&B and pop.

I was using the Bose Triport earphones for quite some time before deciding to get a new pair of IEMs, tried out the Westone 4 which was too sharp for me, Logitech's triple-fi which was too bassy and uncomfortable to wear. A few other less known brand which I didnt take note of, didnt quite cut it for me either.

Shure's 535 may not be the most comfortable, but they are the most natural sounding. Wearing them took abit getting use to and finding the right size on the foams. but once you got it right, it sounds very natural, smooth. I finally get to enjoy vocals of Adele, Katherine Jenkins & Il Divo. The music from queen and lady antebellum."
346,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is absolutely amazing! Very precise, spacious sound lets you hear every detail of the music. The bass is not overpowering, but is still very present and full, and the built in crossover does wonders for proper dispersant between the drivers and maintaining perfect clarity at high volumes.

Overall, they are the best headphones I've ever heard and I'd recommend them to anyone looking for the perfect listening experience."

I purchased these LTD 535s back in the fall of 2014 (1 year ago from today) and despite two major design flaws I believe the sound was amazing. I owned the older model 420s where the cord came directly out from each ear piece, was permanently attached, and hung directly down. You can view them by searching Amazon or wherever for Shure SE420. Those lasted me for a very long time, so when I purchased a new pair I figured I would step up to the 535s.

I had read about the swiveling cord design and watched a couple of Youtube videos on how they worked, but when I began to use them I noticed that I could not use that swiveling action due to the fact that I wear glasses sometimes and anyone who wears glasses knows it can be an issue. Also because of the angle of the ear-piece, when they are worn in that behind the ear method the cord comes out and has to do a turn so it becomes unnecessary (in my opinion). It seems that Shure tried to do something that they saw a need for, but for me it ended up serving no purpose and is why the left piece no longer works. When they began not working I noticed that it was not straight away. That cord swiveling thing they designed makes it so it will only pick up sound when the cord it turned and sitting in a certain angle/direction. Even when they were brand new I noticed this.

The other issue I now have to deal with is the lack of a shorter version of audio cord. For some reason these headphones only come with long cords. So if you used to put the headphones in your front pocket, or clip it to your shirt/arm, you now have only the option of using a very long cord. Good luck exercising with that... Shure does not even offer a short cord to buy for these. *face palm*

So I have recently used the 2 year warranty to send the ear piece and the cord in that no longer work. We will see, and I will update this review to reflect what occurs since I take great care of my electronics and see what type of coverage Shure comes through with. I sent in the cord as well. It may be that the cord is fine and the ear-piece is just somehow broken, but I have no idea and for the money I paid I do expect satisfaction.

So until I receive my 535s fixed I will state the pros and cons below:

Pros:
Sound
Light weight
Numerous types of ear piece fittings, I use a specific one and have never had fatigue with that specific ear piece, with the exception of the cord pulling them out of my ear and having to re-insert them. :(
The sound is truly isolated. I can take a train and not hear a thing but my music (you must try each ear piece and figure out what is the best for you!)

Cons:
Swivel-design
Lack of a short cord
Sound only coming out when that swivel is sitting just right, and when walking at work I would have to readjust it repeatedly.

*Update*
I sent in my L ear piece and a cord that I believed to be broken. The cord had a movable round part from the first time using it, possibly caused by plugging it into my already broken ear piece, but I am unsure of this being the cause. After approx. 1 week I received by L ear piece back (I cannot tell if it is a new one, my original ear piece, or refurbished), and along with it came what appears to be a brand new cord.

The shipping back to me was in a small, tightly wrapped soft packaging that could have been ""smooshed"" by a larger package in transit. All that protected the ear piece was bubble wrap. For this I give Shure a thumbs down, a 1/5 stars, a wag of the finger... I sent it to them in a box with bubble wrap, but a box that would withstand weight and pressure much easier that simple bubble wrap alone. Perhaps they will consider a small hard/rigid case to send the ear pieces back in so even if the package has a larger one on top, the plastic ear piece will not become warped or broken. This may be why some people are having to return them more than once to Shure! *cough cough*

When I took the ear piece out and plugged it into the new cord I immediately noticed a snug fit, compared to the loose fit when I bought them new. It is as if the cord and ear piece actually fit correctly now, but this MIGHT be a bad thing. It will take use to figure out, not WHY, but if this helps in any way. It is nice to not have that swiveling ear-piece issue anymore. When I place them inside my left ear, they STAY where I put them! :) If this was intentional then I give Shure a tip of the hat, if not then perhaps it is still something to consider. Over time it will loosen, but the current fit on the returned L ear-piece is far better then the loosey-goosey fit from when they were new.

I just received them back so I believe that only time will help divulge or assist with making noticeable any issues, but so far they seem to work and the ""better"" fit of the cord has me happy. The only issue now is that the R ear piece is as loose as it always was, so I believe the cord is the same and perhaps the ear piece has somehow changed (model change, or during repair). Again I am unsure of this being bad or good from a standpoint of being ""properly repaired,"" but the fit seems much better for use.

I will still keep the rating for these at a 4/5 because of the swiveling flaw and the lack of a short cord (including no after-market option even!), but my initial impression was an quick, honored repair from Shure!

**Final update. It has been a while since I received my headphone back and I have had no problems. The sound is fine and the swiveling design sucks, but I have no loss of sound when it occurs. I assume then, that my first bud was bad or something occured that I was no aware of such as someone dropping something on them when my back was turned. I care for my electronics like noone else I know... Anyways, Sure backed up the warrantly promise they make, they were replaced, and I have had no problems since. I only hope they do not include the swiveling ear design in the future. :)"
350,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product delivered as promised when promised A +++
351,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded from some SE215's that done me well for 3-4 years. From reading reviews i was worried the base might be lacking. Not the case for me at all, lows still kick, and rumble like they did with my se215's. Now with the added benefit of greatly improved clarity and overall volume boost. I listen to mostly classical(opera,orchestral,choir,etc), rock(metal,classic,folk) and occasionally electronic"
352,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 535 to replace my old SCL5 which had its cables damaged.
I decided to buy a superior one, since I was already satisfied with my old ones and my job as a drummer is getting way more serious.
For the higher price, compared to the 425 (replacer for SCL5 which I also have tested), I expected more sound definition with the triple drive feature, and a more robust frame and wires.
This doesn't mean the phones are bad. At all! They are awesome, just like my old SCL5. I've been using the 535 on concerts and they fulfill my needs. And maybe my ears aren't so well trained to hear the difference between them.
But, for my purposes, maybe I could have bought the 425 and saved some cash."
353,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are comfortable and sound great! I use them with my cell phone and the sound cancelling makes everything else go away.
354,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Shure SE535 to replace an old pair of UE Super.fi 5 pros. The SE535 have outstanding balance and bass that does not cover up the more subtle parts of the music. I especially like listening to electronic and live music on them. FLAC quality live music really shines.

The cable is well constructed and the proprietary connector between the earbuds and the cable seems nice and secure. The cable is rather long, but that isn't anything that can't be fixed by looping it around my back or iPhone and because the cable is detachable I am not as concerned about the cable breaking due to being wrapped up all the time."
355,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been known to spend some money on audio equipment in the past. These were recommended from a musician/engineering friend in NY, and he warned me that they were not cheap. So what. The sound is better out of these buds than my way-more-expensive speaker set-up in my home, and they go with me everywhere. The best speakers you will ever buy."
356,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are absolutley amazing. They provide you with so many different ear piece fittings that I'm sure they will fit just as amazingly for you as they do for me. The clarity depth of the audio in these is incredibly hard to believe that its coming out of these little guys!
357,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In order to get the full potential these ear phones provide, you must ensure you get a good fit. Had to go through the supplied sleeves to obtain the ones that provided a good fit. Once you get the perfect fit you will be awed by the detail and clarity with full tonal range. I am enjoying music all over again hearing the instruments that were muddled in the back ground.
I had to convince myself to order these as replacement for my old E455s that were begining to fall apart because of the cost. It is true they are worth the cost. You must ensure you get the correct fit to get the full benefit and your music will sound new all over again."
358,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Long story short - Years ago, I took some of CD's into Audio Perfection here in the Twin Cities. As I listened, I remember the feeling of being able to spatially locate each instrument in the room - eyes closed, just using my ears and the perfect sound being emiited from the quarter of a million dollar sound system in front of me.

Well, 15 years later, with an $800 Ipad, those same CD's now converted to lossless music files and my new pair of Bronze Shure 535's in my ears, I got to relive the experience.

I had some serious buyers regret when I finally hit enter and saw the 'Thank-you your order has been placed!' and thinking to myself.. wtf did I just spend $450 on?

Well 2 weeks in and I can't relate how much I regret NOT buying these years ago.

PROS: see above

CONS: OK.. not really a con here.. but The music is so spatially accurate, I feel a bit unnerved at times. Similar to the Uncanny Valley robotic principle - When robots look so much like humans that it makes one uncomfortable to be near them. The music doesn't feel as though is coming in from the phones, but rather from where the instruments would be if the musicians were in the room with me. Additionally, The isolation of the black foam tips is near perfect thus blocking out all external environmental sound - lucky I guess as I've read reviews where that isn't always the case.

If you were like me an waffling on the price - think of it this way - A decent entry level pair of speakers from a high end manufacturer will run you at least $1000/pair and you can't bring those floor-standing boxes with you on a plane - nuff said."
359,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had these same earphones twice. They are rock solid amazing. The sound is incredible and the quality is superb. They have taken a lot of use and wear but they still work great.
360,5.0 out of 5 stars,great headphones
361,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great set of earphones-The best I have tried so far compared to W40,W50 and the horrible Etymotic ER4.
The sound quality and noise isolation is excellent and I had a chance to try this on a commercial flight.
I have decided to return it not based on sound quality but based on discomfort and ease of use. First of all, its a big and heavy earphone. I feel its very bulky. Second, The loop around the ear has different cable which is very thick . It is made so as it fit it around the ear contours very tight. It was hard for me to adjust without using two hands.Every time I remove the earphones, putting it back so as to adjust it around the ear was a cumbersome task.
Third, I went for a run and I feel this was heavy, even if you don't take the included volume adjuster. Fourth, for the 500$ price range I expect a mic and a remote to use with IPhone. It comes with an airline adapter, carrying pouch and different ear tips. I have decided to return Shure 535V and try the Westone W30 which I got for 330$."
362,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never experienced better music quality without the need of batteries to shut out external noise. The only Thing I have noted after long use is that the cable gets green due to moisture conditions, the sound becomes then unclear when the cable has achieved this condition when the cable is in movement, but replacement cables can be bought which is very nice, some of the replacement cables give even better sound quality."
363,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best investment I ever made. These are amazing.. clear, loud with plenty of bass presences. Perfect for drummers playing to click tracks."
364,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simply outstanding
365,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the very first review I've written, for any product....and I'm going to keep it pretty simple. These headphones are wildly expensive; but if you're interested in hearing and appreciating every single thing about the music you love, then these are the last set of headphones you'll ever purchase. I found them to be far more comfortable than they look and the sound is simply spectacular! It is the next best thing to actually being there. It's easy to get a bit of buyers remorse about spending $500 on headphones but after the first ten seconds of the first song I heard using them, I knew that it is one of the best (technology) investments I've made."
366,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I was fortune enough to be able to buy both the se425 and se535 to compare. The se425's are outstanding reference in ear monitors. You will get decent bass in pop songs and overall will be happy. The se535's are better with bass and sound stage. Ironically the 535's are actually louder the the se425s so don't worry about an amp. You definitely don't need it. The sound stage is the major difference. The 535's just envelope you and you can hear everything. The 425's are good but just not there compared to the 535 from a soundstage. Remember the recording is everything. You will not get bass from the Beatles but if you put any modern pop song the 425 will sound great. All in all if you can afford the 535 just get them. I bought them used for 389 on Amazon. Thought that was a good deal to get the better pair.

And yes I tried putting one of ear ear buds in my ear to tell the difference. It's dumb. You can't so tell so don't bother trying. All I can say is that with the 425 I played with the EQ. The 535 I didn't. Buy them."
367,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is wonderful. The clarity - superb! Great condition for used in-ears; however, it was shipped with used covers still attached. Ewe. (Minus one star)"
368,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best earphones, period.
I used to have the Bose earphones and thought that they were good, and thought that they were just a bit better than the Apple earphones, then I was looking for an earphone that I could use comfortably on plane rides as the main usage and needed something with noise cancellation or isolation.

Once I tried the SE535, with the correct foam plug for good fit, I was hooked and realized how much better the music listening experience on the go can be when you make the investment.

The downside....now, I can't use any other headset anymore..."
369,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these new earphones. I bought them to replace a pair of older Shure's that had developed cracks and frays in the wiring. Very pleased overall.
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wouldn't consider myself an ""audiophile"" in the strictest sense of the word. I do, however, like to enjoy my music the way I believe it was meant to be heard. In my experience, Shure earphones provide some of the best sound quality for the price. While they are not in any way cheap, there are certainly far more expensive options out there.

I have used a pair of Shure E4c's for the past three years on an almost daily basis. I absolutely loved them. Unfortunately with that much use the cords began to get brittle and started to fray until a few weeks ago, one of the wires finally completely cut out. This is a common occurrence for all earphones which are used extensively. I contacted Shure customer service to inquire about repairs, replacement, and their advice on a comparable product now available. Shure's customer service delivered a highly detailed and cordial response within 24 hours. I learned that I could repair my E4c's for around $110. Alternatively, I was told that the Shure SE315's were being released in September and they were in the price range I originally paid for my E4c's. So, I decided to go on Amazon and pre-order the SE315's.

Today I received them in the mail. They are somewhat larger than my old E4c's, however I think they are more ergonomically in line with my ears, thus they are more comfortable. There are a number of improvements that Shure has made over the E4c's. First, the cords are now detachable. This is an enormous evolution and easily the best feature of these earphones. If the cord does go bad some years down the road, I can order a replacement for a fraction of the cost of full repair. Second, the top of the cord, near the earphone, is now moldable. Thus you can mold the cord easily over your ear and it stays put. It is also made with kevlar, making it more durable and hopefully, less prone to the problems of past cords.

Finally, the sound quality itself is much, much improved. The bass is full and rich with absolutely no distortion. The highs are also incredible and you can hear even the slightest nuances in music, even at low levels. Truth be told, I have been listening to songs just to see how they now sound with these new earphones. They sound that good. In fact, in some songs I have heard entire new sounds and noises that I'd never heard before.

I use high quality digital files and a Zune HD to listen to my music. I don't use an amp. Like I said, I'm not an ""audiophile"" but I can appreciate a good set of earphones and realize that to enjoy your music to its fullest you need to invest in a good pair. If you are happy with the stock earbuds that come with an iPod Touch or the equivalent, something like the Shure SE315's is certainly not for you. That said, once you experience the truly unbelievable sound quality these deliver, I believe no one can go back.

The best sound from new earbuds comes after 400-500 hours of playback after the driver has had a chance to get worked in. However, the SE315's already sound a magnitude better than the E3c's. I am ecstatic with my purchase. If you have the money to spend, you can't go wrong with these earphones. Having listened to the Shure SE425's I honestly can't recommend them over the SE315's given the $100 premium. The SE315's sound absolutely amazing and in my opinion, are worth more than $200.

With Shure's two year warranty and excellent customer service, the SE315's are a downright awesome purchase, not to mention they sound spectacular. Trust me, with the SE315's, you will be rediscovering your music all over again.

****October 26, 2010 Update****

After using these everyday for the past month, I feel even better about my purchase, if that is possible. The clarity of these earphones is nothing short of amazing, which has made my listening of radio on my Zune HD a hit or miss affair. Regular FM radio sounds compressed, garbled, and full of audio artifacts, not to mention static. Luckily, HD radio sounds a lot better. I primarily use my Zune to listen to my own library of music, but it's nice to hear the radio sometimes. These earphones will provide you with both the good and the bad in that regard. Still, listening to my personal library has never been more enjoyable.

Also, the new design of these earphones is fantastic when it comes to listening to them in bed. I will listen to music or watch movies on Netflix on my iPad at night, and I can now do so on my side. The design of these earphones is such that when they are in your ear, they are flush with the side of your ear. Therefore, you can lay on your side without them jutting into your ear and causing pain and discomfort. These are the only earphones I've ever had where this was possible. It makes for a huge difference in using them when I lay down or go to sleep, as I now can lay on either side or my back.

Overall, I still have no complaints. These earphones were a great purchase.

****December 2, 2010 Update****

I guess I am a little surprised by the 3 star reviews some others have been giving these earphones. However when I look at the complaints, they are all valid for the most part. If you aren't used to earphones like these there is definitely an introduction/break-in period that you go through. I do, however, disagree with people complaining about the sound quality. But that is an opinion.

As for my continued use, not much has changed. I still use them almost daily and they have been holding up fantastically. No signs of sound or cord degradation at all. I still maintain that they are very comfortable, but it always depends more on what you were coming from I guess. If you absolutely loved how your old earphones fit then any change will be jarring. However I am completely used to these now and love them. Was still a great purchase and I still whole heartedly recommend these.

****July 20, 2011 Update****

My earphones have been through quite a lot since I purchased them in September 2010. I've used them on an almost daily basis, and for very long periods of time in some cases. Since I've purchased them, I listen to them almost nightly, while I go running, and around the house on the weekends. They have also accompanied me on a flight to Las Vegas and back, (from Florida) as well as on international flights from Philadelphia to Barcelona and back. Needless to say, I still loved them and they have been performing great.

So, you can imagine my shock and horror when my left bud suddenly stopped working last week. I quickly went on Shure's website and printed out the requisite forms to send my earphones in for repair and mailed them out on Monday, July 11th. I figured I would not wait to put Shure's 2 year all inclusive warranty to the test. On Wednesday, July 13th I received an email notification that they had received my earphones and that I would be contacted if there were any issues. And then today, July 20th, I received my earphones back from Shure, the malfunctioning earbud replaced with a new one. And all is good and great in the world! But seriously, I received my earphones back from repair in 9 days, at least 4 of which were shipping, and 2 were over the weekend. So Shure's team turned around my warranty claim, replaced my earphone, and shipped it back to me in about three days.

When mailing my earphones to Shure I was resigned to having to wait weeks, maybe even over a month to receive them back. This had nothing to do with Shure, just expectations from previous warranty repairs in the past I've had to deal with from other companies. I am ecstatic about the service and ease of which it took place. Shure clearly stands by their products and obviously honors their warranty. Again, I love these earphones and this experience has made me even more confident in choosing Shure.

****January 08, 2013 Update****

It has been another year and a half since my last update and I am happy to report that these earphones are still going strong and still sound great. I have had no problems and I still use them on almost a daily basis. I am not sure what the newest models are like at this point, but I am still very confident in recommending these after several years and thousands of hours logged listening to music, playing games, and watching movies. Still highly recommended!"
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, I'm really not understanding a lot of the negative reviews. These headphones are easily the BEST set of headphones I have ever purchased. I am not an ""audiophile"" - I'm a DJ and I love music and appreciate clear, balanced sound with little coloration (especially for when I'm mixing). I want to preface this by saying that yes, I listen to house music (deep house, tech house, techno) 90% of the time, but I have had experience with these headphones playing all types of music.

I have owned many pairs of headphones. In order: Reloop RHP-10's (sub par but for a decent price I guess), Klipsch S4i's, Sennheiser HD-25 ii's, and Klipsch x7i's. To go through these in order: 1) Broke in under a year, 2) lost a pair, second pair broke in under a year. 3) Lost a pair, still have the second pair, still going strong, they are now my backup pair and I still love them, 4) Bought a pair, they crapped out, got another pair, crapped out, both well under a year. Yes, I'm hard on my headphones! I use them to listen to music 10 hours a day, and I walk around, use them at the gym, have a commute on the subway every morning, and back every night, I DJ, etc... the list goes on and on. None of the headphones I have ever purchased, with the exception of the HD-25's, felt like they could take the abuse I put them through, and they didn't!

I look for a few things when buying in-ears;
1) Durability - this is the #1 factor on my list, and it's why I LOVE my HD25's - they feel indestructible.
2) Comfort - As I said, I wear these for 10 hours a day, so comfort is key.
3) Sound Quality - Obviously, sound quality is important. What is most important to me is a balanced, crisp, sound that isn't overly colored.
4) Sound Isolation - I like to shut out the world and do work, or work out, so I basically want to hear no outside sound. Active sound-canceling is bulky, overly expensive, and needs a battery (lord knows I don't need another battery to worry about).

Alright so now on the the meat;
1) Durability - 5
With the SE315's...I finally feel like I've found a pair of headphones that are going to last me forever. Why? Because it was never the drivers that crapped out on my old headphones, it was always the cable! The SE315s solve this problem in such a simple manner; Detachable cables! Not only that but the cable feels like it could take a beating as it is, but even if it doesn't, I'll just throw them out and replace them for around $20-$30 bucks. That's a much better deal that $200-300 for a new pair of headphones. I have only had these for a month now, but so far, so good. I will continue to update if anything comes up.

2) Comfort - 3.5 to 4 with a caveat
Ok, so out of the box, figuring out how to actually put the headphones on was a bit different since the design is so radically different from any other in-ear I have ever used. Once you get used to it, the cable can still be a bit of an annoyance but overall the ""wrap around"" design is awesome. It prevents these earbuds from ever falling out, especially at the gym, or when I'm bouncing around during a DJ set. The way they designed these to fit in your ear is awesome, it just may take a while to get used to for some.

Now, the stock tips weren't very comfortable for me, which is normal for almost all earbuds I have purchased. Luckily the Comply T-100 aftermarket foam tips I used on my x7i's were a perfect fit. Now the comfort level of these is a 5. I guess after spending $200 I'd hope to not have to spend more money on aftermarket tips but I think it's the fact that I became so used to the Comply's after using them with my x7i's that I'll chalk it up to that.

In terms of sleeping with these - I can't fall asleep with headphones in period, but I can say that laying on my side with these in, listening to music in bed or laying on the couch, they were decently comfortable. Certainly more comfortable than anything else I've used. Still, I'd hate to give a full opinion because I simply will not sleep with headphones in or lay down for extended periods of time (Max 1 Hour, but typically much less).

3) Sound Quality - 4
Alright, I see a lot of people here hating on the sound quality. I will compare these to my HD-25's which I believe are one of the best headphones for the money out there, and the Klipsch x7i's. They are all around the same price so I believe it's a fair comparison. Again, I AM NOT AN AUDIOPHILE. For my purposes (DJing, Producing, daily listening) these headphones blow my x7i's out of the water. Kick for Kick, High Hat for High Hat, every sound is so much more crisp and detailed than the x7i's that I can't believe I spent $180 on them and that people compare them favorable to the Shures. The Shures have better dynamic range and separation between different instruments. Against the HD25's, I'd say they are on par or better, with the 25's having better bass response (that's just natural given the fact that they are over-ear drivers) and slightly better sound-staging. Then again, I can't wear my HD25's for more than an hour or so at a time before the head-clamping becomes bothersome and I start to sweat. The reason I give sound quality a 4 is because I'm sure the SE535's and 425's have better quality and better dynamics given the fact that they are multi-driver ear-buds, but they are also more expensive!!

4) Sound Isolation - 10/5 (yep, that's right, 10 out of 5)
I'm typing this from a plane right now listening to some soft deep-house, and I can't hear anything except my music, which is at normal listening volume...Not much more to say than that.

Conclusion:
These are amazing headphones. You certainly won't regret your purchase! If you want the best value, I would say you may like the 215's more. I would certainly say try both. I don't know if the 315's are worth $100 more, but they were worth $200 to me and are truly great headphones! I would certainly buy these again (but I don't think I'll ever have to! Unless I lose them, knock on wood!)"
2,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I own some more costly, ""higher end"" IEMs than this one, like the Sennheiser IE80 and the Westone W4r, both of which I purchased after buying the 315's. But I still like to listen to the Shure SE315's sometimes. The midrange is phenomenal... You can really hear all the nuances of a singer's voice. I love the fit and sound isolation these give... I think it's much better than either the IE80s or the Westones. Sometimes after not using the Shures for a while I put them on a get a huge smile. They still sound great, even though they were inexpensive. They have their own unique sound. Maybe it's just the Shure house sound, supposedly mid-centric and highly resolving. Because they fit so snugly and surely, I mainly use these for excercise and activity now, like while washing the car. Is the bass lacking, as others have said? Well, the bass is there, and it's tight and honest, but it won't floor you. All in all, I'm glad I have these."
3,2.0 out of 5 stars,"TL;DR - Sounds soft. High end is extremely lacking.

These have great, smooth bass and mids and both are fairly clean. They are missing the high end though. The full presentation is extremely laid back. Details are present to some degree, but the overall sound is just soft. I had hoped that switching to the silicone tips would help improve that, but it didn't. There is little or no bass bloat at least. They are well refined as well. Since my main criteria for review here is sound quality and cost, I give these a firm 2 star based on the overall refinement and lacking treble being the only major draw back in the sound. I must emphasize the ""major"" part of that because it is terribly lacking. I have several sets of IEMs ranging from $30 to $100 that sound better.

Build quality is great. Third star for that. They seem sturdy and removable cables are always beneficial. The problem is that the SE215 that costs much less has the same build quality and sound quality that is on par or better by all reports (I haven't actually heard them). Third star gone. You're getting the same build quality and arguably better sound quality for ~2x the money. It's not worth it. Save up for the 535s instead or look at something other than Shure."
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure sounds great. Been rockin' the the discontinued 310's for like 7 years or something. Had to send em in once and pay to get the cable repaired and it began to fray again recently

so I checked out the new models and they made some great improvements: the cables disconnect, so i don't have to send in the new unit, would gladly purchase a new cable as needed.

They are also lower profile than my previous buds, it's spring so I haven't tested, but I have no doubt they will be much comfier with a beanie or hat on the bike or on the slopes.

I wear these headphones quite a bit, up to two hours a day most days out of the week. These 315s are pretty comfy for the most part, takes a lil tweaking to find the sweet spot and proper fit. They block a lot of noise, even more so with a portable amp. But you can still pick up deeper sounds so I still feel pretty safe cruising through traffic on the bike in em.

I don't know all the nuances of audiophyllic analysis, but FLACs and 320s sound beautiful and you are guaranteed to discover so many more dimensions to your favorite tunes if you have never invested this much money in your mobile music experience before. Great highs when your getting all sophisticated with it, awesome deep bass when you wanna go all gangsta wid it."
5,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My first pair of top tier in earphone and all I can tell you is I'm so pleased with my purchase. Just be very careful when changing the ear insert, by mistake I broke my right piece but was able to get it back without any music lost. Still one of the best sounding in earphones. The four stars is for the build quality, again I broke the tip trying to change the ear insert but was able to get it back with a little ""JB WELD"".."
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these over a year ago (Sept 2012). They are still working great! I've had absolutely no problems with them. I've gone through at least 5 different high-end headphones over the past two years and they are my favorite thus far.

I primarily use them for two things:

1) I work on my computer. Because I spend so much time on it I need good headphones to jam out to music for a good portion of my day. These headphones have a fantastic range and I have no complaints when listening to classical music with beautiful highs or heavy dub-step with crazy lows. Whether in an office or at a coffee shop, they work perfectly

2) Whether doing INSANITY at my house or going and lifting they stay in my ear and work perfectly for my exercise habits. They're not technically ""noise canceling"", but good luck hearing anything with them in.

Pros:
Very comfortable.
GREAT range and depth
Cord is replaceable(detachable) and is ridiculously strong/thick.
'Musicians grade' earphones.
great durability - Going a year strong
Love the case they come in, I put the headphones in them when I'm done to keep them safe.
Again, they are not technically ""noise canceling"". But I 'shure' can't hear anything with them in.
!! Little to no bleed through. People CANNOT hear what I'm listening to!!

Cons:
Expensive
No microphone.

Overall: highly recommend them over the competition. The bottom line on the price? You get what you pay for..."
7,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from a pair of 215s. Not worth the money. I'm a bit of an audiophile who needs noise isolation and enjoys high quality. There is MAYBE a negligible improvement. Maybe. But not worth the sacrifice in noise isolation due to the open porting. If I could do it all over again, I'd buy the 215s again, save $100, have the same audio quality (maybe even better bass response), and better noise isolation."
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're looking for a good pair of in-ears for live stage performance at an affordable cost then these are the ones for you.

I've been using these for a little over a month now and I am very happy with their performance. I play drums in a band and the bass port makes them very good for drummers in my opinion.

There is a lot of noise playing in a drum booth, but these in-ears do a great job isolating everything but what they're putting out AS LONG AS you find the right pair of gels that fit your ear. It took me a few tries before finding the ones that fit my ears perfectly so be patient.

I especially like the fact that they come in clear, as I like them to be practically invisible to the audience."
9,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is a solid 4.5
The base it’s not the greatest.
However there is NO mic.
The cable it’s horrible to put on.
And there is the price at $200
For me these are 4 star headphones."
10,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to experiment with different ""non-Shure"" tips. I find the Comply TX-100 and the Etymotic ER38-14F (both available at amazon) help make a good seal in my ear that isolates the sound. I still find it a little tricky to put in, ie take my glasses off, figure out which side/direction in each ear, get the stiff part of the cable around the top of my ears etc. There's not much ""margin of error"" allowed from a good sounding fit, to sounding really awful. If the seal is the tiniest bit off, your $200 headphones will sound like a transistor radio with a weak battery.

But once they're in properly they sound great, but I prefer my Etymotic HF5 for sound isolation if I'm somewhere I want to get them in and out fast. So I use the Ety's for more ""active"" use (walking, hiking, gym) and the Shure SE315's for home use when I'm going to be relaxing & listening to music for awhile (plus the Shure's are more prone to pop-out/unseal with active use). I also have Bose SIE2's which are nice, but not as sound isolating. As far as audio quality I'd say these Shure's win out of all, then the Ety HF5's, then the Bose. I should also mention these Shure's are very efficient with power - ie the volume setting required (for the same loudness in my ears) is much lower, maybe 3/10 versus 7/10 for the Ety's/Bose's. So watch your volume settings on your computer/receiver/MP3 player!"
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have gone through at least 20 pair of headphone looking for a quality set the I could use for workouts and on frequent plane rides. For a few years I was happy with the Sony MDR-EX71. The spilt line and offset wire design was great! But the build quality and sound quality just didn't cut it. After replacing them 3 times for the same connection failure I bit the bullet and spend some extra money on the Shure headphones. I was not disappointed.

These are incredibly comfortable. I use the medium foam tips. The block out most other sound and hold in place very well. For workouts I have never had a problem with them tugging off like most headphones. I would still prefer an offset cord. The double cord under the chin is not very comfortable.

Sound quality is balanced. If you are used to lower end headphones that are biased for more bass, these will take some time to get used to. But you will recognize the clarity improvements immediately.

The most striking feature on these headphones is their build quality. The cords are thick but flexible. They have very well designed strain reliefs the input jack and Y-connection, which many other manufacturers neglect. The rod to headphone connection is strong. I love that the design allows for you to replace a worn set of cords without having to throw out the expensive drivers. Why are all headphone not made this way? Oh, right....these cost 6 times the amount my last set did. Worth it."
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these after several good years with the Etymotic Research ER-4PT. Both are great buds, but I like these slightly better.

Pros:
-Unbelievably good sound, even at low volume
-GREAT sound isolation with foam tips
-Flexible over-the-ear cable takes the weight and pull of cables off the ear canal (especially good for when cable gets caught on something)
-Replaceable cable is easy to switch, means you don't have to send your phones back for repairs
-Offers custom fit tips available from Sensaphonics (I haven't tried these, they're like an additional $150)

Cons:
-The bendable over-the-ear part of the cable looses it's stiffness after 6-9 months (causing the cables to be loose over the ears, which can be uncomfortable)
-Variety of ear tips is good, but they're not as comfortable for sensitive ears as the Etymotic yellow foam tips. (I find the Shure M foam tip too small, L too large)
-Tips get uncomfortable after about 3-4 hours

I use these for studying and for subway commuting, and sometimes just for noise isolation. They really cut down on ambient noise, and allow for relatively quiet listening even in loud environments, which I love. A few cons, but they're just nitpicks. These are so good that I don't see any reason to ever look for anything better. Bought my wife a pair, and while she's not an audiophile, she loves them nearly as much as I do! VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
13,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been playing around with buying cheap earphones for awhile and the last run of purchases I got tired of having to repeatedly put them in my ears. So when I got my iTouch 4G I decided to upgrade my earphones as well. The Diddy Beats/Dr. Dre beats I didn't like the look of them and from what I heard, they also had a lot of bass in them. Which lead me to believe that they weren't balanced.

Shure SE315 got my attention because they were between the high end SE535 and SE110. $500 is a lot more than what I want to spend on a pair of earphones. So I went with the newer model.

Fit is most unusual but it works. I use earplugs a lot and is accustom to the feel. It took several tries to figure out how the SE315 works around my ear and how I like to carry my iPod. But after wearing them for a few hours I forgot they were in.

Sound. I wasn't sure if I would like the sound or if there would be any difference between the Shure SE315 vs my $5 Sony earphones. I like that the SE315 feel balanced in sound and there is some thickness in the bass especially when listening to Hip Hop music. I'm a music lover so this was important for me to find a pair of headphones that enhances the sound of my music collection

Isolating. These things ROCK!!! Cleaning the house, using the vacuum, or anything that's noisy these definitely block the sound out. But it gets better. I can actually hear the music loud and clear. The volume does not have to be turned all the way up.

Only problem I see is that I have to keep them clean. Even when I don't have them in my ear. Dust collects on them pretty fast. Also the cord gets twisted some times around and the connector comes out of my iPod due to the case that I have around it.

Price is not too bad considering that you have a thick Kevlar cord. The ear piece fits inside your ear not sticking out like most earbuds.

Overall I am happy with my purchase. I will never go back to buying cheap earbuds. I give them 4 stars only because of price."
14,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones needs a bit getting used to. I finally used the triple flange ear plugs and now the sound is spectacular. I realized that one needs to create a closed volume of air by using whatever adapter works best for you. As you position the earphones you will notice the sound quality change. You will have to find the right position for your ear. The molded wires can be made into a loop to go over the ear. I have the 5 feet wire one and the sound is fantastic
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are superb!! I was really hesitant about buying $200 in-ear phones over an over-the-ear model like Bose. But this model is definitely worth the price. I can barely hear any outside noise with these bad boys in and the expandable earbuds really lock in for a good fit. One thing I do notice is that I have to compress the expandable earbuds really thoroughly to get a good fit so that I can hear more bass from songs. But that isn't a problem, just an observation/tip."
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using a friend's pair for a week and was even more impressed with the new pair I rec'd. Its clear why these are selling so well after so many years. The comfort and sound are top notch and will serve me for years. I bought them to wear on stage but I think they will get even more use than that. The sound is balanced and the bass is there but not overwhelming and I like that. There are other companies making great in ears, but these don't take a backseat to any."
17,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been on something of a quest to find decent earphones, since foolishly parting with my Shure e2c's. The rundown so far: Sennheiser CX200,Klipsch IMAGE S4,Bose IE2,Etymotic HF5,Monster Turbine,Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10, and Shure SE425 have all been run through my Zune, iPod Classic, and Yamaha receiver. So, a wide range of models, on a reasonable range of devices.

Right off the bat, I have to say that I have some bias toward having the speaker wires over my ears. My old e2c's were reinforced to bend around my ear, and I totally loved that. And to date, Shure seems to be the only company around who acknowledges that as a legitimate way to wear earphones. The SE315's are no exception, molding very well around my ears, reducing the rustling sound from a moving wire.

The overall fit of the 315's is excellent. The engineering on this is worthy of a premium price in itself. The speakers themselves don't protrude from my ears, and the above-mentioned wiring is rather discrete. The tubes are a perfect depth, and the foam tips are comfortable enough to wear all day while blocking out the rest of the world. I really don't think I could ask for more on the fit, and the 315's blow away every model I've tried.

And sound quality? It's great. Highs and mids are bright and clear enough that you can pick up loads of detail, but without sounding shrill or succumbing to clipping. I'm hesitant to say they sound ""natural"", so much as ""tuned for recorded music"". (For truly ""natural"" sound, consider the SE425's) On the low end, the SE315's are a huge mixed bag. If you're expecting to listen to Jay-Z and make your head vibrate with bass, these aren't for you (check out the Monster Turbines for that). That's not to say that bass is entirely absent. It's there, and it's actually quite accurate. Listening to songs from Detroit Grand Pubahs and Shiny Toy Guns, there's a lot of detail on the low side that I just didn't notice before. Similarly, the SE315's bring just the right amount of warmth and depth if you're listening to Dave Brubeck or Scala, but on a track like Tom's Diner by Suzanne Vega, you hear the bass line -- but you don't ""feel"" it at all. It's a strange sensation.

If you're looking for something particular from your earphones (e.g. lots of bass, absolutely crystal-clear reproduction, overly-pronounced mids, etc.) the SE315's are going to be a compromise in one area or another, or just flat-out wrong for you. But overall, I'd have to say that the SE315's are the best earphones I've used in this price range. Without spending literally twice as much money, you'd be hard pressed to find earphones that are this good all-around."
18,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're looking to venture into the world of IEMs, these are a great pair to start with. Though the drivers aren't nearly as good as those in higher end monitors, they're a nice place to start. My only real complaint with these is that after about a year, of weekly use (2-3 times a week in a live band setting), one of the ears would short out and because of that I've gone through at least 5 pairs of these. I would buy them through Guitar Center with a replacement plan so instead of paying full price, I was only paying about $30 for a new pair. I've since moved on to custom molded IEMs, but I still have these as a back up pair."
19,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
1) Isolation you could potentially use to sleep through noisy environments
I travel long distances quite often and these headsets provide great noise isolation. If you're on a noisy bus or train and wear these, you can block out around 80% of the sound. Put on music at 20% volume (I use a Google Nexus 4) and you can be oblivious to your environment. Sure, that can be a bad thing (for those who are driving or running but noise isolation isn't meant for those people anyway)
Often, I don't want to listen to music but sleep in peace while travelling. I put these in and sleep without even connecting them to another device

2) Comfort
IEMs aren't perfect but these are the most comfortable I've ever worn. Long hours without a problem with the right sized bud. The shape is weird to put in the first 2-3 times but there are plenty of tutorials to see learn. Check YouTube. Once in, they are super comfortable and the earbuds are flat on the outside helping you sleep or lie down while travelling.

Cons:
1) Bass (or lack there of)
If you're a bass head, DON'T GET THIS. You like listening to vocals or pure precursion instruments, get these. With a bit of EQ, you wouldn't mind.
I think I have a good ear but I never had a problem with the eq push for bass though one of my friends did say he didn't like the eq push (not sure if it was psychological).

2) Memory wire is a bit weird at times
Not a major issue but it's kinda weird the way the memory wire around the headset behaves. You get used to it though over time

Who would you recommend this product to?
If you like listening to classical, good vocals or you don't mind the slight EQ push and want something for traveling, this could be the one you're looking for!

After using these for over 2 years, I highly recommend it :)"

28,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Before buying know this, you will likely be replacing the connector cable on an annual basis. At $30, you're paying 15% per year to own these. Shure makes these readily available, which tells me that it's a know issue, but a revenue stream for the planned obsolescence of a poor quality cables.

The earbuds are good enough, very comfortable, and I find that the noise isolation is very good when using the correct earpiece. Based on the cost of ownership, however, I would never have bought these though. There are other, high quality options available for the price."
29,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been looking for a pair of buds that I could wear while running heavy equiptment and these definately fit the bill. The bass is a little weak on low volume but the clarity and range of the drivers is amazing for how small they are. I was also very happy with the build quality.
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm no musician or anything of the sort, but I am definitely into the best sound quality, even if its a bit pricey sometimes. These were a great decision.

35,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these because I play drums (death metal) and I trigger my kick drum. In terms of isolation and feedback they are great. Their bass is noticeably lacking but for me that's not an issue because I play fast enough that too much bass would be impossible to discern. A great feature is their ""moldable"" wires for over the ear. Another is that they come with several different sets of earbuds so you'll definitely find one you like.

However, after roughly a year and a half of regular use with great care I experienced cable rot as other users have mentioned. As this was within the limited two year warranty I had no problem getting them fixed and they extended the warranty by a month which would be Nov 2016. Now halfway through December, the ear assembly no longer makes proper connection with the cable most likely due to their decision to incorporate a 360 degree swivel.

I cannot knowingly recommend these headphones to someone knowing that they will break within two years at this pricepoint even though they've come down 20% since I bought them.

I would probably have given them 4 to 4.5 stars had the cable never broken as poor sound was more of an inconvenience in my use case.

46,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Shure buyer for about 5 years not and in terms of sound quality and isolation I have yet to find better. Its mostly the sound isolation that these headphones excel at. I use them on planes and for jogging. The sound quality is excellent, although I am not sure the difference from the SE210 is really worth $50. There is a bit more clarity, but not a lot. For ipod usage, stick with the 210's.

Biggest complaint? Only one... build quality. It appears Shure have sorted the mechanicals to last a little longer than 1 year, but the cable rot issue is quite frankly awful. The 3 year warranty is great & helps, and Shure are very quick to respond and fix any issues. But for such a simple issue you have to ask why can't they fix it?? Especially for a $150 headphones and the fact other manufactures don't have this problem."

if you don't mind earplugs, then you will like these headphones. If you hate earplugs, you will hate these headphones. That said, these are the best Shure headphones I've owned yet. I'm hearing parts of my music that I've *never* heard before. and I listen to my music a *lot.* highly recommended."

60,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Initially, I was very disappointed when I bought these SE315-K's - for the sole factor that they, literally, didn't sound like they were worth my hard earned $200. I have had them for two months now, and gosh was I wrong about these Shure headphones. Once you figure out the right sleeve that works best for you, and to put the SE's on correctly- so they can fit comfortably for hours, you will be entirely content, presumably. I've been listening to music (metal, progressive metal) not-stop with these headphones and with great joy and enthusiasms, you'll inevitably hear a distinction in the great audio quality.

Now for the drummers whom are looking for a good, decent pair of isolation headphones: these headphones will definitely assist you with jamming along songs, comfortably. No need to turn-up the volume to whatever you're going to plug these into. Most importantly, these headphones will protect your hearing. Also, something I've picked up along the way is that, when I don't tune my drums, in other words, I'm too lazy to, by wearing these headphones, your drums automatically sound tuned. Great sorcery, I tell ya'.

Update: November 23rd 2016 (Three years later)

Well, I am not happy at all. I was stoked when I first initially purchased these headphones back in late 2013. Then, that $200 hefty price tag was a lot for me, but I overlooked the price tag due to my initial positive impressions on the product. Boy was I wrong. A few months after I purchased the headphones, one of the drivers began creating background static. Luckily, the headphones were still warranted; so I sent them in for repair. Now, it's 2016 and earlier this year, the headphones began anew issue. I have to constantly move and wiggle around the headphones to avoid any static/crackling being produced. Sure, I can send them to SHURE for repair, but paying extra cash for repairs for an already expensive piece of tech- that prematurely is causing problems- shouldn't be even be the case to begin with. Now, I don't even use these anymore. They're just hung-up with my other unused headphones collecting dust.

If a SHURE Representative comes across this review and would like to lend me a hand, I would greatly appreciated. Until then, I will sadly be an unsatisfied SHURE customer with crushed hopes."
61,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Simply put these headphones are excellent, seriously robust, great design and awesome manufacturing quality.
The SE315 pump out great sound for small headphones, more like stage monitors than your average in-ear type,
the many sound isolating ear adaptions give plenty of fitting options. However, I personally, am not yet as comfortable with
the fitting system as I thought I would be, it takes time to get used to them.

Overall I will not need to buy another set of headphones for a long time, SHURE has replacement parts if I manage to wear them out, and these SE315's as mentioned above are built super robust - for those who travel, work and play hard!!"
62,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good I have a professional in ear plus a very expensive headset for the iPhone. I recommend it! using it with the Shure CBL-M-K cable is great!
63,5.0 out of 5 stars,They fit nicely and sound great for such small speakers. They nicely isolate the outside noises. Bass is noticeable but not powerful unless you use a equalizer.
64,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned the e2c's and se210's and have made use of the 2yr warranty at least 3 times for each pair. These new se315's are very uncomfortable when I first got them, it took a while to get used to the fit and it still isn't that great. I'm forced to use the grey rubber attachments instead of the black foam ones that I'd prefer. These earbuds are really bulky. The positives are the sound quality and the cable construction seems like it'll last(fixed the wire cracking around the ear with a stronger flexible wire)."
65,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The SE315-K ear buds produce fantastic sound. However, the wires are very stiff and difficult to get positioned correctly to fit in my ears."
66,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work out of the box and returned.
67,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds great but I recommend you guys go for SE-425.
68,4.0 out of 5 stars,good sound quality and noise cancelling. great for the gym and air travel. as good if not better than the more expensive model.
69,5.0 out of 5 stars,i thought the price is a liitle too high in the beginning . However'i realize they absolutly worth the cost. Wonderful sound and noise isolatuon. i use them every day now.
70,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sounding and fitting Sound Isolating Earbuds! This is my third pair since 2007. I like the quality of the phones and the length. They are perfect for my workouts and long enough to put into my pocket and still reach my ears. Plus, I am 6'5"" so I need the longer wire."
71,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very unusual. But interesting.
You need to spend some time to find perfect Sleeves.

Sound: good. Very good. Almost perfect."
72,3.0 out of 5 stars,"But not even a year since I bought them, the right earpiece keeps flaking out. I'm guessing there's bad wiring somewhere"
73,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I rarely take the time to stop and review anything but after reading some of the reviews on here and listening to these headphones I felt the need to be heard. I am admittedly an audio snob and might skimp on a lot of things, but my sound quality is not one of them. Since I was young I have always used the best headphones I could afford. Before the days of earbuds this was a top notch pair of studio headphones but for every day life, large cumbersome speakers on your head are not practical. This always spoiled me to today's sacrifice of quality for convenience music.

I have never been able to listen to less than 256kbps MP3s, the loss of quality irks me. In the days before MP3s I splurged on Ultra disks when they were released and today I prefer lossless conversions to convenience. I can't even use my iPhone for my MP3 player because the sound quality difference between the iPhone and iPod is too much for me. Enough about my snotty... I mean snobbiness.

I have had and adored my Shure E2s for many, many years until the cord rot finally got the best of them. The sound quality was amazing and the fit was the best I had ever had for my ear. Normal earbuds never fit my small ears, not that I ever gave them much of a chance because the sound quality was so bad. I have three small mouths to feed and forking over $200 for a set of earphones was a big deal to me even with my discerning tastes. I have to say that I have no buyer's remorse whatsoever.

Fit and Comfort

The fit of these is very awkward at first, though I found the same pretty true for my E2s. While the E2s took less time to initially get situated the reinforced cord does make these a bit more awkward. Once I was able to get them just right and molded over my ear it was easier to put them back in. I still have somewhat of a ""seal"" issue with my left ear but I have yet to try all the many, many available different earpieces. My ears are a little small for the large shape of the earbud itself. I have some very slight discomfort where the back touches the rim of my ear. I found some slight discomfort initially with my E2s as well but that after some time my ears get used to them being there and this would go away. I have not owned these long enough to develop ""ear calouses"". This also impedes my ability to enjoy the ""pillow comfort"" many of the other reviewers experience. None of this is enough to make me take them down a star.

Build Quality

By far the best feature of these headphones is the replaceable cord, and it is much of what you are paying for. As every Shure lover has undoubtably found the cord rot is just heartbreaking. Since my last set of Shures freyed over my ears, I am happy to see this area have the reinforced and stiffer cable. The earbud itself is very well built and I experienced none of the previous reported issues with the connection from the cable to the earbud itself. I had no twisting or any problems at all.
The cord is long enough to allow you ample ability to carry your music player in your pocket and not have to worry about any tugging. The jack also has a better build. I had problems with my previous Shure's jack, I am less concerned about that occuring with this set. I did test out the previous poster's complaint about the iPhone and the case and they were spot on. If you have a hard case on your iPhone you can forget about these headphones staying put. I had no issue with connectivity or sound but the jack would fall right out if I moved at all. This was not a problem on my iPod with a silicone case. It seemed that it was the thick hard case that caused me issue and I was unwilling to drill it out to fit as I am not a fan of music on my iPhone anyway.

Sound Quality

I am not sure what others are complaining about with the sound quality. The bass on these headphones is much improved and does not overpower the music. They are well balanced for anyone looking to listen to music and not bass. I agree with previous posters about these headphones being mid-heavy but I hear so much more of the rest of the music that I had never heard before I might almost be distracted from the lyrics if this were not the case. I really haven't listened to music like this (outside of my car or home stereo) since I started using an MP3 player. I also found that adjusting my EQ helped with some of the balance issues. I tested boosting the bass on my iPod and the music was muddied, so just as everyone else stated if you want to blow your eardrums with bass these are not the headphones for you. Other than that the quality of these is stellar, I don't want to watch TV anymore or ever stop listening to music. It is like hearing it all again for the first time. That being said these are pretty close in sound quality to a solid $100-$150 pair of headphones, you are paying the extra money for the extra features provided in the build quality and the replacable parts. If you are like me and will use a product until every last part replacement fails then you will make a good investment in these earbuds.

Finally, the price on these from Amazon was a full $50 better than anywhere else and with Prime they arived super fast. I can't complain at all about my purchase... ok maybe I could but then I would really just be whining to hear myself whine."
74,5.0 out of 5 stars,The earphone captures the music and the lyrics very clear. It does not let any other sound or noise interfere.
75,3.0 out of 5 stars,Clear sound but not really good bass performance
76,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I have to say I am pretty impressed. I sent these earbuds back to the SHURE company and I had a brand new set back in less than a week. The service & repair department was very courteous and kept me informed all along the way. It's very rare these days to get service like this. I've tried the earbuds and they work perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase and due to the service & the two year warranty on these, I would recommend these earbuds.

I would love to find out how these sound but right from the package no sound came from the right earbud! You would expect you could use them at least once before having to return them"
77,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 215's a while ago, lost them, and then bought these. The sound is very crisp and clear, and the bass is great without being artificially enhanced. I can hear parts of the song that i didn't know was there.

If you are a big music fan, these headphones are wonderful. I highly recommend listening to high bitrate songs to take full advantage of these. Anything less than 256kbps won't do these justice!"
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best!
79,5.0 out of 5 stars,Have used Shures for years. Have yet to be disappointed! Only wish is that I didn't have to drop so many bones to acquire them!
80,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first set of expensive earphones I decided to go with after literally hours of researching. These earphones were superb when they worked and are really comfortable. After 3 weeks the right earbud started coming loose and from time to time would pop off when snagged on my shirt or coiled up in my shorts. A week or so later here I am with a useless product, the sound on the right ear dies off when any movement is done. I only used them at work and ocassionally while running.

Really frustrating paying a lot of money for a broken item I can't replace anymore."
81,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The good thing about these headphones are the foam tips and the cable that can be changed (it will cost you the price of a good pair of headphones though)
The sound quality is really not that great. For this price better look at other makers as Shure makes great headphones but at a much higher price (check the multi drive ones)"
82,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had these a few hours and noticed that the left earbud was crackling and popping and so I processed for a replacement. I really LOVED the sound of these along with the noise isolation feature. The music sounds like you're there at the recording, notwithstanding the crackling. Fingers crossed for the replacement!"
83,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Of course Shure earphones are good
But why the lower version is high on Bass and this one is not?
And of course this ear fitting should be improved."
84,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for the sole purpose of using while I run. Long story short generic in earphones do not stay and need constant adjustment while running. These sit comfortably and the sound quality is, well, quality. I enjoy them but I don't have much to compare them too. As of meow I would buy them again"
85,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sure that they're are better earphones out there. Unfortunately, i am also sure they are over my budget. These are the most comfortable clearest sounding earphones I have ever used. Mind you, I've been through about 20 different ones. I had my first set for a little over 2 years until my dog decided that they were her chew toy. I immediately purchased another set of the exact same ones. The SE315! Thank you SHURE for putting out a fantastic product."
86,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have only had these for a little while and the left ear bud is already blown and distorted upset cause i paid 200.00 dollars for them and now i'm having to buy another pair but not the same model.
87,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the past year, I had been using a pair of Monster Turbine In-Ear Speakers (one of the very few Monster products that isn't actually over-priced). However, towards the end of its life, I started noticing some sound interruption in the right channel. Considering the Turbines had extremely thin and delicate looking cables, I'm surprised they lasted as long as they did. Anyways, it was time for me to hit the earphone market again.

Ever since I graduated beyond the generic buds bundled with MP3 players, I have had to cry myself to sleep way too often when a brilliant pair of earphones is rendered useless by a ruined cable. I decided I'd had enough of that and was determined to get one with replaceable cables this time around. Having also used the Shure SCL2 in the past, I was well-aware of the sound signature of Shures and decided that the new member to my family would be a Shure. From there on, the decision was easy and made mostly by my wallet. The Shure SE535s (triple-driver), and Shure SE 425s (dual driver) weren't too friendly with my I-spent-way-too-much-money-on-booze-last-weekend-so-now-I'm-a-broke-college-student wallet, so the Shure SE 315s were the logical choice for me.

Before I get down to reviewing the product, you should know this review is based off of about 3-5 hours of listening. I haven't had the chance to burn them in yet, and once I have logged about 200 or so hours of usage, I will come back to update my review. These are some of the songs I sampled immediately after receiving my earphones. In my opinion, these songs together brilliantly cover all ranges from the lows to the highs - Staralfur (Sigur Ros), Archaic Patterns (Eno), Let the Drummer Kick (Citizen Cope), 21 Guns (Green Day) and Intensity in Ten Cities (Chiodos).

Mids and Highs:

Reproduction of mid and high frequencies on the SE 315s are pristine, impeccable and flawless (at least to my ear. I have a discerning ear, but cannot claim to be an audiophile). You know how people always claim to have `heard things in a song they had never heard before' ? I now know what they've been talking about. In songs like Staralfur (Sigur Ros), Intensity in Ten Cities and Archaic Patterns it was beautiful. Also for the first time, I am seriously considering completely making the switch to lossless formats. I generally hover around 192 kbps to 224 kbps when ripping my discs, but once again, for the first time it seems I can hear the flaws. I'm definitely going to rip some of my CDs in FLAC and sample them with these earphones.

Bass:

Undoubtedly, bass reproduction in these instruments is on the lower side. I do realize to expect improvements once they are past the burning in phase, but even then, I expect them to be a little conservative when it comes to bass. Now, for me this wasn't a problem. After spending an year with the Monster Turbines, I got my fix of bass. Initially, it felt really good - the strong, thumping bass. After a while, it started getting on my nerves a little bit because the bass on them used to overpower delicate mids and highs. Thus, I was looking for earphones that took it easy on the bass and thus the SE 315s suit me perfectly. However, realize that if you are a bass junkie, and need to feel the thump in your ears, these probably aren't meant for you. The bass reproduction on these is light. The thump and the kick of the bass exist, but is never overpowering. The quality of reproduction of bass on the SE 315s fall somewhere in between my previous earphones, the Monster Turbines, and my current headphones, the Grado SR 60i. The 215s don't have overpowering, shallow bass, yet the bass is nowhere as roomy, deep and true as my Grado's. Not a fair comparison though as the Grados, by merit of being open-air, are bound to have a much wider soundstage.
Be well aware of this before making the purchase. For many, music is no fun without strong bass, and for those people I would strongly recommend Monster's line of earphones.

Cables and Fit:

One of the greatest pros for these earphones is the user-replaceable cables. Thus I feel they deserve a section of their own.
The cable length is generous, extending to about 6 feet. Ample length to reach to the player in your pocket and have some room so as not to tug on it.
The earphones are meant to be worn over the ear so that the cord loops around your ear and suspends the earphones into your ear. It is comfortable to wear them that way so much so that when I made the shift from my Shure SCL 2 to the Monsters, I continued wearing them over the ear. It gives a certain measure of protection to the cable so that if you accidentally tug on the cable, the part where it attaches to the earphones does not get strained.
The part of the cable that goes around your ear has a coating of a certain material that makes them very stiff and moldable. The point of that is so you shape them to your ear and they remain that way. However, the initial fit can be quite frustrating and time consuming. When I put them on for the first time, it took me a good 20min to get it into my ear and get a good seal. Subsequently, it won't take you more than about 15-20sec, which is still more than usual earphones. However, the excellent sound quality your ear receives afterwards makes it worth the trouble.

Packaging:
Finally, I conclude with packaging. Nothing much to write here except that the box the earphones is sold in surprisingly needs to be torn to open them. The box is sealed with a rather strong adhesive and in the process of opening it, even though I tried to be gentle in case I felt the need to return them, I ended up tearing the box. I wonder if that would be a problem with Amazon should you feel the need to return. Be patient and gentle while opening the box.
The earphones come with a huge collection of ear buds, earwax cleaner and a very nice earphone carry case. Use it, it's good for the earphones.

Conclusion:
These are great earphones. They definitely don't come cheap, and I wouldn't say there aren't better alternatives in the market at the same price point, however the replaceable cables actually makes them a much better long term investment. You would not want to purchase expensive earphones only to have to discard them an year later due to a faulty wire.
Fitting and wearing these will take a lot of getting used to, however, the seal is excellent and sound isolation is amazing too. Once again, mids and highs are stellar, bass is definitely underpowered so keep that in mind too.

Update:
About 3-4 days into using these earphones I started noticing some stuttering / cutting of audio in the right channel. Seems like the cable or the connection at the earphone was loose. Anyways, I've requested a replacement from Amazon, and its on its way. Mistakes happen, defects slip through even the strictest QA and Amazon's speedy response more than makes up for it. Won't be deducting a star for this."
88,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm no audiophile by any means however they really lack bass, I was hoping they would be an improvement over the SE215s. They were replacing a pair of Beats Tours as I was looking to upgrade to a pair of high quality pairs of IEMs. I ending up the a pair of Sennheiser IE80s which are spectacular and highly recommend."
89,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had these headphones for 5 and a half years now and I can say they are still in almost perfect condition and work perfectly. I've replaced the cord once but other than that these are some of the most durable electronics I've ever owned. On top of that the sound quality is top notch and the noise isolation is epic for flights and public areas.
90,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure has a vast experience developing micro electronics, I think it could be improved the dynamic range in low frequencies,"
91,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use them while riding. They are fantastic at blocking out road noise but still able to hear the necessary. Very clear and crisp sound. Will buy again!
92,3.0 out of 5 stars,"very bass light and tinny unless youve a serious set of equalizers on the platform(not an ipod). i was looking for a replacement for the ie8 set i had from sennHeiser. they were terrific and didnt require an enormous amount of treatment to reach a point of toleration. i am no real audiophile, i dont pretend to be, but i do understand when there is no depth to music when the bass is not there. when they are on the right platform, they produce very beautiful noise. not worth what i paid, i am not sure i'd ever buy a pair of shure ever again."
93,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second shure ear bud, and it's the second time the right ear bud stopped working basically as soon as the warranty period was over. I did like the sonic characteristics but beware of longevity."
94,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought that these in ear monitors were going to blow the competition out of the water but even after giving it a week for them to ""break in"" they sounded almost exactly like the apple ear pods from the iPhone 6 and i compared them extensively. Yes, the shure earphones do perform better in the lows and hear the audio more clearly without it being mudded together but for the price you pay for them i do not feel that the slight audio improvement is worth 200 dollars which is why i have sent them back for a refund and ordered the shure se535 which will hopefully be a better audio experience that is well worth the asking price."
95,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Had high expectation from the reviews, but in the end find it a bit lacking:

1) Sound quality: mid and highs are indeed very good, sound stage is broad and clear. But base is weak, simply lack the punch and resonance compare to many other earphones.

2) Build quality: not as good as I hoped. The wires are a bit rigid, somewhere between rubber and plastic, and there is even some manufacturing artifact attaching to it. In comparison, Sony's smooth, grooved-surface wires obviously feel better.

3) Sound isolation is really good, but the factory-installed foam (mid-size) is too big, make my ear painful after hours of wearing. And it is so hard to replace the foams, nearly impossible without extra tools and extra care.

4) Convenience: those behind-ear wearing style is always awkward, especially with shure 315k, you have to pinch the earphone piece in the right angel to insert into your ears, then make the wire go behind your ears. It takes me at least 20 seconds to put it on, and that's after many practices..."
96,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to replace my 5 plus year old Shure earphones, one side went dead. Went with what I knew Shure, being an audiophile girl. These new earphone pieces is to big for my little ears, clearly made for men, bummer. Make my ear sore with little play time and heavy. Love the concept of them, hope the boys enjoy them. To late for my to return, will have to give to my main dude."
97,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Shure customer for years now. I bought a pair of E2C-N's in July of 2008. I work in a laboratory with humming machines and I travel on planes often enough that I felt it wise to invest in some sound isolating gear. I did some research online and found that in-ear phones will isolate sound much more effectively (for the price) than over the ear headphones. At the time I was purchasing, Shure only had a few models on Amazon, the E2's E3's and E4's. Because I was not sure how I would like this new technology I purchased the cheaper E2's for $68.80. I was wary about this type of device because many users felt that it hurt their ears and claimed to not be able to wear it while working out.

However, the E2's arrived quickly and I remember taking a lot of time putting it in my ear and fitting it, and because I kept trying different ear pieces it did start to hurt. When I did get them in my ear, I could not hear a thing! The hum of the machines was gone, and for the first time I sat in my laboratory in complete silence. It was very exciting! Next I turned on my Ipod. Wow! The music was so clear and loud that I first had to turn the volume way down. I felt that I was really hearing my music for the first time, clearly with no background noise. It was such an amazing experience that I got goosebumps!

The reviews for the E2's said that many people could not wear them while working out, I had no issues. Many said that the device had functioning issues, I had none. Many said that the cables broke after hard use, I had no problems. I used it for two years almost everyday, in the lab, shoved in my purse, while working out, shoved in a gym bag, stepped on, sat on, rolled over with my office chair, and worked out with. I was very lucky and had no problems whatsoever.

In July of 2010 my E2's were stolen from my hotel room while I was at a conference. Since then I again did a massive search for a replacement. The E2's have gone up in price since 2008, and I doubt they are making more of them now. I did not see the point in buying headphones for almost twice the price I paid in 2008, not when there are newer and better models out there. After researching extensively, I though the SE315's seemed to have the most positive reviews (by people who seem to be very knowledgeble about the product) for the price. I am also one of those people who really believe in getting the latest updated technology, and was very excited to be getting these headphones.

I bought them from Amazon in October 2010 for $199. The updates in these compared to the E2's:

*improved ear bud sleeves

*rotating connector to ear bud (to make replacement of defective pieces easier)

*flexible around ear piece to keep wire in place over ear

*Maybe better sound?

However I found problems with all these updates:

*Ear bud sleeves are pretty much the same and they give you less orange squishy sleeves and more of these new foamy balck ones (which absorb ear wax like a sponge EWWW)

*The rotating piece keeps rotating and rotating making the device hard to get a grip on and get it into your ear. Previoulsy I could get the E2's in my ear with one hand in no time at all, these I have to use two hands, pin back my hair, and push, and push it in, and finally when I get it in the ear, it pops out, or squirms around, or the ear bud is ok, but now the wire is contorted. Sometimes I can get it in, but my ear is sore after all the shoving, and it does not make a tight sound proof seal like the E2's did, even after I tried several sleeves. I can only assume that the defect is where the sleeve connects to the bud, letting noise come in.

*The pliable plastic sleeve around the wire near the bud has made it more difficult to put in, because if I try to first put that behind my ear and then put the bud in, it starts rotating around because of the rotating piece, and moving everywhere. Then I have this formed piece of plastic stuck in it's shape going everywhere while I am trying to put it in. Finally, I will have the device in, and then try to smooth the deformable plastic piece around my ear, and doing so loosens the earbud! The E2's had just the normal wire which was not so bendable, and was not perfect, but I do not think this plaible plastic is the solution either.

*The sound is tinny! I wish every reviewer here could directly compare the SE315's with something with bass. These are horrible! I cannot even listen to my music they have made everything sound terrible. This is a far cry from the goosebumps I got when I used my E2's to listen to music for the first time. I never understood how important bass is until it is not there anymore! I have tried to use the earphones for an extended time to get used to them (becuase I was hoping that would make me like them better) but the sound is so terrible I have to just stop. I tried adjusting the bass settings on my Ipod, and there is nothing that makes it better.

I was greatly looking forward to purchasing an updated and improved device because the E2's were not perfect. I could have gotten over the shortcoming's of the fit of the SE315's if it had good sound quality, which it does not. My regular headphones for $15 have better sound. I will sadly be returning these to Amazon and will purchase a now inflated E2 for $99. In the meantime I will use my $15 set of headphones and get much much better sound quality, if not sound isolation. If anyone has found an updated replacement for the E2's that have just as good sound, please write me a comment so I can get those."
98,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones, because of their configuration, are very difficult to fit to the ear to optimize their sound quality, depth of bass, and resonance. Consequently, I am constantly moving them around to improve their clarity, bass, and expansion of treble, mid range, and bass. I have yet to achieve this, so the resulting sound is repressed and canny. The SE 315's also distort at higher volumes and lose overall sound quality. This sucks for me as I bought them primarily to use when I practice and prepare for a gig on my drums. You also can't change out the end pieces for improved ear fit without tearing them up."
99,3.0 out of 5 stars,"the original chord that comes with these earphones do not have a built in mic despite what the specs say on the product page. That said, these are great earphones that have great sound quality and above average comfort. However, switching to the chord (ordered separately) that has the integrated mic renders these earphones basically equivalent to $20 standard iphone headphones. Any slight movements can be heard reverberating through the chord. I can actually hear the vibration of my typing as I write this review through the chord that is laying on the table on which the keyboard is also laying. Just slightly tilting my head to the side, as the chord moves along my shirt, I can hear the movement through the chord over the sound coming through the earphones. the original chord that came with the SE315 is great, but it lacks the mic. so there's no good way to listen to the SE315s with an integrated chord/mic solution."
100,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to avoid getting ear molds, so I thought I'd go with a trusted name. These would work for a while, and then one or both of the ears would cut out. I sent them back twice, but when these things gave out in the middle of a song at an important gig for the band, i ripped them out and haven't touched them since. I should have left them on the stage."
101,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, great sounds, one of the best sound isolation, but for the price point, a bit too steep and i have other options with cheaper price. Or I would pay slightly more for better one. If u want, maybe should go for the SE4"
102,5.0 out of 5 stars,...very carefully. For indoor sitting use. Let the music take you away. Better than head phones. Much too heavy to wear to the gym.
103,4.0 out of 5 stars,sound quality is only ok for this price
104,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these s few months ago. The fit is tough to secure but once you do they fit quite nicely. The sound is great and you get full bass and amazing high ends too. It gets one star because after about 2 months the right ear went out. They've been sitting in a drawer ever since. It just stopped working!
105,1.0 out of 5 stars,ear bud broke in two months use less then ten times pos biggest waste of money.
106,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have had these for 2 months and the left ear has just blown... I thought it was my actual so super relieved it's just the tech - but also bleak that I spent $200 on them! Will be trying to send them back asap as I work as a musician on Disney Cruise Line and use them daily!
107,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They never improved the cable. I just hate the cable that keeps making sound when you are walking. If only they could make the cables softer and friction free, these are good stuff. Mine came faulty with sound issue in one speaker."

110,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a gamer who plays roughly 4-5 hours a day. I've been in the market for a new set of earphones after my brother took my Ludacris Soul SL99.

The fitment was ok. The standard ear piece is like a memory foam type material which was nice. The earphones also came with a variety of ear pieces. So, fitment won't be an issue for the majority if not all of its users. The wiring right after the earbuds are bent. I don't know if it was a defect or if it's supposed to be like this. So, I had to adjust/turn them every time I had to use the earphones. Just a slight, minor inconvenience.

The sound was very crisp, but too ""treble"" for me. The bass was almost non-existant in my opinion. For those who love your bass, I would not recommend these earphones.

Overall, it was a nice set of earphones, but it did not justify the price and did not meet or exceed my previous set(Ludacris SL99).

I will be returning these tomorrow."
111,4.0 out of 5 stars,"sound is good, and the cable looks old. However, one thing is really annoying!!!! It 's almost impossible to remove the foam sleeves. I really hate it.

112,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm really happy with these headphones, they sound great and they are really good at blocking outside noise."
113,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I *really* wanted to like these earbuds, and they are a fine product with many good features, but ultimately they were not the best solution for me. As a working drummer I have been regularly gigging for the last five years, using Shure E2's exclusively. I've put up with the E2's deficient bass response and inevitable cable rot because they offer great isolation (essential for live drumming), they're affordable, and they fit me very well. The cable rot was an issue, the first time I encountered it, Shure's truly stellar customer service team replaced the entire units, even though they were about a month away from warranty expiration. I cut apart the brand-new set and immediately put heat-shrink tubing over the wires to prevent them from rotting. Why Shure can't fix such a simple problem, I don't know.

I was hoping that they had addressed the lack of bass and the cable rot with the new SE315's. It appears that their solution to the cable rot is to make a replaceable cable. I was skeptical about the quality of the connector used at that location, but it appears to be quite robust. I rotated and flexed them around while listening, and detected no sign of an intermittent connection. Shure did improve the bass response noticeably, but unfortunately they seemed to have bumped up the midrange too, and that was the deal-breaker for me. I found them uncomfortable to listen to. This has always been a bit of a problem for me with the E2's also, they always seemed a little too hot in the midrange. I just assumed that it was because they were designed as stage monitors, and so it was important to hear the vocals above all else. When I fired up the SE315's and found that the midrange was even hotter, I made the sad decision to return them.

There was also a slight fit issue for me with the SE315's. The may have been trying to make them lower-profile, so they wouldn't protrude from your ears. Unfortunately these contact my FRONT ear lobe, in a way the E2's never did. After only about 20 minutes of wearing them, I was feeling some discomfort. Maybe over time I would adjust to this, but with the midrange issue I wasn't interested in finding out.

One other thing; When I first received the SE315's, they had the new foam-style pads installed. I am not a fan of any of the foam pads, I greatly prefer the silicone pads, they are way more comfortable, and most importantly go in and out of your ears almost instantly (a must for rehearsals). When I tried to take the foam pads off, it was VERY difficult. This was compounded by the fact that the tube is smaller diameter and seems much more fragile than the E2's. I was actually afraid I was going to break my brand-new buds, that's how bad it was. Not sure why they chose to downsize it, the E2's were fine, and seem a lot more rugged.

As it turns out, you can still get E2's, in the form of SCL2's (same thing), for about $100. That was the final nail in the coffin for the SE315's. I returned them and bought TWO pairs of the SCL2's with the money.

By the way, if you just want to listen to music and don't need the super high isolation, my go-to earbuds are Sony MDL-EX71's. I have not found any earbuds that I like as much as those, the sound is fantastic, the value is incredible, and they are all-day comfortable. In my opinion they sound better than the Shures. If they offered the isolation that the Shures do, I would use them live, but I have tried it and it does not work."
114,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The High and Mid is very good but it nearly have no bass at all, I wouldn't say this is a balance earphone. This is also very uncomfortable, it put too much pressure on the top of my ear. I recommend you try it on before you buy it."
115,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've previously owned other pairs of Shure earbuds and have been loyal to the company because I've experienced the quality of their products. However, owning this pair of earbuds has made me rethink my feelings toward Shure. I've now used these earbuds for almost a year. When they work, they work amazing. The sound is superb, the isolation is ideal. However, the detachable cables have been a major source of frustration. I've had to have them replaced 3 times now. They simply short out. A $200 pair of earbuds should outlast the cables of a $20 pair of earbuds. But worse is that Shure has made me pay to ship the defective cables back over and over. This last time they sent me the replacement cables the replacements came unusable and Shure again wanted me to pay to send those back. They wouldn't pay for shipping until I asked to talk to a supervisor and argue for 20 minutes.

CONCLUSION: Great earbuds, bad cables, but some of the worst customer service I've ever seen."

117,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought it and was disappointed. Weak. HAVI got a B3 for 1/3 the price that is much higher.
I will return. The bass sound more like a wind."
118,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a dooms day backup to my 1964 quads. Mistake. I'm a pro bassist and I hate them so much. Would be okay if I were just a vocalist or something, but I regret the purchase."
119,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very disappointed in these earphones. I wish I had sent them back right away. As others have stated, the sound balance is off. The upper middle range is way too high and there is no low end at all. For a singer that may be acceptable, but as a drummer playing an electronic set it is very frustrating. All I can hear of my bass drum is a click. Compared to the earbuds that came with my iPhone, these Shure earphones sound like junk. For the price, that is just not acceptable for me."
120,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Many people rag on the sound quality of these headphones. However, I thoroughly enjoy them!! I listen to a lot of house/trance/piano and think that the base and high ends come through very well. Especially the vocals and intricate instruments in many tracks. Also, the form factor is killer."
121,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 2nd pair. Sound quality wise, these are excellent. Bass response is very good and the dynamic range excellent. So while they work - they're great. The issue is I've had to send both sets I bought back in for service because after about 6 months of use (granted at higher volume levels), the right earbud would start getting fuzzy. I cleaned it per Shure's guidance, but it was evident I blew out the speakers. 2 Pairs. Now, shure service was outstanding and fast. But two at this price range - I expected more."
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I once wore these headphones on a cross-country flight, listening to music at a reasonable volume, and when we were about to land I took them off and realized there was a child screaming behind me. They aren't noise-canceling headphones but they're good enough to drown out screaming children on flights, so they're good enough for me.

They're also very comfortable - I can wear them for a full workday and they don't bother me. And the sound quality is amazing."
123,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a set of UE Triple Fi 10's previously and while these aren't quite as bright and fluttery on the trebles they do alright up top. Maybe not for a basshead but they have enough of a low end punch for me if I click the volume up a bit. Excellent mids though. Comfort wise they're a big step up though. They fit in my ears nicely (much smaller than those honking TF10's) and the cable rests nicely over my ear and keeps them in place. I really like shure's ear-tips too. The olives are great; just as comfortable as any other foam tips I've ever used, but way way more durable (I'm looking at you comply!). Glad I chose this set!"
124,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality. Love how they wrap around the back of the ear to fit securely. A slew of different options for the ear bud, to get as close to a custom fit as you can. Only problem is that the original foam buds from the factory are next to impossible to get off. Supposed to come of by twisting and pull at the same time, but it feels like you are going to pull the entire unit apart! Still have not gotten them off. Maybe with some additional wear, they will loosen up?"
125,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful sound. Lots of different foam / rubber / silicone buds to fit different ears. I found the yellow foam ones worked best for me. Love the cable that isn't a broken connector waiting to happen! I've gone thru several sets of Bose due to broken wires. These can be replaced. Takes a bit of effort to get them on - especially for my hands that are no longer young, let's say. Removing them also is enough of a pain that I find I'm reluctant to pop them out to have a conversation. The upside, though, is that they stay in my ears when I walk or get on/off transit during commute. Expensive but a very good product."
126,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are amazing BUT the first pair I ordered broke exactly a month after ordering them, so I returned them. On the second pair I bought the right earphone stopped working intermittenly after two weeks.

127,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are few things as rewarding in life as experiencing music the way it was meant to be heard. The Shure 315's create a music envelope that can only be heard to be believed. I don't enjoy over the ear headphones, so I knew I wanted in-ear earphones. There are several high end makers, but Shure has a trusted and respected name and I started with a pair of the 215's. Great headphones! I upgraded to 315's after about 4 months and I've kept this pair and like them very much for all levels and types of music. I'll be a Shure fan for as long as they keep making this great product."
128,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, great service. I had these headphones for 18 months and one side's sound had diminished. I wear them at work and I sweat a lot.

In a week I received a new earphone and cable. No questions asked. Great Warranty, great sound."

I have the Shure SE215 earphones and thought the SE315 would be a nice upgrade but the SE215 sound so much better especially for podcast spoken word, more refined bass depth sound.

136,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first time with sound isolation earphones. I bought these headphones just to wear at the gym and wear walking around... big mistake. Maybe it's just my sensitive ears, but when I make the recommended seal with these headphones, every internal movement of my body is loudly audible. When walking, every step produces a booming pressure wave in my ears. Even sitting at my desk the sounds emanating from the muscles in my neck were distracting. I figured out that if I creep the headphones halfway out of my ear and break the seal a bit, those noises are diminished enough to be able to stand them while only reducing the sound quality by about 20%. That aside, the sound isolation is outstanding, the sound quality is definitely there, and they are very comfortable. Highly recommended for plane travel or other loud environments, but that's about it."
137,5.0 out of 5 stars,I broke mine in for over 200 hours. I just left them pulled into my amp with a random selection of music. I check every few days and they seem to need more. I finally tried them and they are the best ear buds I've had.
138,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First: I consider myself a lover of music, movies and games with an extremely well trained ear (I can hear electrical currents in power adaptors that are out of sync, etc. - I know...weird.) so I feel I have a good basis to judge audio products on. I can tell you that for the $80 I paid, these headphones are delivering at least 3x that in value of audio quality in comparison to competitive products.

Second: I was a QA (Quality) intern at Shure when the first earbuds for non-musicians (consumer) were being developed and I was able to try many out in my spare time (I even have 2 pairs still that work great, some 12 years later).

Third: I have owned in the past:
- Sony Ear Wrap headphones (gym grade - meh - never use them anymore...ever)
- Shure pre-EC Prototypes (still working great)
- Shure EC2s (still working great)
- Shure SE310s (dead of a crappy chord failure near the 3.5mm jack at just over 2 years of life)

And most recently purchased Shure SE315s (horrible product - see my other review) at the same time as these Klipsch S4's to see which I'd keep. Needless to say, I just sent back the SE315s and am currently listening to my S4s while typing.

Pros:
- Excellent sound quality, well above many others out there

Cons:
- Price is way too high for sound quality (price per quality is probably 4x higher than the Klipsch S4's I'm using and very happy with)
- Product quality was far below expectation - I almost broke the ear tips taking off the foam plugs that came attached to the buds to try Shure's alternates
- Wires tangle quite easily, despite claims that they don't
- Earbuds are huge in comparison to my SE310s and are not comfortable at all
- Earbuds require over ear wrap and barely stay in/on no matter what I did

So overall - DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!

I'm so disappointed with Shure on this one I just have no idea what else to say. I've been a huge advocate of them for 12 years now. But after what I'd call a premature (2 years) failure of the wire on my SE310s (always coddled and in a Shure hard case when not in use) that I'm going to enjoy my 3x less expensive Klipsch S4's and I suggest you do too."
139,3.0 out of 5 stars,I was recently given a new set of fake 535s only to be shocked in a back to back comparison that they sounded better then the 315s I purchased here. It makes me wonder if I got a fake set of 315s as well.

141,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried to replace the sleeves as described in the product manual and broke the earphone.
The manual describes twisting and pulling to remove the sleeve and when you do this - it breaks the headphone.

I've owned other Shure products for a while and generally love the sound. I'm disappointed that these broke so easily."
142,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I expect better quality for the money. I ordered them for travel and, due to a change of plans, they sat unused for a few months. Then, I pulled the headphones out on an overnight flight and found that they did not work from day one. I tried them on several different devices and they have all been intermittent. I was warned about Shure quality and should have listened."
143,3.0 out of 5 stars,"TL;DR Version: Decent IEM's. Great build design, very secure comfortable fit (without glasses). Sound is decent, clarity is amazing, but very mid-range/vocal forward.

Let me start off by saying that everyone has a preconceived notion of how music ""should sound"" when they buy a pair of headphones. Especially when they pay over $100, especially $200. I wanted to love these headphones, but they just didn't have the sound signature I personally was looking for. For others, it could be exactly what they want

Sound: The clarity and detail of these headphones is what you are paying for. Nothing I played on these headphones sounded artificial or ""tinny"" at any point in my listening experience, which is very hard for any pair of IEM's to achieve. That being said, I was unimpressed with the sound signature of the headphones. I felt like everything was EQ'd toward the midrange, and to me the vocals of any music genre were always front and center over instruments, which was good sometimes, but bad in most cases. The high's were very natural sounding, definitely better than most IEM's that tend to be harsh. The lows were ""accurate"" in a sense, but they were always very subtle and had no punch whatsoever. I listen to broad spectrum of music, from classic rock, acoustic, modern pop music, and every once in awhile bluegrass and classical. For any Rock music (Led Zeppelin, Tom Petty, Metallica) these headphones were very anemic. I've owned Yamaha EPH-100 (IEM's) and Audio Technica M-50's (Overear) and both of these made Rock music sparkle. The SE315's were the opposite, guitars sounded weak in the mix and bass drums had 0 thump. This was especially apparent when listening to AC/DC where the overdriven guitars should be bright and punchy in the mix. With these headphones they sat in the back and while Brian Johnson's vocals screamed in your ear. This can be fixed with scooped EQ'ing, but the headphones lose the natural quality I was looking for. The soundstage of these headphones is also just average. The SE315s don't squash any of the of the instruments, but they don't separate them either. When listening to acoustic music like James Taylor and Alison Krauss they sounded decent, but lacked that presence of ""being in the room"" feel. To summarize, if you don't like punchy bass and want very natural sounding headphones these are probably for you. If you like headphones that brighten the sound of music stay away from these, you'll feel like you're overpaying.

Fit and Design: The design of these headphones are stellar. The headphones are lightweight in your ear, but have a very sturdy build. They both look and feel like they are meant to last and can take everyday abuse. Shure offers you a wide selection of tips, so you should be able to find a tip that offers a great seal in your ear without having to make a separate purchase.Initially I couldn't find a tip for my ear's, but I eventually cut the end tip off the Triple flange earpiece and I was able to achieve a comfortable and consistent seal. The over the ear design is both comfortable and secure, however if wear glasses you may find yourself adjusting your frames ever so often."
144,1.0 out of 5 stars,This item is terrible. The right earbud didnt even work and sound quality was awful. Highly not recommended
145,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are are JOKE! Waste of money . . . DON""T be fooled by the price! These sound no better than my 10 year old Sure 210's and the fact is Shure isn't the only game in town anymore. I have several ear buds I'm trying out, Focal Sphear S are the most accurate and present a balanced sonic signature - and for $109 a bargain. For bass lovers, Klipsch R6 ll are your buds. Comfortable and a super bargain at $59.00. These are not as accurate sonically as the Focals, but these (Klipsch) are heavy on the bass and lots of folks are looking for that. They sound good, but not as good as the Focal's, IMO. I was looking for one pair of ear buds, but ebded up keeping both the Focal's for everything but motorcycling and the Klipsch for under helmet use when sonic aren't as important and the bass wash out from the wind buffeting will be compensated for with the extra bass from the Klipsch.

As for these Shure's - they are very hard to insert into your ear and the stiffing of the wire for the first 3 inches or so coming out of the buds is very awkward. The biggest atrocity is the lame sound. Very bland, terrible bass and low definition -- very disappointing! RETURNING. :("
146,5.0 out of 5 stars,👍🏻
147,2.0 out of 5 stars,It was too difficult to use especially for the price
148,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for about 2 years now. I'd like to give it a 4.5 stars. Never once had an issue. I used to work in a manufacturing plant as a tech and these have been through many different conditions. I used them nearly almost everyday and even for runs. Listening to music was still enjoyable during lunches while the plant ran, these block out a good bit of noise. Sound quality is great, more on the warm side that allows you to enjoy music for many hours. Soundstage is pretty good as well, especially for a single driver. Bass is present but not real punchy but can be deep. I paid 120 (like new) when I got mine a couple of years ago and it has been a great investment. The replaceable cable is a huge advantage sense I gone through a few pricey headphones before that went bad due to the jack or ripping the cable. These are a very good starting point for an audiophile. The only real gripe I have that has always bothers me is I wish Shure gave an option for shorter cables. They don't feel cheap but are still pretty light. For best sound use the foam tips from Shure or Westone. Oyaide makes a nice cables that brings the highs out more in the headphones but the headphones out the box are great."
149,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before you go off looking at all these reviews, you need to understand one thing:

1) IF YOU DON'T USE THEM PROPERLY:

a) the noise cancellation isn't going to work well
b) You aren't going to hear the true bass or quality if you don't know the proper way to put these in your ears, and make sure the ear buds are deep in your ear and have made a SEAL

90% of the any negative comments are usually about sound quality, bass, the headphones not staying on the ears, etc. And 90% of that is due to people not taking the time or effort to understand how to use these right. You have to put them on correctly. And yes, the added plastic that is bendable at the end of the earbuds work GREAT.....if you wrap them around your ear properly and bend it enough so that they do not come off your ear. You have to really bend that plastic around, even down to the very low end of the ear in back. When you do, these suckers will stay on if you're doing somersaults...so the claims that these earbuds don't stay on your ears is nonsense.

Ok yea the bass. It's not like it's gonna be so loud that it's going to blast your ears but the bass is very good IF again you seal the earbuds right. That means again, making sure you use the RIGHT earbuds for YOU. There are several types of sleeves. Experiment and try each of them out. Don't just try the default black spongy sleeves. And with any of the sleeves you gotta put them DEEP in your ear. I found the 3 studded white earbuds work the best at least for me. They get right in there deep in your ear, they don't bruise your ear or make you uncomfortable either, and they really seal your ear so you hear very high quality out of these earphones. You'll know when you have put it on right when you can barely hear a thing, the noise cancellation should be working well before you even turn on the music and you'll know when you've got them in right..trust me. You have to really make sure you aim the earbuds to the middle of your ear canal and then push those suckers in hard! they're not going to damage your ear, just try it for once!

As far as the wires going bad I have not experienced that yet. I know I did have a defective pair that I did have to return to Guitar Center but they replaced them in no time and the new ones are just fine. I even called Shure about it and their customer service seemed fine to me, the guy said absolutely not should they have been tripping out like that. Sure enough, the new ones Shure sent guitar center that I now have are working great. I've owned shure headphones before. So far, I don't see why people are saying the quality or quality is not there. Again there will be defective buds here and there.

And VERY IMPORTANT::: you gotta replace those ear buds. Those seals get weaker and weaker over time. I love the sport ribbed. They keep in, light, comfortable and seal great. The spongy kind suck. I have to replace these every 4-6 mo though or you'll loose the great isolation. I mean that's expected, ear buds don't last forever and it's cheap to get a new pack as well so keep this maintenance in mind.

No I do not work for Shure (I'm sure I will get some trolls here so wanted to put that out there also). I'm a Software engineer who listens to music DAILY at work while I code and so I use these suckers a lot. They've been great as long as again you use them correctly people. Read the d*** manual for once ok? Yea there's not a lot there but it does tell you how to properly wrap them around your ears and it takes a few times to get used to it and get it right. Be patient, don't give a product 1 star just because YOU haven't made an effort to do your due dilligence to check whether maybe it's YOU who aren't doing something right and to try it for a while and find out that all these issues are nonexistent in reality once you get the hang of it."
150,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this almost daily for more than 6 months now. At first, I wasn't so pleased with the subdued bass. After a few days of intensive listening, my ears finally appreciated its sound signature. The thumpy bass I originally sought for was pleasantly replaced with a more refined bass that does not drown out the other frequencies. I have to say that I find more enjoyment in this when listening to rock / alternative music more than anything else. Comparing this to my recently purchased Audio-technica Ath-m50x, I'd have to say that I quickly switched back to SE315 because there is not much advantage, at least for me, in taking with me on the road the bulkier Ath-m50x. I end up listening to music more with this gem than I do on the Ath-m50x (which is also outstanding given its price.) The fit in my ear is near perfection. I can listen to music for hours straight at a time. I handle it almost without care but there are no signs of it breaking any time soon. I highly recommend the SE315 and I am actually looking to get one of the higher end of this lineup soon."

For the kind of money the SE315's cost, you could buy about 20 sets of those. Those cheaper options work well enough if all you care about is getting sound into your ears for a few short hours each day.

What sets the SE315k apart is the construction quality, mostly. And, if you like critical listening, you will NOT be disappointed. They sound clear and quite neutral. They're also quite comfortable to wear once you get used to in-ear units (it's quite a different experience from on-, around- or over-the-ear units).

My most recent set of earphones (and favorite, until now) is the Shure E2C, which will be the point of primary comparison. Those earphones were great at the time I purchased them and would still perform great today if it weren't for the degraded insulation on the cable at the point where it loops over the ear. Currently, the E2C's still technically work, but the cracked insulation is irritating the skin behind my ears. The SE315's solve this problem with both a durable, bendable ""lead"" at the earphone end as well as making a quick-disconnect on the earphones so cable replacement is simple, inexpensive, and effective. The durable lead holds its form better than a bare insulated wire so it's less likely to degrade from flexing so the cable should last longer, as well.

The SE315's fit my ears quite a bit better than the E2C's being replaced. The E2C's driver unit stuck out quite a bit from the ear. The SE315 folds the driver unit inward a little bit and sits more flush with the ear. If you're going to rest the side of your head on a pillow (like I do on an airplane), you'll appreciate the difference. The new shape somehow also allows for greater long-term comfort.

The E2C's came with a trio of rubber tips and two sets of foam tips. The SE315, on the other hand, comes with a trio of rubber tips, four sets of foam tips (three of them are a kind of memory-foam that mirrors the shape and size of the rubber tips), and a triple-layer rubber tip (like earplugs). If you can't find a fit from those included options, or if you want a *really* custom fit, you can always have a set of custom tips made for your ears. There's a number of companies that will take a mold of your ear and make the tips that fit the earphones.

The case I got with the E2C's was a hard, circular shell covered in a durable woven nylon fabric. Inside was a hard plastic ring to loop the cable around while the earphones and connector slotted into the middle. The case that comes with the SE315's is a soft-sided oval in the same (or VERY similar) fabric. There's no rigid structure at all. I can see the argument both for and against the hard shell case and the one for the SE315's will work great, just differently.

The only complaints I have with the SE315's (besides the cost which, again, is worth it to me) relate to the ease of use. Pulling the tips for replacement requires quite a bit of effort, even with the suggested twisting action. Also, trying to get them into my ears with that more durable lead at the earphone side is a little tricky - they'll tend to fall out or away before I get them fully seated and the cable routed around the top of my ear. The E2C's don't have either problem. It's just something I'll need to get used to, I guess."
153,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, nice and simple as I have been researching earbuds for the last month. I've bought and returned a set of Beats, corded and wireless, Bose noise cancelling, Jaybirds, most had fitting issues all had serious sound issues. The reason I wanted a new pair is for the gym (weights, cardio machines and spinning, running) to have great sound with decent volume. I also use these for travel at times.

First, the fit; right out of the box they have the medium tips that are a memory foam - Perfect fit and they stay in, even without the cords over the ears, with cords over, even better. For running, many others have fallen out on me, these, with cord over the ears do not! The memory foam locks in nicely just be aware of whats going on around you as they block out most ambient noise. The cords have a bendable wire in the first 3-4 inches from the connector that bends easily to form over your ear, works great and you really don't notice it after a few minutes, no rubbing at all. There are extra tips included and you can order more from Amazon.

Sound; now here's is the hard part, I am not a teckkie or audiophile. I just like good quality sound and know it when I hear it. I want great volume, and everything else to basically even out and the ability to pick out differing instruments and vocals. These do the job wonderfully. I listen to rock, hip-hop, alternative, even some Johnny Cash and these rock them all. It's amazing what you miss in your music with certain earbuds. Also, during my evaluation, I played music ripped from CDs (best quality but barely) most of my music is simple itunes downloads and many ""mastered for itunes"" all sound great with very little noticeable differences. However, on any of the others I purchased there was a huge difference in quality. These Shures make my music sound better, simple as that.

Now, I also tried the 215's, not bad either if you want to stay in the 100.00 range, great choice, just not as much depth on the bass would be my guess, but very clean. The 535s were, well awesome on another level if you want to shell out 450-500, I'm not there yet. These are just for casual use. Had a serious question for Shure before my purchase, ""will my ipod nano drive these buds"" and they responded the next day that any ipod can drive any of their buds series...And they do very well!

Cons: If any, the cord is very long, but I run it under my shirt, and behind my back at the gym and that works. Inline controls would be cool but I understand that they can be ordered separately which is cool but may be a problem as it will probably add serious length to the cord.

Overall, very happy with this purchase!"
154,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Price: At this price for these types of headphones, you should only buy if you are an artist, or an audiophile. If you are planning to use these on your iPod as you walk or jog were ever you go, these are not really for you (will discuss below). I would definitely recommend these to any artist for its quality and price, not to my average friend.

Quality: The quality is outstanding. I am still amazed in finding background instruments on songs I listen to every day. I can hear every drum and the different snare sounds in the songs. The bass (instruments) sound amazing. The bass in electronic music is ok, since Shure headphones are known to be more about quality than bass (something that people complain, but remember, these are quality headphones, meant for artist and what not). So far, I am amazed and in love with the quality of these headphones.

Conformability: They are very comfortable, and they don’t fall off (and I mean it, since I tried running with them and they did not even move). They can some effort getting use to them, by their design and over ear placement that they have, but after the first 2-3 days of using them, they are just a habit putting them on and having them for a long time. You can have these headphones at full volume, and you won’t get a buzzing sound from the music being too loud (although I still don’t recommend using them at full volume for a long period of time, it will damage your ears).
Warning: I have to say and remind people, these are quality headphones. If you buy some nice 4x4 tried to go off round, and put them on your Prius , you wont even go over a puddle. Same goes with these headphones, when you put them on your iPod, tablet, or any device that does not have a good audio driver, you wont get the full quality of these headphones. I have used them on my iPod, iPad, and my sisters Samsung phone, and they sound much worse than being plug in to my laptop and speakers. At full volume, the bass makes them sound like they blew up, and the music sounds distorted. If you put the volume at 90% you don’t get that problem, but it is still something to keep in mind. You can literary block all outside sound at around 20% of your volume, but some people like full volume to get the max feeling, and this might be a problem if you don’t have the right player. I don’t use them to walk around and such, but if I would plan to buy these for that reason, I would say get a ponos music player (only mobile player I know with a good sound card, there might be more out there, but I don’t know any).
Also, I mention I used these for running (once) but I don’t recommend using these $200 headphones were they can be damaged by the movement (although not likely, since they were made for people in live concerts, and they move a lot). Also, you cannot hear anything from the outside, and that can be dangerous when crossing streets, etc.
Overall: I am in love with these headphones, and if it weren’t for its price and the problems with low quality audio drivers, I would tell everyone to get them. I really love these, and am happy. Hope this review helps on my experience with these headphones."
155,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the finest earphones I have owned so far, with regard to both audio quality and mechanical design. They are a significant improvement over the older SCL-2 and SCL-3 models, with considerably more bass extension and greater presence in the midrange. Their only weakness is that they do not reproduce extreme highs. They are solid at 10 KHz but do not have useful output at 15 KHz. The trebles is still quite crisp. They do not have quite the openness and detail of my Grado Labs SR-225 headphones. They have to be classified as ""near-audiophile"" but they are not that far off. The more expensive SE-425 or SE-535 may be able to cross that line but I have not had the chance to hear them.

These phones do not have the big, booming bass sound that many people like, especially for rock music. If you want that characteristic, get the Ultimate Ears ""TripleFi"" 10 which have a big peak in the 100-500 Hz range. The TF-10 rocks but the Shure is much better for classical, jazz, folk, etc. It also handles heavy metal just fine if your device has the power to drive it properly.

At this point, I have lost four pairs of earphones to wiring failure, usually about the time the warranty expired. The SE series now have user-replaceable wires which is definitely a good thing. They are attached by a clever swivel connector which further improves their ability to stay in place and probably reduces stress on the wires. It introduces the question of whether the connector will be reliable in the long term but it works fine, without introducing noise, when new. The wires go over the ears and the first couple of inches have a thick sheath which molds to the ears to some extent and should protect the wires from abrasion on metal glasses frames. I lost a pair of SCL-2 phones to this.

They fit very snugly into the ear, more like a hearing aid, which keeps them in place better than any others I have had and also gives outstanding sound isolation. They are a bit tricky to insert and you are more aware of them initially but I find them quite comfortable. You can put your head on a pillow or wear earmuffs without any problems."
156,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this not from Amazon but from duty free at airport mostly for the ""sound isolation"" feature of it. In terms of sound isolation, yea it's pretty good, great even. Your mileage may vary with fitment to the earbuds that came with this, most of which I find comfortable. The earbuds are bulky and not suitable for a long usage, but the biggest offender is the sound quality: it's an absolute mess. I understand that some headphones aspire for more neutral sound but they screw it up here. There is great clarity at the expense of bass, but it should not be a trade off. Other headphones, have achieved clarity without compromise. Bass is nearly non-existent and the effect is jarring and unpleasant. Compared this to my Sound Magic E30 sound quality on this headphones does not even come remotely close. I have bluetooth headphones that sounds better than this. Also cables are too thick heavy, I simply hate it."
157,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The SE315 are marvelous headphones. It APPEARS Shure has solved ALMOST every issue with their previous headphones.

Pros:
* They're Shure headphones, so they sound great and come with lots of different tips for nearly any preference.
* The in-ear comfort is exactly the same has previous Shure entries. If you've owned Shure before, you know what you are getting into for fit.
* The replaceable cable is something that was SORELY needed. Nothing is worse than paying $200+ on a pair of headphones and having the cord break just out of warranty and it cost nearly the purchase price to have them replaced by Shure. Now just replace a $50 cable which admittedly is expensive, but a lot less than it would have been with previous Shure headphones.
* The body of the headphone itself is angled differently, so they are more flush to your ear. They should work better with earmufs, ear on a pillow, etc.
* The ""over the ear"" part of the cable is now covered in a thin foam-like sheath, so hopefully less cord breakage which has plagued Shure headphones.
* The 1/8"" jack now seems sturdier than previous models and is angled, so it should last longer.

Cons
* Yup, they're Shure so yup, their expensive.
* I loved that on my previous two Shure headphones that the cord split in the MIDDLE, so if the part of the cord connected to the 1/8"" jack needed to be replaced, it was a cheap replacement. Also, if the cord gets jerked away (caught on something) it just disconnected in the middle. This feature is gone. The cord is one single piece like with other headphones.
* The 1/8"" jack itself, while beefy and angled (both great features) is REALLY fat - about 1 cm wide. If you don't use a case (like I do for my iPhone), you'll be fine BUT if you do use a case, I think there is an EXCELLENT chance you won't be able to plug in the headphones unless you ream the case hole wider (which is what did, using a knife), get a case with a huge headphone jack hole, or stop using a case (not an option for me).

Overall, I'd mark the SE315's as about 4.5/5. They are three steps forward (yay replaceable cable) and one step back (HUGE headphone jack and a single piece cable instead of a split cable design). I do intend to get the ""CBL-M+-K"" for the iPhone mic and music controls and maybe that will have a more svelte 1/8"" jack."
158,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always hated earbuds. When it comes to music listening, I generally don't like anything that sticks into my ear canal. Pretty much every set of earbuds I've ever tried ends up hurting my ears and sounding crappy. I prefer headphones that rest on the outer surface of my ears, or cover them completely, like the Bose QC headphones, which have been my favorites for many years.

The downside to not liking earbuds, of course, is that you can't do much physical activity wearing headphones, because they're just too hot and confining; your ears get all sweaty, and you worry about body moisture damaging the pads and/or the components inside the headset. But I've never actually spent much time with PREMIUM earbuds, so, with Father's Day approaching, and after doing a little research, I decided to drop a few hints on the 315's from Shure, and take a chance that ONE of the multiple pad options included with these would work for me.

This particular set of earbuds works with a single, ""high definition"" driver. The higher model numbers use multiple drivers to cover different frequency ranges ... basically like ""two-way"" and ""three-way"" speaker systems. I suppose they're probably impressive, but I can't offer any comparisons here, and frankly, while I was pretty sure I wanted/needed a bit more ""hoo-yah"" than the 215's, I couldn't possibly see myself spending more than $200 on a set of earbuds, so I opted for the 315's.

Plenty of reviewers have talked about all the technical plusses of these earbuds (e.g, detachable, Kevlar-reinforced cables; great frequency response, etc., etc.), so I'll just cut to the chase of how/why I concluded these earbuds are great. Let's just assume the drivers on any products you get from Shure are going to be state of the art (and these are). What's REALLY great, however, is that Shure provides a packet of EIGHT different types/sizes of earpads (S/M/L rounded foam; S/M/L rounded hollow rubber; a silicone ""tree"" type, and a foam cylinder, so your chances of finding ONE set/size that actually fits YOUR ears is excellent). Further, the fit of the earpads is not just a matter of comfort ... properly fitting earpads are CRUCIAL to getting the most out of what these things can do. If the earpads don't properly fit your ear canal, for example, the whole bottom end of your music just disappears.

All the earpads are soft material, solidly attached to a smaller/harder rubber cylindrical core. This core fits neatly over a barbed, hard-plastic tube that sticks out of the ear module itself. All the foam varieties are amazing, in that you can totally smash and moosh them, making them look absolutely awful, and within a few minutes they'll resume their original shape. I took the time (about an hour) doggedly going through pretty much every earpad option in the bag, until I figured out that the large, rounded black foam earpads were the ones that worked best for me. That is, once I put them in, they were actually comfortable; they stayed firmly in place, and I didn't have to jam on them or push them further into my ears to get the full frequency range of the music.

In terms of sound quality, these earbuds will most definitely give the listener WAY more than he/she could ever dream of getting from the ""cheapie"" earbuds that are typically thrown in with personal music devices, but Shure also understood that when it comes to earbuds, all the advanced audio technology in the world isn't worth squat if the darn things don't fit properly in your ear. For me, Shure finally solved that problem. I'll still opt for over-the-ear headphones when I can, but now, I don't ""hate earbuds"" anymore, and I've got a high-quality audio solution for when I'm walking, exercising or riding my bike. Thank you, Shure!"
159,5.0 out of 5 stars,"tl;dr: great sound clarity, reliable, great for long term wearing, lacking bass, wonderful shure warranty coverage and overall customer service.

Have had my SE 315 (Clear) for 5+ yrs now and have had 0 problems. No cord rot like I've heard of. I do keep them in their case when I don't use them but i worked in a call center for 6 months and wore these for 7 hours a day and they never got uncomfortable.

Outstanding clarity. I can hear sounds I can't with many other speakers, little details that elevate this product to a different standard. The only downside is they lack a good bass profile. That part blows but it's not a deal breaker.

Noise cancelling is quite good as well."
160,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these earphones!!!

Pros: If you know what you are doing and are patient, these will be the best earphones for the money you have ever purchased. Yes the cable where it attaches to the earbud is stiff, it has a wire in it to form to the curvature of individual ears. The bass is tuned ""Properly"", you will have to do a little eq adjusting to get it to sound how you like it. I use my pair with my S5 and with a little tweaking have hard hitting bass and super clear highs, and rich mids. Patience is key. Study the product you purchased, read the literature, and you will be super happy with these. They are designed by pros and show in the long run. The last pair I had lasted me for 7 years before the cables went out. (back when they didnt detach) Isolation is perfect. cant hear a thing except the music. If you are getting ear fatigue you should switch the size of the insert to something smaller or a different material.

All in all, they sound amazing and the over ear design is perfect. The same way any performer is able to keep a pair of these in their ear for performance after performance should be evidence enough.

AMAZING earphones!!!!"
161,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So i've had my SE315's for over 4 years now and I could say that they are still great.

You could hear things very clearly, and you can hear things that you would never had heard before.

Also, Shure's customer service is great. I actually obtained by SE315's from a warranty swap since my SE310's cord failed. And I obtained my SE310 from a warranty swap too...since my E3G's tips got stuck in my ears...lol that wasn't fun

They're not that great at bass, but you aren't buying these for bass."
162,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because I was looking for a good set of portable, high quality, reliable and well built, in ear monitors. I am an audiophile and a high-end audio electronics engineer and manufacturer. I bought these not as an audiophile but for daily use at home, the gym and when traveling.

I read with interest, the numerous reviews here, before I made the purchase. I have to say that the reviews are spot on and I am VERY pleased with them. The removable wires are great and allow for excellent fit and adjustment. They are also of very good quality and rugged. I expect them to hold up very well.

The caveats are ALSO true, especially about them fitting properly and how much this impacts their performance...especially bass. These are accurate and produce the ACTUAL musical event very well. Many cheaper headphones and especially ear buds or in ear monitors, purposely boost the bass. These do not. My first impression was that they were forward, bright and lacking bass. This changed quickly as I first determined the right fit sleeves for my ears. They also needed to break in for a day or so, upon which time they further improved. I first compared them to a $20 pair of skull Candy ear buds that my son uses and I thought WOW, there is the bass. I listened more and I realized that the cheaper ear buds just had REALLY exaggerated bass and no resolution otherwise. This is very important to keep in mind, as you may be dissatisfied with these at first listen, if you are comparing them to other inexpensive ear buds, but DON'T give up on them. Find the right fit, let them break in and then decide. They still may not be your cup of tea, but my conclusion now, after using them for less than a week, is that I am VERY satisfied and I initially considered returning them.

I looked at the 200 series as well as the 400 and 500 series products. I decided that for $200, the 300 series should give me what I am looking for without spending too much and yet not leave me dissatisfied. I am very satisfied with the performance for the investment. If anything, I am curious how much better the 500 series would be. It appears that they DO go deeper, with two additional bass drivers. I would certainly consider them in the future and possibly if I decide that I want a pair of 'monitors' for more serious listening at work, where I would be doing extremely critical listening.

I also have a pair of Grado SR325 headphones and they are great. I have also recently auditioned the Audeze LCD-X headphones. The Audeze headphones are exceptional! They are also very different than in ear monitors and cost $1600. I wanted a good pair of in ear monitors for their portability and convenience. I mention this only as another point of reference. In ear monitors are different than headphones and really cannot be directly compared.

I used them for several hours at the gym today, both running and lifting weights. They stayed in, even while I sweat, and the noise isolation was very good!

Regarding their noise isolation properties....exceptional! In fact, they do such a great job that I have to either mute my music or take them off if I need to interact with family or exist outside of my musical isolation....not a bad thing!

I don't typically write product reviews, but I have been SO impressed with these, and I also didn't want people to almost make the same mistake as myself and dismiss them without a proper fit.

If your goal is to enjoy music with great resolution, exceptional noise isolation, comfort and great build quality for everyday use, I cannot recommend them highly enough!"
163,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a long time customer of Shure because they produce the highest quality sound products at a semi-reasonable cost. The SE315-K headphones have lived up to my high expectations, and then some. As a previous employee at a company that used to be run by a guy named Steve, I've had the opportunity to meet with several headphone manufacturers and sample their products, including Beats (the worst), Bose (great but pricey), and Shure. Since then I've promoted Shure's product and will continue to do so. Don't believe the advertising from Beats, they are all brand name and no substance."

OK now to my review my journey began 2 days ago while I was at the gym I had my reliable brainwavz s1 a beautiful and amazing sounding iem's but just like other earbuds the came to an end by a machine at the gym you know the usual wire caught and pulled earbuds dead so I was bummed I don't train with anyone else except my music it's my constant amp up so of course I couldn't go one day without them I had a pair of chepo earbuds but if your like me once your use to that amazing sound there's no going back so I started showing instantly that night and since I literally needed them the next day I took to best buy as my refuge of course they had the beats and bose two brands that I really didn't want beats just being such a mainstream sell out product that really is over priced and bose sorry but I like a variety of earbud tips not just some that look like a fine from a fish there seriously ugly iem's so I looked up the other two that still were contenders sony and klipsch I knew right away I didn't want the klipsch even being the new R6 I was already a member of that class with my old brainwavz s1 it was definitely time to move up and so I took to sony grabbing the xba-h1 witch claimed to have dual drivers and blah blah I really expected something worthy what I got was complet trash!!!! So I returned the by the way they weren't defected they were just horrible seriously for 170 bucks my chepo 10 dollar ones were better so now what was I to do it really sadness me that I was so close to buying some beats tour 2.0 but then I remembered that guitar center sold shure so I went right away I had a choice between the 4 the 2 and 315 and went with 3 s so I get home and what do you know the right driver is blown out after all this I got a defected one so back they went that same day now getting to the point I tried them on only to be again disappointed they had great I mean amazing midst and highs but lacked bass and I couldn't find any tip at this point to fit secure I like my iem's to go all up in my ear canal lol not just sit there on my ear like most do so messing with all the tips I finally found that the tri flange did the job to a perfect degree now the only thing still that was probably the most important part was the bass my brainwavz s1 had amazing bass and these almost 3x the price were lacking behind them just as I thought I can't believe shure rips people off like this I remembered someone saying try messing with the equalizer by the way I use it with my Galaxy S4 so I went in and added bass and ohhh myyyy gooddd I was so happy I did not only did they kill my brainwavz s1 in bass but in everything else literally leagues apart but in all honesty I would still buy some brainwavz s1 there amazing for there price and that's my story take your time with these ear buds there professional caliber iem's they must be treated as such take your time finding the right tips and to any one complain that these baby's don't have bass wait till you guys mess with the equalizer the bass the vocals the mids the highs pure music nirvana
165,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely decent headphone, most part of the music is great, but human vocal part feels low or far away.
Had an E3C before, love it, but it was kind of fragile, and ended up broken it. Found that no longer in production, so went to get this (supposedly) shure's replacement for E3C.
No, not as good.
Here's how it feel v.s. the old E3C:
Pro:
1. Stronger, haven't achieved to break it yet (about 4-5 years), both the wire and the headphone are working flawlessly.
2. I like the stiff wire on top, make it easier to hold the shape on my ears.

Con:
1. the size is kind of large, it took me (my ear) at least a year to get comfortable with it. Before that, the big earbud rubs an area in my ear, and it gets hurtful after a few hours.
2. The vocal part of the music just feels far away than normal. The acoustic and instrumental part of the music is pretty decent and sometimes amazing. But when human voice starts, it sounds lower than it was/should be.

Personally I've just upgraded to an se535, I know it's strong, I won't lost it accidentally, and I may be using it most of the day while working, it make some sense to me.
On the other hand, if you too think se535's price tag is pretty mad, try a few others first. I do think there are better ones out there for this one's price. Or, if you listen elusively to non-vocal music, it's probably a good choice."
166,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't decide between the 315's and the 425's, mainly because I wasn't sure the 425s could actually be worth $100 more. The only differences between the two models are 1-sound quality, 2-adaptor and 3-carrying case. The case thing is easy, because who cares what case it is? The 425s have a hard case, the 315s have a soft case. The soft case is actually a little cooler, but the hard case is probably more useful in protecting the buds. I'm not one to use a case unless I'm traveling or such anyway. The 425s come with the adapter for standard headphone jacks. If you really need one you likely already have it, and since they only cost a couple of bucks to buy, I don't think that should count in the comparison. So that leaves us with sound quality. Ok, funny story: When I first tried out the 425s my husband came by and asked why I had that awful look on my face. I was so disappointed! They were tinny and made the music sound cold and dead. I took them out, very disappointed, and tried the 315s, which sounded a bit warmer. When I put the 425s back in a few minutes later I realized that if my fingers were on them, they sounded amazing. Well, a bit of fiddling with the different sleeves and I found a set that fit my ear well. These aren't slam-in-your-ear-and-go earbuds. It takes a moment to get them on and adjusted (tho I can see that getting easier with practice) but when you do - WOW. Here is my best tip: Get them in the way you think they are supposed to go, then push on the housing and see if they sound better. If so, you're not getting a good fit and you should try a different sleeve or re-seat them. The foam versions of the sleeves can be rather hard to get on and off, but it is worth it.

So, which ones did I keep? The 425s. Yeah, there really is $100 difference in the sound. Now, everyone is different, and I'm using these as iPod/computer earbuds, not for reference or monitoring, but for me the detail produced by the 425s is excellent.

The 315s are ok, but that's the issue, they're just ok. For the price they should be at least good. They're marginally better than your basic $20 earbuds. They're not $150 bucks better, for sure.

I've been through a LOT of headphones and earbuds over the years. I have returned more pairs of earbuds than I care to admit in the $100 range, too. The 425s are better than any earbuds I've ever tried (tho NOT more comfortable, at least not yet). The 425s are actually better than my very expensive Sony over-ear, full size headphones, too.

I like the cord design. I was concerned about the detachable cord, given some of the other reviews here, but I hear no static so maybe they've fixed that issue. I tested that out in both models and couldn't see any difference; neither had any static.

And as for sound-isolation. I don't feel like I'm deaf to the world with them on, but I certainly can't hear a lot of external noise. For example, I'm sitting in a room 10 feet from a TV on which there is a loud football game playing. With the music on I cannot hear the game at all. If I turn the music off, I can hear the TV. It's pretty much the same effect as having a pair of the sort of foam earplugs ya wear to a concert on, so, ya know, set your phone to vibrate.

I'm very satisfied with the 425s Day 1 (this is all not having burned them in yet). The 315s are on their way back."
167,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for nearly a year now, they are by far the best in-earphones i have come across. i am in no ways an audio-phile but i'm quite specific about sound quality and i have to say these sounds great, they are clear but provide a warmth to the music and they pick up on the full recordings allowing for a fuller experience. The isolation is near perfect, at higher volumes you cannot hear any background sound, even at low volume unless overly loud there is no background sound.
The durability had to be one of the biggest selling points for me, i have gone through about $700 worth of other earphones only to have them stop working or fall apart after only months of use, the cord is very durable, from memory its made of Kevlar, it feels strong and is definitely stronger than the cord you find on cheaper sets ( after rough use on my behalf and not having stored in the given case my cord has begun to break but to no fault of the manufacturing), the actual jack itself is very strong and unlikely to break even from the roughest users. The fact that the cord can be changed is a major bonus, although i am not to sure where to purchase one from. The actual earphones may seem fragile but are in fact really quite strong.
In the package you get and case, its good but could have been better, also about 10 different earpiece sets ranging from rubber cones to foam inserts, also includes a cleaner for the earpieces. One con i came across was the yellow foam earpieces you get, i'm not sure if it was just mine but it seems as if a monkey had cut the pieces, one piece was about 3mm thick and cut on an angle and the other was about 1cm think and roughed up without an use at all.
At first the fitting takes time and will be fairly uncomfortable, it took about a week to get used to it.

Overall these are amazing earphones and excellent for the price, they are probably the extent to which you can get away without need of a amplifier and make them great for use with Ipod or other mp3. These will suit any type of music, i listen to mostly hard rock/heavy metal and find these to be amazing for it, i also listen to some r n b etc and although people say these are lacking in bass i find the bass to be ""cleaner"", and you can always change your e.q to get a heavier bass response.
(i use the medium black foam inserts as they are the best isolation for me and i find them easiest to put in, that's another thing, many reviews say they take time to put them on etc, honestly after a while you can put them in just as easily as any earphone)

168,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased SE-315's to use live onstage. I'd held out as long as possible using wedges but felt it was time to have my own set of ""ears"" for the various gigs and shows I do. Not wanting to spend a ton of money I looked at several in this price range and these were the standout by far.

Shure's reputation for quality gave me confidence that they wouldn't fall apart after a few months and the fact that the cable and each driver was replaceable was a plus.

I've used them on several shows and find them to be really good and fine for my needs. So much of the fidelity and clarity issue depends on who is doing monitors and what the console situation is that it didn't make sense to be spending $600+ on a set of ears.

All in all I'm happy but the one issue I have is that they may be TOO bottom heavy for my tastes (and I like a lot of bass). It seems in this product market so much emphasis is placed on the low frequency issue that some manufacturers go too far. But I've gotten used to it so it's fine. The other thing is that I was surprised that I was able to overdrive them with my ipod 160gb classic. This happens when I have the volume maxed - which I know is far too high but I just wanted to see what the distortion threshold was. I would have thought there would be a bit more headroom with something this high end.

Overall - I am very happy and don't regret buying them for a second. Now the stage mix is clear and I'm able to control exactly what I want to hear which makes playing a pleasure."
169,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Why the hell did Shure change the shape of their headphone from that of the SE310?! I lost my SE310s of three years, and decided to buy the ""replacement"" SE315. The E3C fit nicely inside the ear canal. I could wear it for hours, comfortably, with all noise being blocked out, and a nice tight seal guaranteeing an immersive listening experience. But then Shure changed the shape to what it is now, such that the earbuds just rest inside the opening of the ear canal, allowing much more outside noise to enter.

Soundwise I found the bass to be weaker than that of the SE310--already a mild criticism of both the E3C and the SE315--and the midtones to be weaker and muddier. I've already purchased a set of SE310s on eBay, and will soon be selling these on eBay.

What the hell were you thinking, Shure?! I will never buy a headphone from you again as long as you continue to use this new headphone shape!"
170,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these predominantly for long mountainbike rides in the French Alps while listening to podcasts and occasionally on long car drives. So I need something rugged, with very high sound quality, and easy to use. They have good sound and appear durable. They block outside sounds effectively but not completely, giving me a safety margin while riding.

Unfortunately, I have to fiddle with them when I try to put them in my ears because of the way they are designed: the wire can rotate completely, so it can get twisted and pop out easily, which is rather frustrating. They are also not labelled left and right, so it was difficult for me to figure out which ear to put them into for a time. These are minor quibbles, given the quality of the sound I get."
171,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these as a warranty replacement for the Shure SCL 3's and all I can say is WOW!!!!!!!! The difference between my older ones and the 315's is like night and day. I use these with a Cowon mp3 player (J 3) for bicycle riding, walking and long distance international plane flights and the noise isolation is excellent. The sound quality is like being in the front row of live concert-you can hear every musical note very clearly and the sound separation is super.

When I sent my old Shure's to IL. for repairs, I was hoping they could be fixed and was surprised that Shure sent the 315's instead-PLEASANTLY surprised. The turnaround time was about 6 working days-FL to IL and my compliments to Shure for their excellent customer, something that is lacking with many companies.

These may take a little time to get used to and if you decide to buy them, Shure provides several different earpieces that should fit most people. I used the yellow foam tips with my old SCL's but have changed to the foam tips with these and the sound isolation and quality are greatly improved.

Last, I would not consider myself an audiophile but these headphones are superior to my ears. I have had them for a month with no problems and have been able to hear cymbal, drum and guitar sounds I had not heard with my old SCL's. Hats off to Shure for making a great product and their excellent customer service experience."

173,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good sound quality and comfort. I see a lot of reviews talking about the lack of bass, most likely that can be caused by bad fit and or the sourse of your music. Make sure to chose the right earbuds from the ones included with these headphones. In my opinion bass is very well balanced and does not overwhelm the rest of the frequencies. These headphones perform so much better when connected to a PC and a proper player with loss less files. You will notice imperfections in the compressed mp3 files. These headphones may be a good way to start getting into high quality music. Sound isolation is great - at 30% volume i cant even hear myself talking, no need for the active noise cancelling. I am very happy with my purchase."
174,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these! I’m a drummer and everything sounds nice and clear! It sounds so good that they make me want to play all day! They’re comfortable as well! I really recommend them!
175,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They really aren't that comfortable, but definitely more comfortable than the big Vic Firth sound isolation headphones. Band practice is about 7 hours long, maybe 3 times a week. These only lasted about a month; the left earbud failed. Pretty sad for almost $200. I would've been better off getting two pairs of the cheaper ones so that I'd at least have a pair on hand while the other was sent in for warranty repair."
176,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got these yesterday directly from Shure as a replacement for my E3C's that shorted out (which if you read other reviews, were a NIGHTMARE as far as build quality...I went through FOUR pairs of them, each one shorting out after about a year of light to moderate use). Considering the price and the specs, I think this is a welcome (and unexpected) upgrade...so that was a nice surprise when I opened the box (and I will say that Shure makes the return/replacement process pretty painless and their turn around to replace broken headphones is very fast). These (the SE315's) are considerably more cumbersome and robust than the E3C's...but if that means better durability/longevity...I am OK with it. This does, however, make putting them on and getting a good ""seal"" considerably more difficult (actually somewhat of a pain in the butt). This is the main reason for not giving them 5 stars. They have also changed the design so the ear-piece is actually removable now...one assumes so the cables can be replaced without having to replace the earpiece (which contains all the expensive technology/drivers etc)...probably a smart move on Shure's part. I once tried on (but could not afford) a pair of the E5C's...and these seem comparable AS FAR AS BUILD QUALITY (not sound) to those. As far as sound, I will admit that I am not an audiophile or one who espouses to have great knowledge of what ""great sound"" is. I own several pairs of decent headphones, and I can say (having only used them for about 30 minutes last night) these seem to have (for me) very good, balanced, clean sound. My Klipsch Image S4i's (which I recently purchased) have a slightly brighter sound and they seem to bring out the highs better than the Shures...but sometimes that comes across as tinny to me. Perhaps that's because I've used Shure headphones for so long and I am used to a more mid/bass predominating sound. I don't know. But all in all, out of the box, these seems like another quality SOUNDING product from Shure. How they hold up over time remains to be seen."
177,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm giving these IEMs 2 stars because the sound is awesome and they are the most comfortable IEMs I have ever worn.

Unfortunately, after using them everyday for 3 weeks, the right ear started making a cracking noise, then the volume went down considerably. I would make slight adjustments by pushing them around inside my ear and then they would return to normal sound. They finally went out completely. Luckily I was able to return them for a full refund.

I really really wanted to like these, and I really want another pair, but I am just a little gun shy due to my experience and seeing the same issues reported all over the 'net."
178,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had three pair of Sures, each an updated model, they all go bad in a year or two, always one of the two buds stops working. They say clean them, but that never helps, I believe they use poor components and something inside fails. And I always use their hard case to protect them. Just a very poor design (or good from their perspective--repeat business). The sound really nice when the work, and I find them comfortable. But I suggest getting the Sennheisers--way better reliability and not much difference in sound, and to top it off they're cheaper."
179,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just bought them hoping to find a temporary replacement for my damaged Grado PS500e. I know that price gap is to big to compare them however i have to say that those Shure SE315 are simply unbelievable wrong. I have also some Monk earbuds (5$) which are performing better in both highs and lows. I have owned a Bayerdynamic 770 which are in the same price range and which are good sounding device.
Those Shure 315 have close-to-decent mids, sibling highs and nonexistent lows. I'm not a bass head since i listen mainly to classical music. Listing to a piano recording makes you cry for every cent they cost. I cannot believe that a company like Shure isn't able to create something better today for the same price. I think they come our with products like this ones just for the market-segmentation mantra. I would not buy the Shure SE315 not even for 3$."
180,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't even think about buying these if you want an earphone that will last more than 2 weeks. I have now had 7 replacement sets all with the exact same issue, the ear buts just fade out and eventually stop working. It got to the point that I have stopped even bothering trying to fix them they are so bad! I literally cannot go 2 weeks before they just die, then it takes 1 month to repair and get back to me!

Comfort wise they are awesome, which makes it doubly frustrating that they are so so poor.

I wrote to share twice, the first time they simply showed no interest despite me explaining the issues, the second time they didn't even reply. My advice, buy something which does not say Shure on it!"
181,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not a fan of HUGE bass or anything, but these headphones need a lot more of it to be good for casual music enjoyment. They would be great for stage monitering as a vocalist. Vocals and other mid to high pitches sound fantastic with great clarity. Also, make sure you save your receipts; Shures do have a problem with on earbud or the other cutting out prematurely. I traded mine in for the cheaper SE215s and couldn't be happier.

184,2.0 out of 5 stars,"2 stars for the good sound coming out of them but the built quality are the customer service received a -3 Stars.

After a year of usage, one of the two earphone housing split into 2. I also discovered that the cable is falling apart too by the 3.5mm connector jack. The cable also broke off just like the heck of any iphone charger. Anyways, I called customer service, filled out the form, and mailed my split earphones including the cable to Shure for service and didn't hear back from them until a week later.

SURPRISED! The repair cost is $150 for the cable and the earphone housings. NO WAY, SHURE! I told them that I rather sell them as parts on E/bay and get some money + the $150 I can upgrade to another earphones. BTW, I did purchase an audio Technica IM02 for $200 from AMS with a 2 year warranty, and it sounds as good as Shure se530 if not better.

2 weeks later, I received the earphones back from Shure broken as they were. I figure it's just the housing that split into 2. I do have some very good super glue. Why not glue them back together. That I did! It cost me a nothing! For the cable, I purchase a 46"" shure cable from Amazon and couldn't be happier ($38). The length of 46"" is just perfect pocket length. 64"" original length of SE315 cable is just way too darn long for it to be useful!

btw, Amazon currently sells IM02 for $169.95 ATM (1 year warranty). Same price at AMS for a 2 year warranty. Which is a steal!

In the future, I wouldn't not buy another shure product!"
185,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never been a fan of running with headphones for two reasons: They always fall out of my ears, and running on the streets without full use of hearing seems dangerous. I am always on the look out for headphones that will stay in my ears while running for use on the treadmill or on trails.

I came across this article recommending the Shure SE215 for great sound quality and security in ear. I have always used cheap earphones that you can buy at the gym or Target so I was not familiar with the more high end products like Shure, Etymotic and Klipsch. My friend Lauren owns an audio supply company and gave me some Shure SE215 earphones to try out.

Immediately out of the box you can see and appreciate the quality of these earphones. They have 3 basic parts. 1. Ear foam acts like an earplug and blocks out almost all noise. 2. The driver produces the sound
3. The cord that attaches the driver to your music of choice.

After a 5 mile run the earphones are solidly in place. I never had to adjust them at all. I have found that the key to success with these ear phones is the fit of the earplug part. They come with 6 different sizes to fit any ear canal, so fitting should not be a problem for most people.

3 sizes foam and 3 sizes rubber and 1 tool for cleaning out the driver canal.

The noise isolation is really great with these earphones as well. I have used a pair of Beats Studio headphones and these earphones block an equal amount of ambient noise for 1/3 the price. The SE215 would be great to use on an airplane or anywhere you don't want people to bother you.

With the good sound isolation comes one drawback. They act like earplugs, so you can hear everything in your head. It is impossible to use these earphones while eating, the sound of your own chewing is immense. While running there is also a constant boom boom boom with every footfall, this may be distracting for some, it was easy for me to ignore.

Overall these are some really great earphones and I would recommend them to anyone who wants great sound and good sound isolation. Buy them here:[...]

187,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before owning my Shure SE215, I always just bought the cheep $15-$30 earphones. By far the best earphones that I have ever had inside my ears. Can't believe that Shure make even better ones then these.
After waiting for my Shure SE215 to come in the mail they finally arrived to my door step. After opening the box and trying them on I knew that these were the Earphone that I have been searching for, for a while now. But before being totally sold, I needed to put them through the toughest test of all. Only one thing came to mind was the local indoor skydiving wind tunnel. For those who aren't familiar with an indoor skydiving wind tunnel, it is a place where skydiver practice their skills in vertical tube with high wind speeds, any wheres from 110-160 MPH. With those type of wind speeds you can imagine that it is very loud inside that environment. The Shure SE215 had no problem with keeping up with the wind noise. Not only was I able to hear my music very clear, I was able to hear the bass clear as day. They also shield my ear from the damaging wind noise. The only thing that I would change if I was the head designer of these kick butt earphones, is that I wish that the earphones could be inserted deeper without causing a very slight discomfort to the ear cannel. But that just might be my ears. After my awesome wind tunnel session I sat around my house just listening to my favorite songs. On most of the songs I heard a lot of things that I never had heard before. The sound is just so clear. It reminds me of watching TV on an HDTV for the first time. How can such a little thing make my head rattle like I was pressing my ear next to a speaker at a concert? You will not regret this buy. Maybe if you lose them or someone steals them. I'm so happy with them so far that I know that if I ever have to buy new earphone, 1-I'm making sure that they are Shures, 2-I'm forking up the money for the SE425s. I hope that this info is more then helpful.

I have used a pair of E2c's for years. Had to repair the cable several times but they keep on working. The 315's I thought, would be a nice small step up. Boy was I wrong. I tried every ear tip and none of them provided a solid seal, like my E2's. The only ones that were close, were just OK. I even had one tip pull off the end, and was lodged in my ear canal. I took a lot of jabs for that one. But after the jabs, the guys pulled the ear tip out and I went to the next set.

The cable, although sturdy at the ear, provides too much bulk and is a true pain. The shell pressed my outer ear so hard, it began to just hurt. SO out they came and back to the store they go.

A second time because of a strange sound (sutured etc) and a speaker playing at 50% of the power it should deliver.
So in terms of sound and quality these Shure are just a scam. And Shure after sales service is so slow. 3 weeks to change a simple detachable/removable cable."
193,3.0 out of 5 stars,Would I buy this product if I had to do it over again? The answer is no. I thought that it would provide more sound isolation and better quality for the price of $199. Perhaps if it was $99 and still that is a maybe.

The cord is also not the twisted thick type that the 215 had and seems to be a standard quality and not all that thick.

198,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not a professional musician or an audiophile, but these are great headphones. I use these headphones for playing guitar and for my daily commute too and from school in the city via the train. For reference, my previous pair of headphones/ monitors were the Image S4s which I loved so much I bought two of. So far I've owned my image 315s for 3 months. When I first got them I didn't notice that much of a difference to the audio quality of my music other than the headphones producing more mid range sound and less bass. I listen to primarily metal and rock (though I do listen to a little I everything else: rap, country, classical, ect). For that music application the lack of bass did not bother me. Where these monitors really shined was when I plugged them into my amp for my guitar. Again I am not a professional musician. Not even close at that but I'm not deaf. The image s4s were great for my music on my Zune HD (which I only use 320+ encoded audio files) as was the Shures, but as soon as I plugged them in my amp the audio quality on the s4s took a dive. They sound washed overly distorted no mater how I set my amp, so I generally settled for my full sized over the ear set sennhisers (sp). This is where the Shures shined. The audio was perfect. After that I threw my over the ears into my drawer and never looked at them again. After this experience my monitors suddenly had new life. Started to notice just how crisp and responsive the audio really was (I might have been stuck on the lack of bass which ""degraded"" the quality between the s4s and Shures). As for why I love these monitors most (besides look, the clear monitors and braided cable and so cool) they block out the annoying drone of the subway amazingly well. Almost too well. It blocks sound out so much so, I had to buy a set of regular Sony ear buds so I could wear on campus do I could hear my friends when they call out to me (even when I have the volume on the Shures at 2 on my Zune and one monitor in, I still can't hear anyone). The one problem I have is that the sponge ear piece that came with the set got ruined my oil I had on my hand while working on my car and the other sponge sizes don't fit me. Now I have the silicone fittings on which aren't as comfortable. That's all :)"
199,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these as a replacement for a pair of Shure E4C which were in my opinion were some of the best. The 315's were supposed to be the newest equivalent since the E4C's have been discontinued. When I first listened to the 315's I thought something was wrong with my computer settings because they were not nearly as crisp and clean as the E4C's. After trying several different sources I came to the conclusion that there was just something different and missing from the SE315's as compared to the E4C's as I had remembered. There is nothing about the 315's I can really say WOW about. Just an average set of earphones.
200,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This product was recommended to me by my friend who is a sound engineer. I loved the ""fullness"" of the sound as well as the secure fit and sound isolation qualities.

After about 9 mo. of daily use (2hs.) the left earpiece quit working...I could hear the music very, very faintly with the volume turned all the way up. So I bought a new set (I loved the sound). In 6 mo. (no exaggeration) the left earpiece quit working... same thing. To me these earphones are expensive but worth it if they would last for ... say.... 2 years? I am disappointed and will find a better product elsewhere."

These things are outstanding for blocking out wind noise and maintaining sound quality. I have tried many different models but none seemed to fit under my helmet.

The Shure earphones are great for riding. The sound quality is GOOD but there is room for improvement. The sound-isolating feature of these, using the ear attachment pictured, is superb. I also have a pair of over-the-ear JVC HANC250 Noise Cancelling Headphones. I often listen to music while vacuuming and the Shures outperform the JVCs in blocking the noise of the vacuum. Build quality is excellent (running out of superlatives here). The cables are very thick and will no doubt out last the Bose in-ear which eventually started fraying where the cable met the 3.5 in plug. They are a bit awkward to wear at first, but I quickly figured it out. They were very comfortable, even after two hours under the helmet; whereas the Bose would be uncomfortable after one hour. Overall, I am very impressed."
202,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear phones are nothing short of fantastic! At first, I heard a lot of static and artifacts, but then, when I used them on a better audio device, they were amazing. So, the downside is that any interference (such as with an android phone) is picked up and can be heard. when I run it off my macbook pro, it's gorgeous. so, if you're going to use these with a sub par audio player, then it's a waste of money.

Takes a little getting used to the way these fit, but after about 10 minutes, you'll forget they are even there, and the seal they create is awesome, I can't even hear people standing next to me talking. I have my device set to almost the lowest volume level and I can hear everything perfectly, though, I agree that the bass doesn't kick in unless you turn it up a bit, though I still think that's the player's fault and not the ear phones."
203,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of SE-315's. (the first pair were stolen) I LOVE these headphones. I listen to everything from country to rap. The sound stage is amazing, you can literally close your eyes while listening to music and visualize where the sound is coming from. I have compared these to the Bose IE2 in ears. They are not even in the same ball park, on sound quaility, the Sure's cable is also thicker, and almost 12"" longer and detachable. Now to the comfort. With multiple choices for the in ear tip these headphones make a great seal and are extremely comfortable and dont come out unless you want them to. From high notes to low notes and everything in between the SE series (215,315,425, and 535) are simply amazing. I HIGHLY suggest these in ears to anyone that doesnt mind spending money on a quaility product! They are well worth it!"

206,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Having owned Shure's line of sound isolating earphones for several years, and going through about 1 pair a year, I can tell you that the engineering changes are noticed immediately in their new line.

The good: better durability - mentioned in other posts

The bad: I immediately noticed a lack of clarity in the SE315 sound in comparison to their last year's product. Had to return these and purchase the SE535. They also don't fit the same and are bulkier so I had to use the white ear-tips, instead of the black ones, to get a deep fit... and the white ones don't seem to isolate sounds as much."
207,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had many clam-shell only headphone users be surprised by the quality of these headphones. A really good seal is needed in your ear to get decent bass response (other reviews complain about lack of fidelity in that frequency range). I purchased additional flang tips on amazon to get the best fit in my ears. To reduce cord noise when wearing the headphones use a clip to fasten the cord to your clothes and create a tension point to stop the transfer of cord vibration to your ears. I purchased Fii0 replacement cord on amazon to use with a DAC/AMP and get slightly better bass response due to that cords construction (however it is shorter than the OEM cord). Excellent value for the price.
208,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is one part the product itself but equally about the company that builds and stands behind their product.

I've used Shure products for decades; initially knowing them for their phono cartridges, back in the day on campus radio. They were the cartridge and stylus of choice and I recently replaced the cartridge on my turntable with a great Shure product. In later years I started using their in-ear monitors, slowly going up the product line, buying better and better iterations.

I use my earphones *a lot* - when I fly, these babies are jammed into my ears for the entire flight to block out the babbling cacophony around me. Even if I'm not playing any music, they dull the sound to a reasonable level. Add some music from an iPod or a movie from my laptop or tablet and it's all over; I don't hear a thing except what I'm listening to. I literally have to pull one from my ear to hear what a flight attendant might be saying.

Data centres: when I have to spend time getting hands-on with some equipment, there's nothing better to drown out the thousands of fans and 15K drives that would, otherwise, push me over the edge.

At the race track: suppressing the scream of cars and bikes, there's nothing better. Plus, if I'm on the track myself and need to get some lap time updates from my lap timer, these fit comfortably under my helmet giving me very clear communication.

But through all this, you can tell these things get around and get beaten up a little. What I've found is that the connector cable (or whip) eventually frays and starts crackling intermittently. Ironically, or maybe luckily, this always seems to happen right around 20-21 months into owning the particular iteration I've been using.

Shure have a no-question Warranty policy and have always replaced any faulty parts, free of charge and very fast; 3 times in succession so far.

So really, I get at least 4 good solid years of use out of my headphones. I think that's a pretty fair lifetime for a heavily used piece of consumer electronics.

For a little company from Niles, Illinois, these guys are showing the rest of the world what it is to be a top-tier, customer-obsessed company and they have my loyalty for life!

Go Shure! You guys rock!!"
209,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a series of Shure earbuds and loved them. I even got used ot the over the ear part. I especially liked the fact that the headphones and cord could be separated to replace the cord when it inevitably burned out first. My old favorites no longer a current product, I bought the SE315-CL. I did not see anything online that said that it had a unified cord, so I was really disappointed when I opened the box. But the box was open. These do not have a ""R"" on one piece and an ""L"" on the other either, and I have had a hard time putting on the first ear correctly. No biggee I guess. I was starting to get used to the harder plastifc/kevlar part near the ear bud, which is much ess comfortable than earlier models.. But I would put up with that too as the sound is good and I find the over the ear fit a good one with my ears. But now less than a month from receipt the right ear has a short or something, and works only intermittently when I pull it or put pressure on it. When I return from this trip I will send it back in and see if at least Shure will stand by the product for a month. Stay tuned."
210,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these headphones heavily for 1 year and 11 months. Finally one of the buds snapped off at the retaining washer. The other side was getting a bit tweaky too and sometimes I would have to adjust it to get sound out. I travel with these to the tune of about 100,000 miles a year. I fall asleep with these on airplanes and often in hotel beds when I can't fall asleep. I run with them, lift weights with them, etc etc. They are USED and used hard.

Seven days ago to the day I filled out the RMA / Warranty form and sent the headphones back. Seven days later (today / five business days) I was surprised to see a box from Shure via UPS on my doorstep.

They replaced the entire thing. Cord, both ear buds, everything. Brand new replacement.. THAT my friends is quality service. I honestly figured I would ship and forget and sometime a month or two down the road I might have a repaired unit. I never expected a new set. I never expected anything to happen in 5 business days.

Awesome! I've used Shure for about a decade and they have lifetime loyalty out of me now. As if they didn't before.."
211,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great deal and excellent quality. This was by far the best deal that I found and shipping was very fast.
212,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a very good pair of ear buds as I've been using cheap ones for a while now. My replacement needed to stay in my ear, deliver great sound, be of quality construction, and reduce outside noise. The 315's accomplished all these and I didn't mind spending a little more for them. I've seen other replies stating that they had issues with quality, hoping that doesn't happen to me given the expense of these. So far, so good. I would recommend these to anyone who doesn't mind shelling out a up to $200 for a set of good ear buds."
213,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best earbuds I have ever owned. My first time with a dual driver earbud and it makes all the difference. Isolates the sound very well and quite comfortable to wear for extended time. Only complaint is simply a payoff to excellent isolation of sound, I cannot hear anything else but the sounds from the earbuds, external voices cannot be heard."
214,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a big fan of Shure earphones and their older generation and high end new generation are well-balanced, comfortable and offer great sonic clarity. These new generation 315's, were not cheap but the sound was shrill, loud but strident. They were really a disappointment. They also didn't fit or stay in place as well as the previous generation Shure's. I like the change to the cord and the way it attaches to the earpiece. I would recommend looking elsewhere at this price point. Otherwise go for the higher end 535's."
215,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked as expected
216,5.0 out of 5 stars,"burn it in for a week and the bass will be surprisingly richer.
headphones like this need time to get worked in and the bass will develop very clearly.

also, use the white in ear canal tips, they do the best full seal.
I can barely hear the train coming when I have it in. and I really don't hear it when I have music playing.
It's a bit shocking to just feel the train passing by rather than to hear it.

the sound is clear, I can note compression from non flac and anything below 320kbs audio.

my little sansa clip and the tiny apple's nano can drive these headphones without having to turn the volume up at all."
217,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used other in ear monitoring buds that had a slightly higher sound quality especially in the bass response. That being said, these produce outstanding quality for the cost. You can get a little more if you're willing to pay quite a bit more."
218,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best earphones I ever had, I own a e2g, a e3c, a se115 and now this little beauty. From the e2g to the se115 big difference, the new black foam tips are outa this world for comfort and isolation but the size is bout the same. Now, for the SE315, the sound is amazing, better bass, rich middles and crystal highs. No distortion at all, the new SE detachable cables are a BIG plus, really strong and long lasting feel(my 4y old e2g has some crackings on the wire loop 2cm from the buds but the sound is still perfect. This new cables seem to leave no room for these kind of problem and if they do wear out, you may change the cables only). It is smaller than the SE115 and its differently shaped, it gets inside your ear and bonds with it, there are no tips or nothing coming out of the normal ""ear line"", much more comfy to sleep with them as they seem to dissapear. Well, personally, Im in love with them."
219,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After waiting over a week for the Shure SE315-K, Sound Isolating Earphone's to arrive i got the package and went to try them out. the sleeve that the earphones come with on them already did not work so following the directions of the manufacturer of twisting and pulling on the sleeve the earphone nozzle broke off. now i only have one earphone that is usable and completely defeats the purpose of buying these. this is poor manufacturing and the fact that these broke less than 5 minutes out of the box is very disappointing.

update
Shure (the manufacturer) was very helpful and replaced the broken part for no charge. I am now very happy with the earphones and am very glad that I made the purchase"
220,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The short story: these earbuds are oddly shaped, but are very comfortable, and provide excellent isolation. I am not an audiophile, so I hesitate to comment on the audio quality, although to my untrained ear they seem to provide excellent sound.

The 315s take a bit of getting used to: figuring out the best way to get them in your ear is a bit tricky (they're the 'over-the-ear' type) but once you get the hang of it they're easy to work with.

The 315s have several advantages over the other two sets of earbuds I have owned. Both of those buds were Shures, one in the $100 range, the other in the $300 range, but they didn't stand the test of time. The more expensive set eventually separated at the cord/earphone junction. The 315s have improved on those designs in four respects:

1. Replaceable cord

2. The end of the cord that attaches to the earphone (basically the section that rides on the top of the ear) is built stronger than the rest of the cord, and the joint between the heavier cord and the lighter cord is covered by a long piece of heat shrink (or similar material) to provide further strain relief. I work in electronics and have used the same technique to bolster cable connections that are subject to frequent movement. It's simple but very effective.

3. The earphone actually rotates on the connection to the replaceable cord, which actually removes strain on the cord/earphone joint. The old style earbuds suffered at least some strain from frequent lateral motion, especially during insertion and removal.

4. Heavier earphone body. That might sound like a disadvantage, but in my opinion it's a plus. The earphone lays perfectly in my ear, and due to it's size, I can easily use the body of the earphone to remove it from my ear. The older designs tempted one to use the cord to leverage the earphones out of the ear, further stressing the relatively delicate cord-to earphone joint. There's no reason to use the cord to help remove the 315 earphone.

That last point also brings up another issue: some have complained of the 315 earphone being prone to separate from the cable, implying that the connection between the two is week. I've not had that problem, but I suspect that folks that have had it have not been removing the earbuds properly: in other words, they have been tugging on the cord to remove the earbud from the ear and, of course, stressing the cord-to earbud connection and making it pop free. A drawing in the manual shows precisely how to remove the earbuds (just as I have described in #4 above). Basically, with the 315s, folks have to unlearn some of their old bad habits with respect to earbuds: use the elongated body of the earbud to remove it from the ear, rather than twisting with the cord."
221,5.0 out of 5 stars,"best products on the market - period. I've been using Shure now for about 10 years. The sound quality is insanely good, clear, and with lots of deep, deep bass. The proper size foam is imperative for great bass sound. Try different foam sizes, including larger ones than you might initially think your ears need. you wont be disappointed."
222,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by addressing the frequent claims that these headphones lack bass-- they have plenty of bass. I'm the kind of person that loves bass, too, and these buds satisfy my ravenous thirst for bass. Kick drums hit hard and metal sounds as brutal as intended. Maybe they don't create over-the-top boomy bass that muddies music--no--what these little guys produce is far more refined and detailed but they don't lack any power.The mids and the treble are riddled with nuance and subtlety. There's a tragic irony, however, with owning premium headphones like these: Compressed music will start to sound compressed... especially when compressed to less than 320kbps. These are actually replacing my 3-year old SE215s. The old ones still work fine which is a testament to their outstanding build-quality.

If you want it so loud it hurts these headphones will gladly oblige.

I use these with an HTC One with Beats audio (beats enhancement turned off) and the Poweramp music player with custom EQ adjustment."
223,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not good headset. Although it fits nicely in ear, however, the sound quality is not good at all. I have Bose QC20i and I absolutely love it. If I compare this Shure headsets with Bose QC20i, I would not even rate one star for Shure. It lacks all the good quality of music and sounds very dull and one of those cheap headsets. Not recommended, if you want these for your music."
224,5.0 out of 5 stars,great pair of isolating headphones. you need to choose the right cup among a great choice that comes included. live music standard for sure.
225,2.0 out of 5 stars,These are not that comfortable in your ear and the cord smells like petroleum. I have another pair of Shures and they are better. Sound is very good on both.
226,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earbuds are the best sounding that I've found. They truly represent the entire frequency range in a way other earbuds just aren't able to do. It's a pleasure wearing them will hiking or walking as they assorted ear tips allow you to find the perfect fit & as a result I can wear them for hours with no discomfort. I can also wear them for hours without any listening fatigue as you don't have to have the volume loud at all to hear everything cleanly.
227,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these earbuds. I use them at church and in a band. They are comfortable and reduce a ton of external stage noise.
228,5.0 out of 5 stars,The se315 earbuds are absolutely amazing and completely satisfying. The sound from these earbuds is rich and full. They provide very nice isolation from exterior sound and the bass will satisfy anyone's musical palate I have fallen in love again with my entire catalog of mp3s. Thank you Shure for such wonderful technology!
229,4.0 out of 5 stars,"had 100 dollar ear buds before, and felt cheated. I was reluctant to spend double the amount. I went with these shure in ear monitors, and i simply love them. the noise cancellation is great, they sound awesome, and the fit is comfortable, and do not hurt your ears with long use. I've been missing a lot with my music. the frequency and range is nice and full. You can hear things you have never heard before in your music. These things have me wondering about the SE846's now, just can't swallow that price, maybe some day."
230,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were a replacement pair that were loaned to a friend who lost them. I like them so much I replaced them with the exact ones. Well I might have gotten the next model up if I could have afforded it, but these work great."
231,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th pair of Shure isolation headphones. I got these to replace a pair of Shure SCL3 headphones. I definitely felt that the SE315-K's were an upgrade. With multiple drivers, I felt these had a much better bass reponse and better frequency range. I did feel the fit was a bit more difficult to get right with these than my older pair. However, once the cable got ""broken in"" (it was very stiff to start with which will probably be a good thing for longevity) they have settled in nicely and I get good isolation. Don't give up when you first put them in your ears (it's tough to keep a good isolation initially). Once you get the cable to soften up a bit, they work great."
232,4.0 out of 5 stars,super gift
233,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the third pair of Shure noise-canceling earbuds I have owned. For me, the high quality has always been worth the money. I put these in, can't hear a single thing except for the music, and the quality is high enough that I hear parts of the music I never knew existed (for songs I've listened to hundreds of time before).

Advantages:

- Amazing music quality
- Great warranty

Disadvantages:

- Previous Shure versions I've owned have had the ""cushion"" portion of the earbuds deteriorate over time. Thankfully the give you a bunch of replacements.
- The SE315-K version doesn't easily wrap around the back of my ears like the older versions did. A little annoying but manageable."
234,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure earphones are simply the best sounding! Full range, extremely clear, and very comfortable."
235,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very well made, but somewhat difficult to fit in. The real problem: sound quality. These have a nasty mid-range peak that is just plain annoying and unnatural. The sound fine with Audyssey AMP, but I can't us the app for all that much, so I gave up on these. For this kind of money, they need to be way more neutral and pleasant."
236,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as an ugrade to my Sennheiser CX-400 earphones. In all regards, these Shure earphones are an upgrade from the Sennheisers. The Sennheisers have a little more bass, but the bass overpowers the mids and highs. The Shures are much more balanced.

I considered Shure 315's and the Triple.Fi 10's from Ultimate Ears. The deciding factor for me was comfort. I use earphones when I'm going to sleep, so I need to be able to wear them and rest the side of my head on a pillow. Because these earphones angle back along your ear rather than stick out like the TF10's, they work very well in this application.

There is a lot to like about these earphones. The cable is thick and robust without being unwieldy. The earpieces are solidly constructed, very comfortable, and fit well in my ears. They have excellent isolation with no microphonic effects from the cable. The nylon case is nice and holds the earphones well. These tips are easily replaced and a wide variety are provided, which can be fun to experiment with. I found the medium black foam tips work best for me. I've worn these for a couple of hours and forgot that I had them in.

I found these earphones to benefit greatly from break in. Initially, I was very dissapointed by the sound quality - the bass was severely lacking and the treble had no sparkle. After using them for a few days (6 or 7 hours of listening), they suddenly opened up. So be patient and give these earphones a chance.

I dinged a star only because of the sound quality. Compared to my Grado SR-225s (which are at the same price point as the Shure 315's), there is something missing in these earphones. Perhaps it's not fair to compare IEM's with open-backed/over-the-ear headphones, but I can't help it since that is my frame of reference.

All things considered, I'm quite pleased with my purchase and look forward to continued musical enjoyment with these earphones."
237,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An amazing pair of headphones. Let's you listen to almost every single detail of the song you like/love. My gripe though is that it lacks deep bass.

241,4.0 out of 5 stars,good
242,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Need to block out substantial NY city noise (subway and above-ground) without bulk. These headphones are extremely well-made, with foam-like inserts that mold to your ear canal and block out the shrill sounds, while allowing just enough in to be able to interact in the environment when necessary.

I mostly have listened to spoken podcasts, so can't comment on musical sound quality, but can say the volume can be so low these are benefitting hearing/reducing loss by not having to crank them up to drown out noise."
243,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing in ear monitors. Very comfortable to wear little ear fatigue. The sound quality is amazing. The bass isn't overwhelming but still present. Build quality feels great and the tips it comes with are varried. I would strongly recommend them.
244,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound great.

Huge downside is the fact that the connection on the earphones cuts out. I only had about 6 hours of use with these before my Left headphone would constantly cut out. If you jiggled and pushed on the cord near the connection it would come back but as soon as you turn your head again it would cut out.

For $200 headphones this should not be an issue. sucks cause I really liked my e4c's and wanted to love these too."

248,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd pair of Shure earphones. One day I will learn not to leave them on the plane! Apparently the cleaning crews NEVER find them :-) Well I was a big fan of the Shure line-up of products. Unfortunately they lost me on the ""new and improved"" system. You must warp the line around your ear for a proper fit. The wire does not want to stay in place and if you dare turn your head they want to come out and you loose the sound quality and sound isolation. I which they would go back to offering the standard type E type earbuds.

Once in and not moving - nothing comes close in quality of sound I think. Up to you if you can live with the wire around the ear."
249,5.0 out of 5 stars,It takes a little getting used-to when putting these headphones in your ears. But once you get the motion down it's just an after thought. The foam tips really do a great job at isolating exterior noises. The sound quality is top notch as well. Cyrstal clear across the entire spectrum (at least as far as my ears can tell).
250,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Years ago I had another set of sure earphones. The Shure SE315-K, Sound Isolating Earphone far exceeded my expectations and I'm very glad I made this purchase. The treble is highly detailed and the base is earth shattering meaning very very good."
251,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I will start off by saying these are good headphones but not GREAT. They have GREAT build quality however. They are 10x better quality than my Klipsch Custom 3's I am replacing due to the known cable issue. Right out of the box you can tell the cables are high grade and the monitors themselves seem like the will last for years. These earphones are not small but they fit nicely in your ear actually making them much less noticeable than normal headphones.

As far as sound goes these are great in some areas but seem to lack a bit in others. I am not an audiophile however I do own quality products( Shure se315, Bowers & Wilkins P5's and Klipsch Custom 3's) and rip my music in flac or 320 mp3s. The highs are very pronounced and come through with excellent clarity without being overly bright. The mids are solid as well as the bass but seem to lack a little depth. The quality is pretty impressive considering these are only a single driver and they cost about $200. The biggest downfall that these earphones have is the sound stage and separation at times. When a song has a lot going on it almost seems it all mush together.

Overall I would absolutely recommend these earphones especially because of the outstanding build quality and lasting value. Shure has set the standard for build quality that many other companies will struggle to live up to."
252,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear buds are the bomb. The music quality is amazing. I can totally enjoy my music when riding my motorcycle without having to crank up the volume into distortion. And these came with a set of the triple flange sleeves, which are very comfortable and block out wind and other background noise."
253,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my husband. The sound is awesome. I love them so much, I intend to buy myself a pair. Well worth the money."
254,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stop Reading reviews and purchase these earbuds. Shure makes impressive in-ear monitors and these will not dissapoint. These are best for portable non amplified listeners. If you have a headphone amp then I would go with the Shure 425s but these 315s perform amazingly with or without a headphone amplifier. And detachable cables and foam sleeves are a big PLUS!
255,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had a pair of these before and completely wore them out. Tia is clearly a professional's choice and well worth the price!
256,2.0 out of 5 stars,"(A) Ergonomics
I'm sure everyone's ears are different. For me, any tip one these earphones was laborious to insert into my ears. I tried several times a day for a week and I never got much better at inserting these. I did not have this problem with my old Shure E3c, my new Etymotic ER-4Ps, or a Monster Turbine I tried. I fault the backwards setup (rather than direct into the ear) of these earphones.

(B) Poor Bass
When the buds are sealed properly, the bass is weak. Compared to the Etymotic ER-4Ps, it's a no brainer to ditch the Shures. When I had the previous generation Shure E3c, I remember the Etymotics being a step better in bass but not this much.

(C) Useless Noise Isolation
Perhaps due to my difficulties, the design of the drivers, or from the thinness of the foam tips provided, the noise isolation on these phones was minimal. In a side-by-side comparison to Etymotic ER-4Ps, the Shures blocked out what seemed like an order of magnitude LESS office noise. The Etymotic ER-4Ps cost a bit more, but the few bucks are worth never hearing anyone around me talking while playing music at low volume.

Seriously, skip this product. Buy an Etymotic ER-4P or Westone etc. The Etymotic cord is more dainty, but you can record it for $50-60 via outside vendors (different material) or from Etymotic. Frankly, if I'm paying $200 for a pair of Shures, I can put in a bit more for something that actually works."
257,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Context: I've been a Sennheiser headphone audiophile since the release of the HD580s way back when. Have the HD650 as well, really a benchmark headphone. Have had excellent speakers my whole adult life, too. And am a musician. I know what music sounds like live.

I approached earbuds and iPhone lossy digital music with trepidation. My initial experiences were not encouraging, iPhone 3 era.

But now, fast-forward to 2013 and, I'm sold. Have Sennheiser's near-top IEMs, and they are fabulous. Started appreciating IEMs with Shure's E2s, which seemed the right price for iTunes music years ago. What they lacked in both the basses and highs, the sense of air you get with great headphones, they more than made up for in mid-range clarity and presence. Excellent for casual listening in an environment where I'm doing something else along with listening to music (which I rarely do, preferring complete focus).

I listen to everything, classical extensively, rap and electronic dance, country, music from around the world, you name it. I'm listening to Daft Punk's latest as I type this.

The SE315s are, well, just perfect. Not only is there a presence to the sound, the bass is TIGHT, which matters way more to me than sheer thump and volume. The transients, which are what I love hearing clearly the most, because they're where the life of a musical sound lives, are precise, and energetic, and free of distortion. This is what gives the SE315s that sense of being able to reveal things you haven't heard before.

No disrespect to the Sennheiser IEMs; they are very neutral as well, and I love 'em, but they're not as rugged as these, so I save them for special listening sessions.

At less than half the price of those, these are perfect all-rounders. I'm not sure I'd use them to master an album, but maybe that's just pretense on my part; the more I listen, the more I'm amazed.

The sign of a good IEM, and not just because of the isolation, is that you can turn the music DOWN and still hear everything.

In my experience, only these and the IE8s have accomplished this for earbuds. The top of the line Etymotics, as well.

But the SE315s are what I'll take with me everywhere. I look forward to many years of pleasure and reliability from them."
258,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd buy these again. They're the only ones that allow me to push my wheelchair and stay in my ears without me having to mess with them every few minutes. I love the huge array of earbud covers they give you, and they come in a very cool zippered case that I'm still using today. The sound quality is superb. I just can't go back to buying crappy earbuds."
259,4.0 out of 5 stars,A little awkward to get around the ears at first but you'll get the hang of it quickly. Great selection of buds so you'll have no problem getting a great fit for fairly high end sound. Some of the CD s on my new iPod are over 27 yrs old. Hear things I never knew were there. I consider somewhat of an audiophile so I have very high expectations. But they are worth the price.
260,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had a a pair of Shure E4c for a long time that I have been very happy with, especially when travelling. These beat them with a good margin. Same good sound insulation but with much better sound. Somewhat surprised by the big difference between them.

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First things first $1000 for a pair of iems or “earbuds” is insane beyond belief…. people will look at you like you have five heads so I don’t advertise the cost of these ever. Is it worth it though? Let’s get to that.

Accessories:
I am not going to spend much time going over this as the accessories are listed here in detail on amazon and on shure’s site. To put it simply there is everything you need. You get a bunch of ear tips, a case to carry the headphones, adapters, two different length cables, case to carry all the accessories etc. There is nothing else you need to buy, the cables are fantastic, there is no aftermarket cable needed. I didn’t need comply foam tips, there are lots of tips included here.

Design/build quality:
Build quality is rock solid. Much, much better than the 535. There is no weak part to the iems. The iems fit over your ear with memory wire. I have oddly shaped ears and typically have trouble with over ear iems however these fit perfectly. I was able to get a tight seal with the middle size included rubber tip and the sound isolation is unreal. There is no disruption from outside noise at all and with music playing I can’t hear anything. I have never seen isolation this good, just make sure you get a tight fit.

One thing very important to point out is the nozel inserts. These iems come with three nozel inserts, bright (slightly geared toward higher frequencies), neutral (balanced), warm (slightly geared toward lower frequencies). When I got these I immediately changed them to the warm inserts based on reviews. It wasn’t very difficult to change them but definitely take your time and have an open work space. Shure’s directions are very detailed.

Comfort: These are very comfortable and stay put in your ears. By comfort I don’t mean like pillows for your ears or forget you’re wear them sort of comfort but there is no pain or discomfort caused by them. I have worn them for hours with no issues.

These do NOT need an amp. To be clear with a 9 ohm impedance (the lowest I’ve ever seen) you will likely damage your ears, your amp, and these iems trying to use an amp. Using an ipod, phone, or anything with a quality internal dac is all you need. The incredibly low impedance is the result of essentially a built in amplifier which pushes the 4 drivers incredibly well.

Sound quality:
Unreal, magical, pure bliss. To give a little background I am a studio headphones nut. I don’t claim to be an audiophile because there are people far more qualified to use that term than I am but I am an audio enthusiast and I have, for a very long time, loved headphones. My go to line of headphones is Sennhiesers HD line (600/650/700/800). These headphones have massive drivers, require a quality amp/dac setup/aftermarket cable, and are not portable but to me it is worth it for the unbelievable sound and soundstage they put out. I have never been a huge fan of iems or earbuds aside from convenience because they will never deliver the wide-open soundstage, layering, or detail that a pair of studio headphones will…. until now.
The soundstage and layering of these iems is unbelievable. If you could not feel them in your ears you’d swear you had an open back pair of over ear headphones on. The spatial soundstage here is unreal. There isn’t a word to describe how large and spacious it is. There is so much open airiness to these and again the layering and separation, dreamlike. They are incredibly balanced, crystal clear treble, perfectly present mids and the bass. I am not a fan of bass heavy anything, the bass should be replicated naturally and not give you a headache. The bass here is deep, very detailed, and punches deeply when the song calls for it. Warm, beautiful, open. Not a detail is missed, nothing is rolled off, nothing is overemphasized. Even at low volumes these things project an insane amount. Unreal.

The sound quality here is honestly like a 15/10. This may just be the first flawless sounding headphone I’ve ever heard.

So is it worth the money? Well IMO it is well worth it if you love your music and are thoroughly dedicated about your headphones. It is a lot of money to spend and I heavily questioned buying these for awhile before I took the plunge and continued to question while I waited for them to come however I can safely say I have no regrets. They’re incredibly portable and more than driven by your portable device. No pair of headphones is worth going broke over but if you have the money I can’t imagine anyone not being thrilled with these.

Hope this has helped anyone deciding on whether or not to buy these. Cheers."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Aside from a few exceptions, this is the pinnacle of IEMs guys. This is it. It comes at an astronomical price that might even make you pass out at just one look, but sometimes if you want the best, you do whatever it takes to get it. Also, I got these in early June of this year, so I've had about 6 months to form my opinions.

I got the box from the mail and I didn't even realize that it was my earphones. I opened the cardboard box to see the initial packaging. It is the biggest box I have ever seen for earphones. I opened it and saw the clear pelican case. I opened that and found a micro-fiber cleaning cloth on top of the earphones and the smaller case they come with. Many of the accessories are in the case such as the ear tips, extra cable, airplane adaptor, quarter inch adapter, and tuning filters.

I ordered the Black color and I'm so glad I did because they look ""all business"". Right off the bat, I pick them up and I can immediately tell that these are no joke. The cable is thick with really good strain reliefs on the y-split and on the jack. The metal nozzle on the housing leaves me feeling a little better about long term durability. The comfort of these is really good. I use the yellow foam sleeves and have had no issues with fit, sound, or comfort. From walking to class to class, to when I'm at home, to being in any loud environment, these things block out so much noise.

The sound of these is expected when paying $1000. After paying that much, expectations are near impossible to exceed. Did it exceed my expectations? No. Did it reach my expectations? Yes it did in a big way. Before I start, I want to say that I am listening to ALAC files and Spotify 320 kb/s and listening through the Oppo HA-2SE. Also my opinions are based off the white filters because they sound the best to me. The bass is tight, punchy, and it has ""true subwoofer performance"". It's actually my favorite part about this earphone. I can hear every nuance and every detail in every bass note. I can't say that with anything else I've listened to. The mid-bass doesn't interfere with the midrange with the help of the Low-Pass filter. The midrange is forward compared to the bass and treble. Listening to Pop, Country, Alternative, and some Rock is a pleasure to listen to. The treble is my least favorite part of the sound. It's detailed and it's clear, but it doesn't extend high enough for my liking. It's not a bad treble response, it's just not what I prefer. Some enjoy this, but when I'm listening to Classical, Soundtrack, and some Rock music, I want a treble that has more of a presence to increase the soundstage. One aspect that stands out in the sound of this earphone is the vocals. They are the best I've heard bar none. Male and female vocals are well presented. They are natural, full, and clean all at the same time. I bet there are a few other earphones that sound better than this, but the combination of the sub-bass, midrange, and vocals is downright addicting to listen to.

This and the Sennheiser IE800 are often compared to each other, but in reality, they are more different than they are alike. They are so different it's hilarious that these are even being compared against each other. They are aimed for different types of buyers. I'll make my recommendations here. If you are active and listen to music mainly on the go, then SE846. If you listen to music more at home or in bed, then IE800. If you listen to Pop, Electronic, Hip-Hop/Rap, Country, and/or Alternative music, then SE846. If you listen to Classical, Singer/Songwriter, Soundtrack, R&B/Soul, and/or Rock, then IE800. Overall, if you listen to any genre and all you care about is sound in an earphone, then IE800. If you want a earphone that comes with everything and has little flaws, then SE846.

If you want the best overall experience for a universal earphone in this price range, this is probably the best you can do. It has a nice presentation, stellar build quality, top tier sound, and accessories to go along with all this. If you're thinking about getting these, take a while to think about it. You're spending $1000 on earphones. You have to be completely insane to spend this much on an earphone. Spend time to decide and whatever you decide to do, enjoy your music and live your life to the absolute fullest."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having owned the range of Shure's previous IEMs, I was thrilled when the SE-846 was released back in 2013. I bought them as soon as they were released and have been listening to them ever since. I travel internationally at least 6 months out of the year and work on oil rigs. When I say that these headphones are durable, I believe that to be a qualified statement. The sound quality: they are better than anything else Shure makes or AKG or Westone or UE. Compared to my SE-535s these are in a whole different realm of sound quality. I've not listened to any other headphone (including open back electrostats) that more faithfully reproduces the nuances of an upright bass played as part of a jazz trio. Fat, throat-vibrating bass while not sounding boomy or overly presented. On some Charlie Haden tracks, you can hear the texture of his fingers on the strings. Detailed playback? Yeah the 846s have it. These headphones, much like the SE-535s, have excellent dimensionality. You quickly forget your wearing something in your ears. The sound stage is wide and not at all muddied. Good live recordings sound like your right there. Check out Stacey Kent's Dreamer in Concert album for a good demonstration of this. You'll best appreciate this when listening to FLAC files but even 320kb/s sounds good.
Bottom line: If you want the best portable audio setup for under $3,000 start off with buying the SE846 IEMs. Buy right once, cry once. I mostly use Apple iPhone or MacBooks to listen. I used to carry a standalone DAC/amp combo but I don't even bother anymore. The headphones powered by the iPhone 6+ and now 7+ (via adapter) are plenty good enough to still sound better than anything else I've tried and I try out a LOT of headphones."
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Settle in with some coffee or tea cause this is going to be a long one...

;-)

Shure IEM's have been my mainstay daily listening choice for quite a few years now. I bought my first pair of Shure IEM's back in 2007, a pair of E4C's that I (amazingly) found for $100.00 at my local circuit city.

From the get go, the Shure house tendency towards neutrality and not over emphasizing any particular frequency really sat well with both my inner music producer, as well as my inner listener. I'm not a fan of exaggerated or unnaturally affected music in regards to any frequency range, really and if given my druthers, I would always have gear that tends towards neutral but that still responds well should I decide to use equalization.

Therefore, at least in regards to IEM's, I've always stuck with the Shure brand as the engineers (and ears) there, those behind the design process of their headphones, IEM's and even their microphones (I own several), seem most concerned with a natural, mostly unaffected presentation.

From the E4C's, I rather quickly moved on to the SE500's, then the SE530's and then the SE535's. I've enjoyed them all immensely and for mostly the same consistent reasons: solid performance, nothing exaggerated, clean detailed presentation and excellent build quality (not to mention their excellent service department).

Here come the SE846
---------------------------------------------------

And so when the SE846 was released, especially with the accompanying “hoopla” around the considerable amount of new technology that went in to the production of the IEM (in-house engineered balanced armature drivers, a miniature ported sub woofer of sorts with 4 inches of acoustic pathway, etc.) … admittedly, I was over the moon and just hell bent on the need to try them.

But when I saw the price of $1000.00, I realized this was an item that most likely would not end up as part of my regular, daily arsenal. And, for all intents and purposes, it has not. Something about spending $1000.00 on an IEM just throws some internal checks and balances that have simply not allowed me to actually try (or buy) a set.

But lately, I was lucky enough to get to spend a couple weeks with a brand new pair of SE846 IEM's and as a long time and quite devout user of the various 500 series IEM's, I figured I'd take a moment to write a bit about my experience with them.

Solid
----------------------------------------------

When listening to non-equalized music, The SE535's have always been just a tad to much on the “flat” side of things, a bit too “middle of the road,” a bit to “straight-laced.” This is fantastic from a music production point of view as it allows me to hear music for what it is and without any affectations brought on by the IEM itself (should I care to have a “clinical” listen to any given sort of music). But in daily use, I have always insisted on using equalization to bring the default, somewhat subdued presentation of the SE535 more in to focus in regards to what I enjoy insofar as recreational music listening is concerned. It's true as well, as you've most likely read or heard, the SE535 has fairly rolled off, stunted highs that I can only imagine were decided upon to make the IEM most palatable with the most sorts/genres of music. But in the final analysis, I enjoy a bit more sparkle than the SE535's naturally provide and too, I like a bit more sub bass and bass presence in general. Therefore, I've always used equalization with them. Currently, I use a Cowon J3 with it's formidable Jetaudio EQ to fine tune the SE535's and prior to the Cowon, a Teclast S:flo 2 with an Arrow amp's bass/treble boost.

And so the primary difference I would note between the SE535 and the SE846 is that the SE846 requires NO equalization to sound “right” to my ear. In fact, at all default/non-EQ'd settings, the SE846 sounds about like my SE535's with equalization applied. And yet, for various other reasons discussed below, the SE846 still sounds markedly more impressive for several other reasons.

SE535 vs SE846 … a general breakdown
---------------------------------------------------

The SE535's, in general, sound a bit more “flat line” or “homogenized” than do the SE846's. I think this has everything to do with the rather dramatically better instrument isolation/separation that the four drivers of the SE846 provide. The two IEM's are without a doubt from the same basic tuning camp, they are both somewhat neutral and neither overly accentuate any given frequency; with the SE846, I never found myself thinking, “wow, those highs are too bright,” or … “that bass is totally unnatural (think Bose)” … but Shure really took things to the next level with the SE846's and they are a fantastic successor to the ubiquitous SE535 if only for the fact that they solve two of the most obvious issues with the SE535 (to my ear, mind you): first, the rolled off highs and second, the lack of a visceral sub bass.

I just wish they'd have released them at a closer price point to the SE535's instead of basically doubling the price, but that's just my limited income and other interests (that require my money) talking. :-)

But it's true. Take every criticism you've heard regarding the SE500 series IEM's and just imagine them all rectified. That's what the SE846 brings to the table. It's not just the superior bass performance of the SE846 (which is significant), it's the high frequency presence, the sound staging, the instrument separation and micro detail retrieval, it's everything really. The improvement over the SE535, really is that significant of a thing. I have listened to the various 500 series Shure IEM's nearly every single day for 4 to 6 hours a day and for the past six years; I am intimately acquainted with them and the above comments are made with a good deal of confidence. The SE846 is a real evolutionary step away from the Shure SE535's.

But as mentioned, they definitely hail from the same sonic camp...

The one area I think the two IEM's are most similar is in regard to mid range frequencies. Upon first listening to the SE846, I was very happy to hear that Shure decided to stay with the (my opinion) utterly brilliant, somewhat forward and very present take on mid range that just about all of their headphones/IEM's are known for. I like my bass and I like my highs but I think somebody once said that the music is in the mid range and I for one, would tend to agree. The SE846 mid range is nearly indistinguishable from the SE535 mid range, if not just a tad more refined around the edges. Couldn't be more happy about that and the huge improvements in overall frequency retrieval and separation make the SE846 almost a perfect headphone for me.

Lows
---------------------------------------------------

And as most every review will mention, the bass performance of the SE846 is rather astonishing. However the Shure design team came up with that ingenious (and gorgeous) sub woofer-like “porting” system, whereby they give the bass frequencies, literally, four inches of metallic path to trace before exiting the tiny IEM's sound tubes, is beyond me but I can say they've worked a minor miracle with it as the bass performance is the best I've heard from any IEM.

It is not an overwhelming, huge, constantly present bass like one might hear in some of the “bass head” cans out there on the market; unless the particular track calls for it, you will never even know such potential is dormant there, but should any given track need it? The bass comes and it comes in just that amount that the track/recording calls for and is always in perfect relation to the high frequencies and the mid range frequencies. That last bit is perhaps the most astonishing facet of the SE846, the fact that at any volume, from the subtlest of settings to the loudest, the SE846 remains absolutely well behaved, with everything in it's place. The bass never bleeds into or drowns out the highs/mids and the mids, though generally always the backbone of the Shure IEM sound (any of them), never dominate in a way that seems outside the requirement of the given track/recording. I sat one day for over an hour just turning the volume way down and way up, marveling at how in the world they kept the relationship between highs/mids/lows so consistently perfect no matter how loud or soft the volume became, truly a feat.

But the bass is ridiculously good and miles beyond anything the SE535 is capable of. I consistently use equalization to give my SE535's just that little bit of extra something at both ends of the frequency spectrum as they are just so “flat line” that at times I find them to be a bit boring … not so with the SE846, though. Straight out of the Ibasso DX90, with no equalization, the SE846 are pretty much perfect sounding to this guys ear and I had no need or desire to equalize them in the slightest.

Highs
---------------------------------------------------

Another quality often discussed regarding the SE535 is the obviously rolled off high frequencies. I don't think it is debatable at this point, either for reasons of sounding the best with the most types of music or otherwise attempting to make them non-fatiguing, the SE535's are designed with a rather pronounced “roll-off” of the upper high frequencies. This isn't altogether bad as they can be easily massaged with a decent equalizer if one prefers more sparkle (I do); should one have a player with a decent equalizer (think Cowon J3) then that can be remedied; or worse case scenario? Should one be stuck with an exceptional player that has a pretty bad equalizer (think Ibasso DX90), then it can become vexing.

But again, as a person who has lived with the SE535's for many, many years and many thousands of listening hours, I can happily say that the SE846's are much more resolving and have far more sparkly, ­more detailed high frequencies. Everything about the high frequencies is more resolving and more detailed.

I would put a section here discussing the mid range but suffice it to say, the SE846 come with the same, rather pronounced and “confident” mid range presentation that the SE535's and most other Shure headphones count as hallmark. I for one was very pleased to hear this as I'm a big fan of a leading mid range and nothing else can really be said about it other than the fact that the SE846 presents that same mid range in an even more detailed, articulate manner (most likely having everything to do with more drivers).

Otherwise?
---------------------------------------------------

Sound staging is a bit more out of the head than the SE535's … the increased number of drivers and perhaps the design of the housings, give one the impression of the music coming from a slightly greater distance (in a pleasant way).

The SE846 is a noticeably more detailed/resolving IEM than the SE535, presenting music with a much greater, more discreet separation among the various instruments in any given bit of music; this is not a subtle thing, either. There is more “silence” between the various players and overall, one finds one's self more intimately experiencing the sonic landscape. An interesting thing is that as I would switch from the SE846 back to the SE535, I had a very intense and nagging desire to keep turning the SE535's volume up, thinking that if I did so, I would be able to hear the same sort of details I was getting via the SE846; but increasing the volume thru the SE535 just didn't assuage that nagging itch; in the end, I realized it was simply a matter of the SE846 being a much more resolving listen and there was no issue or discrepancy with the volume setting when switching between the two IEM's. Apparently, the number of drivers and overall design differences inherent to the SE846, really do make a very positive difference.

-- Using the Shure “black olives” the noise isolation was identical between the two IEM's (and quite remarkable, as always with that particular tip).

-- The fit of the SE846 was approximate with that of the SE535's, even though the SE846 is without a doubt a bit larger of an IEM; still, I had no issue with the fit (my ears are what you might call “medium” sized).

-- The build quality of the SE846 is something out of an Engineering or Industrial Design periodical, I mean it's a freakishly gorgeous bit of gear to look at with a magnifying glass. :-) … the cables are ridiculously tough and well put together (microphonic free, BTW) and overall the entire package screams quality.

-- I did not experiment with the various nozzles that reportedly can be used to change the sound; I found the default, “neutral” setup to be so perfect that I didn't have any desire to try the other options and so I can't speak towards that.

-- I did not test the SE846 with any sort of amplifier; they sounded brilliant straight from my Cowon J3 and even better, straight out of the Ibasso DX90.

Why I won't be keeping this $1000.00 pair of IEMs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First and foremost, I simply cannot drop a grand on a bit of gear that only has a 2 year warranty.

Despite my appreciation of Shure Inc. … their microphones and headphones alike, both of which I have used extensively over the past two decades … I still feel that such a device as the SE846's should come with a warranty that more syncs with the rather heady price tag. Again, I have nothing but love for Shure and their business methodology; for chrissake, they sent me a completely free pair of brand new SE530's once ... simply because I wrote an honest letter to their service department, but that's another thread …

But the fact remains, a 2 year warranty is basically the same as Shure saying, “Hey .. we think that these might very well fail after about two years of regular use and if so, your either going to have to buy a new pair or pay for repairs.” And, for a $1000.00 pair of inner ear monitors, this is simply unacceptable for me as a consumer. I'll just EQ my SE535's, thank you very much. ;-)

Something I didn't write anything about in the above little essay is that throughout my listening session, I was also swapping in a set of Koss Portapros for even further comparison and I have to say, they are damn near the sonic equal of the SE846's; and, to my ear, a decent bit more exciting of a listen than the non-equalized SE535's. Very similar bass/high freq performance as the SE846's but without the lovely isolation of the latter, and of course not nearly as discreet/portable. And if folks feel that paying $1000 bucks for the 846's is better than $40 bucks for the Koss Portapros or even $500 bucks for the SE535's (both of which I consider fair) … then more power to them. Technically and to make sure the above comparison is understood, the Koss Portapros are not nearly as detailed as the SE846; further, the highs and lows of the Koss' are tipped just so much more towards the “unnatural” … but they are coming close to the sonic performance of the SE846 and so at $40.00 and change, and with a lifetime warranty? It makes dropping a grand on the SE846's sort of hard to justify (even though I still want them real bad) … ;-)

But again, can't say it enough … the Portapros, even at a mere $40 bucks, still have a life time warranty (which I've used more than once). Hell, even the $1000 dollar Koss ESP-950 kit comes with a life time warranty, which I've also used on more than one occasion.

Ultimately?

Shure has done a genuinely remarkable thing with the design/engineering behind the SE846 and I certainly feel the price is okay for such work and especially the resulting performance; if you have the coin to spare and want pretty much the best sonics one can find today in the market of universal fit IEM's? Then buy the Shure SE846 immediately and feel good about buying them. I certainly would if I could and I might still, anyway ... if I can just find somebody who might want to buy one of my kids (just kidding, I don't have any kids but selling one still comes to mind and as I try and juggle responsibilities in an attempt to justify buying the SE846's for real)

If the SE846 IEM's had a life time warranty? I would buy them happily, immediately and without hesitation. Hell, even if the warranty was five years instead of two, I'd still buy them. Shiza! Just look at Blendteq blenders! They build a remarkable product as well (Blendteq is like the Shure SE846 of blenders!) and they back it with a very respectable 8 year warranty and those only cost about $500.00 bucks! But I digress ..

Much of this last bit of playful vitriol is just my annoyance at not allowing myself to keep the SE846's (really, I'm bugged to hell). It's been a couple weeks since I returned them to Amazon and every time I put my SE535's in, I'm immediately reminded of how superior of an IEM the SE846's are.

The pain is real...

Further, the sonic differences between the SE535 and the SE846, though quite significant, simply do not warrant a $1000.00 upgrade when considering my other interests that require financing and my relative income level as well. I really enjoy the SE535's and combined with a clean, capable EQ, they can be made to quite nearly approximate the general frequency performance of the SE846, though the better separation among frequencies and the better isolation of individual players that are hallmarks of the SE846 sound, simply cannot be matched by the SE535 with any sort of hardware or software equalization; it is a simple matter of better physical engineering and design (great job, Shure!!).

So yes. I will pine for the SE846's for some time and yes, I sorely wish that Shure had released them closer to the price point of the SE535's or even so, a much better warranty term when priced at their current $1000.00.

But at the same time I'm hugely pleased with Shure's innovation and the quality of the product that they chose to make and introduce to the audio market, both for those of us making the music and for those of us who listen.

Keep up the great work, Shure. I remain a fan....

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best earphones for $1000, probably better than other IEMs above $1000.00. I've been using it for 11 months now, dropped it twice, and it's still working. This doesn't deserve below 5 stars, as others reviewed it. In fact, it deserved more than 5 stars.

I also replaced the cables with my Shure SRH1540 cables (yes, it's compatible), because I love black, and to give emphasis on the transparent IEMs. I also tried 2 different filters, and now I'm using the black one. There should be 3 different filters, but my white filter is missing its partner. I only received 2 blue filters, 2 black filters, and 1 white filter. I think they missed to include it in the package. Anyway, I didn't complain about it. I just love the black filters and the blue one, even though I haven't tried the white one.

I connected it to my PS4 via Soundblaster E5 using an Optical Cable, and it sounded majestic. I felt like I'm inside the game while playing Uncharted 4. The bass is incredibly awesome! You'll feel it like your heart beats bass. There's nothing more I can say with the SE846. I'm just impressed. Really impressed.

I also tried the various eartips included in the package, and I just love the long white one, the one they call ""Triple Flange Sleeves"". This doesn't give you the best sound isolation (The default one does) but this eartips will make you listen to your music in your head, not in your ears. It's like the band is singing inside your brain, while you listen to your favorite band. Or the movie is inside your head, if you're watching your favorite movie with the SE846. The feeling is immersive, like VR."
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't usually gush over a product I review. I'm usually fairly picky and can find at least a few issues that would need improving. Not this time!
These IEMs score top marks in every category for me:

Pros:

1) Sound isolation with Shure's foam tips is almost exactly like that of the Etymotic ER4S - the best I've ever heard in terms of NRR.
2) Excellent frequency response, which doesn't neglect the treble or the sub-bass. The low-frequencies sound as good, or better than that of dynamic drivers like the Sennheiser IE 800. This is very impressive for balanced armature drivers.
3) They sound crystal clear - clarity and articulation across the whole frequency range.
4) Given their bulk and weight, they're surprisingly comfortable - certainly the most comfortable IEMs I've ever used. You could easily sleep with them on.
5) They come with three sets of filters to fine-tune the FR to fit your own personal preference (black = warm, blue = neutral, white = bright).
6) They have thin posts, which allow a big choice of aftermarket tips, should you want to experiment. However, the Shure foams are the best tips I've ever used on an IEM. (I've used these for years with many other Shure and non-Shure IEMs.)
7) The posts are made of metal, and they need to be, because those Shure foam tips do not want to come off those posts! (I'd previously had bad experiences with plastic posts snapping on other Shure model IEMs.)

Cons:

I really can't think of any. Price is the only thing that might leave me hesitant to recommend them to everybody. For those that aren't as serious about audio, the Monster Turbine Pro Copper comes very close in terms of sound signature and articulation, but doesn't have the comfort or isolation of the 846. (However, you can now pick up a pair of Coppers for about 1/4 of the price of the 846.) I also can't comment on QC, because I've only had one pair. If they break or stop working, I'll post back, but for now, I'm very happy with these.

P.S. One very important comment I forgot to make. These IEMs sound great at any volume level. That's critical, because when you're directing 100% of that acoustic energy at your eardrum, you need to keep that volume low in order to protect your hearing."
6,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these today. Wow. Packaging has been scaled down very much. No longer includes a pelican case. The box is no longer ""rubberized"". Now, it's very ordinary with a foam insert and everything shoved into the earphone case. The out-of-the-box attached wire also has short. When attached to my phone, audio cuts in an out when the plug-in end moves. I tested with my year old wire, and they worked fine. So, also seems quality control has degraded. What a disappointment for $1000 earphones.

The box from the first pair also had a serial no. and manufactured date. This new pair has neither---nothing says ""serial number"" nor a date. Maybe it's coded now. I'm assuming I got a recent one and not a refurb or returned item.

Update:
Just noticed in Amazon's listing it does show that it (still) comes with the clear pelican type case. There's a pic that is subtitle ""comfort""----my packaging did not include this item. My SEs come from UTM Inc. I'll be returning them since they're 1) defective wire and 2) misrepresenting what comes included. Bummer."
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Okay what can I say I had my doubts but wow was I wrong. Hearing these things compared to some of my other set up kind of makes me wonder why I wasted so much money on the others. I don't know the magic shure did but these SE846 were just magical. Everything you want from high end earphone and even high end headphones were in these earphones the soundstage is surprising large when you compare them to other makers. Plus the ability to customize your sound as just frosting on top of the cake. With each filter you could customize them to be what you wanted them to be making them that much more personal to you. Of course try out all the ear tips as you might not like the ones that it came with but I gotta say though the one that they are packed with were really nice. Fit right in but I had to change them out as there were a little bit to big for me. If you are looking for some hifi earphones and are already on the market looking for customs then check these out before you go customs because you might just find out that these are much better for the price.
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now we're talking! Best IEDs to be stuffed in my ears as of yet. I also have the Japanese version of the SE535s and they are way too bright so those will go back, I did not try the regular SE535 which are reportedly much better balanced and you can get filters right from digikey for cheap. I decided to go more than double or nothing and got these instead despite the high price. These things (SE846) have amazing headroom and are very efficient, great bass, not boomy or too exaggerated, detail, clarity, imaging (really called power response officially) as well as high end without any tizz or sibilance, most important is that these have none of the nails on the chalkboard sonics in the upper midrange of far far too many transducers of any kind. I can barely touch the volume on an AudioEngine D1 being fed by a Squeezebox Touch. I was close to getting custom IEDs but decided to give these a good try. I also own an AudioQuest Dragonfly Red. These also sounded great being fed from a Samsung S7E.

To do, I'll try them with my Samsung S8+ and then with the dragonfly on those as well as other sources. I've been listening to these for hours now with no fatigue. You really do not always know right away as any transducer with higher harmonic distortion will sound more alive with more detail in A/B comparison but after some time will cause anxiety and irritation since what you thought was more detail is actually information that was never in the recording to begin with, nope it's distortion! 3rd harmonics being the most irritating."
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile. I don't know how to appreciate every nuance of a given piece. After listening for a week I can say I have developed an appreciation for what audiophiles talk about. How can you not with these beauties?? After switch through the different ear tips, you'll find one that fits you best. They're comfortable and do an excellent job of isolating you from the environment. Not so much that you can't hear someone trying to talk to one, but once the music turns on you're in another world!

As a drummer (mediocre) these IEMs have saved my ears. I usually play listening to music off of my phone with some cheaper Bose ear phones but after any 10 min session my ears would be ringing. At baseline I have tinnitus, thank you very much Alice In Chains concert in 2007, so these provide me with incredible sound with no further damage to my ears. Honestly, that is priceless. So if you're a drummer like me looking for superb audio and ear protection, these are for you.

A great tip I read is checking out CDs from local libraries and ripping the files to your computer in FLAC or WAV formats, providing you with lossless audio quality, fit for these IEMs. Also, if you have Spotify, google how to use the Spotify Web Player (NOT APP!!!) that is available through Google Chrome only. This provides INCREDIBLE hifi streaming capabilities far superior to that of the Desktop app. You will need to be a premium member, but odds are if you have money for these, you'll have money to support their use.

So just like that, I've been converted into an audiophile, or at least a noob audiophile. I love these!"
10,5.0 out of 5 stars,"846 (stock blue/white tubes) vs W60 vs M-Audio IE40 (a tweaked and rebadged UE TripleFi)

I bought a W60. Its faceplate cracked in two days. I sent it back and got an 846. It's a happy accident that the W60 broke. I like the 846 much better. I was lucky enough to try both, so I thought I'd try to compare them. So here's what I thought:

Soundstage:
W60 - OK width. Not very deep. The vocalist sometimes felt too close, sort of vaguely placed. I couldn't quite pin down the instruments in space. It didn't feel like there was a band in the room. But very airy. Good instrument separation.
846 - Wider and deeper. More natural consistent instrument placement, like they were in the room. Excellent instrument separation.

Percussion:
W60 - Cymbals are clear and shimmering and distinct, not harsh. So detailed I swear I could hear the individual thingies in a tambourine, the texture of the skin on the drum. Awesome for piano (which is a percussive instrument, I think?). I never cared for Elton John before, but on these his piano playing sounds awesome, wrenching. Good crisp bass drum.
846 - with stock blue tips: Cymbals are kind of a splat. It's not unpleasant, but in comparison... The high end rolls off so much you don't get the details. Lower pitched percussion - blocks, hand claps - are handled beautifully. Drums aren't bad, but they're better on the W60. Piano isn't riveting.
846 - with white tips: much, much better than blue tips for percussion.

Vocals:
W60 - I wasn't impressed. I thought these were supposed to be good for female voices, but kd lang sounded blah. Not much of an improvement over my triplefi's. Some women sounded great - Shirley Caesar, Patty Loveless - just not as many as I would have expected. Men not as good. Chanticleer doing renaissance a capella was blah.
846 blue tips - Spectacular. Warm, detailed, realistic. Good separation, placement. Great on harmonies. I think Shure tunes for vocals - their warm signature sound.
846 white tips - You sacrifice a little bit of warmth for tons more detail. I strongly prefer it.

Guitar:
W60 - Not much of an improvement over the triplefis.
846 blue tips- Rich, detailed, warm. Noticeable improvement.
846 white tips - Even more detail.

Bass:
W60 - Better detail
846 blue tips - Goes lower, more ummph when needed, murkier
846 white tips - Same, just eq'd down a little bit.

Synths:
W60 - meh
846 blue tips - much better, more alive, good 3D effect
846 white tips - even better. More detail

Brass:
W60 - sax sounded great
846 blue tips - horns sounded great
846 white tips - now sax sounds amazing

Styles of music that I think would work best:
W60 - piano, orchestral, orchestrated pop, jazz
846 - rock (prog rock, neo-psychedelic, country rock...), synths, country, bluegrass (banjo is probably better on the W60s), dance music, gospel

Improvement over my old triplefi's (an old $400 three BA iem)
W60 - I heard new details in surprisingly few songs. Hugely disappointed at how flat Pink Floyd and the Dandy Warhols sounded. So little of my favorite music sounded better I wasn't sure the improvement was worth the $600. (If I preferred piano music, it would be different.)
846 - Lots of new detail across genres. Finally figured out what some lyrics were! (Very clear vocals) So much more detail it was definitely worth the upgrade.

Comfort/build:
W60 - Very small, light, and comfortable. Better for small ears. Will the all-plastic build last over time?
846 - Fits me comfortably, but I'm 6'2"". Sturdy. Metal nozzle. I like it fine.

Edit: I switched to white tips. What a HUGE improvement - for my tastes. Big improvement of instrument detail and separation - which is my favorite thing. A little less bass, a little less warmth, but worth the trade-off... for me."
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm happy with the shure se846 amazing sound
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had these for over a year now and love them so much I had to post. This is my third pair of high end Shure Earphones in the last few years, one pair of the Shure SE530 the original model but they wore out because cord became frayed and could not be replaced. I replaced them with a pair of Shure SE535 two years ago and then these Shure SE846. The SE535 were shockingly expensive and I still can't believe I spent a ""Grand"" buying them on Amazon, so I had high expectations after all the posted positive reviews. Are they worth twice the price of the already expensive SE530 $500 price? Hard to say, but they are CLEARLY BETTER!!. Now I can't listen to the barely used SE535 because these have ruined my listening expectation. If you have near perfect hearing and can tolerate an in ear headphone, definitely get these."
13,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not a pleasant shopping experience. The earphones sent to me was a Japanese export edition and the included parts are different compared with the US edition. There was no hard plastic case and the whole box is held closed with a small circular scotch tape.

I will be returning this product because it does not match up with the descriptions but I will purchase this earphone some where else"
14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely amazing! Like most people, I was a little hesitant to spend so much on a pair of earphones, but finally gave in and just received my SE846-BLU's yesterday evening. The box and included accessories is first-rate, and includes everything you need to get the earphones a proper fit. I tried the earpieces that came installed, but they were a bit too big for my ears, so I tried the ""Tree looking"" ones. Wow, talk about serious noise isolation.

The bass these deliver is nothing short of phenomenal: deep and clear, but not overpowering. I think the highs are a little laid back, but are much less fatiguing than some of the previous headphones I've tried out. The Mid's and Bass are just unbelievable though; much better than any other headphone or earphone I've heard. It literally sounds like the music is coming from inside my head, and reveals details I never even knew existed on many tracks. Truly an audiophile set of phones, and definitely worth the investment if sound isolation and fantastic music is important to you.

PS: My set came in a sealed box, with all accessories included, and is definitely the brand new US version.

Highly recommended!"
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent the past year looking for a pair of earphones that gave me the full spectrum of sound--hi-fi in miniature size. In the process I found myself becoming more picky, scrutinizing each pair as I found one set that was a little better--only to find them deficient in some way. I really didn't want to spend more than $100, either (cue the dubious laughter). But it seemed I would have to splurge for the perfection I sought. But a grand??? No way, I thought (for the SE846). So I went with the SE535, convinced they would be good enough. And they almost were . . .

The trouble is, the bass of the SE535 earphones is not quite as dramatic or deep as I want. And the treble isn't ""quite there"" (to where I personally would like it) either. There was the additional annoyance that the impedance requirement made them unusable with portable devices without an external amp.

And so . . . With a wave a nausea over spending so much on a pair of earphones, I bought the SE846. If only I had done so in the first place! I literally spent as more on all the pairs I acquired in my pursuit for perfection, anyway!

The bass of the SE846 is so much, I actually find myself backing the EQ off a bit on lowest range (before it was set to max with every other pair I owned, save the Bose QC-20, which are partly responsible for me turning my nose up at the bass of the SE535). The treble hits the mark, albeit the EQ is at max on that range (and I understand the custom filters that come with the SE846 will boost the upper range more, but I'm not tinkering with them for now).

Another significance is that I can actually use these with my phone and tablet! No longer, must I be tethered to a desktop or some kind of amplifier to get hi-fi sound.

So my advice for anyone considering the SE535: don't do it! If you're willing to spend $500, it means, you're not going to settle for less than the best. But you are. Better off getting a cheaper pair of earphones, and not feel bad for getting something ""second best."" And no gaudy (IMO) metal box or model number emblazon on the earphones (I have the blacks) to show off to the world--or scream ""steal me."" Finally . . . I found what I was looking for: SE846."
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let's be realistic, $900 is a ridiculous amount of money for headphones. But think about how much money you may have already spent trying to find the pair that gave the response you were looking for? I've gone through Apple, Beats, Sennheiser and even Shure SE425's. None of which gave the punch I was looking for. Well, maybe the beats, but noise cancelling over the ear headphones create a pressure problem with my ears. I much prefer ear buds or IEM's. And for whatever reason I am high frequency sensitive, I mean I never got checked or anything but I have trouble getting headphones to sound the way I want. That was until I swallowed my pride and coughed up the money for these. Damn. That's all I can say. The sound posts are tunable so I swapped to the ""warm"" filters. And since the posts are removable, they're also metal, so you don't feel like you're going to break them changing the foam ear inserts. Thankfully I was able to return the SE425's to Amazon in exchange for these. I just should have bought them in the first place."
17,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not going to waste a lot of space here. I've had many headphones and earphones over the years, both cheap and expensive. These are the VERY BEST I've ever owned. AMAZING BASS - I mean AMAZING... right out of the box. Don't even need to swap nozzles that come included. If you can swing these, you'll only buy 'em once... no need for anything different, EVER. Heaven."
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, these are very expensive. They aren't for everyone. But if you want the best possible sound in an IEM without going custom, this is your baby. The replaceable filters, the large array of tips, and the bevy of other accessories you get with these are just the cherry on top. Don't bother keeping any kind of bass boost on, because where you're going, you won't need it.

I bought these to upgrade from my Shure se215 (I used Steelseries Siberiav2 for gaming) and these are so much better than either one. The only thing I've ever heard that comes close is my friend's professional mixing audio setup with a high-end mixer/amp and a set of KRK V8s. With these, if you listen to CDs, FLAC, or high quality mp3, you can hear vocalists licking their lips and breathing, and so many little details you missed before. It reminds me of the leap going from cassette to CD. If anything they are a bit bass heavy, but not in a sloppy bad way.

If you're reading this, seriously thinking about pulling the trigger on these, and you can afford them... do it. They are amazing. You only live once!"
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a professional musician, working songwriter and recording studio owner for over 20 years. I was reluctant to spend this much money on IEMs because no matter what the reviews have always said, most IEMS just cant match things like Sennheiser HD800s with pristine AD/DA like I have in my racks in my recording studio. Folks that I really admired told me these would change my mind, so, when I had the funds, I took the plunge. I took the plunge mostly based on the enthusiastic endorsement of a well respected friend and audio engineer (thanks Jeff H.) My friend He worked as a mgt consultant with Shure on the ""consumerization"" of these high end monitoring devices. The verdict: Shock & Awe!!! I am astounded!! I am literally stunned.. I plugged these straight into my iphone and listened to a song I mixed and mastered, meaning I know every instruments, EQ, placement, and panning. I couldn't believe what I heard. I heard incomparable fidelity and life in a way that I have never experienced with any IEM. Mind you, this is all WITHOUT pristine DA and power amp like I have in the recording studio...this amazing sound scape came only from these plugged into my iphone! These are the most astonishing IEMS by far that I have ever experienced. These are not just a little better than the 535's at half the price, these are 10X the fidelity of the 535s. I am stunned, amazed and very, very happy with this purchase. I wish I would have bought these sooner. Shure, Great job!!!! These are amazing and worth every penny!"
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With Comply Foam Isolation tips, these are as good as it gets. Worth EVERY penny of the 99,900 pennies they cost.
You will not be disappointed."
21,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had my doubts about these being better overall than my Sennheiser IE800s, but have been pleasantly surprised. The sound is different, no doubt there, but it's subtle and difficult to describe. I won't be getting rid of my IE800s, just using them less based on mood and situation. The listening ""situation"", by the way, is where the Shures shine: unlike the IE800s, the SE846s stay in my ear perfectly, seem to disappear on my head to the point where I forget I'm wearing them, and the cord is longer resulting in better freedom of movement. When I'm in the mood for the Senn-sound, and I'm sitting relatively motionless at my desk, the IE800s are wonderful. For all other times, these are the best choice. Very grateful to own both though, heh."
22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned Westones and a few Shure SE535s. I currently use Sennheiser HD800 with a tube amp as my Gold Standard. Previous Shures sounded great for vocals but always left something to be wished for - the base, particularly for classical music. Shure SE846 is perfect - clean base highlighting base and tympani with great definition without hammering or clouding the overall sound.

The HD800 Headphones are the go-to device for serious listening. The Shure SE846 is for jogging / moving / on airplane. Having listened to both, I would say they are complementary to each other: HD800 has a great coherent sound with a life-like soundstage. Shure SE846 has a great separation with fast response. I keep finding things I didn't hear before with each set. I would compare the HD800 to a Steinway Concert Grant, and the SE846 to a great Yamaha Jazz Grand. Both are fantastic but with a different color."

However, the build-quality of SE846 is better than K3003 and I expect it to last longer than K3003."
29,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have listened to many earphones, over the ear ""cans"", including Bose Noise Cancelling, and nothing, I mean nothing compares to this experience in good listening. I was happy with them when I first received them, but then I started to look up the interchangeable sleeves, and was curious as to what were the differences. The ones that come with the earphones are a neutral, yet tremendous sounding sleeve, but then I curiously looked at the black sleeves, which were labelled ""warm"". I took about 20 minutes to figure out the way to change them (took my time, since small parts involved and didn't want to break them, or lose anything). I just put them on with the warm ""black sleeves"", and these bad boys came to life so well, that I had to write my review and not miss the opportunity to describe them to others. I am hearing things on live recordings that I never heard before, including a live ""Croz"" show that I bought when I went to the NYC Winery on 1/31/13, and I hear him talking to the crowd, the crowd responses, and the clicking of the silverware on a plate, it is that crisp and clear! The base came to life, and the highs are high, mids just right, and I am only at half volume on my player.

I am actually playing these on an Astell and Kern AK100, modified by Vinnie of Red Wine Audio when I first bought it. I am amazed at the clarity and again this is on a high bit mp3 album, and when I put this on the original flac file studio album, I got shivers down my spine. Sheer enjoyment, and the old ear canals can't stop thanking me enough! Shane Fontanes leads are crisper than ever.....and Marcus Eatons accoustic riffs sweet as candy, Crosby vocals like he was in the room with me, and the base/Drum bottom of the band incredible. WOW!

I am happy that I bought them, and recognize that they are a small fortune, but if you love good music, good sound, and clarity, with a comfort that I have not experienced before in my ears, then these are the earphones for you. I would do this in a heartbeat now, after hearing them, and looking back is 20/20 vision always. But I read review after review, after review, and none said anything bad about these. Nothing bad....excepting for a once off this (comfort) and a once off that (one side fitting different than the other, and the solution was to put the different size tips on). Again once off, kept me digging and every time I did, I was overjoyed to hear more and more great things about them. Nobody on the downside was right about these phones, nobody.

I don't work for Shure, and actually don't like the earlier earphones from them. I have had two pair, and still keep an older pair as a spare. I have owned Ultimate Ears, Bose (still have the noise cancelling for trips), Koss Portaphones (several pair and like these for the beach over the ear), and many many others. Never did I find anything that I liked that was ""totally satisfactory""! Now I did, and Shure outdid itself with the SE846-CL.

One last thing, I didn't listen to these on an Ipod yet, and doubt they will be different, excepting for the fact that with the Astell & Kern AK100, it is an experience in good listenting!

Shure SE846CL = Ear Candy for the Heart and Soul. Hope this helps and start saving, they are worth the spend."
30,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start out with saying that I absolutely love the sound of these. Nice bass impact, great mids/highs... I love everything about the sound. I spent about 3 weeks trying to get the perfect fit on these, since they are a fairly large earphone, they take up most/all of the space in your ear ""cavum"".

My comfort problem is that the earphone was actually resting on the outer edge of my ear, no matter how much I would adjust it. My right ear had no issues, but it just was not comfortable in my left ear... I would have pain after about 20 minutes.

So...I would definitely recommend buying these and testing them out. If you can get a comfortable fit, you will love them. As for me, my search continues for a earphone that sounds this good...but is more comfortable."

All I can say is ""wow"". I'm no audiophile but I'm a very auditory person and though I can't find the eloquent words other reviewers used to describe these things, well, WOW. These blow the sure 535's away. And those were very very good.

36,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome product, never heard anything like it! As great as these headphones are , my only complaint is that they keep falling off.

39,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off let me say that when i first tried them on it was very cumbersome to get in and to get a good seal. The stock wires that come with the Shures arent very friendly to the average person whos use to the kind of earbuds that come with the istuff or the cheapys you bought just to work out with or anyone just looking to put them in quick and go. You have to baby them around your ear and then use the wire wrangler to make it snug to your head so they dont hang there and feel like they're about to fall out. Thats if you can put them in your ear in the first place and get a good seal. Before i forget to mention, If you have small ears these might not fit or not go in right so make sure you CAN use these otherwise you will have buyers remorse off the bat.
Your probably wondering why i gave these the full 5 stars if Im dissing these off the bat but as the title says dont assume anything until you see it through.
When I finally got them in good and right the sound from these were sublime and blissful.
You'll hear notes and backing vocals you have never heard before or noticed. The bass is there but not rude and fake like the headphones you see every celebrity and athlete wear. I too got suckered in the hype and bought them. They don't need a lot of power so be carefull not to have the volume up too high before you plug them in otherwise you get a rude awakening.
Just to reiterate you must get a good seal and fit otherwise you wont get the full experience of these babys.
These come with a bunch of tips to get started with to see what works the best. Play around with each type of tip before making judgement on these like i almost did. If you have owned westones in the past or like me replacing them after they broke, you'll be able to use the same tips so you'll have more variety to play with if you still have the westone tips that came with them.
One thing though is that getting the tips off the shures are a chore so be carefull when changing the tips. Especially the foamy ones.
These are a big investment to the normal person so if you can really afford them go for it otherwise you can try the other shures which are still not cheap but compared to these they're doable."

44,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave this product 4 star for now but I think I just received a defected earbud. One of my favorite song, Lizard by Mauro Picotto, the bass punch is non-existent compared to my much cheaper earbuds and sound not better than the earbud that came free with my phone. The earbud is sound flat. The hell is going on? I got all kind of mix feeling but mostly bad as I'm really looking forward to own this earbud. I didn't know I could get a replacement instead of a refund with Amazon as I just learned about it earlier. I just return to UPS and once I get a refund and clear my credit card, I will give it another shot. One other thing, I couldn't change the sleeve that came originally with this earbud. My friend and I tried to change but couldn't. The sleeve just stuck very tight and we couldn't get it out. We don't want to twist and turn too hard that could damage the product but we tried and couldn't change the sleeve. Anyone had this problem, please give me advise on how to do it better next time so I could get a better experience with this earbud in near future. This is not really a review since I don't have much experience with this product yet beside frustrations. Anyone had experience with this product, please feel free to chime in. Thanks in advance!"

46,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing clarity. Even though I had expected excellence, this was well beyond that. The bass was clear, deep and resonant. Outstanding. Well worth the money."
47,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd waited awhile, months, before buying these earbuds. They arrived, and I find that they can bring smiling to one's face while listening, as other reviews have highlighted. Months ago arrived Bose (about $300) noise canceling earbuds, that are easy to carry around, and that are great for planes. But something was lacking in that I found myself not listening to music at the coffee shop, which had been a strong, regular practice with Bose over the ear noise canceling phones. For me these Shure buds maintain losing the bulk and weight of over the ear phones; and, if memory serves also add a deeper delight in the music, so back to the smiling."
48,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best earphones I ever bought
49,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My write up will be split into 2 parts, the first part is meant to give you my high level sincere impression about the SE846 (I will not go into the details, since some other reviews in here are very informative), and, the second part is aimed to give you my personal opinion in terms of the product value for money for generic groups of buyers.

1) This is the message I sent to Shure through their Facebook account:

""First of all, I sincerely thank you and thank your engineers for the Shure SE846 creation... They are a real joy to listen to!!!

Well, a couple of days ago, my colleague brought it to me from the U.S., I am not joking when I am telling you that, when I first listened a couple of my reference tracks; I was smiling with joy (don't recall I ever had such reaction with my other IEMs) while walking... (someone probably thought I was crazy...:-P).

Nevertheless, my pet peeve of this pair of IEM, are the stock cables. I am sure Shure have its reasons for including such cables, but I do not find them too comfortable (rigid). I am wondering whether you can recommend any aftermarket/upgrade cables that goes well with the SE846 sound signature.""

2) The following is my take in giving you my sincere suggestions to those people who are interested in the SE846. After all, they are a pair of expensive Universal In Ear Monitor (UIEM), the perceived value for money for these is really important.

- Non-audio enthusiast with little disposable income - suggest to look elsewhere, these are not worth your hard earned money (to me it's like buying a really expensive bottle of wine, but unfortunately I don't know how to appreciate the taste of it)

- Non-audio enthusiast with moderate disposable income - suggest you to save some more money and start with some cheaper UIEMs (maybe Shure SE535 or Westone 4R) before venturing into high-end UIEMs

- Non-audio enthusiast with a high disposable income - suggest to buy them, even if you might not appreciate them, as much as, the audio enthusiasts. After all, the SE846 is one of the best UIEMs in the market now, and, you can replace the 3 included sets of nozzles to slightly adjust the sound (it is like having 3 slightly different sounds in 1 IEM, every time you replace the nozzles).

- Audio enthusiasts - if you can afford them, they are worth the money. From the first time you slowly unbox the SE846 to the time you check all the included accessories, it oozes quality and luxury (and it is not the best part yet).

The best part is when you start listening to them, going through those reference tracks you always listen to with your other UIEMs (knowing there were some shortcomings or wishing something a little bit more/less, in certain parts of the songs); and finding out that the SE846 can handle your expectations (with the 3 replaceable bright/balanced/warm nozzles).

I hope the above will be helpful to potential buyers. Apologies for the long review, I got carried away :-).

Cheers"
50,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best in ear headphones I've ever used.
51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these with my in-ears monitoring system (also a Shure product) as an upgrade from the SE215 earbuds that came with it. As one would expect upgrading from two to four drivers, the sound quality is drastically improved. I do not need to have the volume up as high in general, but hearing the other vocals above my own voice is considerably clearer, making harmonies much easier as well as singing lead. Instruments are much less muddy sounding, and adding bass to my monitor mix is now possible!"
52,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Although I gave it a four-star rate, these 1000 dollar earphones won't beat your 300 dollar DT990. Keep that in mind.
So then why would I buy them? Well, I personally like listening to pop, rock, these everyday kind of stuff. I don't often listen to test tracks just to test the performance of my headphones/earphones, neither do I listen to classics( guess that's why I'm not a decent Hi-Fier XD). Also I was looking for a pair of earphones I can wear while walking, easy to carry with. I don't want to carry my big headphones dragging those long cords. So what's left for me were earphones. I was looking at K3003, SE846, UE900, IE800,and a pair of aurisonics. I did some research. Looking at others' review may not be the best way to choose your headphones but at least they give you some ideas. According to most reviews, SE846 dedicated to pop music the most. So I chose these. And they do. A lot of high qualified bass, rocks when you listen to rocks. Compared to headphones, mid and high sound a little... not as clear, but still, very good for pop and vocal. Quick response. Those ear tips isolate noise very well. And it was fun playing those different sound filters BTW. Differences are obvious. My advise: If you want ultimate sound experience, go with big headphones; wanna carry it along? Then maybe K3003 and IE800 are more balanced, but these ones are the best for plugging into your phone and listen to billboard. Don't want to spend so much? I personally tried UE900, similar sound character, but cost you much less without too much lost sound quality."
53,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth the price, while quality/price ratio is respectively not high. That is to say, when you spent $500 on an IEM, you get 80% of what you want; when you pay $1000, you get 90%. Definitely not recommended if you think could blow you away."

65,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are AMAZING! I just had to write a review, something I have never done before on amazon, even with over 1000 purchases over the years. I have owned the 530 and 535 since it came out, and I was really hesitant about buying the 846s, especially given the HUGE price jump, more than double the price of their previous flagships! Honestly, I bought it from amazon thinking I will probably return it after doing a brief trial, but I can confidently say that these are definitely worth the money.

Compared to the 535s, there is a definitely noticeable improvement in sound. Sorry for lack of terms - the sound is a lot more ""smooth"", I guess what people refer to the mid range. It is a definite improvement over the 535s (which were already really good compared to a lot of high-end comparable earphones). A really noticeable change is the bass. Used to be really weak in the 530s and 535s. There is a lot more bass with the 846s, I would say the perfect amount..The ""sound stage"" (or so from what I've seen other people mention) is improved a lot more.

I don't really know any of the audiophile terms, I apologize again, but these are are a huge jump from the 535s. I was disappointed going from the 530s to the 535s since the improvement is so minor, the biggest probably shure finally getting rid of its old cable that break so easisly....If you love the 530/535s, you will love these earphones!"
66,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great bass, but the mids and highs are muted and overpowered by the bass; leaving a lot to be be desired in this price range. Compared to my Shure SE535, the bass and mid bass are much stronger and the best I have heard for in the ear earphones. I however prefer the accurate and articulate mid range and treble from the the less expensive SE535 and the Etymotic ER4P models (and over the ear Sony MDR-7506). Vocals via the SE846 are darker and lack necessary timbre and refinement that I am used to hearing both in headphones and from my very accurate Ayon Spirit III tube amplifier with Legacy Victoria LE speakers. After extensive listening and switching back and forth comparing...it was an easy decision for me to return these for a refund. I was also surprised they are made in China which I did not expect. At this price point it would be nice if Shure would make these state side and it would certainly better justify the price and provide more pride of ownership."
67,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned several different Shure IEMs over the years. I'm not a musician or an audiophile, but I like music and I like the way Shure makes it sound. If you can afford it and are willing to spend the money, you will be pleased with these."
68,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best IEM on the market period. I tried the Sennheiser IE800, and Westone W60. Neither comes close in musical reproduction and bass. Their biggest downside is the fit, they are bulky and while when you put them first they feel super comfortable, on extended listening period 1.5-2 hours plus hours your ears are literally in pain. If they fit you. you will never buy another IEM for a very long time! They are amazing to listen to."
69,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bass player large venue contemporary Christian worship band. Amazing low end, can hear perfectly. Worth every penny. Would watch you tube video on maintenance, very helpful"

72,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Kinda the best in universal fit BA earphones less than 1000, but way to much bass than I expected. Losing some original ""SHURE features""."
73,3.0 out of 5 stars,"All of the positive stuff the other reviews are saying about these IEMs is right on. Flat out best I've ever heard by far.
The bass extension and punch are fantastic. Highs and upper mids are a big improvement over stock 535s.
They are a real pleasure to listen to (stock unamped AK120 as source).
Packaging screams ""high end"" and the easy to swap filters is a great feature.

But....
So far I've had two defective pairs, from production batches a month apart. Same defect: an intermittent buzz in the right earphone. I was able to reproduce it by feeding a 250Hz tone while at the same time looping a ReBirth kick drum. It seems like there's some sort of interaction within the earphone that's causing resonance. It's not distortion or other problem with the signal. It's a physical problem.

I called Shure after the first one and they said they never heard of this before, even though there's another review here from a head-fi'er with the same exact problem. To be honest, I'm done with them at least for now. The 2nd pair is in a FedEx drop right now and I don't want to try my (bad) luck a third time."
74,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Professional packing job, heavy duty cases. I did try the different filters and settled on the black(smooth) one. Maybe I'm just spoiled with over the ear cans but these do have lots of detail and they sound a little bass shy, soundstage is good. I used them for my hemodialysis sessions but I've also used the Fostex TH-900 and I love the Fostex. I would use the Shure for traveling use. Don't know if it's worth the thousand bucks."
75,5.0 out of 5 stars,No EarPods are able to do the same!
76,5.0 out of 5 stars,first review ever. I've had the se846 for a year and a half and love them. But not enough to write about cause i never do. I just paired it with the oppo HA-2 and wow. Along with Tidal its just beyond... Better than my 25K home system. Amazing synergy.
77,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth Every Penny!!! The low is awesome, the high is great and the human voice is just like from heaven."
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Rarely does a product receive universal acclaim in the audiophile world. Usually, products that do are so special, so incredibly over-engineered and designed that the price of entry is truly but a dream for the 99.9% of us: D'Agostino Momentum Monoblock amps & preamp ($90,000 for the three), Continuum Audio Labs Caliburn turntable (over $100,000), YG Acoustic Anat II speakers ($110,000 for the pair)...you get the picture. These three products, and a very few more like them, are all unique in that they are without a doubt the best at what they do. They are not perfect (nothing is), but they do such a good job of reproducing sound, of truly making a recording come back to life as music, that they are considered without fault. The Shure SE846 is one such product.

While I do consider myself an audiophile, I am also a realist. I will never be able to afford a system coming close to $100,000, so I became quite a bit of a headphone and earphone fetishist. You see, while audiophile ""reference-systems"" using components similar to the ones mentioned above remain out of reach for many, buying a good set of 'phones, hooking them up to decent amplification and listening to well recorded material will get you 9/10ths of a ""reference-class"" system for a fraction of the price. So, I've amassed quite a collection: various AKG headphones (240 Studios, K551, K701 and K712 Pro) as well as BeyerDynamic's excellent T9 and even Parrot's surprisingly cool Zik. For earphones, I have the B&W C6, Sony's excellent XBA-4 and Shure's E3c and SE535 LTD models. And while it's relatively ""easy"" to make a great sounding set of headphones, earphones present far greater challenges. So, after reading review after review on the stellar SE846, I took the plunge and bought them.

Many earphones (like most headphones) tend to have a certain sound signature, usually described as warm or detailed. But, because there's only so much to tiny drivers/transducers in earphone can do, get the design wrong and that warm earphone becomes muddy, or that detailed earphone becomes harsh and fatiguing. The Shure SE846 gives you everything, more of everything, without ever exhibiting any bad ""behaviors"". Here is the classic ""Shure Sound"": warm, rich and smooth mid-tones, but with added presence at the top end that never overpowers or becomes too ""bright"". Here, cymbals sizzle, bells ring and the sounds decay with delicacy and immediacy, all at once. There's abundant detail, but it never becomes harsh, never presents itself as analytical. You just hear the recording, hear the music, as it was meant to be heard...as if you were in the recording studio with the artist.

The SE846 biggest breakthrough is the first-ever Low-Pas filter that allows for extended bass that truly can be appreciated. Many products look to go low, but end up with distortion or ""muddying"" the rest of the frequencies. Not here. The SE846's have bass that plays with presence and authority, but never over those beautiful mids or sparkling highs. This is bass that sounds honest and true, not bass that slams for simple effect. Additionally, the soundstage produced by the SE846 is the best I've ever experienced from an earphone. Never has an earphone sounded les ""in my head"" as these. Sounds and notes come from where you expect them to be, with sourcing as direct, or as seamless, as the engineer intended. Indeed, this is what strikes me as the most compelling thing about the SE846: everything sounds as it should, nothing seems misplaced or pronounced. The overall sound presentation is just so astonishingly correct.

This being Shure's flagship earphone, you expect build quality and fit-and-finish to be tops and they are. While some may lament the use of (a very high-quality) polycarbonate body, this allows Shure to show off the inner details of the SE846. Every metallic surface inside is satin brushed, with laser-etched logos. The 10 individual layers of metal, laser welded together, that makes up the Low-Pass filter can also easily be seen. As well as all the circuitry, hand wired and soldered. Shure throws in a very complete fit kit, the unique frequency response filters, two Kevlar-reinforced cables, cleaning cloth, airline and in-line attenuation adapters, 2 separate carrying cases...you get it all, really.

All-in, is the Shure SE846 worth $1000.00? For most, probably not. But, when taken in the context of being able to have something that is universally acclaimed as being the best, of performing without fault, it could be looked at as a bargain. Because, if you wanted to get similar performance out of a speaker system, you would need to spend tens of thousands of dollars. And even then, would you be satisfied knowing that somewhere out there, something is better? With the Shure SE846, that ""something better"" hasn't come around...yet."

82,5.0 out of 5 stars,wow
83,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just your average guy that likes the best. I've had a pair of 535's for a few years and now I just purchased this pair of 846's. I can't add to the previous posts but I agree completely. The sounds is fantastic and I'm glad I spent 1K which at the time seemed a little nuts. Thanks Shure, it's a great experience and I spend 100 plus hours in an airplane seat every month, so the more I can relax and disassociate myself, the better."
84,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned and used Shure IEMs for years. I have been waiting to replace my E5c model for many years. I have been keeping an eye on the newest releases and these looked like they would fit the bill perfectly. However, after spending $1000 one would expect something phenomenal. Sadly I was disappointed.

1. Because they have 4 instead of 2 drivers I was expecting cleaner richer audio. I will say that there is a only slight difference in audio quality. They do appear a tad louder but when replacing the nozzle with blue to black, they replicate the audio of my E5s almost identically. Maybe this is ""the law of diminishing returns.""

2. Fit is an issue. Again because they have 4 drivers they are slightly larger and may not fit your ear as well as the 2 driver models. I found them to be uncomfortable after an hour or so. I wear my E5s all day long without issue. I expected spending this much money for these to fit better. I ordered custom molds for the 846 and with the molds the 846 wouldn't fit in my ear. I wish I hadn't ordered the molds for these as now I'm out of pocket for those w/o no use for them. They do not fit any other earphones I own.

3. There is a clicking noise on certain bass tones. It is intermittent but also very annoying. For this much money I expect much better product. I read other reviews before purchase and found this comment, but apparently this issue of clicking is still occurring. I also was hearing occasional interference. For lack of a better description, it sounded like the dead air of an old cassette tape between songs. I believe there was a shielding issue. I contacted Shure Customer Service. Their CS certainly isn't what it used to be. The first person I spoke with was helpful and transferred me to one of their audio engineers. (or at least that was his supposed title) I explained my concerns about the clicking and noise issue. The technician/engineer was rather abrupt and in my opinion rude. He said my E5s were old and that he had no clue how the audio signature would compare, and informed me that all of the 846s are tested before they leave the facility and are guaranteed to work. Well that certainly isn't the case. He informed me I would have to RMA them. I was not about to do this with a brand new product and ultimately end up with a refurbished replacement. Maybe if they were cheap IEMs...but these most certainly were not.

Thankfully I purchased these through Amazon and was able to return them. If you make the decision to spend this much money to replace/upgrade your old Shure IEMs....Test them out thoroughly! Their quality control isn't up to snuff and their support (at least the person I spoke with) was disappointing.

I'll think twice and maybe 3 times before I purchase another Shure product again."
85,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been reading on Amazon and watching Youtube reviews on these IEM's for about 18 months. I've had IEM's from Klipsch, Denon, Sony, Beats, etc. I got a good deal on a pair of Shure SE215's and they've served me very well for the past year or so. I don't consider myself an audiophile, but I love music and I want to hear all of the details from the artists I enjoy.

I had very very high expectations for the 846's coming off of 215's based on the numerous reviews. I'll be honest, I was kinda underwhelmed after the first 20 minute listening session. I plugged them into my iPod classic and listened to various tracks at unknown bitrates. I used the cone sleeves and the neutral filters. But, the more I listened, the better the 846's performed. Once I had time over the weekend to sit in a quiet room, try ALL of the included sleeves and switched from neutral to bright filters, these things really started to live up to the price tag and I started to notice notes and instruments in the sound stage I haven't heard before. Finding the correct fit and seal with the various earbuds is a critical step.

The biggest and most critical adjustment was the source itself. I downloaded various FLAC and Lossless albums and loaded them on my old iPhone 4s. WOW, WOW, WOW. Now, I feel like these 846's are living up to the audio hype praised by so many others. I won't go into trying to articulate what the sounds are and how good they are. Just know that these are absolutely next level. Shure says these have subwoofers and they do. Don't make the mistake of thinking these are boomy, bass-head Beats type earphones. The bass is tight, accurate, and truly integrated into the soundstage. I invite you to listen to Marcus Miller lossless files. You can ""feel"" the bass plucks because of the accuracy. Given that these are $1,000 IEM's, I'll use my still very good 215's for workouts and motorcycle rides and the 846's for listening sessions on long flights and at home when headphones are required. If you want to be immersed in your music at anytime and anywhere, give these SE846's a try. I'm pretty satisfied with this investment."
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had many expensive earphones in the past but they are really the best one till date. Even at this price,they are worth every penny."
87,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I went from SE215 to SE846. The first impression I got was bass was less pronounced and the lower frequency was muddied (very muddied). It felt as a step down to both of my SE215 and Bose QC20. Added the microphonic was way worse than on my SE215.

Problem 1 Microphonic: The reason why I am deducting a star. The cables provided with se846 are hard plastic instead of rubbery like the ones came with SE215. These convey a lot of noise, even rubbing against the shirt. Replacing the cable with the one from 215 solved the issue. Still for a 1000$ IEM this is serious knock even though you can get alternative cables online.

Problem 2 Muddied lower frequency: being closed, shure IEMs always relied a lot on having a perfect seal. I always shoved my SE215 deep(foam) to get best sound. But in case of these having a perfect air tight seal creates a problem due to its bass. The Bass tends to overwhelm the lower frequencies and the whole song feels like it lacks separation. The muddiness goes away when the seal is barely formed by just placing foam on the ear canals rather than completely shoving it in. Given its size this seems its where it wants to be instead of shoving it in and ends up being far more comfortable. This looses the noise isolation to some extent but I am happy with the clarity.
This could just be my ears.Note* I am not an audiophile I prefer clarity and separation over overwhelming bass."
88,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking forward to loving these headphones the moment I read on how great they are. I was looking for well balanced audio in a very small package. I have no problem spending the money as long as I am 100% happy with them. At this cost, there is no room to settle. Fantastic or nothing. A bit about myself first.

I am a self proclaimed audiophile and listen to music day in and day out. I use an iPhone 6 with an external DAC and by mostly all my music from HDTracks and other places. I have nothing less than 24bit/96Khz audio on my phone. I am very serious about music and one of the weird ones that will only listen to music if it is 16bit/44.1Khz or above Anything less is just ""hearing music"". Oh, and if it makes any difference, I am also a Female... HAHAHA. So on to the review.

Here it is short and sweet. For sound, yes they are very good. I would love to see them have a balanced cable added to it or have it as an option FROM SHURE, but that is the less of the evil. In short, my ears are very sensitive and after about an hour or two of wear the IEM it self becomes very uncomfortable resting on the inside of my ear. I found that I had to adjust these phones over and over again through out the day just to have a bit of relieve. If the cord ever gets caught on something...LOOOK OUT! It will hurt like heck if you pull from it or it pull from you.

As far as the Bass everyone talks about, I did noticed there was more bass than the 535s and others I tried, however... go back and listen to the standard Apple Earpods that came with your iPhone at the get go. I think there is just as much bass there as these is in these headphones....

Over all, the quality, accessories, and dynamic range of the headphones are great. If you have sensitive ears... these may not be the best choice for you.

Just my thoughts..."
89,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this expensive earphones but sadly found out that my ear is not good enough to tell the difference from good earphone to bad earphone.
90,4.0 out of 5 stars,Wasn't as comfortable as I needed so had to take off for that.
91,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice
92,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted 6 months until the left ear busted and is buzzing horrendously now. I don't even play these at high volume...haven't heard back from customer service.
93,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchase these headset expecting a miracle, but truth be told my ultimate ears tri-10s are better sounding. So I was disappointed but I already paid for them so I will have to live with them for now. Thank goodness there is nothing wrong with my ultimate ears triple-fi 10's."
94,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I prefer over ear headphones (as you will see from my list below) but the 2 units of IEMs I do have are as good any you are going to hear and I use them all the time as there is only a minor noticeable loss in sound stage and detail from my at home over ear ones.

This review is strictly based on my opinion and tastes in sound and music. I am 53 years old and have lost the ability (happens as you get older) to hear certain hi frequencies, that those of you who are a fair bit younger can still hear and enjoy. The point being that I may not be overly affected by what some describe as high frequency screechiness or sibilance ( I prefer clear detailed highs, mids and lows in their natural form to overpowered low detailed highs and muddy thumping bass).

Tested on iPad, with and without Oppo h2 Dac and Chord Mojo also on AV receiver.
Each unit was left to burn in 24/7 for seven days and listened to before and after. The Fostex, Beyerdynamics, Sennheisers and HIFIMAN became smoother, warmer and IMO more enjoyable after the burn in. The other units mentioned did not seem to change radically or become any more enjoyable.

I have had the following headphones and returned them over the last 4 months ( some tested for 2 weeks, others for almost a month with music from techno, rock, pop and all the way to classical and opera (also used a audio reference cd for more comparisons).

Sennheiser 598( good sound but feel like cheap plastic and ear cups are shallow) - Shure 1540 ( smooth sound, wide soundstage fore closed back and very comfortable sent the back when the Fostex arrived) - Beyerdynamics 990 pro 250 Ohm( most comfortable earpads of all and close in sound to the t90) - master & dynamic M40 ( very nice build and sound, but earpads are to narrow and have a high clamping force) - Blue Lola ( sound ok but heavy and awkward) - Audio Technica M50 and Vmoda 100 ( both ok for the price, just not in the same league as the keepers).

Keepers.
Fostex TH900 ( my favourite of all for sound, looks and comfort)
Hifiman 400i ( wide soundstage, great sound and comfort) - Oppo pm3 ( great all-around sound and comfort also can't get them out of my wife's hands) - Beyerdynamic t90(crisp, clear, detailed and comfortable) - Bowers and Wilkins P7 ( awesome build quality, fantastic sound - a little on the smaller side in earpads).

These 2 have very positive reviews across the web and I really can't add anything significant to what has already been said.

IEMs - Westone W40 - great comfort with a ton of tips to choose from. Sound is clear and detailed and they are so comfortable that you forget they are in your ears.

Shure SE846 - a noticeable step above the W40s in build quality and sound.extremely well regarded across the web for these
Sound is detailed, clear and solid. They come with three different types of exchangeable tubes so that you can adjust for bright, neutral or more bassy sound. I wasn't as fond of the ear tips that came with these but end up using the silicon 12mm from the Westones thus solving the comfort issue. After testing, I went back to the neutral tubes and have enjoyed these ever since.

95,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for something that got 80% of the sound quality of my Fostex TH900 cans in a mobile package. I tried these out because of the phenomenal reviews on Amazon. The bass is great but the mids/highs are muddy. Voices sounded veiled and the sound stage is tiny (somewhat understandable as these are IEMs). I am using a Bryston BDA2/BHA1 combo. They were also not very comfortable. I couldn't imagine wearing these for long periods of time.

At this price point, I would recommend the AKG K3003i. Same price but sound incredible - maybe even better than my Fostex TH900. And they are very comfortable.

If you have reference grade full sized headphones and a quality DAC/AMP, these will disappoint. If you've only heard other IEMs, these will sound phenomenal."

Since 2010 I have enjoyed my previously top-of-the-line Shure SE535-V Triple High-Definition MicroDriver Earphone with Detachable Cable - Metallic Bronze, so I was a little reluctant to take the plunge of purchasing this newest model at twice the cost, wondering ""Can it really get any better?"" Well, the Shure SE846 way exceeded my expectations with distinctively enhanced treble and bass, greater soundstage breadth and depth, and notably overall clarity of the individual instruments and voices (I listen to mostly classical music such as Handel arias/duets).

At one website when Googling ""SE846"" I found 3 key comparison criteria between the two earphones that prompted my purchasing:
""1) Notably lower low-frequency: 15 Hz vs. 18 Hz. 3 Hz lower low-frequency. The lowest frequency at which the device produces audio. The lower the low-frequency response, the stronger and juicier the bass.
2) Lots higher high-frequency: 20000 Hz vs. 19000 Hz. 1000 Hz higher high-frequency. The highest frequency at which device produces audio. The higher the high-frequency response, the clearer and crispier the treble.
3) Measurably lower impedance: 9 Ohms vs. 36 Ohms. 27 Ohms lower impedance. Impedance is the device's electrical resistance to the current being pushed through it. The lower the impedance, the easier it is to get higher volume and requires less power.""

My own testing of the Shure SE846 with both my Sony Walkman NWZ-E354 8GB Digital Music Player (Red) and Apple iPad Air ME898LL/A (128GB, Wi-Fi, Black with Space Gray) NEWEST VERSION confirms that all 3 improvements working together have taken my tracks to the next level that is truly breathtaking. I played Titanic: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - Anniversary Edition [+Digital Booklet], and the ""subwoofer"" really produced those very deep bass notes of the first track ""Never an Absolution."" Joyce DiDonato, Barbara Cook, Renee Fleming songs became even more alive and thrilling. It was like seeing and listening to Blu-ray discs instead of DVDs of my favorite films for the first time! I couldn't stop listening! 2-year limited warranty from Shure.

Published reviews that you can find by Googling ""SE846"": 1) Gregory Schmidt in the New York Times on Nov. 19, 2013, raved about the ""amazing sound."" He found the cords that wrap around the ears a bit cumbersome. (They are a little thicker than those on the SE535, but once molded, stay set). He also wondered if they were worth the cost. (You have my opinion; you will need to judge for yourself). 2) Tim Gideon reviewed it on Dec. 5, 2013, for PC Magazine; it earned an ""Editor's Choice award"" for ""stellar sound quality."" He provided a detailed comparison with the Sennheiser IE 800 High-Performance In-Ear Headphones (Black) that also received an award; while each has its pros and cons, he still preferred the SE846. 3) Geoffrey Morrison in Forbes on Dec. 8, 2013: ""The Shure SE846 is a brilliant sounding headphone. Warm, deep bass, delicate treble, lifelike midrange... they're probably the best-sounding in-ear headphones I've ever heard. Simply a joy to listen to. I wish their fit/cable made them a little easier to live with, but I think a lot of people will be willing to make that sacrifice for the excellent sound. Highly recommended."" 4) Anthony Verducci in Popular Mechanics on Dec. 9, 2013: ""The Shure SE846 deliver a clean, rich soundstage and smooth vocals with the best bass reproduction I've ever heard in an in-ear universal. Everyone should hear music like this--that is, if you have the cash."" 5) It was a 2014 CES Innovations Design and Engineering Award Honoree in the Headphones category (20 honorees). 6) Steve Guttenberg at CNET on Dec. 19, 2013, rated it ""Audiophiliac's In-Ear Headphone of the Year. The SE846 is a universal fit in-ear, but outshines the sound of my favorite custom molded in-ear headphones from JH Audio, Ultimate Ears, Westone, 1964 Ears, and more. The SE846's sound is more open (less stuck inside my head), it's highly transparent, treble detailing and dynamic range capabilities are extraordinary, and then there's the bass. It plumbs deeper and is significantly better defined than the competition's headphones."" 7) Steve Guttenberg made it a Sound & Vision ""Top Pick,"" Jan.10, 2014: ""The Shure SE846 is a brilliant design, one that marries state-of-the-art engineering with a rare musicality. I can't wait to see how the competition reacts to Shure's home run!"" He also preferred it to the Sennheiser IE 800."
98,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is an nice earphone.perfect earphone for fifi music. Looks new and gold color is cool
99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want the best non-custom earphones, this is it."
100,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am curious about the glowing review on the Shure SE846, hence I purchased one when they were available from the Amazon Warehouse with slight discount.

The packaging is impressive, but overdone, but I do like the water tight box. However, don't expect someone to carry this box with the earphones going out, it's too heavy. The carrying case, however, looks like the one from SE535, not commensurate with the elevated price point of SE846. Overall physical fit and finish is good and agreeable to the price.

Now, the fitting itself may be a little difficult. The body of SE846 is quite large, it's larger than SE535 and Logitech UE900. Luckily, it fits snugly in my ear without causing discomfort. However, the cable being very stiff and unyielding keeps falling off. The stiffness of the cable is also prone to transmit vibration, like a stethoscope. While I may not like Monster Cable headphones and earphones, but I think they at least pay attention to use a softer and pliable cable to lessen the cable noise.

The best way to describe SE846 is that it's basically SE535 with a subwoofer added, and with the high frequency 8kHz and above boosted by 6dB or so (by ear, not measurement). With movies it may be OK, but with music, I am having trouble, because the 'subwoofer' in SE846 is completely on it's own, it's obnoxiously obtrusive and stand in the way of music appreciation. While I like more bass, I can't agree to more bass if the 'more' is not synchronize with the rests of the frequencies. While I do not have measurement to confirm what I heard, I found online some measurements and these hard data confirmed what I heard.

I could have kept it because it's a fun earphones to watch movies, but sorry, at your price, everything must be perfect.

I am more than 20 years into as an audio and music enthusiast, I go to a lot of live concerts from Jazz to classical, and I have heard and used many good equipment; this puts some perspective on where I am coming from, to reference my review."
101,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Experience these for yourself. Your ears will thank you.
The fit is perfect. The sound is next level. You put these on, plug them in, close your eyes, listen and you just start smiling....You can't help it. It just sounds that amazing. I upgraded from the SE 535 and wondered about doing so since I had already dropped big bucks on the 535's. Do it! Don't look back. These will blow your mind."
102,4.0 out of 5 stars,Would get 5 stars if not for price. Amazing piece of sound gear. Use it mainly for bike riding. Literally transport home sound system to the pavement. Not safe BTW!
103,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Feels like you're in a studio & part of the music!! Your favorite music will come to life,new music also!"
104,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this highly revered set of in-ear headphones as a ""backup"" and secondary set to my custom fit Jerry Harvey Audio Layla IEMs. Being that the Layla costs almost three times as much as the SE846, my expectations weren't all that high.

The SE846 is very good - certainly a lot better than some Sony, Bose and Klipsch in-ears I've had in the past that were in the $300 range. I do agree that the SE846 doesn't *need* a separate DAC amp compared to other in-ears I've tried, including the JH Audio Layla. It sounds very good connected direct to my iPhone running the Onkyo HF Player app and high-res audio files (ALAC, FLAC and DSD). For this reason alone I plan to keep the SE846 - mainly for listening while exercising and doing other outdoor activities like hiking.

When compared to the JH Audio Layla, the SE846 exhibits much less soundstage and bass. After having read how big of a bass the SE846 is, I was somewhat disappointed how meek the bass sounded compared to the Layla. So when I use the SE846 I use an EQ preset on the Onkyo HF Player app specifically tuned to boost the low-mids and the bass. Only then does it get somewhat closer to the Layla. I'm not a bass head at all and have the bass circuit set fairly low on the Layla as well so the lack of a strong punchy bass on the SE846 surprised me.

This being said, it's really not fair to compare a $1000 set of in-ears to a custom IEM that starts at $2700. I certainly wouldn't say the JH Audio Layla is almost three times ""better"" than the SE846 but it really is a lot better in terms of soundstage, definition, audio ""density"", clarity, and cohesion across the entire spectrum. The Layla is considered a studio mastering grade reference set of IEMs so it is on a different level altogether.

Overall, I like the SE846 a lot. I normally use the JH Audio Layla with Chord Electronics Mojo DAC/headphone amp but use the SE846 only with the iPhone when I'm on the move and I'm not being too critical about the sound. In that context, with its lightweight and portability, the SE846 really shines. It wasn't quite as good as I expected based on all the rave reviews I've read but it's certainly good enough and I've decided it's a keeper."
105,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Left ear stopped working and I can't even detach the cable to check. At such a high price unbelievably low quality.

Edit1: just received a replacement from Shure. Still unacceptable for such a reputable company and such expensive headphones to make the customer go through all this.

Edit2: broken again 1 month after replacement (same problems). Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had with headphones. Wish I could get a refund"
106,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5/5 in sound quality, perhaps 4/5 in value for money. Major drawbacks are the slightly too warmish treble, which might give a feeling of lack of resolution sometimes. The low end and midrange is excellent, giving a nice punch that emulates full size speakers as much as possible with IEMs. Two other negatives is the stock cable (the guide is very stiff, making setup/insertion quite slow and annoying) and the poor quality of most of the included tips (I'm using the medium olive-shaped ones, which com installed - seem to be the best). I've changed filters to White, which gives a nicer treble and less boomy bass. You can go full afterburner and remove the filters completely, getting even sharper treble, but there's some loss of body in mids and bass, making it sound a bit thin.

In summary:
GOOD:
-Excellent midrange, very nice full vocals
-Good resolution
-Great separation and positioning
-Fairly wide soundstage (height/depth and width).
-Pretty nice bass, both in quantity and quality (tight, no bleed into lower mids)
-The Clear version is pretty neat to look at, showing the 4 BA drivers - this is the safest bet to avoid fakes too.
-Filter swap system actually works and is pretty easy. 3 levels (4 if you consider filterless an option)
-Included hard case and transport case are nice.

BAD:
-Stock cable sucks in usability. Cable itself is fine, but the stiff part around the ears is truly annoying. Slows down the usage and has zero advantages except for stage performers (or if you are very active/moving).
-Could use a bit more energy on the treble. Feels a bit rolled and smooth sometimes.
-Price is still too high for what it offers, despite being a very good sounding IEM.
-Only two of the included tips are any good (olives and foam)"
107,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a high-end listener who has tried other highly reputable earphones and headphones and I can honestly say these earphones are simply breathtaking. Since I started using these earphones through my Fiio X5 V3 audio player It's like my music has come to life. I'm able to listen to songs I have heard hundreds of times before while experiencing every little nuance in the music I was simply unable to hear with my ath-m50xs. It's like going through life with a wrong pair of glasses and finally getting some prescription lenses and seeing the world for what it truly is for the first time ever. I was honestly apprehensive about making the purchase because of the price but I knew I wanted the best and from all the articles I read and videos I watched, I knew this was it and I can honestly say they are well worth the money. In my honest opinion, I truly believe it's impossible to accurately know whether these earphones are worth it because simply saying they're amazing does not do it justice; they're something you have to experience to truly know the extent of how remarkable they are. I honestly wish I could formulate an accurate combination of words to adequately convey the impact these earphones have had with my listening experience but no words can. No other product has made me feel this way and I highly recommend if you love your music and take audio accuracy and clarity seriously."
108,3.0 out of 5 stars,Its a good pair of earphones with good sound quality but it was a little complicated to put on and to make it comfortable in ears
109,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Expensive but worth every dollar. I own a pair of JH Audio JHA13s and prefer these over them. The Shure's are comfortable and the sound quality is incredible. Its right up there with the JHA13. Yes there is a lot of bass but its not extreme or muddy at all. You can hear the bass instruments play perfectly. They have character and don't overwhelm mids and highs. You basically hear every single characteristic of the music. I was stunned at what i was hearing and didn't want to stop listening to my music. I dont know how Shure did this but the headphones dont play left and right. It creates a soundpace which is rare for in ear headphones (or on/over ear). Anything from mama-yo to Kings of Leon and Nin Inch Nails sounds amazing better on these.

I have only used them as is out of the box and havent messed around with the custom sound tips (yet).

I used them with my iPhone 6, Mac and on my Cypher Labs Theorem 720 DAC/AMP. The iPhone 6 was really good with music purchased from the iTunes store as well as ALAC files. I also tried Tidal with lossless Flac, which was on par with the ALAC version of the music. Using the headphones with the Theorem did kick it up a few notches. But you dont need special hardware to fall in love with these headphones.

I spent a lot of time researching these and listened to many different in ear headphones. I own really good over ear headphones, including a set of open planar magnetics and closed planars which i use with the Oppo HA-1 amp. If you need something that is mobile without sacrificing sound quality you absolutely wont go wrong if you buy these."
110,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The cheap comes out expensive.... by that I mean that I always wanted these but was not willing to spend the money. Instead I bought

Sennheiser MM550x 550$, not happy!,
Audio-Technica M50x 300$, not happy!,
Phiaton MS 530 250$, not happy!,
Bose QC20i 280$, good noise cancelling, not a fan of the Bose sound
Ultimate ears Triple-Fi 10 250$, a little happy but don't like to look like a TV antenna
Sennheiser IE08 450$, kind of happy but not the most comfortable

and finally the SE846, VERY happy.

So I spent 2180$ plus taxes instead of 1000.

Don't get me wrong, the other headphones above are all very good but my message is, if you want the 846's don't be cheap, comes out more expensive.

2 more things:

1. Yes they are worth the money
2. If you use them for lets say 5 years and pay 1000$, that's 200/ year or 55 cents a day to enjoy the very best earphones on the market and stop shopping for better (for a while at least)"
111,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Earphones can become extremely personal choice and what sounds amazing to one person can sound horrible to another and this is completely acceptable, Some people have a more sensitive hearing for trebles and mids than others which can result in different choices of earphones, some people can find deep bass quite disturbing while others will love it the whole day, so it is important to know what type of listener you are and what type of music you listen to.

I like natural sound, acoustic band alike, instrumental music, jazz, funk music and classic, with little vocals because I like to hear the micro details from the instruments. Usually I like the sound with a slight boost in mid and treble to be able to capture more details but also appreciate a tight and controlled bass, so it looks like this set is custom made to my hearing. (in some songs I found myself lowering the bass just a hair so I can hear more mid and treble details, but this is me just because my hearing is less sensitive to high tones). So make sure you try the different little pipes for sound signature as they make a huge difference, I prefer the white which gives me a crispier and sharp tone

For me this par of earphones are by a great margin the best I have ever tried so far and I am comparing to Angie 2, Campfire, Westones, Sennheiser, Stages and other shures as well but they all fall short

It produces a very balanced signature, clean sound with excellent separation, amazing sound stage and very good isolation so for me the search ends here.

Some models I tried before were difficult to classify as they were quite similar in sound but when I tried this one it was like something else was added to the sound (as usual, sound is very difficult to put in words, and I won't try to create more words than people have already invented to classify sound)

I deleted my previous bad review about this model cause I found out that I have tried a defective set from my local shop.

If you are an audiophile or you are looking for that crystal clear sound and stage sound as if you are a few meters from the live band, hearing every single instrument than you found your earphones.

One only funny thing to note: the provided in-line volume control is of the worst quality you can expect, came falling apart and even worse, it totally destroys the sound quality, it is laughable really, what a shame Shure puts such equipment in the packing."

Just sent in my 3-year old SE846 earbuds, wanted to replace a worn-out cable and the right earbud was cutting out occasionally. Expected to pay for the cable and $246 to replace the right earbud. They charged me $17.46 for the cable - and I got a NEW pair of 846 earbuds - the earbuds were free. Words fail, I'm blown away."
114,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had these headphones for 2 days, so I'm not quite ready to make a firm statement in this review. If I remember I'll update this after some time.

I own a few respectable earphones/headphones. Klipsch x10 (S4's too - though I never used them again after getting the x10s), Master & Dynamic MH40, Beats Solo 2 (was given to me), and B&W P5s. I have also spent some time Shure's SE535's the last two days.

For my ears, the MH40's are pretty special. The warmth in the tonality is fantastic. But I wouldn't consider them sharp - I like my highs to be piercing when they're supposed to be piercing and I feel like the MH40's drop off quite a bit in the highs. It's okay, because again the warmth that this creates is fantastic too. But when I want to really feel the highs I have to pull a different set.

Until I got the 846's I thought the X10's were fantastic. But now, they sound artificial. Before I got the Shure's I would have said that the base was very present and strong while providing great highs. Love the highs. But again, now after listening to the Shure's I find them to be artificial. I'll keep them though, they're the most comfortable in-ear's I have and they're still quite adequate.

Since I got the MH40's I don't listen to my P5's. I wore them the other day and they are really great, but the MH40's are just too good. I'll probably sell the P5's.

Okay, so the 846's. Wow. I was prepared to be disappointed given the high price - though this was tempered because I was able to get them for half off, but still, I had very high expectations and didn't really expect these to sound like they're worth the $1000 retail. The clarity, and the accuracy of these are just fantastic. As I mentioned above they made my previously favorite X10's sound totally artificial. Listening to Norah Jones felt like she was singing right in front of me. The clarity of the instruments was so cool. You can hear their placement in the room, and the spacial separation. Fantastic. I love music with heavy use of piano (thus Norah Jones), and dang, I just love hearing how these render piano.

The only thing I feel like is missing is a real punch to bass. While bass is very clean, and rendered quite nicely, perhaps it's just that in-ear earphones just can't push enough air to make you feel bass, but it just doesn't have quite the emotive feeling I get from over-the-ear headphones like the MH40's. But again, that could well just be because of the physical limitations of a tiny tiny armature.

Are they worth $1000? That's a really hard call, that's a lot of money. For the $500 I spent on them? Hell ya! I don't think there is anything that comes close under $700."
115,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very interesting product for me. I think it is important to know my audio background before I can start talking about this product. I started listening to music on a pair of first generation Ipod Touch headphones. I then upgraded to a pair of V-moda ear buds which served me well for about a year. I then acquired a pair of Audio Technica ATH-mx 50 studio headphones that I used for studio monitoring, as well as a pair of Bose 2i2 earbuds for exercise. After several years my Bose buds broke due to a cable failure. With no option to replace the cable and an expired warrantee, I was forced to start perusing for a new pair of ear buds. That is when the Shure earphones came to my attention.
I purchased them with the intent to use them for exercise and monitoring live performances and studio recordings. So far they have given me mixed results. First of all the sound isolation is really top notch; almost too much so. I recently used these in the woodshop while running a handheld power sander, I couldn't hear the sander at all and the music was just as amazing. This is good because the music is all you hear no matter what, this is bad because it can be unsafe while exercising, walking, driving or doing anything where you need to hear ambient sounds for safety reasons. This is just something that should be noted before you decide wither or not to purchase.
The sound that these produce is absolutely stellar (as one would expect.) They provide exceptional clarity and all frequencies come through to provide an amazing sound signature. I have found some interesting attributes with some modern tracks that I am used to listening at a high volume. In the past I would turn the volume up rather loud to provide maximum awesomeness and a healthy dose of distortion. With these headphones, you can turn the volume up as high as you want and there will be absolutely NO healthy distortion. All of the sounds are crystal clear at all volumes, which is a good thing but something to get used to.
These earbuds are very comfortable. The over the ear cable provides an extra level of secureness on ones head. If you are not used to in ear headphones you may experience some discomfort in the first few weeks but this discomfort will surely pass. They include two different cable lengths that come in very handy for different applications in the studio and on the go. If you can't find a well fitting set of tips from the selections included, you have bigger problems. Huge variety of tips that provide different acoustical qualities and different feels. These headphones are highly customizable.
Another note: ya' know that hair raising tingling sensation that goes from your head all the way to your toes when you are listening to the best part of one of your favorite songs? Yeah, that happens at least twice as often when I'm listening on these earbuds. It's really weird, I keep thinking there is something wrong with me. But day after day, repeat after repeat I keep achieving the same results. Shure has clearly done something very right here.
Overall there is diffidently a time and place for these headphones. If you've got the cash and you are willing to spend it these are definitively the best of the best; these are the 100% sound. If you are the average consumer looking for a 90% sound for everyday use I would go with the Bose 2i2. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the price; sorry I forgot to mention that. This is a perfect product for certain applications, with in an imperfect & elitist price tag.
Hope you found this review helpful, I am happy to answer questions to help you decide if these are for you!"
116,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best IEM's I have ever put on - hands down. Sound isolation is perfect, highs are high - lows are low and the mids are right where they should be. There is 0 microphonics (sound due to movement with the cable). The build quality is incredible and there are a ton of customization options (tips and cones) for you to mix and match.

I picked up the optional iPhone compatible cable (in-line mic) and haven't swapped back to the standard cable.

I replaced the default cones with ones that enhance the high range since I enjoy crisp pronounced highs - but each cone sounded good in its own right. If you have the cash to spare, these will be the last IEM's you own for a long long while.

Expensive - totally. Worth it - yep. Don't mortgage your kids for these, but if you have the cash you won't regret the spend. The travel case is great and the pelican case for rugged storage is perfect.

Couldn't ask for a better pair of IEM's."
117,4.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best (and more expensive) Earphones in the world: Clear low frequency, very nice medium and fantastic tweeter.
But ... the relation between drivers is not perfect (perhaps the Earphones needs time) and finally, a Grado GR10 is less than 50% the price for a result which is more less as good as the Shure."
118,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are simply unbelievable. One can safely say about these headphones that you have never heard anything like this. Let me try to give you a sense of this experience. First you will spend about 10 minutes trying to put them on, why is this so f*** complicated! Once they are in, and you turn on your music player, preferably NOT a phone of some kind, it's like someone injected instant karma into your soul. The headphones disappear, you disappear, you are left with an ineffable waffle like quality. There are no headphones. The best lover in the world is gently whispering in your ear. Scrape. Save. Bribe. Cry. Get these headphones.
In my experience it only took about 2-3 hours to break them in a little - that's important."
119,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent bass for an I.E.M., But if you want more bass, a good pair of (over the ear) cans will probably deliver that. But those would of course be bigger, bulkier, and some models sweatier. And cans probably suck battery power faster from portable devices.

Superb airiness/spaciousness rarely if ever heard in other I.E.M.s. So much so that the sound is reminiscent of electrostatic floor standing speakers. You might get this airiness in open back (open back means sound leaks out the outside of the cups, so people around you can hear them somewhat), or electrostatic/ribbon cans.

Very good clarity.

And I like the removable and replaceable cords, and the metal connects (at the earbud-cord connection points) not found on many I.E.M.s Plastic often cracks and breaks, no matter how sturdy it seems initially.

After having had these awhile now, the only reason I took off one star, is because if you don’t remember to occasionally twist tighten the ear buds to the cords, you may lose one or both ear buds, and need to buy more. They self loosen.

Despite that single caveat, these are either the best I.E.M. you can get, or close enough."
120,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I know these are way too much $$. But it was worth every penny. These earphones are stunning. Treble as near to perfection as you can get, and Balanced Armatures that actually give clean, clear, low bass. I have others on the high end, but all I want to use are these."
121,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely stellar. I own 3 pairs of Shure earbuds... the older 200 and 500 series that are ""fixed"" to the cables as well as this pair of SE846. The sound these quad driver buds put out is simply astounding. I no longer travel with my powered, noise cancelling B&O headphones- although I still love them and use them at home all the time. But these Shure units block sound as well as any active noise cancelling item, are small, lightweight and very easy to travel with and feature best in class sound. Yes, extremely prices, but if you use earbuds a lot and have a high quality music player then they are well worth the money for the features and benefits they deliver."
122,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I believe these are way overhyped. They advertise ""a true subwoofer"" and that is partially true. However I did not like the muddiness of the bass and one of the drivers was slightly distorting and buzzing in the lower frequencies at higher volumes. I tested this with several sources including my FiiO E10k Olympus 2 playing FLAC's so I know it's not my source. For $1K, I would expect the IEM's to handle any amount of listenable volume without any distorion. These are currently on their way back to the seller. For the same amount or less you can get B stock CA Andromedas that blow the se846's out of the water."
123,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not as pleased with the fit as I expected. I've owned a number of models over the years - this one has slightly longer ""tubes"" and they don't seat as well as the all the other SE-series. The 535's are amazing enough, and fit excellent."
124,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones have extremely awesome sound quality. The design of the earphones is extremely well made and when you put them in your ear and lay on a pillow they do not cause stress or discomfort to your ear while laying on a pillow. Highly recommend these to anyone who might be thinking about buying them. They have a ton of accessories that come with them too.
125,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an audiophile but do listen to music most of the days. My previous earbuds were the Klipsch S4s. I purchased the Bose earbuds but returned them. The S4s lasted for 2 years and I wanted to upgrade them. I went into it thinking of spending $150 to $200 to replace them. I'm a big fan of Amazon - for better or worse - and saw the Shure 215s. I bought them and were impressed but not blown away. I then bought the 535s and it wasn't a big step over the 215s in my book. But then I hit the button to buy the 846s.... For me to spend this much money on earbuds isn't a problem but I sure wasn't going to waste any money on something that wasn't all that great. I hate to say this... and if you don't want to buy these earbuds don't read any further.... but these 846s CRUSHED the 535s. It wasn't even comparable. I was hoping that the 846s would be just a little better than the 535s as the price difference is ridiculous. But to be honest - these are literally a multiple better than the 535s.... I've had these for a few months and these continue to amaze.

What really sold me on these is that you hear parts of the song that you NEVER heard before. Either instruments / vocals... you will hear things that you have never heard. And some of the words I could never understand came through clearly.

The only negative - it does take awhile to get used to putting them in your ears. They are easy now but it is difficult to do it the first few times. And if you want to share the experience with someone - trying to tell someone else how to put them on is a pain.

Lastly - the one thing you'll have a big issue with is listening to these and walking is way harder than chewing gum and walking. I know that sounds way stupid but what ends up happening is that the noise canceling and the music soundstage surrounding you.... you will walk into things you never walked into before.... it takes away some of your normal senses and your brain is more focused on the music. I've hit my head and toes on things I've walked by a 100 times."
126,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I rarely write reviews but I just had to write a review for these. These are hands down the best purchase I have made in the past year because after months of using them I still am surprised by the breathtaking audio quality and fidelity. When I first put them in my ears they actually brought tears to my eyes as I heard things I had never heard before in songs I had had a thousand times before. Even now after owning these for months, I am still taken aback by how incredible these ear buds truly are. On my opinion, these are worth every penny and I have no complaints what so ever."
127,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from over ear headphones like the LCD2, HE-500, and T1, these are impressive. Bass on Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works 1 is amazing. Playing through the Sony WMA1 with high gain output."
128,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not generally one to write reviews, but ... after I unboxed these today I spent hours listening to music on them including some deep subwoofer test tracks and all I can say is that these earbuds are sublime.

129,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first foray into higher end audio. These sound really great with both my FLAC and MP3 music. Really makes it all sound new again. Most notable is the low-end. Truly outstanding. I did not understand complaints of ""muddy"" bass in headphones until I listened to these.

131,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned many ""in ear"" earbuds and I have to say that even though these are around $1,000, they are worth ever penny spent on them. By far, these are the best set of earbuds I have yet to purchase. I started my audiophile obsession with a pair of Shure SE215's and was quite impressed with the sound that I got from a pair of earbuds that where around $100.00 when I purchased these years ago. They sounded great when I got them and then years later they held me over until I finally bought these. More on that below. I then decided to try the others as well. I have a pair of SE315's that I ordered from a different site and I noticed more bass, but they seemed to lack the highs and mids of the 215's. The SE425's, in my opinion are the worst ones I have ever owned. Sorry for those out there who like them, I just think they have a pure sound, but they are lacking in the bass department. I don't use these too often. I usually use these to listen to my iPad when watching a YouTube video or a news clip or something when my better half is watching TV. I finally broke down in 2012 and purchased a set of SE535's. These sounded great and lasted for four years. When I was single, 16 years ago now, I always listened to music at night turned down very low. I now sleep with earbuds listening to music and my better half wears a CPAP machine. He started noticing that he could hear the music playing very slightly coming from the earbuds. I looked at them very closely only to discover that they where starting to separate at the seams. I tried to use superglue to repair them, but that only made a mess and they still where not sealed around the housing. I finally threw in the towel and bought a new set of earbuds.

I own several other earbuds as well. I have a pair of Westone W40's that sound very good, they just hurt my ears after wearing them for long periods of time. I don't like the silicone earpieces and the foam isn't much better, they are also a different size if I remember correctly than the Shure foam earpieces. I also have a set of Bowers & Wilkins C5 Series in ear earbuds and they sound really good as well. My only issue with these are that they coil in your inner ear to keep them in place. Nice amount of both bass and highs, but I must have deformed ears as they will not stay in. Also they are a great value for the price now if you can wear them. I decided that in order to get the best out of my Astell & Kern AK100 3ohm edition portable DAC, I was going to have to buy a nice set of earbuds to complement this player. I considered buying a new pair of SE535's, but I decided on buying something different and newer. I first purchased a set of Westone W60's, which cost as much as the Shure SE846's. I started having issues with the right ear piece immediately after receiving them. I thought about how I did not like the fit of the Westones I still own anyway, so I sent them back. I finally decided to buy what I knew was going to be an exceptional set of earbuds and a reliable brand I have enjoyed for years now. The Shure SE846 with built in subwoofer. I did some research on these and read a few comments about them from AVS forums and was sold on another set of Shure in ear headphones.

I have a Astell & Kern AK100II model with the dual Cirrus Logic DAC and a pair of special edition Astell & Kern Angie Special Edition balanced earbuds by JH Audio. This is a really nice sounding setup. I still tend to use my first edition AK100 (the 3 ohm version) more as it has a single Wolfson WM8740 DAC and it sounds so much better to me than the dual Cirrus Logic DAC in my Astell & Kern AK100II Player. It seems to really separate the sound much better than the Cirrus Logic chipset. Don't get me wrong, the newer Astell & Kern is very nice as are the Special edition earbuds. This was a gift from my partner for my birthday. But I still listen to my first edition player using these incredible new Shure SE846's as they sound so great together. I am using the inserts that came from the factory in my new Shure earbuds as they are providing plenty of bass for the type music I listen to. I like Rock, Alternative, and New Wave stuff. I listen to bands like Blur, Suede,and Oasis. I also like the Grateful Dead as well as CSN&Y. So my musical taste is all over the place.

These are by far the best set of headphones I have ever owned yet. The Angie SE from Astell and Kern are very good as well, but not as comfortable as my Shure SE846 earbuds. I can wear these for hours at a time and have. I use the large black foam ear piece as it fits the best and is the most comfortable. These have the same size jacks as the rest of the Shure line of earbuds. I think it's 3.5mm gold plated and angled which I really like. The newer Astell and Kern models use the Trrs smaller tip. The balanced output of the player is an incredible feature and it sounds incredible as well, it stil doesn't sound quite as good as my first edition player. I'm also not a big fan of using my iPhone for music as it dosent have enough storage, you need a separate DAC and amp all which takes a toll on the battery life, and it dosent do High Resolution files. I bought an iPod and wish now I had not as it never gets any usage. iPhones and iPods also don't play Flac files without an app. It still only plays 24bit/44kHz files, so you need a very good external amp to get the full sound of high resolution. I prefer a separate portable DAC for my music listening and a phone for calling people. I have mostly 24bit/192kHz files on my Astell & Kern Player. It will also do other formats including DSD, but I have a nice set up at home for really high resolution music listening. In fact these Shure earbuds seem to have more bass response than my Beyerdynamic Tesla headphones that I use with my home set up. I have also decompressed a few Apple Music files and added them to my portable player as well and they sound much better than playing them through my iPhone, iPad, or my iPod with an Oppo DAC/Amp combo.

This set of headphones has unbelievable bass response as well as highs, mids, and things I was never even able to hear with my SE535 earbuds. I just can't figure out how Shure engineered these earbuds to get this much bass from such a small earpiece. It is a true subwoofer sound and it blows away any set of midrange priced earbuds away. I have always been under the impression that I needed to ""break in"" my earbuds as well, but if you go to Shure's website, they say that there isn't any difference in sound after the first day or after one hundred days on their earbuds. They only recommend ""breaking in"" over the ear headphones. They sounded incredible right out of the impressive packaging. These are top notch and come with a set of different inserts for listening taste. One high range, the preinstalled mid range, and a lower range which neither of the other two I have tried yet. The preinstalled inserts are phenomenal in soundstage and everything I have on my player sounds like it's 10 times better than with my older SE535 earbuds. Them come with an attached 60 inch cable, but you also get a shorter cable (40"") , a set of various tips, the extra inserts with a tool to change them, a square hard shell case, and a cleaning rag. Everything is all packaged in a really nice magnetic closure cardboard box with the instructions in a slot inside the lid and the product is in a water tight plastic case. Similar to a Pelican case. I'm not sure if it's waterproof, but it appears to be. I have already ordered another square case, one for my earbuds and another for my accessories. I would not hesitate to buy these again and would highly recommend these to any audiophile who is looking to replace their earbuds or is looking to buy another set that has an incredible sound stage that is customizable for less than $1,000. My Angie Special Editions also are customizable by turning a set of screws on the cord, but I want be changing these for awhile if they continue to perform as perfectly as they are doing know.

Some user have complained about the comfort of these as opposed to the others in Shure's line up, but I haven't had any comfort issue, in fact these are more comfortable over long periods of time than my SE535s. My only possible regret is that I'm thinking that I should have bought the black or blue model, as clear plastic tends to yellow with age, but if this is their latest flagship in ear headphones, I can't wait to see what in store in the next couple of years. My only other advice is to make sure that the seller you purchase from is an authorized Shure dealer, or your warranty is already no good."
132,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these after seeing rave reviews online and on the tube. I've allowed approx 20 hours 'burn in' time and have listened all genres of music. And I'm asking myself if I missed something (?). Don't take me wrong, they're not bad. But IMHO you can probably get better buds (or cans) for $1k."
133,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfort- The sennheisers stay in my ears pretty well. The shures are a little too big and the cable is really stiff and annoying. +1 for the sennheisers.

Design- The shures look better hands down, they have adequate amounts of weight to them and the replaceable cable is a huge plus compared the senneiser ie800s

Microphonics- The ie800s did encounter microphonics because of the cable and I could not move much in them. On the other hand the shures go around your ear so the shure gets a +1 for this category.

Sound (Bass,Treble,Mids)

Bass- The shure se846 has a ""subwoofer"" bass to it which is extremely unique and can dig EXTREMELY deep, but the detail of the bass is ""alright"", a little definition would be nicer. Compared to the ie800 which also has deep bass. The shures out perform them because of the depth and subwoofer like feeling.

Mids- The shures sound amazing!!!! VOCALS are extremely realistic and sound like the singer/songwriter is talking to you and it's personal. The se846 moves my heart more. The ie800s have excellent mids and vocals sound clean but the se846 is quite effortless and LUSH sounding. Keep in mind that the shures do have coloration to them and aren't reference grade. They do have kind of a fun signature with the bass-mid emphasis.

Treble- The shures for $1000, have a treble roll off which is unacceptable considering the price. They sound veiled and muffled compared the ie800. The ie800 have sparkly treble and can get a little bit too detailed (might lead to listening fatigue). But the ie800 never irritated me, and I think higher end sounded extremely AIRY, and liquidy.
The shures take quite a beating regarding treble.

Filters on the shure se846- I found the Nuetral one to be the best, since the others altered the frequency response, and I generally prefer a balanced sound. The brightness filter was simply ""ok"" It would have been better to see more airy ness on the upper end.

Final Conclusion- Consider the shures if you travel a lot, because of the isolation and can block serious amounts of noise. The sennheiser are good if you aren't sitting still (many people complained about the ie800 becoming stiff due to cable issues, I have not encountered that).

Sound wise- The ie800 have better over all clarity and transparency. The shure se846 sounded veiled and muffled in the treble regions when compared to the ie800. Now if you want just good Vocal and Bass then consider the shures since they outperform the ie800 in those categories. In my opinion I would pick the IE800s overall since they just offer better sound quality and airyness of a reference grade earphone. It was disappointing of the treble roll off which got me the most, if the shures were brighter then they would easily be better than the ie800s.

135,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all, coming from the SE425, to the SE535, I decided that I'm in a place where I can comfortably afford these bad boys. I have to say however that when I first got them and played them I was a little disappointed... for the first 15 seconds. The SE425 and SE535 had a sound profile which I felt focused on clarity and midrange, which I enjoy. This makes things like snare drums and vocals really pop, and bass was always somewhat subdued, but it was clear to me that the SE846 took a different angle from the other headphones in this range and really focused on a true subwoofer experience.

As a result the bass is very prominent. It was surprising at first, but once I listened to a few more tracks I realized that the clarity in the other frequencies are still there and the bass is really adds a warmth and a bed for all the other frequencies. It makes you think of bass in a whole different way for in-ears. I personally use the white, or bright, filter with mine and feel like this creates the most even mix of bass, midrange, and treble. The best part about these headphones is the soundstage, they are easy to drive, but the separation of between the layers is very prominent. You hear things in tracks that you never hear before and the nuance with the sound brings you into video content like never before.

It's odd, but even if you watch something on a small iPad screen, you feel more into the video, or movie, or whatever when you can hear the most minute details in the audio. It brings out details like no other headphone. Are they worth $1,000? If you love music and are an audiophile, I would have to say for Shure!"
136,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned the SE215 earbuds before these, but I was always curious what a set of earbuds that costed almost TEN TIMES what the SE215s did would sound like.

Well, they do sound better than the SE215s. The differences are hard to pin down honestly, but everything is just a little clearer, a little more lifelike. Do I think they're a full ten times better than the SE215s? No, I don't think so. The SE215s are not bad sounding earbuds by any means, and unfortunately, listening to the SE846s is not the earth-shattering, life-changing experience I hoped they might be. And yes, I know that's a lot to ask from earbuds. But they are $900 earbuds, so, you know, I was hopeful.

Overall they're just very good sounding earbuds, very clear, full bass, everything you could hope for short of a truly transcendent experience. For this reason I can't really give them any less than 5 stars. Are they worth the $900? It really depends on how much money you have to spend, and how important it is for you to have the absolute best sound possible from your earbuds. But I would not say they're a full ten times better than the SE215s. I should mention that thus far I've only listened to them through the audio output of my phone, so take this review for what it's worth.

One thing I will say is that these are EXTREMELY efficient earbuds, meaning that you don't have to turn them up very far for them to be very loud. This is good as far as battery life on mobile devices goes. You won't need to turn up your phone as far as you would with other earbuds to get the same volume. Compared to the SE215s, I would say the SE846s run about one or two notches lower on the volume setting of my phone to produce the same loudness as the SE215s. (This is on a volume scale of zero to fifteen on my phone.) One other thing that's impressive and also a little dangerous is that these earbuds can go to ear-splittingly loud levels. The impressive part is that they still seem to be very clear with very little breakup even at high volumes. The dangerous part is that I would not recommend listening to these with the volume of your device set to max. They get extremely loud, loud enough to muffle your hearing and make your ears ring after a few songs at full volume. But, hey, if you want to blow out your eardrums with crystal clear sound, these will do that too.

Also, I bought the ""international version"" of these, so this might not show up as a verified purchase review, but I do own them."
137,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For several years, my ""go to"" earphones have been the Shure 535...well, unfortunately I lost my last pair on an airplane (you're welcome, whoever is using them today) and I decided to try the 848 as a replacement.

To a degree, the 846 has a lot in common with my old 535's...similar sound qualities - you can tell they come from the same company. The 846 is well ahead sonically, providing a ""thicker"" and faster sound that's much more engaging with the right material. Definitely glad I made the switch.

I would say that a product like the SE846 requires you to have some really good quality source material. Just as it reveals every note in a well-recorded song, so it will also reveal every flaw in low bitrate material coming from a mediocre source.

Still, this is one of the best sound experiences you'll hear for the money...can't go wrong with these."
138,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for a year now. They are the best IEMs I have ever had. I've tried the Universals for JH Audio and they didn't sound as good as these Shure SE846s. The bass response of the Shures are phenomenal. It's a full sound with presence and clarity. I don't know all the technicals, but I do know what I hear.

The best thing about these earphones is SHURE'S CUSTOMER SERVICE. They are simply the best -- bar none. Every time I have dealt with them, their response has always been over and beyond what I would expect from a electronic consumer company. PHENOMENAL.

This is the best purchase I've made for my music."
139,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first earbuds/earphones I have ever purchased at any price that have real and deep bass. Simply unbelievable. Who needs big over the ear headphones if you have these? These put my Shure SE535s to shame -- they sound like garbage next to these SE846.

Besides the deep and real bass these earphones have a fantastic separation of sounds. All these separate drivers help to create a real soundstage.

These earphones give meaning the the adage that you get what you pay for.

The only thing that is not perfect is the cables do not feel quite as sturdy as those on my Shure SE535s. But all told what fantastic sound these have."

First of all I must say THANK YOU for Amazon ,to deliver this item to me less than 40 hours even I select normal shipping.
BACKROUND:
I have upgrade my earbuds from BOSS(SoundTrue® Ultra In-Ear ) - SONY XBA-H3- SHURE SE846
Before I buy this,SE846 ,I did too much research on internet and finally decide to buy it. While I research on internet I didn’t find any single comparison between this and SONE XBAH3.So if any other guy who has any idea to upgrade from SONY XBAH3 to SE846 , I hope this will help.

Below review fully base on ,
1).Music source: Iphone 6S PLUS 64GB(Equalizer set as”Acoustic”)
2).LOSSLESS Audio songs, directly ripped from genuine Audio CDs
3).I replaced Earphone TIPs to COMPLY P-series (P-100 /Medium size)TIPs. (Actually these are very very comfortable and have great noise isolation. But beware, I saw that very tiny partials of memory forms deposit inner part of that TIP and it has some probability to deposit those small partials deep inside your ears. So as a precautionary step before it attached to earphone , I just use air blower to throw away that very tiny form partials)
REVIEW:
When consider BOSS , this SHURE SE846 has Phenomenal, incomparable sound so I just eliminate BOSS from this review.
Very first time ,first few minutes with SE846 ,honestly I didn’t notice significant different between my previous SONY XBAH3 ,except SE846’s mind blowing supper quality BASS.
However after playing several Songs (POP/ROCK) I realized that, SE846 has GREAT separation(L/R separation for stereo sound).Sony XBAH3 also has this separation but it does not highlight as SE846.So SE846 doing great job in sound separation.
On the other hand when using SE846 ,I can easily identify and NOTICE ,each and every music instrument sound come from song. when using XBAH3 sometimes I didn’t NOTICE some music instruments sound. (Actually XBAH3 deliver that sound in lower intensity (low amplitude) but SE846 deliver same instrument sound very clearly and somewhat high intensity.)
When considering BASS,SE846 has supper quality bass , but it does not affect to higher frequencies. That is the MOST SIGNIFICAT PART OF SE846.
When considering mids, also good. And it delivers good higher frequency as well. (Actually almost same as my previous SONY XBAH3 which has excellent treble.)
ROUNDUP:
After using SE846 , what I realized is, it delivers, exactly same sound which recorded at music source. But on the other hand there are several audio systems which do the same job( for example: yg acoustics anat iii signature, but price range is between $50,000 – $100,000,which is dream for majority of us)
So if you are a guy who wants such a “premium quality” music at 999USD ,it is worth to buy SE846.
But if you want good quality music with budget value, 300USD, SONY XBAH3 do great JOB.

UPDATE 4-FEB-2016:
Last month I bought ibasso Dx80 as a upgrade. But unfortunately sound (quality) from ibasso Dx80 not good as iphone 6s+ .It has huge noticeable hiss (you know SE864 is high sensitivity IEM), also sound signature does not meet my expectation and it does not even close to iphone 6s plus.
Base on expert reviews and chord web site information (plus Rob watt presentations in you tube) I turn in to Chord mojo, currently top level DAC in the market (it more affordable than Hugo).But my mind always remind me can you guaranty Mojo sound quality will better than my existing iphone 6s plus. Then I contact chord customer care (info@chordelectronics.co.uk) and they inform me they already got so many award for mojo and I will impressed with it sound quality, also they guaranty there will not be any hiss.
Finally got my chord mojo. Actually together with my iphone 6s plus, my SE846 sound amazing…really amazing…!!!!.It has too may detail in sound. And even very small sound also highly emphasize. It has smooth more comfortable and noticeable Bass(if you like bass come from iphone 6s plus defiantly you will impressed with bass from Mojo as well) . Mids ,highs and vocals are Cristal clear!!!.LR separation is awesome. Iam really impressed. There is NO ANY KIND OF HISS.
Then I try Mojo with Dx80 and, SE846 sound not better than Mojo with Iphone 6s plus. Also Mojo +Dx80 Bass is less and treble is too high. I mean not well balance.
NOTE: For above comparison I use 16 bit/44.1 Khz FLAC music files. Always use SE846 as IEM.

Summary:
1).Don’t buy dx80 if you have iphone 6s(+).Sound quality from iphone 6s(+) really really good.
2).Sound quality (with SE846):
Iphone 6s (+) with Mojo > iphone 6s(+) > ibasso dx80
3).For me, Mojo+iphone 6s (+) sound far better than mojo+ibasso dx80 (both with SE846)

For your information:
1).I order my Chord mojo from moon audio ([...]) because in amazon USA site price was too high. Also chord electronics confirm to me that Moon Audio is official retailer for Mojo. (Also moon audio deliver this item to worldwide)Don’t order this item from ebay, most probably you will get made in china crap!!
Contact email Chord electronics: info@chordelectronics.co.uk
Contact email Moon Audio: sales@moon-audio.com
2).I use my iphone 6s plus charger together with ANKER USB cable to charge MOJO. There was no any hum or hiss come from device while it charging!!
3).While listing songs, normally you have to put your phone to Airplane mode to avoid RF interference , Otherwise you will hear some kind of hum/buzz sounds time to time and it will provide bad impression to your listening experience.
4) Sometimes I have notice small hiss, when use this device while it charging. So Don’t use this device while it charging.
5).While it using it will get WARM, As per Chord electronics it is normal.( [...]

Hope above information will help to you."
141,2.0 out of 5 stars,They sound fantastic! Unfortunately they are uncomfortable and difficult to insert.
142,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When rating audio components and accessories, it comes down to three factors: what your personal preferences are, what device you're using to play your music, and what kind of music you listen to. Some complain that the SE846s are ""bass heavy"". That may be true if you're only listening to Hip-Hop, but wouldn't be true if you're listening to Jazz and Rock from the late 1950s and '60s when recording engineers weren't thinking about emphasizing bass and were looking for a more neutral sound. So, how do the SE846s perform? Good bass presence (compared to the SE535s) without overwhelming the mids and highs. (The advantage of a solid bass presence is that you can always tone it down if it's too much. It's better to have it in reserve if you really want it; and you can neutralize it if you need to using an equalizer.) At the opposite end of the spectrum, the treble range is bright, but not overly so, especially if you (again) use an equalizer on your home computer or if you use a sophisticated equalizer App like EQu. The mid-range is well represented, with vocals and other ambient sounds and instruments articulated well. In short, the SE846s are much more ""punchy"" than the SE535s, which may get a bit of getting used to. But . . . if you EQ the music properly according to your taste and the genre of music you're listening to, these will certainly do the trick. In my opinion, well worth the money."
143,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well I must say this is it for me.

I own a pair of Etymotics ER4P, as well as Ultimate Ears UE11 Pro, and until recently (when I accidently stood on them) a pair of JH13 Pro's.

I've also owned various full sized cans such as HD800, AKG K701 and top Grado's. Along with that, Benchmark DAC1, Sugden Headmaster, and Grace M902.

The best combo I had heard to date was the JH13 Pro's powered by Sony PHA-2 DAc/Amp with uncompressed digital feed from Ipad/Iphone/PC..

When I had my impressions done for the JH13 Pro's several years ago, I also had a hearing test done at the same time, and discovered that after years of nightclub DJ work and shooting high powered rifles without hearing protection, the higher frequencies in my left ear were deficient by roughly 2.5 DB

Enter Shure SE846 with customisable filters. All I did was replace the neutral filter in the left ear with the white high gain filter and viola, hearing problem solved.

At this level, you audiophile's can argue nuances until you are blue in the face. These SE846's blow everything I've ever heard out of the water just out of the Iphone 6.........that's before dedicated amps.

My only complaint with the Shure's is the comfort isnt as good as customs. But until JH Audio can tune individual ears to a person's hearing test results, I will defer my Roxanne order.

The only other expense for me is a Chord Hugo.........subject to audition of course."
144,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Every so often one comes across a product which truly deserves writing a review about, so, here’s mine:
After reading so much about these IEM’s, I finally decided to get a pair for myself. I came back home and let them seat for a while in order to let the excitement pass, late in the night , before trying them out, I decided to establish a comparison point previous to the SE846 experience. I listened to “Divano” by Era, first on a set of B&W's C5 IEM’s, later on a pair on P7 headphones from the same brand (both of them great pieces of equipment which I had for some time). Once I established my reference point the time came to listen to the SHURE’s; was I in for a big surprise, the grin in my silly face couldn't begin to describe how good these were, even just out of the box, the experience was simply amazing. Sincerely I couldn't recommend them more if I wanted to. Are they worth the price? Well, let’s just stop here for a moment and consider how much would you have to spend to get comparable sound from speakers which would provide you with a similar experience and there’s your answer. As with most things related with audio, everything is relative. One thing is for sure, the B&W's will be sitting in their boxes for a while from now on.

UPDATE AFTER SIX WEEKS OF USE> Been using them almost every day for the past six weeks, with all types of music, and, with most genres, they will sound amazing, although certain types can turn out to be a bit tiresome in your ears.
I’ve read a review stating that an external amp and DAC where needed to truly experience what the S846 could achieve; IMHO, I would have to say such is not the case, the power needed to drive this IEM’s is so little that listening to with an IPhone at only 65% of the volume will be more than sufficient in most cases *(with other brands I had to turn the volume up to 90% to achieve the same results); which brings me to the point of using a receiver as an AMP/DAC with them; the difference? Barely negligible, although a bit more depth in the sound could be appreciated, it wouldn’t justify the need for carrying around a separate DAC nor an AMP for their use alongside the S846.
With the exception of classical music for which I find the B&W P7's more enjoyable and Metal which I found to be a little harsh with the S846's I would personally recommend them as great all around IEM's well worth the price."
145,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Third pair of these headphones. I hoped the problem would not be present every time. Within one year, one of the ear bud leads will start shorting out. This has happened with three pairs now. It's not a matter of cleaning. Small adjustments will help for the short term. Very much not worth your money. Quality assurance and design issues. I will waste my time or money again with this product.

Update: Within one year, left side is blown. What a waste of money."
146,5.0 out of 5 stars,"About me: Enthusiast who has just become an audiophile with this purchase. Upgraded se535's to se846's (today). Typically listened to Spotify or MP3s (320kbps) on Macbook Pro & iPhone 6S without an external Digital-to-Analog converter (DAC) and/or amp. (Updated to Tidal lossless, getting DAC/amp).

Questions I had------>

- Is there a discernible difference between the two headphones? Without a doubt. The bass. The bass. The bass. Wow. the mids & highs are perfection. You hear songs all over again. And this has been without a DAC/amp & even at 320kbps!

- Build quality? The se846's *feel* so much better constructed. I was always nervous changing the earbuds on the 535's - afraid I'd snap the plastic connector tubes (never did).

- Is it worth it? Dropping $500 on the 535's was justified at the time as ""the last headphones I'd ever buy."" And they could have been... but I was always 13% disappointed in the bass response. It was good...but I had this lingering suspicion that I was missing out (I was).

BOTTOM LINE: If you can afford the se846's, you can have the best of the best, taste the nectar of the gods. If it means your kids don't get school shoes: buy the 535's and a bottle of booze. Drink the booze to blackout, forget you ever heard of the 846 and you'll be quite happy."
147,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE 846 are spectacular !! Having owned the Shure SE 535 for the last 2 years, I have grown accustomed to the Shure sound. I loved the Se535’s however I felt they were lacking in the bass area as far as definition is concerned. The Shure SE 846 takes care of this issue and some. I did not think it was possible to get this type of sound from IEMs. Deep precise bass with outstanding Mid and High definition. No ear fatigue even after 5 hours of straight listening of varied genres, Jazz, Rock, Pop and Classical.

At 9 ohms,the iPhone 5s has no problem driving the SE 846. In fact I paired the iPhone 5s with the Apogee One v2 thur the lighting connector and there was a notable clarity in the Bass and high region, however it was not that big of a difference even with Masted for iTunes songs. However when I ran USB from my Mac BookPro thru the Apogee One, that was huge difference . Seems the iPhone 5s has a decent sound chip.

Was the upgrade from the SE 535 to the SE 846 worth the extra $500?. For me yes, especially since I have now heard the SE 846. Fact is I would have been perfectly happy with the SE 535 if I had never listened to the SE 846, but I have and now I can never go back. I use the SE 846 everyday, running, at work, at home. By far the best IEM’s I have ever heard."
148,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been enjoying my new 846 IEM's for about a week now and the minute I put them on I was completely blown away with the quality of the sound and overall experience. Certainly the highest praise is that they are so close to my high end Shure cans that it is almost impossible to tell the difference. I experimented a little to find the right tips but have kept the standard set up as far as the inserts.

Out of box experience was fabulous and consistent with what one would expect first from Shure and especially at that price point. After a few days I got spoiled and the original ""wow"" impact fades a little but then I just had to breakout my Westone W4's just to validate my opinion. Again, unbelievable the difference between the two. I would compare the difference to what the experience is between a standard pair of apple earbuds to the Westone IEMS. Analogous to going from coach to business and now to first class on a transatlantic flight."
149,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, I pulled the plug on this $1000 earphones after thinking about it long and hard. My wife drove me crazy for the first one week talking about how ridiculous I am to spend $1000 on a freaking tiny earphones. Now that part is over and I decided to write a review about it. I didn't buy in Amazon, but an authorized dealer in NYC for a substantial discount and no-tax.

I am not an audiophile by any means, but I love to hear good music (not those mileys and biebers by the way). I am an average music lover like many of you who are considering buying these expensive earphones. And obviously SE846 is a mass-market earphone targeted at most people like us and not just audiophiles or musicians alone.

Build:
Shure has done a wonderful job of creating an engineering Marvel, no doubt about it and I am proud that it's an American company (you know that when it comes to high-end headphones, its the Beyerdynamics and Sennheisers of Germany and AKGs of Austria rule, while we have Bose and Beats - not very flattering:-)).
This earphone is an epitome of fine, crafy, smart engineering. An earphone acheiving the performance level of SE846 was almost inconceivable only few years ago. Shure somehow pulled off the magic. The earphone itself is in a Crystal-clear casing which shows off its internal components in all its glory. It is a wonder to look at. Shure says that these earphones are very sturdy and I think it can take a lotta abuse without getting cracked (although you would be hard-pressed to abuse a tiny earphone that costs a grand). It's a tough and solid case for sure and will stand the test of time. The cables are replaceable and the end that connects to the casing rotates freely 360 deg for additional adjustment. Removing and re-attaching the cable is by a lock-snap mechanism and is super easy. SE846 comes with 2 cables (46"" and 64"" long, both 3.5mm gold plated plug). I picked the shorter cable for connecting to my iPod/iPhone. The cable itself is well-built but a bit stiffer by design. There is a transparent jewel case (big) and a semi-soft case for storage of earphones both at home and for travel. I always use the semi-soft case because its compact in size. Comes with enough earplug sizes and adapters (airline). All the accessories look and feel like a million dollars. Shure wants to make sure that the customers realize this is a luxury product billed at $1000. Everything you touch oozes quality. But, does it translate to superior performance for an average audio enthusiasist? Read on for my take :-)

Noise isolation:
As far noise isolation, SE846 blocks out outside noise reasonably well because of their snug in-ear fit. But, you could still hear the external environment you are in ever so slightly. Its not like the active noise cancellation in Bose QCs (by the way, BOSE is one of most overrated/overpriced headphones in the market, save for those Beats audio :-).

Fit:
You have to find the right earplug (SE846 comes with a lot of them anyway, so you will easily find one that suits you). And, u have to insert them the right way (Shure has a video in Youtube on how to fit these the right way). Now, when I dangle the wires in front of me, the fit is good but i have to be careful when I move my head. Because, sudden movements can unseal the plugs a bit, not so bad though. Shure recommends to keep the cable dangling on the back of you if you are doing some activity as they claim that the fit is more snug and the earphones won't unseal as it does with the cable in the front. I tried that but not enough time to observe how well the claim stands.

Long-term comfort:
With Over-ear phones (as good as they are with sound quality), the one complaint I always had was my ears getting warm or sweaty after prolonged (over an hour or sometimes even less) wear. But, the comfort level on SE846 is quite good. I didn't feel like I was bothered with something snugly blocking my ear canal. The design is well thought out when I compare it to my old Ultimate ears in-ear earphones. SE846 is a bit bigger because Shure had to cram all those Quad Hi-Def drivers and other components into such a tiny casing. Its a bit bulbous if you will, but not uncomfortable if you have a medium sized ear like me.

Sound quality:
Now the Sound quality. I have owned some in-ear phones in the past like Ultimate Ears Super Fi 5 Pro and Triple Fi 10. I also have a Audio-Technica M50X Over-ear headphones. And I listen to mostly Pop and rock songs. To check how good SE846 is, I compared hearing the same song (320 kbps) on M50X and SE846 using my iPod and iPhone. I know its not an apple-to-apple comparison, but I just wanted to check how much better a $1000 earphone is compared to a $150 headphone (and in my opinion, Audio Technica M50X is worth every dollar). By the way, you could definitely take the sound quality several notches up on any headphone by using the right Audio source and a Amplifier/DAC. But, I use my headphones plugged right into my iPod or iPhone or Computer without any extra in between (amp/dac). This is my realistic setup in my day-to-day life. Ok, so When I compared the song with M50X and SE846, the difference in overall quality of the sound is not that much. I know you might be surprised/shocked to hear this from me, but please keep in mind that the sound quality can be impacted by a lot of factors including the audio source, amp, quality of audio file, type of song etc., etc., I am just doing a comparison of a realistic scenario (listening straight out of a ipod/iphone) that many of us encounter on our daily life. Also keep in mind that the price of these earphones has a whopping $850 difference. Let me explain a bit more of my experience. The sound stage on M50X was broader than Shure with the highs, mids and lows clear. The lows/bass was good but not great (it's a bit shy of what you would expect). On the Shure, the first big difference I noticed was the bass; man it was pretty damn good!!!! Considering how tiny SE846 is, its mind blowing how good the lows are. I was impressed how they managed to push out so much bass into this tiny earphone. Well, the bass reproduction is Shure's industry-first technology that was achieved by having 10 stainless steel plates precision-welded together creating a 4 inch pathway enabling the low frequency roll off without any distortion (whew, lotta technical right there). The extra bass is not really extra in a sense of warm and unnatural, but in the sense of neutral and near-perfect reproduction with enough thump. Shure calls it as a 'True Subwoofer'. But, as far as the highs and mids, the sound was only marginally better than M50X. Now, thats just for one song I picked. I am sure if I sample more songs, the results may vary, favoring one earphone over the other depending on the type of song.

I listened to couple other instrumentals to see how well the clarity of all instruments sound without one canceling or overwhelming the other tone. Shure shined in that regard. You can hear every instrument with superior clarity. I heard the guitar on 'Dani California' song change subtly through out the song alternating, which I have never heard before. So, i think SE846 can reproduce all the sounds in a composition with much better clarity than M50X. I read from other reviews that SE846 even rivals many other Over-ear stalwarts like Sennheiser HD 800 in that category (clarity in sound across all bandwidth). And for the size of these earphones, that's a pretty impressive feat.

Also, this earphone has high sensitivity (114 dB SPL/mW) and very low impedence of 9 ohm which is perfectly suitable for any portable media players. No amp needed. When I crank the volume on my iPod to half, that's already high enough to hear everything loud and clear. Frequency range is pretty good at 15Hz - 20KHz. It comes with 3 filters to suit the sound signature you like. The filters can be switched within a minute or 2 using a supplied key. You can change the sound signature by selecting a Warm, Balanced or Bright filter. I am comfortable with the Balanced filter that comes factory fitted. But if you need extra bass, switch to the Warm filter and for extra treble, you could switch to the Bright filter.

Cons:
1) Obviously, the price. I don't know if the cost justifies the product. I would price them at $700 for it to be a good value proposition. (I know $700 is still high for a earphone)
2) Since my needs are to hook this thing up my ipod/iphone, my biggest complaint is that Shure did not include a cable with remote and mic. Come on Shure, for a earphone thats costs a thousand dollars, thats the least you could do. I have to shell out $50 to buy one and the reviews for Shure remote/mic is not good at all. I mean, this earphone was not designed in 2005, but 2013. Almost every other earphone in the market that caters to portable devices come with a cable with remote/mic. Its either a over sight (or) considering how smart the engineers are in Shure, this is probably deliberate to make more money by omitting an essential accessory. That's pathetic.

Value:
Ok, lets face it, these are one of the most expensive earphones money can get (i am not talking about those custom-molded ones that the music stars or professionals use, i am talking about an average person like me). I have't tried Sennheiser IE800 or AKG K300I which are direct competitors for SE846. But i have read a ton of reviews on these 3. The general consensus is that Shure SE846 is the best of the 3 in terms of overall sound quality although each one excel in different Sound category. So, if you have the extra cash lying around, go ahead buy this and u won't be disappointed. But if you think u are overstretching your budget, then these are not worth it. Its better to buy SE535 or other earphones in that price range. And, don't forget that the songs have to be in a good format (high quality) for these expensive headphones' to bring out the best. If all we listen is mp3 and stuff, the difference in sound quality between a $400 earphone and this one is very very minimal.

SE846, while they have impressive technology packed inside, for an average music lover the cost-benefit is not that good. I mean, i expected some more from these $1000 earphones, may be my expectations are very high, but hell if I dropped $1000 on an earphone, i think i deserve to atleast have high expectations. If not for the portability of these earphones, my M50X will serve me well especially for the money i spent on them ($150) - again this is a comparison of overall cost-benefit/value. I will do disservice to Shure, if I compare it with a much cheaper Audio Technica M50X, because that will be a apple-to-orange comparison as these headphones belong to completely different categories. The comparison is only to tell the readers how best can a thousand dollar in-ear earphone match up with one of the most popular over-ear headphone (M50X). My 5 Stars is for impressive technology and unbelievable sound for a in-ear form factor. But, I will take a star off for the Value."
150,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned the se535 for just a little over a year before I decided to take the plunge and buy the se846. I know many people will debate whether or not the purchase is worth the money as the se846 are nearly double the cost of the service 535. Luckily I got both at a discounted price from a local retailer in LA for around 100-150 off the Amazon price.

This isn't meant to be a detailed review but I will do the best to post my impression. Having owned the se535 for a year and a half I must say that they are one of the best pairs of earphones I have ever owned. I have been loyal with Shure for the past 6-7 years starting with their scl2 then moving to the se215 then a leap to the se535 and another gentle jump to the se846.

Around one year after I bought the se535 I decided to do the filter modification which requires buying a few audio filters from mouser online, they cost around $25 total for a bunch of different options. If you decide to go this route I recommend buying 2 sets of the lower colors (like white, grey etc). I made the filter modification to improve the bass response of the se535 which as mostpeople know is slightly muted.

Now to the review, the stock se535 vs se846. The bass on the se846 (every review you read mentions this) is miles ahead of the se535 using the blue customizable tips. To me the black were too muddy to be utilized but are aimed at providing more bass. The bass itself is clean punchy and deep on tracks with subbass. I recommend understanding the fit of the headphones and getting a good seal before dismissing the bass as lacking. Each person is different but for me the westone star olives worked well. All the other notes are slightly above the se535 in reproduction as expected. The white filters emphasis how much clearer these are.

Now after making the filter mod to the se535, the playing field levels a bit. The 535 definitely have a deeper base and soundstage after going to the grey filters while not sacrificing the mid and highs. I recommend anyone who has the se535 and wants the se846 to carefully attempt this mod. It may be adequate enough to keep you from splurging on these headphones.

In the end, if you're a first time buyer and $500 doesn't make a huge difference to you. Buy the se846. If you're on a budget and cannot see spending a grand on headphones, buy the se535 and do a filter mod with a good fit. I know there are other alternatives on the planet (westone etc) and I recommend you review those options thoroughly. Over the war headphones will always produce better sound and specialization but these se846 imho are as close as you can get to that same reproduction, sometimes when wearing them you will wonder if you are actually hearing things from outside the earphones (speakers in the room also playing the music??) But in reality you aren't."
151,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me apply a perspective whereas to me these are a great value. I travel weekly, and when I am home have a little time to sit and relax listening to music i enjoy. I have to eek out my enjoyment on the road, walking through airports, in hotels, the fitness center and in the cube at work! I usually carry 2-3 pair headphones, full size travel, like the Ultrasone Palladium Ed 8, then some various smaller ones, Shure, or Bose etc. From the moment i put these on i could tell, i have the Soundstage, liquidity, definition, orchestral balance, nearing my open back HD800, with over $3000..00 of amping and source equipment attached, all coming from a single portable source. I a package no bigger than a deck of cards, I have audio I can enjoy anytime anywhere, + comfortable fit, + isolation (no need for noise canceling,) + durable and sweat resistance, IEMs, and then the engineering achievement, of putting all this, in a tiny package! The bass of these earphones IS the true achievement, it is a visceral achievement and experience. By the way I also play some guitar, and have a feel and ear for music and production as well as reproduction. Don't want to ramble, but I have been listening to high-end audio, since the days of the B&O radial Turntable and Marrantz Amps with Bose speakers; and have bought more headphones across thirteen years of travel; and several more money than these Shure, and nothing touches them. The only experience which i enjoy, which is not better, just different, are my open back Sennheiser HD800 in Balanced mode!
I wish I have never written so many positive headphone reviews across the years, and saved that 5th star, for these!"
152,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got them a week ago and the sound is amazing, I got the Shure SE535 too and the sound is very different, the Shure SE535 have almost the same sound in classical music but in every else the SE846 are better. You can customize the sound without use an EQ that's perfect when you have a HF balanced player you really doesn't need a digital EQ.

They are very expensive and the sound stage could be better.

Amazing with DSD music (the sound stage is spacious and much better)

Perfect to listening pop, opera, hip hop and orchestral music."
153,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried or owned more or less every $1,000 to $2,500 IEM out there today, Noble K10, the top of Jerry Harvey's line, Sennheisers . . . and these Shures are in that class, and might be the best of the bunch depending on your tastes.

1. They have razor sharp clarity, especially with vocals (mainly, I think, due to Shure's history and their signature mid-treble hump). Much better than some top of the line brands that have a slightly veiled sound. Wearing these, I've come to understand lyrics that I had previously misheard. If you have a hearing test, wear these to pass!

2. They are **actually** neutral, unlike other high-end IEMs that claim to be neutral but in reality have a slightly warm sound signature without enough sparkly treble (but note there are even brighter IEMs out there, such as the AKG 3003 and possibly the Sennheiser IE 800, and of course you might want a warmer headphone. It all depends on your tastes. These with the white filters work for me on the warm to bright spectrum.)

3. They have good bass. If I were to characterize their sound signature, I would say lots of deep (sub 100 hz) bass and lots of mid-treble. The JH Audio Roxannes are better [possibly the best in the world, even better than the K10 and Layla] with drum and tom sounds but the SE846's are good with the electronically generated bass sounds that you hear in music today -- which is synthetically generated by computers, as opposed to being created by banging a drumstick against a surface.

4. They have excellent 3D presentation. With these the sound is sometimes right in your ears, sometimes 6"" away from your ears to the left, right, sometimes inside your head, sometimes above, sometimes below.

5. They do not stick out from your ears unlike other large high-end IEMs, and they are not uncomfortable at all (with my ears and my tips. the comfort issue could be different for you).

6. They isolate as well as foam earplugs (if you use the foam earplug comply tip).

The only caveats are that:

1. You have to get the right tips for your ear canal. I use Comply P-Series medium, which sounds significantly better than other tips, for me. They even sound noticeably better than the Comply P-Series Slim, which is the exact same tip but only a millimeter or two thinner. That should tell you how important it is to get the precisely perfect tip. The tip could make or break this IEM for you. With other tips, I wouldn't like this IEM nearly as much.

2. You need the right source as well to get the best out of it, and make sure it's something with low impedance. But at the same time, this sounds great with just your phone's output jack. I opt for a neutral/slightly warmish sounding source for the SE846. I use the bright filter so a bright dac may be too much. The source will also impact the bass this puts out; for example, with the ESS 9023 dac, you get tons of bass. Update: For the first time, I tried the black filter. It wasn't nearly as warm as I thought it would be, and this might be the true neutral filter; might have to use this going forward!

3. I only listen to pop music, so I can't vouch for these with classical, jazz or other types of music.

4. Finally, please do not judge this or any headphone until you listen it for two hours straight. You need to give yourself time to get used to a new headphone's style.

In summary, unlike full-sized headphones and speakers, inner ear monitors are very sensitive to the tips you use, your ear canal and the player -- but if you can solve these, the SE846 is an outstanding option."
154,5.0 out of 5 stars,"From the moment you first use the Shure 846's the rich base and full sound will be the number one impression of these.
The kit is painfully expensive, but if you are reading this you probably already figured out that you simply can't get bunch base guitar music from IEM's for less. (In Ear Monitors)

Im puzzled how many people feel these are barely a step up from the 535's Ive been listening to these since the 500's years ago, and the 846 base is far richer, it is possible the 535's mid-range is a smidge more detailed, but overall the stage of full sound picture on the 846's are far better and more satisfying. on the 535's I've always had the low end lifted to get a bit more punch, but they just never could deliver a full contrabass experience, the 846 can, its that simple.

The complete kit comes in a sealed cardboard box that can not be opened without being destroyed, guess at least you know its never been opened by somebody before which can be a good thing. inside the box is a Apple-ish black box with the full kit and the transparent travel case for the full kit. there is a zipper case with the fit-kit, personally I prefer the medium memory foams, but for external sound dampening find that the yellow's are the ticket.

For best full sound, remember to noodle the foams, really thin, then tuck into the ear canal and hold for maybe 4-5 seconds while the foam expand and kinda lock the monitor in place. bam, now you got the full audio experience. only saying this because a lot of folks new to Shure's simply just push the monitors in a little and hang the wire over the ear, thats not enough, you want to get a complete seal for best audio.

Are they worth $999 ??? hard to say, depend what you want from your music, I love acoustic music and want to hear the music without loosing the base strings. But more importantly, noise dampening headphones and in-ear-monitors are part of my everyday life, both for enjoyment and work, so for me, its pennies a day for awesome audio.. hard to beat. if you only listen at home, a pair of over the head cans may be a far better investment, but if you listen while active in-ear-monitors are hard to beat."
155,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I probably would consider myself an audiophile since I am a musician and avid music listener. Further I have tried most high end iems on the market and seem to fall in love with Shure. I have owned 215, 315, 535 and now the 846. I bought the 535s based on many reviews I had read that put them in the top 3. Unfortunatly I felt the 535 lacked punch and low end. Some may call this true balance, however if felt like too much middle for me. The 846 is a perfect blend of a balanced clear sound with a punchy bass and clear low ends when needed. Basically exactly what the 535s were missing in my opinion. So far I absolutly love them. You will not regret the sound quality, however it does come at a price!"
156,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A stunning piece of audio equipment. Shure - I congratulate you. Expensive, but worth the investment. This earphone is jaw-dropping in every way. I cannot find fault in the sound signature; sonically, it does everything to another level. You'll hear detail, texture and tightness across the frequency range that will astound you. Highs are beautifully airy, mids are forward and superbly detailed and bass is tight and punchy with a superb low filer pass keeping all the low end contained in the right frequency range with no bleeding into the mids.

Tons of accessories, and many options on ear tips which means most people will be able to find the perfect fit for great sound isolation.

Conclusion: for my sound preference - this is audio nirvana (but do audition if possible as audio tastes are very subjective!)"
157,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ill keep my review short and say this. If you currently own se535 or Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 and feel as if the lows are lacking these are for you! Ive never heard bass reproduction done this well for a iem. 100% worth the price, I find myself using these for working out, snowboarding, dirtbiking and they are constructed well. The cable is okay in terms of being rugged and is the same as the one supplied with 535's. Paired with a iphone 6 and soundcloud 100% of the time."

And about my listening experience, I'm comming from Marshall Major special edition, Beats by Dr dree Solo version, Beats Studio version and Beats Pro Special edition Detox version. Exceptionnal sound quality with natural and flawless music listening experience.

First song that I've played:

Broken Spectre by Tipper. Album (Broken Soul Jamboree).
I was smiling when I've played the song, so clear, normal mids , normal bass, normal treble, exceptional guys, and after reaching the 2min07s part of the song, I was so surprised , I heard so so so so so many instruments I was unable to hear with all my headphones before.
The instruments are fading through your brain and going from left to right side of your head. Amazing

SHURE is so SURE guys. I recommend these."
161,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first step into ""audiophile"" headphones were the Shure E4C's which I purchased used nearly 7 years ago and they work perfectly still to this day! However I was so curious about upgrading to a better headphone. I was going to go after the Shure SE535, but I never had the money. Then I finally accrued enough money for the SE535. When I was about to pull the trigger on it, the SE846 was announced. I then decided if I was going to upgrade my headphones, then I'd make a big upgrade.

After nearly 7 months I purchased a set of new SE846's from eBay for $800. Honestly these are the best headphones I have ever listened to! I personally use the short cable and the yellow ear-tips because those were the ones I used with my e4c's and they gave me the best seal.

Everything about these headphones are great! The overall look, feel and quality is top-notch. Initially they were extremely cumbersome to get on because the design was so much radically different from my e4c's. I just couldn't do it. It took me literally 40 minutes to achieve a good fit. However after figuring that out, I can now get them in within seconds, so there is a learning curve there. The sound is phenomenal. To my ears these sound better then all of the Grado headphones I have owned (RS1i, GS1000i and PS1000's) mainly because you are completely isolated from the world. The soundstage doesn't compare to those over the ear headphones, however the lows, mids and highs are just as excellent if not better. The ""true subwoofer"" on the SE846 is nice and subtle. It isn't overpowering and it doesn't hit ""deep"" like I thought it would, however there is just the right amount of punch and it is a good tight punch; not muddy at all.

My only con is the warranty. With such a high investment these headphones should carry a 5 year warranty in my opinion. Now, with the proper handling and care I expect these headphones to last 10+ years, however the peace of mind would have been nice. Like I said my E4c's are just over 7 years old and they still operate perfectly so I'm not overly worried.

Anyone willing to drop a grand on headphones I would give these a look...they're excellent and well worth the investment."
162,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried all of the top end ear phones, and these were head and shoulders above. Quality is second to none, sound same. I bought them in Japan at Bic Camera and got duty free pricing which further sweetened the deal. I just pray I never lose them as I'll likely get a heart attack if I do."
163,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, I have been a Shure buyer for a long time now. Their products have always been amazing, then I decided it was time to upgrade my earphones. Based on reviews, I decided to buy these. At first, ordered it from Amazon open box provider. But it just didn't sound ok to me ( it wasn't even up to my SE535), so I returned it and ordered brand new from Amazon. To my surprise, the left earplug will just not play. Not sure if this was just my luck, but the quality is just not there, specially considering the price for these. Very disappointed."
164,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lets start by saying I am a huge Shure fan. I started out with the E2C's, then moved on to the SE210's, then the SE310's, then the SE420's (Fab), then the SE535's. Whilst I did like the 535's for its bass, after a while I found there was just something missing from them in terms of detail and midrange compared to the SE420's so I sold them and brought a pair of SE425's (Which I personally think are better value for money than the 535's - less bass but more detail and midrange). Then Shure announced the SE846, I was hoping that these solved the bass issue of the SE425 without drowning out the other elements as well as the the detail. Did they fix my gripe? HELL YES! These have just blown me away! They are the most natural sounding headphones/earphones I have ever listened to and to add to it the detail compared to the SE425 is just mind blowing! You get moments where you just smile hearing something never heard before. The bass is controlled and not overbearing in your ear like some earphones I have heard. Everything is perfectly balanced. I have thrown every kind of music I own at them and they never fail to impress. I am only listening to them via an iPhone, I'm scared to play them via a portable headphone amp as I know I will like it but can I justify spending another x hundred dollars? Time will tell :)"
165,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently bought SE846 along with Oppo HA-2 and could not believe my ears. Quality of sound I got is close to my 30k music system. I would highly recommend to buy a good doc like Oppo HA-2 if you want to get the best out of these amazing Earphones. Sound is natural, bass is tight and highs are excellent without any hint of harshness. Almost feels like flat response across all frequency range."
166,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the Best Earphone that ever listened. Specially size is very small than SE215CL one. A little bit weight than SE215CL one!
I have no wards to explain the quality of Sound of this. I am re-listening all the albums again because all music creations included lots of extra sound effects that I never heard before!

These Shure sound amazing!

Holy jumpin. The first song I played on these was a vinyl rip of Boston - More than a feeling.. And my jaw sank. This is the start of a journey and the end of one. I had the Sennheiser IE-800's before these Shure's These Shure's make those Sennheisers sound like beats. Compared, highs were a bit harsh on the Sennheiser sounding near artificial, but not too far off par ( my ear is veryyyy picky) On the shures, they are jsut short of transparent, with a slight lack on the extension. I use the neutral filters, with an oh so slight-slight treble enhancement to get my treble to my taste on the EQ.

Overall I'm just flabbergasted.. they are truly one of a kind. The , the mids as if you're in a front row at a concert. Well maybe 4 rows back. But still, the live soundstage Shure tuned these to gives me chills for ear buds. Well only the first couple times I heard them. Now my ears are expecting the same and better. As will yours. (Disclaimer below)...

Anyway now that you've had fun scrolling around looking for disclaimers (unless you read in order),

The bass on these suckers is so accurate it might just blow your brains. Near absolute zero distortion for the low end. Prepare for some of the most accurate bass you may have ever encountered. And it extends low... Oh man do they mean true subwoofer performance.

The mids are so pleasant and fun to listen to. They almost make you want to sing along,... well if your at some privacy.
They are so fun. That's all I can describe them. Fun and sing alongy.

The highs smash where they should (referring to drums and cymbals), behind the mids, and these buds soundstage is mind-blowing. Yes even drums come from behind the vocal. You can audibly hear that difference. Its amazing. Oh yeah did I mention instrument placement is spectacular????? Mind-blowing.

These MF'ers sing like a heavenly trumpet when you feed them 24 bit audio... my oh my and in that jay river media center program, you can get 32 bit audio support... if you have the proper hardware....

You just gotta get these... they just get better and better the more you listen to them. And you'll find yourself singing along most of the time, and if I bet you won't even realize it and someone will mention to you that you were singing loudly. Idk...

So yeah I just became a fan of Shure from zero to.. Well how ever many days the shipment took I guess.

.....AND
I can't.. come up... with any cons....

IDK if this is the best ear-bud in the world, but someone put this flagship masterpiece next to the FitEar 337. It'll be uber close. CAN IT GET BETTER?!......

Not worth my time, thats how good I declare these Shure's. And I'm taking a rest. These Shure's are my kinda buds.
They are my twins. Baby them like cash. You deserve this investment.

177,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are simply the best music listening devices I have ever heard/owned! I picked up a pair of these during an over seas trip to Bangkok in December 2014 and pretty much blew my entire holiday budget on them and I have to say it was completely worth it!

In short these are the pros:
+ impressively small form factor
+ unbelievably good sound
+ good build quality
+ replaceable ear buds and connector cables
+ unassuming appearance (Some may consider this a con, but this has saved my pair from being stolen more than once!)
+ sounds amazing even without a high quality DAC

and the cons:
- Takes a few seconds to put on properly
- Expensive?

Ok so now for a bit more detail. First of all I am no audio expert, but I do appreciate good quality sound, or at least have been learning to appreciate it over the past few years. I haven't owned many pairs of high quality headphones, in fact before these SE846s I've only owned a pair of Beats Studios which I consider to have reasonably good sound quality but are horribly over-priced... But other than that I've also tested out the Sennheiser HD800s at CES 2013. So in terms of sound quality I'd definately have to say that the SE846s come out on top, for me the HD800s were surprisingly underwhelming... Though I'm fairly certain it's because what ever Sennheiser was using to drive them at the show wasn't cutting it. The sound was super accurate like the SE846s but it just seemed to lack the punch the SE846s had, at least in the setup that Sennheiser provided. Then if you consider the HD800s $1,500 price tag, the SE846s seem like a bargain considering they work well without an external DAC and have a much much smaller form factor.

The main reason why I love these headphones is because I listen to music when I'm on the go a lot, these are also perfect for the gym. The sound isolation is great, at least with the default foam buds, and they're also very comfortable. They work so well without even playing music that i found myself using them as ear plugs during long flights. Though i think comfort will vary depending on your ears. Even when stowed in the awesome mini-pouch they still fit in my pocket easily and I pretty much carry them around with me at all times, something i couldn't do with my Beats.

Now the second reason why i love these is because of build quality and just the build design in general. A problem i had with my Beats is that the leather and material pieces on the headphones themselves began to wear and get dirty with age. The headphones clearly hadn't been designed to be cleanable or have replaceable parts and that's rendered them pretty worthless now (The included Monster Cables were even more terrible in terms of durability)... This isn't an issue with the SE846s due to the seriously no-frills/practical design. There simply isn't anything on these things that seem like they could wear at all... Even the replaceable cables seem so tough that they will probably never need to be replaced, even if you carried them around without the mini-pouch.

I guess lastly i should mention the sound quality... These simply blew me away, the sound is crystal clear, it literally sounds like i'm sitting in the recording studio listening to the artists perform right in front of me... As a consequence though these can also bring out the worst in your music, any noise or artifacts in your music become blatantly obvious and once you get used to these things, every other headphone is just not good enough anymore...

I don't know if these are the best in-ear headphones you can buy, there may be cheaper ones with similar quality, but i'd be amazed if there's anything that can sound better, at least with current mobile/pc grade DACs"
178,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best sounding headphones I ever heard at any price. I bought them to go with my Ibasso DX90 and the synergy between the two is delicious!
There really aren't any flaws with this earphone, its just a matter of taste if you prefer something a little different. But I love it and I cant imagine anyone buying this thing and thinking it doesn't sound great. I had a se535 (still do I guess) but this sounds much better. Now the se535 sits in my drawer."

187,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these after much research....and am very happy with build quality and sonic soundscape. Was not an easy purchase...

I recently sold my 1992 BMW 850 car for 1000... While it originally listed for 90k- its recent radical devaluation (based on its remarkable bad quality) helped fund my purchase of these magnificent earbuds cables and provided change for some expensive gold plated hdmi cables. At a whim , I also purchased a set of AudiOHM RNF Army Green Ergonomic Headphones for 19.95. Lifetime guarantee, and they sound nice - but they prob. can't compare to 1k ear buds.

These are great sounding ear buds.... ear buds. My 95.00 Sony studio closed ear phones beat these by far. Subwoofer in an earbud? If you have the money to spend on a less than optimal architecture (earbuds)- go for it."

Im not saying these are bad because they are not at all, they do sound great but i was expecting more. I have ran these off my benchmark dac2 hgc and again the clarity, air and soundstage of the main hifi or my kef x300a office speakers just isnt there.

Expect great sound but not miracles, my se530 with eq set to trebble enhancer or jazz sounded not far off at all.

I am not saying these earphones are bad, but you can't use them with Phone or laptop without a DAP and AMP, because you will not get the results these IEM are made for. If someone is saying or suggesting that these earphones will wow you when you will use them standalone with your phone or laptop he/she is lying. So if you decide to go for these earphones I hope you have budget for $ 2000, as you will need a DAP and AMP (portables are also available) as well."

196,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound Quality: 5 stars
Build Quality: 4 stars

I give it 5 stars for sound quality. I have never heard any IEM that sound as good as these. I have tried many from cheap ones to more expensive ones and never could find one that satisfied me. I own many high end over the ear headphones too. I have to say these give even some of my higher end full size headphones a run for there money. However, IEM will never have the sound stage when compared to over the ear open headphones. However, these little IEM has very clear rich full vocals, clean crisp highs (no sibilance), and deep tight controlled bass. The sound is amazing for in ear.

Now the reason I gave only 4 stars for build quality is because the cable it came with. The cable is very stiff which makes it difficult to deal with at times. Even when I put it over my ear; I have a difficult time getting the cable to settle properly due to the stiffness. Also, I have big ear canals and I could not find an ear tip that would form the tightest seal. Additionally, taking off the ear tips was very very difficult to the point I almost ruined the first set of ear tips that came originally on the IEM. I even called Shure to help me. They instructed me to put the IEMs in the freezer for a little bit to see if it helps to take off the ear tips.

Overall, I ended up selling these because in all honesty, I could not justify spending 1000 dollars on a pair of IEMs that are capable of breaking. If these were more durable, like sweat proof and can be used for sports as well then I would have kept these. The only time I would need IEMs are for the gym or if I happen to be out at a coffee shop to do some work. I would never wear these at the gym and I have been through many IEMs. Seems IEMs are more prone to breaking due to its small size and how its handled and used. On the plus side, it looks like every part can be replaced. Therefore, if one of your drivers go bad; I'm sure you could just replace one of the drivers but probably will be costly. I recommend these to people who travel a lot or out doing work in coffee shops or public places a lot. I would not use IEMs for home use. Over the ear headphones will always have an advantage for sound and comfort IMO."
197,1.0 out of 5 stars,"But decided it deserved this because of price.
seriously, what is going on? My audio files are 320kpbs, but why is there a slight buzzing sound in every song? It is only at certain points of the songs and very subtle but it is there and it bothers me.
It took me over 5 minutes to get them in my ears without falling out. They are very uncomfortable to use.
My monster turbines were way better than these in every aspect.

I would have attributed not liking the sound coming off of these being that i'm not an audiophile connoisseur, but that buzzing and the physical discomfort made these a pain to use.

I am thinking that it ""may"" be a faulty earbud (only one had the buzzing) but i think i'd pass on finding out for sure."
198,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't even think about it... Returned after a week of letting them burn in.. Had a great seal with Compy Foam tips as well.. Save your money and buy Bose soundtrues or soundsports. Earbuds will never conpare to headphones, and neither will ever compare to speakers... This we may simply have to accept... If any of you out there are willing to spend this kind of money on earphones and don't yet have a speaker system.. Your priorities are misguided. Spend just 800$ on a full 5.1 system with a solid receiver and change your life.

In fairness, the bass is as advertised for the 846's... Stellar for IEM's.. Best I've heard. But then again - my 5 year old SONY XB700's (over-ear) that were less than 100$ at the time of purchase have better bass and are generally twice as fun to listen to with a much much better soundstage. Really though... Priorities......

Would only recommend if 1k$ isn't a lot of money to you.

Edit: Hate to do this to Shure but my new Bose SoundTrue Ultra's, for 150$, regardless of their 3.5 stars on amazon... Are 10x better of a purchase. Take my word."

205,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the International version yesterday. The headphones sound pretty well but I did expect much more than this. Previously I used a pair of Nocs NS800 headphones. Lasted more than 5 years. When in comes to sound quality, besides the bass the 2 are comparable but the price for the NOCS headphones is 130$ and these were 870$. Also the headphones are uncomfortable and chunky. I also own a pair of over the ear headphones from Sony (XB950N1). For me the sound quality for the Sony headphones is so much better. The bass is way better and the mids and highs sound the same. The headphones are much more comfortable, wireless, active noise canceling and the price is about 130$. Do yourself a favour and don't buy these way overpriced headphones. I'm going to return them as soon as possible."
206,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm surprise at all the 5 stars reviews on this iem. The 846 is good but definitely not a 5 star. 5 star should mean you can hear every minut detail on all the spectrum along with a proper quick delivery of frequency. The 846 is far from that. The 846 shines with good with low frequency basr however the tech behind it is not enough that it feels fast and detail. It's kind of a muddy bass. The mids shines as well but everything else like the micro detail gets covered and muffled. So all in all, you get a good mid and base iem without the rest. No sound stage, no airyness, or detail. Definitely not a 5 star."

I then proceeded to open the packaging and instantly placed them in my ears to find as a i played a song it seemed to transport me to this world of music videos from the 90s from dancing with MJ to laying beats with lil Wayne these puppies were awesome. I now wear them to work everyday as I am mailman it really drowns out the barking dogs.

209,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I came to Amazon today to find an inexpensive yet decent pair of earbuds to wear at work, since using my bluetooth headphones would entail my cell, and I do not like constantly charging my big screen phone. Anyway, I saw these and became intrigued! So many wonderful reviews, and even pictures the buyers posted showing their super product. As I gazed through pictures of the earbuds on 10 year old cell phones on faux wooden tables, I pondered how I could ever afford such fine product. Then I conceived (a thought, silly) that I shall do what these buyers obviously did - I will not buy a new cell phone for the next 5 years and instead purchase this at the end of the 5 years! I'm sure they do not regret keeping their decade-old devices to be able to afford these earbuds. Therefore, not a positive nor a negative review will be left today. Instead, I will update my review in 5 years after I save my money from not getting a new device and will be able to pay 1k for earbuds (hopefully they won't be 2k by then). I will just need to be certain that I do not roll over the wire with my chair as I have done with my previous 100 or so earbuds at work."
210,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This SHURE se-846 sound so so. If you think this, you spend 1000$, right? Based on this 1000$, it totally does not worth it.

SE846 is very picky on some kind of music, if you not heard that type of music, totally waste of you 1000$, if you listen that type of music, I also don't think it worth it since all ear buds can performance better on that type of music.

I use it do songs, violins, piano, jazz, pop, drama, movie, it is just few hundred dollars earbuds, worth current market about $500, but sold at 1000$.

My next purchase was the Shure SE535 series which I still possess. Coming to the Shure SE 848-CL, well, wow! Firstly, there's simply no comparison between the 848 and 535. I would say that the sound quality is a full 100% better and I have absolutely no regret in shelling out almost a 100% more for the 848. I have attended various concerts by Roger Waters (Pink Floyd) and I can tell you that at times it's difficult to make out whether you are sitting at home or are at the concert. All that is missing is the feeling of the sound from the speakers at the concert hitting you in the chest and it would be impossible to know the difference. It's almost as if the sound is flying of the instruments. Truly worth the price in my opinion, but do keep my preface in mind."

229,5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATED AND EDITED REVIEW ? : BE AWARE THAT I DO NOT WRITE 'FAN-BOY' REVIEWS. I TEND TO BE HYPERCRITICAL. SO WITH THAT IN MIND, READ THIS UPDATED REVIEW:

Since purchasing the 846's in February 2015, I have used them almost on a daily basis. In my opinion, these IEM's sound outstanding across the various genres that I tend listening to: EDM, Adult, Alternative Rock and Singer-Songwriter. They reproduce sounds that were ""not there"" before Using other well-rewpcted p. COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES THAT I OWN OR HAVE OWNED, THE 846's SEEM TO REPRODUCE MUSICAL ELEMENTS THAT WERE NOT APPARENT BEFORE.

AS TIME GOES BY I FIND MYSELF ENJOYING THE 846's MORE AND MORE EACH DAY. MUSIC IS CLEAR AND DYNAMIC. SOUNDSTAGE IS WIDE EXTENDING BEYOND THE HEAD AND INSTRUMENTS AND VOCALS ARE LOCALIZED. BASS HAS IMPACT AND SOUNDS NATURAL EVEN WHEN LISTENING TO 'UNNATURAL' BASS-HEAVY EDM. THE PHONE'S PARTICULARLY SHINE WHEN LISTENING TO ACCOUSTIC MUSIC.

There is [WAS] a caveat (and the [PREVIOUS] reason for a one-star deduction) is that sound isolation is, at best, modest in noisy environments such as the New York Subway and on city streets. One possible explanation is: After trying the various ear-tips included with the phones and having purchased additional ones made by Shure and Comply, I have yet to get a confident and tight fit. In addition, I find inserting the 846's a bit of a hassle. [I HAVE REASSESSED THE ABOVE SITUATION. I AM NOT SURE WHY BUT THE FIT IS NOW PERFECT USING THE TREE-STYLE TIPS. ISOLATION IS NOW AS EXPECTED. IT DID TAKE TIME GETTING USE TO IT BUT INSERTING THE PHONES ARE ALMOST SECOND NATURE NOW! ]

After a couple [FIVE] months listening to music through the 846's and [STILL] working through the guilty feelings I still have for spending so much money {ON EARPHONES] , I can still [MORE THAN EVER] recommend the Shure's very highly. IN FACT, I CAN NOW ""AWARD"" THE SHURE 846's A WELL DESRVED ""FIVE-STAR"" RATING. I WILL SHORTLY PROVIDE READERS WITH A MORE THOROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THE 846's MUSICALITY.

FOR REFERENCE, I USE THE 846's WITH iPHONE 5C, iPAD 2. MUSIC IS SOURCED FROM APPLE MUSIC, iTUNES, SPOTIFY, TIDAL, SIRIUSXM. COMPARED PHONES INCLUDE KLIPSCH 10 i, B & W P3 AND P7, SHURE 4c, AND AKG Y50. HOME REFERENCE SYSTEM INCLUDES CAMBRIDGE AUDIO AZUR 650A AMPLIFIER AND VANDERSTEEN 2ci LOUDSPEAKERS."

Lets just say that i am VERY happy with the product i received. The bass is incredibly detailed and packs a punch, but I never felt fatigued or overwhelmed by it like my IE80s. The voices sound crystal clear and smooth, it is almost like having them sing right next to you and the instruments...oh man i can hear tiny details i never noticed before. I always thought the IE80s were a good IEM, but after hearing the SE846, I am a Shure believer now :P...also i hear this thing pairs very well with the IPOD touch 5th generation"
236,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These 'phones beat out the W60, SE535, W40, SE425, and iSine10, only to lose to the Etymotic ER4SR.

The SE846 proved a worthy adversary with impressive sub bass (20-30hz), decent isolation, comfort, and clarity throughout the frequency range. Too much bass, not enough upper mids, a cable that feels like a coat hanger, and the price... no thanks.

The ER4SRs just did it better, and for less.

*A comment on bass. I tried the ER4XR, and enjoyed it for a while, but the more I listened, the more I could hear its accentuated bass. I thought, maybe it's neutral frequency response and low distortion that make for audio nirvana. After testing the ER4SR, the XR's neutral sister, kick drums and basses are now balanced in the mix, and not distracting."
237,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, if you are not ok with spending a $1000 dollars for in-ear headphones, then you should stop reading now. But if you are, and you appreciate amazing sound, then read on...

I have been using these for a month exactly now and I am still blown away when I listen to music I've listened to thousands of times with these headphones. The clarity of each instrument is amazing and I hear new things in the recording every time I listen. Much is made of the bass performance on these and I can attest to the reviews, they are not lying in the least. The bass performs like you are listening to a system with a dedicated subwoofer, but it does not overpower the sound at all. It is nice, tight, clean bass that fits very well into the mix. The soundstage is excellent on these and the sound is rich and full no matter what type of music you are listening to. The sound is excellent, even at lower volumes, and these headphones don't require you to crank the volume up high to listen, and I often find I keep the volume lower than I did with my previous headhphones, which were the Shure SE215k's because these are the top of the line in performance as many other reviewers have stated.

The swappable filters are a great option with this set of phones as well. I prefer the neutral set that comes pre-installed, but the warm and bright filters sound good as well, so there's an option for those with any listening preference. And it really doesn't take much time to swap them, it is practically fool-proof, just read the instructions and you are good to go!

These come with many different accessories, from multiple sets and types of eartips, to various cabling adapters and even a large hard case and cleaning cloth. The one upgrade I can say is that I don't prefer the standard foam tips that come with these, they are slightly uncomfortable after long listening periods. I bought the Comply brand memory foam tips and now I can listen for hours with no problems, so I would recommend getting those instead of using the stock tips if you want memory foam ones.

Shure has found a customer for life in me because of the original set of 215's I have and now these. In fact, I just ordered a pair of the SRH1540's and am looking forward to comparing those with the 846's. I have no doubts I'll continue to be in aural heaven thanks to Shure and their outstanding headphones!"
238,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is as good as in-ear sound gets. I have owned more different IEMs than the law should allow, and these are in a different class. The bass is everything you have heard abot, but never over-powering."
239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The IE800s are much better than the se846s, I tested, tried both, and the IE800s are the definite, clear winner. The se846s have good bass, vocals and mids but are missing the highs which enable you to hear beautiful sounding cymbals clearly. the IE800s frenquency range is also superior, LOW END 8HZ HIGH END 46,000 HKZ, compared to the se846s 15HZ to 20,000 HKZ, case closed! Please try, test the IE800s before you buy, you will thank me. The IE800s are under $600.00 dollars on Amazon. The price has gone down because the cable is not replaceable at the earbud body, it is only replaceable where you almost always get a short in the wire, at the 3.5 plug in, it is also very rare to have problems with the cable at the earphone body. The other bad rap these amazing earphones get, is its microphonics, which is easily remedied with a clip. The shorter cable is great for keeping it from getting hooked on things, and you can wear them all day long without noticing that you have them in your ears, PLUS THE IE800s take only 3 seconds to put in and one second to take out. There is absolutely no tangling of the kevlar reinforced cable. Also check out the reviews on YOUTUBE. The sound of the se846 sounds great but it is like you are listening under water to get the great bass sound. The ie800s sound airy and breathable with out of this world incredible sound."
240,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely superb I tra war monitors, with superb bass and extended response. Got best results use a balanced cable and a player with balanced headphone output."
241,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited over a year to get it and when I finally got it, I can say it does sound crisp and clear. My only complaint was that it was too large for my ear. Even the small tips wouldn't help it stay in the ear. Also, the wire were too bulky and long for me; it kept moving as I walked. Another complaint I had was it may not sound the way you hope it would without amplifiers. Headphone AMPS cost more than $200, so if your looking to buy the Se846, beware. I wish it had a small microamplifier that attached inside the wires. But it might take years for this technology to come around. Till then, I'll stick with the Se215 which is cheaper and has a better sound stage, IMO.

P.S. Hope the next IEMs Shure developes have triple quad microdrivers with a high def microamplifier; wireless would be awesome too."
242,5.0 out of 5 stars,By far the best headphones I have owned to date. These sound amazing as it is when using them paired with your phone but when you use an external DAC using a digital to digital connection the performance is unparalleled. The treble is as clear as can be while the mids are beyond perfect and the lows are deep and rich in bass. Overall I'm blown away by what such a small device can deliver. Shure has surpassed my expectations with these headphones. I truly recommend these to audiophiles or professionals in search for true sound performance from an in ear monitor. The only complain I have is that I didn't own these sooner. Can't wait to see what shure delivers next.
243,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely superb sound quality. It doesn’t get better than this. Three years (and counting) of ownership, and I’m still continually impressed. There’s
nothing better in this price range."
244,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound if you want in ear headphones with great sound and can afford them indulge yourself with these ear buds.
245,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, a good earbud, but let down by quality control issues.
Last month, Amazon stopped selling these buds while they sorted through these issues. My manufacturing date was DEC2013, and this must be the bad batch.
My right side earbud has a static/buzzing sound that occurs at medium to low volumes and at the 100-300Hz range. I changed the filter on the one side and the buzz still remained. I also tried 3 other sources and determined that the flaw was definitely in the Earbud.
So, for $1000, this is a poor showing. I gave 3 stars because the quality was 1-star and the performance was 4-stars.
Sound quality:
Most of the reviews here are pretty accurate. Review is with the stock neutral filter (blue)
Highs are slightly subdued but still adequate. The recessed highs produce a nice, non-fatiguing sound that can be listened to for hours. There is a lack of ""shimmer"" to the highs however. Using the white filter makes up for this nicely.
Mids are wonderful. Up-front and intimate. Not effected by bass levels either. Probably the nicest part of this earbud!
The bass is also very nice. Extended and clean as can be. Decent impact puts it above most Balanced armature drivers. This is the first of this type that I have heard that can convey the weight and realism of bass like a dynamic driver model.
isolation-Very good
Comfort- OK, but be warned that these are pretty big and may Pinch on small ears.

But, be wary of the quality issues. Several message boards are seeing a high rate of reported failures of these buds. Seems like the right earbud is always the problem. For $1000, they should be better made!"
246,5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound great as they should but the cables have a really bad smell to them. I scrubbed them with scented soap and it helped a little but they still smell.I really like the sound and would hate to have to return them. Does anyone have any suggestions? Been afraid to try anything else as I don't want to harm the cables.
247,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best sound all around. After owning the se 315 ,se425, se535. The se315 has nice bass and good sounding mids , ok highs. The se425 lacked melodic sound it was very accurate , almost no bass was emitted to my ear. The se535 is a great triple balanced armature with much better low end than the se425. The y are midcentric which I enjoyed, the highs were slightly rolled off and the bass was pretty good, but not poweful enough for my taste. The portable audio device I use is the ak120 which was compatable with the other iem's mentioned above. At 9ohm's The se846 was not a compatable match for my 3.3 ohm ak120. So I sent the ak120 to red wine audio for the rwak120 mod and now can accurately assess my se846's. Personally any review that starts I use a ipod or iphone I will bypass because that is not hi res music and pointless to test quality on,I do own a iphone and nano 5th gen. But would not waist time listening on them. But it was nice present for my wife so shes happy. So the se846 is clear, clean with a wide sound stage.Bass that is excellent because it in no way muddies the sound. The three other speakers are amazing the mids are much better than all the other shure iems .The highs are crisp and bright but not over done and not annoying in anyway . Just a perfectly balanced iem. Very satisfying on all levels. I only have used the neutral filters though they come with high boost or low boost as well . I never use any eq to hear the way the music was intended to be heard. So great iem's if you can afford them."
248,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, it is something different. The scene is beautiful and totally engaging. The audible sub low presence is very natural to me and totally - it's a game changer. BUT... I've ran into an issue with my pair - drivers matching failure. It took time to understand... But still it is obvious! I'm requesting replacement though. Let's give 'em another chance... Cuz the sound is just CRAZY...

Now, while the replacement of SE846 is still in process I want to add a little comparison that I've been personally missing on the web.
I've been doing some side to side comparison of SE846 to my Etymotic ER4S, Grado SR325i and Sennheiser 595. I've used different sources including PreSonus AudioBox 22VSL, Rio Karma, iPod 5th gen and iPhone 5s with uncompressed wav material... My reference records include Amused to Death by Roger Waters, Some female vocals, and different instrumental like Joe Satriani, Jeff Beck, Jon Gomm and the like.

What can I say - the only competitor here that is still light years behind SE846 is Sennheiser 595. The rest of the crew is simply unpleasant for listening to the music.
Sennheiser 595 still lack the punch the speed and bass extension of Shures, and highs are never as clear too. Not mentioning the soundstage! Yes, you've got it right - open cans, Sennheiser 595, still unable to provide that soundstage of SE846 - which was a really BIG surprise to me. When I was trying to describe what I'm missing with the rest of ""competitors"" I didn't manage to find better expression than the sound picture is fading BELOW the virtual midline drown through my two ears. It just seems that someone has stolen the part of the spectrum. That is a drastic difference that make these Shures so incredibly pleasant to listen to. Going even further I've used this resource to just test the productivity of my headphones in different frequencies: audiocheck dot net. It provides a huge set of different test material which will give you the idea of how god your headphones are at producing different frequencies. It was a complete disaster for the whole crew in the low segment of audible spectrum - except for the Shures - they are simply BRILLIANT throughout the spectrum."
249,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was not actively looking to replace or upgrade my Shure SE530 custom earphones last year when I heard about the new Shure SE846. I was intrigued enough by Shure's promotional material to start reading the reviews that were written as these earphones started to become available. Of all the reviews that I read, the one that convinced me to take the plunge and spend a shed-load of money was that of Flavio of Earphone Solutions ([...]).

I bought the SE846 in January since when they have become my constant companion. I do not regard myself as an audiophile, but I have always enjoyed a wide range of music genres. It is without exaggeration that I say that these earphones are life enhancing. Music that I have listened to countless times through my custom SE530s takes on a new dimension through these earphones. Even at low volume the separation between the bass, mids and treble enables me to enjoy my music afresh. It is a revelation. When you turn up the volume you FEEL the bass and yet vocals remain clearer than I have ever heard them before.

I have not yet tried the alternative filters and so cannot comment on this aspect.

I am used to looping the cable over my ear with the SE530s and I soon became used to the stiff cable ends which I find useful when using the earphones in the gym. Once in my ears they stay in place with no further attention needed. I find the SE846 to be more comfortable than my customs; they are slightly smaller than the SE530 and I also find that I can go to sleep with them in without the earphones being pressed into my ear canal as I turn my head on the pillow.

I have done one long distance flight so far. I plugged into the in-flight entertainment system at the start of the flight and took them out at the end. What aircraft noise? I used the in-line volume control so that I could hear flight attendants and got off the aircraft without the usual fatigue that occurs through experiencing the relentless background noise.

I can wear these earphones with none of the fatigue that other earphones have given me. I think that this is not only due to the comfort of the fit, but also the way that the music is experienced; it feels as though you are listening to speakers rather than earphones, but its better than that because the noise isolation gives you freedom from external distractions.

In the two months that I have been using the SE846s I have found nothing that gives me any cause for regretting the purchase. They appear to be expensive, but all things are relative. Some people spend more than this in a year on other things that are gone once consumed. I used my SE530s for years and I am sure that the SE846 will serve me even longer. With the SE846 Shure has broken new ground, so if you love your music and you can find the money, don't hesitate, go for it!"
250,5.0 out of 5 stars,Greta sound. Excellent quality.
251,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow,

The sound that comes out of these earphones are phenomenal. The resistance on the SE846 is 9ohms VS. 36ohs for the SE535, with that plus four drivers these earphones are a no brainer. The price for these have double and now that I've had them for a while there is no buyers regret. I never paid much attention to cases and that was an expensive lesson, I broke the right SE535 by stepping on it in the middle of the night (which is why I picked these up). The packaging with the earphones compliments the sound, one clear hard plastic case and the usual hard Shure square case.

The price hasn't changed much on the SE535 so I picked up two because these earphones are worth the retail price. I use Surefire earplugs with these earphones, it gives me stand off from sweat when I'm working out and it's an extremely comfortable fit for long periods of time. Since I use the earplugs I've never been worried about isolation (even though isolation and sound quality go together, more outside noise kept out means more noise goes in the ears), so if you use the earplugs that came with the earphones and they are comfortable that works. I travel a lot so a good set headphones are essential and the smaller the better for obvious reasons.

If you want the best sound out of these earphones a quality MP3 player is a must. These earphones will sound good with most MP3 players because the resistance is low. I purchased a Hifiman 901 to use for traveling or doing house work. I figured I would buy a Excellent MP3 Player and a Excellent set of earphones VS. buying an Excellent set of closed headphones. Give me a month or two and I will update this review. Hopefully this helps

One last thing, I've been using sure earphones since 2007 and their customer service is on par with Apple. If your going to spend this much money make sure to register your product on their website so there is no issue's if you have to send them in. Before they made detachable cable I had to send my earphones in a few times. I would also recommend buying these from Amazon and not a third party.

Update:

I've had a serious wake up call after listening to the shure 846 with the Hifiman 901, amazing sound and clarity is an understatement. I've purchased headphones that cost more than the SE846 and disappointment is the best way to describe listening to them. The 846 runs a frequency range of 15hz-20khz, most high end headphones run from 5hz-46000khz+. Most portable music players only produce sound from 20hz-20khz. For the higher end headphones that use to be my portable travel headphones. They will be put away until a portable player comes around that can produce lower frequency for bass. Shure hit these earphones out of the park. I'm already excited for the next generation of earphones (probably won't be out for another 4 years). Take your time and do the research when it comes to your portable music player. These headphones will make the most basic cell phone DAC sound good. Pick up something dedicated to music and the 846's will sound like whatever artist your listening to is standing right beside you singing in your ears."
252,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Shure earphones are splendid and have changed the way I hear music from average to superlative sound. I wish they made hearing aids too.
253,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound!
254,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had many, many , many pairs of high end earbuds, and i have to say these are my absolute favorite. the sound is incredibly well balanced and the low end is much more pronounced than the se-535's, it is literally no comparison, but still a very natural balanced sound unlike many of the can headphones out there these days. So if you are an audiophile and love to hear things how they were meant to be heard in incredibly clear detail, these are your headphones. If you are a bashed that likes to crank your bass, there are many other cheaper alternatives out there, as heavy bass is what these were built for."
255,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, great sound.

I've had quite a few pairs of headphones and these have the best sound BY FAR.

The sound is so clear - truly amazing. The bass is very good - much better than the Shure 400 series.

Sound isolation is good.

They really are a joy to listen to."
256,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic IEMs, not much to be said that other reviewers haven't already said. If you've got the means you won't be disappointed."
257,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I brought these with some level of skepticism regarding whether they would be worth it. I was a previous owner of the SE535's and was relatively satisfied with them although I always felt they didn't go low enough or high enough but their midrange was buttery and unparalleled. I took the dive with these 846's and I am sure glad I did. The extension that I was looking for on both ends is present. I haven't felt the need to try out the low or high filters as I am completely satisfied with the neutral ones. The thing I find remarkable is that I find myself turning down the volume on these. They are so detailed and balanced across the sound spectrum that there is no need to play them loud. The low end is visceral and unlike anything I've ever heard in an earphone. You really feel like you have a subwoofer in your ears. At the same time the bass never overwhelms. I particularly notice that drums are incredibly articulate and textured. Everything else is outstanding. The ear tips do a great job of sealing out external noises (although Westones' ear tips are the best IMO). In short, these are keepers and are likely the last earphones I will ever purchase."
258,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price. I use these every day. They have fantastic sound in my ears and the block out all the noise. Highly recommend.
259,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these with high hopes in part because I previously purchased the SE 535, which sound great. I was looking to upgrade and took the dive for $1000 based on the performance of the SE 535. Well, after several weeks of ownership and listening to various types of music from soft to hard, I can honestly say I am a tad disappointed. While I can discern a slight difference in the overall sound performance between the SE 846 and the SE 535, it is hard for me to justify the price tag on these based on the overall sound difference. The SE 846 do offer a bit more clarity in sound, but again it doesn't justify the difference in price from the SE 535. Additionally, I found these somewhat cumbersome to place in my ears and when I did they kept falling out. It took me an hour or so to figure these things out and get them into my ear so that I could really hear them clearly. So, in sum, while these are nice, they are not worth the price tag, at least not in my opinion."
260,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing comes nearly as close as these IEMs.

I have tried lots. But for well rounded base, an equal amount of highs and balanced mids, this is it!

But it would be an insult to engineering to listen to MP3s on these delights.

trust me.

Listen to ""Watch Your Step"" or ""Sahara Sun"" by Darshan Ambient on 24-bit/96KHz FLAC. Of course you will need the Onkyo HF player for iOS or Android."
261,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent IEMs, i've been using them for around 2 months. I'm coming from Westone UM Pro 50s, which fell apart at the plastic casing seam twice now in one year. My only complaint would be that they are considerably bulkier and less comfortable than the UM Pro 50s (which have 5 armature drivers, instead of 4 on these, but no ""subwoofer""), and i have large ears. The cables are also far more stiff and noticable over the ear. They do feel far more solid in terms of build quality, however.

As for the audio quality, they obviously do not disappoint. I love the filter feature, I initially tried the whites and didn't like them at all but the blue filters were the absolute perfect balance for my type of music."
262,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These replace the nearly 3 year old se425s I've been using. Ordered them Amazon Prime, overnight $3.99 shipping...14 hours after the order was placed the package is delivered. And the new packaging is not to be ignored, it's very nice. As for the earphones, Ive been listening to them for about an hour so far...just on a Macbook Air. And all I'll say is: Seriously, be prepared to be blown away. $1000 buys you sonic happiness. They're very LOUD! Crispy clean sound, and the bass explodes--no joke. Everything I've thrown at them sounds incredible...These are amazing earphones."
263,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Holy moly these are neutral. Nothing stands out or bites, everything is just RIGHT. The best IEMs in the world."
264,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I'm thrilled with the clarity and soundstage, among other attributes of this fantastic set of IEM's. I'm waiting on a DAC to be delivered to bring them to the next level."
265,5.0 out of 5 stars,love them!!!! for life!!!!
266,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sounding. Like nothing I've ever heard before.
267,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just bassy goodness. Get them.

270,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an armchair audiophile with some old MFSL material and tube amps. These are the best-sounding earbuds I have ever used; I have tried all types and have settled on the SE 535 - pretty good but not great - until I found these. The low cycle bass is reproduced with clarity, precision, and volume. The high end does not saturate. The earbuds come with dampers to customize the high end for personal taste. The harshness of cymbal crashes and electric guitars is gone. Boston's MFSL Third Stage Gold CD tends to be heavy on the highs. With the SE846, the highs are smooth and clear. I am thoroughly amazed at these earbuds. They sound great powered by iPhone 5s."
271,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me prelude this review by saying that the first order of these headphones that Amazon shipped wound up missing after delivery, and after contacting Amazon after waiting 2 days for it to hopefully show up (which it didn't,) Amazon sent a replacement. A+ for the customer service. Now on to the review.
I purchased these for my boyfriend, and he is blown away by how detailed these IEMs are. The bass is tight, fast, and has punch, but does not distort nor take away from the full and detailed mids and highs. Soundstage is very impressive for an IEM, and trumps several full size cans. Instrument seperation is very precise and detailed, and there is not a single complaint I've heard from him about then. Strongly recommend if you have the cash for them."
272,1.0 out of 5 stars,"REVISED: The right side has died. No sound whatsoever. Unbelievable after only 5 months (!). What should I do.

Here is my first review. My, things have changed. I am NOT willing to try another pair.

After trying so many IEMs and finding so many to have at least one fatal sonic flaw I realized, being a professional musician, that I should've just saved my time and spent the big bucks for these mini-monsters. Unbelievable sound, never ceases to amaze. Tried so many Westones and they all have a warm, muddy and/or recessed mid range--so frustrating as the overall sound quality of the Westones is so wonderful. I wish I'd never wasted my time listening to so many of the Westones: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, Pro, non-pro, etc. They are ALL flawed. Suggest you not waste your time either, and just go for these 846s. Skip the 535s--they are lacking in any realistic bass response or balance. The 846s: sonic bliss, and all music shines."
273,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best headphone I ever listen in my life! Thank u Shure!
274,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are exquisite.
275,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me preface by saying that I'm not a hardcore audiophile but that I do enjoy listening to music and travel quite a bit for work and am constantly on the hunt for new IEM's and headphones to use when traveling on planes/etc. That being said, I'd probably describe myself more as an enthusiast rather than a hardcore audiophile.

I was in the market for some high end IEM's and was choosing between the Shure SE846-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Quad HiDef MicroDrivers, Crystal Clear and Sennheiser IE 800 High-Performance In-Ear Headphones (Black). I was looking to upgrade from my Shure SE535-CL Triple High-Definition MicroDriver Earphone with Detachable Cable (Clear) and Westone UM 3X In-Ear Musician's Monitor, Universal Fit Earphone with Removable Cable, Clear, 79292 (I have the RC removable cable version of the UM3x's). Anyway, I ended up buying the SE846's and found a pair of used IE800's on another site so now I have all four of these IEM's and plan on selling the SE535's and UM3x's. I know I really don't need two sets of IEM's but with the SE846 and IE800 I love them both so much that I don't really want to sacrifice one or the other. In any case, since I have all four of them now I thought it'd be helpful to some of you out there who may want to know a bit more about these at least in terms of how I rank them.

I'll be ranking them using the following criteria (which I adapted from a well known user on head-fi) on a scale from 1-10 each:

Bundled Accessories - Which ones come with the best and most comprehensive list of accessories
Build Quality - How well I feel they will hold up over time
Isolation - How well they block out ambient noise
Microphonics - How much cable noise you hear when moving around
Comfort - How comfortable each one are after wearing for extended use (over an hour on plane for example)
Sound - This is a bit subjective as all people tend to hear details differently in the sound so I'll do my best to describe why I rank them the way I do
Value - For the money which one is best?

::Shure SE846:: - 65/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
9.5/10 - Shure really didn't leave anything out when they put this package together. It comes with a large plastic case like a pelican case as well as a zippered case. It also comes with a plethora of tips and most interestingly a set of 2 additional tubes that can be inserted in to the IEM's that change the sound of the SE846's. I opted to stay with the pre-installed neutral tubes. The only thing that would have been nice is if they included an iPhone/Android compatible cable. At the price they are asking it should be a throw in...

::Build Quality::
10/10 - All plastic with the exception of the ear nozzle which is metal. From what I hear this is the most susceptible part to break so it's nice they changed them to metal from the previous generations plastic nozzles.

::Isolation::
10/10 - I use some Comply Tsx-100 Comfort PLUS Earphone Tips (Black, 3 Pair, Small) with these and they isolate noise very well.

::Microphonics::
9/10 - Shure cables are long and slightly thick. Microphonics are generally not that big of an issue unless you're really moving around a lot.

::Comfort::
8.5/10 - These are LARGE IEM's. With everything packed in to the SE846's I suppose you could say that they are small but compared to the SE535's these are noticeably larger and if you have smaller ears you may have some comfort issues with these. I've found that I can wear these for extended periods of use but find myself adjusting them from time to time depending on how much I am moving around.

::Sound::
10/10 - The sub bass is incredible in these little IEM's. I thought I could hear bass in some of my other IEM's but these take it to another level with the low frequencies it can go down to. The bass is there and not overwhelming and the highs are crisp and clear. I find the soundstage to be wide on these but not as wide as the Sennheiser IE800's. Overall, the sound on these is excellent! Also worth noting is the VERY low impedance of only 9 ohms! This means that they can easily be driven from mobile devices and get good volume without having to turn it all the way up!

::Value::
8/10 - At the price they ask for these, I can't say that they are the best value but they are some seriously great sounding IEM's.

::CONCLUSION::
The SE846's seem to be an evolutionary step in a long line of IEM's. I've had many Shure's dating back to the e2c's, SE425's, SE535's and now the SE846's. As time progressed and Shure refined and improved their products I've been with them along for the ride and I'm happy to say that the SE846's have many welcome evolutionary steps above and beyond what they've done before. The sub bass is amazing in an IEM and the other improvements like the metal nozzles and removable tubes to change the sound are great. Coming from their previous flagships, the SE535's, I can see that they've put a lot of thought and effort in to these and can say that the higher price is fully justified... if only they'd redesigned the iPhone compatible cable and included it with them too! Honestly, though, that's the ONLY downside I see in these IEM's is that they don't include an iPhone compatible cable like their competitors. Other than that, these are some of the best IEM's on the market today and I highly recommend them.

::Sennheiser IE800:: - 60/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
9/10 - Not a lot comes with these but what it does come with is REALLY nice. The case is by far one of the best cases I've ever used for IEM's. The case has a cutout inside the case to put them in and the cable wraps around the case nicely so you never have to deal with tangled cords. The IE800's come with a set of replaceable silicone tips that can be cleaned and reused by just running them under the sink with some soap and water... NICE! The only thing as with all of these is that at the price they ask for them they should include an iPhone/Android compatible cable. The other thing you should know is that the tips are proprietary so there are no officially documented comply tips that will work but I hear that some of the comply tips will work.

::Build Quality::
10/10 - Ceramic housings and a kevlar cable... no other IEM on the market can say that as far as I know... built like a tank

::Isolation::
8/10 - The bundled silicone tips do an adequate job of blocking ambient noise but they aren't going to block noise as well as others.

::Microphonics::
5/10 - By far the worst microphonics I've heard out of an IEM. Try not to move much when using these... I think it's mostly due to the downward position of the IE800's when inserted in to your ears. If you're lucky enough to be able to wrap the cord around your ear so you can use them as over ear IEM's then do it. It vastly improves the microphics of the cable. Unfortunately it's a bit uncomfortable when I wear them this way as the upper part of the cable past the Y is only about 9.5 inches.

::Comfort::
10/10 - These are so small and light that they really disappear when you insert them in to your ears. I find that I can wear these for extended periods with ZERO problems. They may be the most comfortable IEM's I've had to date.

::Sound::
10/10 - The frequency response on these IEM's is really really nice! It's amazing you can get such rich sound out of a single driver IEM. I was skeptical at first since I'm used to multiple driver IEM's but after hearing these I can say that I'm convinced! I do feel that the mids are more pronounced on these than the SE846's which is nice for certain types of music. The bass is also good on these IEM's... Overall it's a nice and rich full sounding IEM. It's worth noting here that the designer of the acclaimed $1500 Sennheiser HD800 Over-Ear Circum-Aural Dynamic Premiere Headphone also designed these... I've never heard the HD800's but I've read that the IE800's are like mini HD800's. Also, the low impedance of 16 ohms means that it can be driven relatively easily by mobile devices. On my iPhone I can get more than adequate volume from these without having to turn it up too much.

::Value::
8/10 - Yes they are expensive but they sound great and are extremely comfortable to wear.

::CONCLUSION::
These are great little IEM's and I mean little! I'm wearing these right now going on over an hour with them on at my desk and I don't feel any fatigue at all... and the sound!! The sound is nice and crisp with good bass response and instrument separation despite being driven only by a single driver. Although the Shure SE846's do have some more bass response in the low low end, sound wise I still put these on the same level for it's overall richness and sound. Great IEM's and highly recommended!!

::Shure SE535:: - 60.5/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
8/10 - Comes with a case, tips, and various other accessories that I don't use... The bundled accessories are acceptable for an IEM in this price range but I feel like they could have included a bit more like an iPhone/Android cable.

::Build Quality::
8/10 - All plastic but I've had no issues with them in the year+ use I've had with them.

::Isolation::
10/10 - I use some Comply Tsx-100 with these and they isolate noise very well.

::Microphonics::
9/10 - Shure cables are long and slightly thick. Microphonics are generally not that big of an issue unless you're really moving around a lot.

::Comfort::
9/10 - These are fairly light IEM's and feel great in the ear and I have had no issues with them wearing them for extended periods.

::Sound::
8/10 - Nice and crisp highs and mids! The bass lacks a bit when compared to the Westone UM3x's and of course when compared to the Shure SE846's it will be lacking too but nonetheless if you're more in to mids and highs then you can't go wrong with these. These are some nice and neutral IEM's IMHO. These impedance on these is 36 ohms which means that it can be driven from most mobile devices without the need for much amplification.

::Value::
8.5/10 - If you're in the market for a pair of neutral IEM's these are the ones to go with.

::CONCLUSION::
The SE535's have now been eclipsed by the SE846's but not everyone will want to spend that kind of $$ on the SE846's. At their price the SE535's are still a tremendous IEM that has a great neutral sound with good mids and highs but lacking a bit in the bass department. They are still enjoyable to listen to and are actually more comfortable (to me) than the SE846's due to their smaller design. Recommended for those looking for a really good, neutral IEM.

::Westone UM3x RC:: - 63/70
--------------------------------------------------------------
::Bundled Accessories::
7/10 Comes with the standard case, tips, and various other accessories that I don't use. The zippered case is nice and compact but I feel like they should have also included their Westone Monitor Vault - Smoke Gray for them as well. Also, like all of these, they should include an iPhone/Android cable.

::Build Quality::
8/10 - All plastic but I've had no issues with them in the year+ use I've had with them.

::Isolation::
10/10 - I use some Comply Tsx-100 with these and they isolate noise very well.

::Microphonics::
10/10 - The Westone Epic cable is by far the best I've used in terms of microphonics. The cable is thin and light so it really causes no issues in this regard.

::Comfort::
9/10 - These feel about the same to me in ear as the Shure SE535's... great for extended use.

::Sound::
9/10 - The mids and highs on these IEM's are crisp and clear but these also pack a punch when it comes to bass. They don't pack as much punch as say the Shure SE846's or even the Sennheiser IE800's but at this price point they are very nice full sounding IEM's. These IEM's have an impedance of 56 ohms... they can be driven from mobile devices but you'll definitely find yourself turning it up a bit.

::Value::
10/10 - For the price I feel that these are a very good value... good sound, good comfort, and good price!

::CONCLUSION::
I initially bought the UM3x's on a whim at the airport mostly because I craved something with a bit more low end bass over the SE535's... this was of course before the SE846's came out and the Sennheiser IE800's... nonetheless, after auditioning these I bought them on the spot. The highs and mids sound good (not as good as the Shure SE535's but good enough for me) and these IEM's do provide the bass response that I was looking for that the SE535's were lacking. They're warmer sounding to me than the SE535's and more fun because of it. Depending on my mood (before I got the SE846's and IE800's) I'd switch between the SE535's and UM3x's. I recommend these highly!

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------
As you can see from above these are ALL really nice IEM's and for various reasons I've ranked them all very highly.

HIGH OF THE HIGH END MARKET
If you have the money definitely go for the Shure SE846's or Sennheiser IE800's... They are both well worth the money IMO. The SE846's may be better for those of you on the go a lot (because of the low impedance and low microphonics in the cable) while the IE800's are probably better suited for at home use or for people who won't be moving around much (due to the microphonics issue).

LOWER OF THE HIGH END MARKET
If you're budget is on the lower end of the high end IEM market then I have no hesitation in recommending either the Westone UM3x RC's or Shure SE535's... the difference between those is mostly in the sound signature. The SE535's are more neutral sounding to me while the UM3x's have a bit more umph when it comes to bass response.

It should be noted that Westone has recently released the Westone UM Pro 30 Smoke (Universal Monitor Earphones) and Westone UM Pro 20 High Performance Dual Driver in-ear Headphone of which I auditioned both at a store... These would definitely both be worth looking in to... the accessory bundles alone would be worth it over the competition. They come with a regular cable and iPhone/Android compatible cable and a nice plastic pelican case-like case. My wife got the UM Pro 20's and she's very happy with them and uses them every day."
276,5.0 out of 5 stars,Earotica!!
277,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Brilliant - had shure 535 previously
previously. These are much better - bass, clarity, wider/deeper soundstage."
278,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best evah!
279,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are expensive headphones, but they sound great. I would recommend using with a DAC and high quality FLAC files.
I've had these earphones for about 3 months now and they sound great. I use them almost every night after work to relax.
The bass is not overpowering and the vocals sound great. These headphones are not for everyone due to the price, but if you like high quality sound, I would recommend."
280,5.0 out of 5 stars,"one of the best purchases ever. I didn't know all my head phones and ear buds where crap until I tried these.
believe me I only buy the best of everything. or so I thought until this. this is quite one of the best ear buds around. if you like music this is a must."
281,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
282,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have long used the SE535 headphones, which I think are among the very best on the market. When it came time to replace a pair, I upgraded to the 846. I am amazed. The balance and clarity in every range is remarkable. I have heard new notes, phrases, and instruments in music I've listened to for years because of the clear mix. I listen to a wide variety of music from Wilco to Brad Meldhau to Jason Isbell to Wagner et cetera. I'm also an amateur musician and use these headphones to mix my own compositions. While Shure promotes the bass quality, I don't listen to (and don't usually enjoy) bass-heavy music. My sense is they will faithfully deliver the bass as the artist intended.

They are not cheap, clearly. The SE 535 headphones are very, very good, but honestly, the 846's are noticeably, discernibly superior. If you care deeply about the quality richness of sound, I can highly recommend these headphones."
283,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Although those earphones are incredibly expensive, they're totally worth it. The quality of the sound that they produce is out of this world. The subwoofer works perfectly. You can actually feel the earphones vibration with bass sounds. It's a must have for musicians that can afford that price. I am really impressed."
284,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow. Just wow. I've owned the Shure SE530 and SE535s before these and didn't think headphones could sound any better but my ears were blown out of the water when I listened to these. There are no words to describe how far the range of sound these go. They are better than any in-ear and over-ear headphones/earphones I have ever heard. My go-to over ear headphones right now are the V-Moda M100s but after buying these I never want to take them off ever again. I have used these listening to lossless music on my MacBook Pro, iPhone, iPod classic and Nexus 5 (with PowerAmp Music App). I also have a Fiio portable headphone amp but with these headphones I've noticed I don't really see a huge difference when I'm using the amp.

I hear details in songs I've never heard when using normal speakers, and watching movies on my laptop is completely immersive now. This is the way sound is meant to be heard, almost better than real life. :) What's even better is the ability to physically change the sound yourself with three customizable frequency response nozzles. I kept the neutral in as I felt the high and low nozzles were too extreme in distorting the sounds.

I listen to all kinds of music from pop, classical, rock, acoustic, instrumental and many other genres and everything sounds as if I were listening to it live. If you're into bass, these definitely hit the spot. There's a kind of 'rumble' in the bass that makes your hairs stick up with the right song. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about these headphones, I would give it 100 stars if I could. I was hesitant to upgrade from my 535s for a while, especially since they were double the price and I wasn't sure it was worth spending so much for headphones. I'm not an audiophile or professional by any means but this has got to be the best $1000 I have ever spent.

To top it off Shure included a huge fancy polycarbonate case with a ton of accessories and interchangeable parts, and even an extra cable that would normally cost you $50!! I'm in love, and you will be too."
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this headset to use with the system at the gym to instruct a spin class. I got this set because I knew it would work with the set up. Before purchasing, make sure the system being used will be compatible with this headset. Since the gym already has the set up, I can just connect to the battery pack they have. There is a wire, but it connects to the battery pack which attaches to your clothing. I have to tuck the wire down my shirt so it doesn’t get caught on the handlebars of the spin bike. Without tucking the wire, I have had a few embarrassing moments where the wire has caught on the handlebars. To clarify, it is wireless as you you’re not connected to the system. But you’re connected to the battery pack which you connect to your clothing. You can walk around freely and move freely. It even worked when one of the instructors went outside and forgot to turn off the battery pack, she was away and outside of the building and the sound still was heard without any issues. There is a little foam piece that connects to the mouthpiece to help you not sound so winded. I can hear myself breathing but it doesn’t come through the speakers. It fits my head only if I have my hair tied a certain way, I think I have a small head because the other instructors who have the same headset don’t seem to have any issue no matter which way they style their hair. I sweat a lot while instructing and the sweat has not had any problem with the sound, I do take the foam piece off after each use to let it dry. It comes with 2 foam pieces so you can switch them out."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this headset after my other Shure went out after less than a year. I was hoping putting a little more of an investment into my next set would be worth it -- and so far so good! I really like how much more durable this one seems to be. I make sure to dry it off after every class as well as remove the windscreen and allow the mic to hang until the next time I use it. I never wrap the cord tightly around the set either, so I'm hoping my good habits ensure a long life for this one."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wired mic for teaching Grouo Fitness classes- no more sharing germs and hair grime with other instructors. Super easy to attach to the transmitter pack, slim and compact for storage too. Looking to purchase the transmitter soon"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had several of these. Work great but don't be fooled, sweat in the mike will kill it."
4,3.0 out of 5 stars,"To sensitive to sweat. No matter what you do with the windscreen sponge. It should have extra screens. There should be many screens. They should be available to purchase. You still get it wet, and it still stops working in a few months. We have no choice here, but it is what it is."
5,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked fine on the proper pack setting for 2 months. A couple of weeks ago it stopped working at all on proper setting. I've tried on packs at all 5 gyms I teach at. I have to use the cheaper mic setting to get any volume, on which the mic feeds back regularly. The feedback causes me to feel like I can't move freely around the stage and that I have to overly meter the volume of my voice (and I'm not a loud person). It feels unprofessional. I am very disappointed to look for help today and see that I could only have gotten support with this issue within the first 2 months. Fitness instructors expect their mic to work for years, not months. Super frustrating."
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this while livestreaming my workouts on Zwift for a few months now. It's very lightweight, hardly noticeable while working with it. the only possible flaw is that the microphone picks up wind noise from a small fan I have set up in front of me. I've solved this by moving the fan off to the side, and the wind noise disappeared. You'll also need to take time to set your speakers up to not get echo, but it's worth the couple of minutes of effort."
7,3.0 out of 5 stars,I used this maybe 15 times and the connection to the transmitter button got stuck in transmitter and cannot get it out. Stopped working during my class! Up until then it worked great??
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this several times a week and it works perfectly.
9,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I use and its great, but it is not wireless like is says. Oh well! I'm has a wore that hooks to the transmitter"
10,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the perfect headset for fitness instructors! The sound quality from the mic is outstanding, and has a comfortable and secure fit. Highly recommended!"
11,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works. Fitness lab instructor loves it!
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,This headset has changed my life - I was so tired of mics not working at the various gyms at teach at. This not only keeps me germ and gym yuk free but the sound quality is amazing! I just hope it holds up to heavy use
13,5.0 out of 5 stars,I do indoor cycle classe with this and it gets pretty soaked with sweat. It holds up very well and is very comfortable. Other models have not held up as well.
14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headset microphone. Lightweight and comfortable to wear. Used in a cycle studio so it gets a good workout multiple times a day, six days a week."
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best mic headset and great value for the money.
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using this for several months now, after noticing that other fellow group fitness instructors have been using. So far it’s been reliable and I am pleased with the purchase."
17,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the goose neck. so far it has worked just fine and enjoying not having to share with other fitness instructors.
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great! Much better than the cheaper models I've used.
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,PE teachers love these!
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,best headset i have owned!
21,5.0 out of 5 stars,works as advertised
22,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far it is working as advertised. Too early to give it a 5 star rating need to see how wellit holds up.
23,2.0 out of 5 stars,they don't last.
24,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound!!
25,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good."
26,3.0 out of 5 stars,Overly sensitive in both studios I teach. I often get feedback. After 10 mins it seems to stabilize. But then 40 minutes in I have to keep increasing my volume. Maybe I have a bum unit?
27,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just the best, is great that you can replace this in older equipments."
28,4.0 out of 5 stars,worked wonderfully
29,3.0 out of 5 stars,It seems to have good clear quality however the only draw back was it slips off of my hair. Need a head band if your hair is straight very distracting.
30,4.0 out of 5 stars,good product.
31,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When worn it does not move a inch and compared to the stock headset, that is already very good, the sound is crispy clear."
32,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful - great to have crisp clear sound again!
33,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
34,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Deceptive marketing!!! We purchased this specifically because we wanted a wireless headset for our trainers to easily move about without ripping the wires off during demonstrations. As it turns out, it's wireless only to the receiver... the actual headset is NOT, even though it says wireless and even shows the headset without wires. Of course it's wireless from the headset to the receiver! Very deceptive! Waste of time, energy and money. Will return."
35,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love this mic it's confurtable gives great voice output. Best fitness mic I have use so far.
36,1.0 out of 5 stars,BE AWARE. ITS NOT WIRELESS
37,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic
38,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a gift that will not be opened or used until mid November so I can't really tell you. I'm sure it will be great. It is for someone who teaches exercise classes.
39,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's supposed to be a wireless headset. It is not wireless. Very misleading.
40,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Should make it clear that you must purchase the complete system. Disappointed, now I need to purchase another piece to complete set"
41,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this headset to teach classes at my gym who uses the SHURE system for Group ex classes so i wouldnt have to share the headset that is a tad worn out (150+ classes a week) and they use the slightly less expensive PGA 31 mic. not only is this mic (i bought it just for the comfort) so much more comfortable and sturdy, my class participants say that the quality in sound is noticeably better than the other mic headset. It uses the same 4 prong connection in to the microphone transmitter (belt pack aka butt pack)"
42,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound from this headset is very clear and stays in place well on your head. As other reviewers have indicated, no it is not completely wireless, the wire goes from the headset to the mic pack (not included). This is as I expected and as similar headsets operate. I would definitely recommend this headset, which is at a great price point for the quality."
0,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried for years to find earphones I could use for listening to podcasts, but until now they've all had too much wind noise, from $30 in-ear Bluetooth models to the Bose 20i. These Shures have enough passive noise isolation that I can comfortably hear podcasts at a moderate volume, even when doing 40 mph downhill. I don't know how sweat-proof they'll be, but a 3 hour ride in hot weather that included pouring water on my head wasn't a problem for the earphones.

Edit: took off a star because the mic's sensitivity to wind noise makes it useless on a moving bicycle for voice commands. I tried putting tape over the remote, but that didn't solve the problem. Other than that, my ears ache slightly when wearing them for 4-5 hour straight, but that's more than acceptable for the noise isolation."
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my 1st set of Shure's 12 years ago and they still sound great and are in excellent shape to this day - just change the foam tips regularly, plug and hit play. But with this set, I get the convenience of the mic to make and take calls on my iPhone also. I was pleased from the very first note of music I listened to immediately upon receiving them for my birthday. They sound great and will only get better the more I use them. They look nice also - the white and black contrast is very tasteful. I'm a business traveler and have had 2 sets of Bose QC's (wired & wireless) and the noise blocking on these is so much more effective than the noise cancellation in the Bose (not to mention I won't get the 'headset dent' look in my hair after a 2-3 hr. flight). The only knock I can think of is that the case they came with is a rather flimsy zippered pouch, unlike the original hard round clamshell case of my original set. Otherwise, an excellent product. Highly recommended."
2,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say, Shure SE215 has been one of the best audio quality and fit earbuds I have ever used. I've only had one BIG issue, and that is they break somewhat often. After 6 months of use, the right earbud started cutting off. I sent it back and the 2-year warranty covered the repair at no cost. The problem was the wire. Before this pair, I owned the original SE215's and those had the same issue. About 1 year in, the issue happened and I sent them for repair. About 3-years in, the issue happened again and I bought these. This cable feels more ""cheap"" than the original black SE215's (no mic). I think this Mic only works with IOS so keep that in mind. The fit is amazing, and the sponge-like earbuds make sound isolation possible at a mid-high volume. Shure needs to invest in R&D for new generation better durability earbuds."
3,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones to replace a 10+ year pair of Shure SE in-ear phones. While the older earphones sounded great, the wires had started to crack and cut my ears while I used them. I purposely purchased this model because of the additional microphone the unit to be used for phone conversations with my iPhone. Here's the comparison to an older version: a) The cord is shorter and the gauge wire is smaller than the older model. B) The phones sound more bassy than the older pair...this means that at lower volumes, they sound muddy. C). The inclusion of the microphone limits how close you can move the plastic slider to secure the ear buds. This, along with the shorter cord leads to a sloppier fit if you try to run the cord behind your head. Pluses would include: 1) the ""hinged"" style ear bud is easier to insert and find a comfortable listening position, 2) The cable is replaceable so if ""wire rot"" occurs with this pair, I can replace it rather than throwing the pair away. I have a pair of Bose earbuds that I use for business calls all week. I think I prefer the more ""open"" design of these phones because the tighter/closed nature of these phones is hot to use over extended periods of time. Overall - it's a solid purchase from Shure without having to spend big bucks for the more advanced models."
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE SHURE HEADPHONES, AND THESE DIDN'T LET ME DOWN!

I splurged on these after owning a pair of SE110s for 10 years. I used those things every day, on my way to work on the subway. Fantastic headphones with good sound. Most importantly, they lasted forever. Finally, one of the earbuds was shorting out because of a bad connecting.

These are built just as well, and they have much richer sound. Bass is readily available, and the mids are starting to warm up well as the headphones break in. They also feature similar build quality to my se110s, with a replaceable cord. The remote works well with IOS, but I haven't used an android phone. I look forward to putting these on, but I just need to make sure the music quality is good enough for the headphones to match!"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"On my long search for earbuds that can suit me for good quality music and mobile use, these are my final answer. I've read all the reviews and so I had to give them a try. I've went through many other brands at lower price points and wasted a lot of money but this makes up for it all.

These are totally worth the money. I'm not gonna go in depth with how they sound but SERIOUSLY these blew me away. They fit so well, they're lightweight and feel like they're not even there. And the sound quality is the best at its price range, allowing me to hear the drums, guitars, and vocals in my favorite rock tracks and all the ranges of sound in any electronic song.

The cable is also a big improvement upon the stock model, being thinner overall but keeping the durability all the same. The aux does not fit inside a lifeproof case unfortunately.

Overrall I couldn't take these out of my ears when they arrived so if that's something to go off of, 9/10 earbuds. Wish they came in solid blue though."
6,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these Shure SE215 special edition earbuds on March 30 and they are a huge upgrade from what I usually use. The only complaint I have is the cable, like any other cable they get damaged and stop working (I'm glad I can replace the detachable cable, which is a third of the price of the actual earbuds) but this particular cable seem to break prematurely because within the 6 months of having them the right earbud with the mic went out without any visible breakage. I take very well care of my earbuds and managed to make the brand 'Skullcandy' earbuds to last more than a year without breaking. As for the sound quality, they are the best sound I've ever owned in an earbud. I'd suggest buying the Shure earbuds without the mic because it's too bulky and from my experience makes the earbud go out prematurely."
7,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed at the quality of these earphones. I upgraded to the model that has a microphone and buttons on the cable for an extra 20 bucks. I had just purchased cheapo headphones my entire life and figured that I'd upgrade and get some nicer ones as a treat so I bit the bullet and spent over 100 bucks on these. At first, they sounded great. The noise-cancelling is fantastic and the sound is actually noticeably better. However, last night, I plugged them into my phone and only one side was working. After about a month, they had already broken. How is this possible? I am not rough with these: I don't run with them, I've never stepped on them or sat on them, I don't travel with them. I really only used them for music in bed at night and when cleaning the house. I was willing to live with the fact that the actual product page doesn't clearly have any notes about the cable not working completely for Android (wtf?) and I didn't realize it until after the fact. What's the point of having a cable that only works for iOS? Now I have to go through the entire mess of using the warranty."
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the only earbuds that don't hurt my ear canals with fit. The rest of them fall out, hurt or otherwise just don't work. The sound is crystal and the noise reduction is a life saver on those ""family friendly"" trips."
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great, excellent bass (heavy but not grossly so), love the inline controls. Little zipper case is decent.

None of the default ear buds that it comes with are comfortable IMO. Even the small foam ones seem to hurt the inside of my ears after an hour or two. Might look into getting a custom fit set. Not going to ding a star for it, i'm really paying for the drivers and the buds have almost always been a disposable item."
10,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I consider myself fairly experienced with a wide range of headphones and I try to kee expectations reasonable for a given price point. I don't find these to be a value at all.

On the upside, they are very comfortable and Shure provides a wide range of inserts so you can swap as needed. I can wear for long periods of time with no discomfort. Cable attachment allowing swivel as a great idea.

External noise isolation is more than adequate with being eerily quiet. I do like to have some awareness of my surrounding when music is low or off. I use a set of JH Audio JH-16 IEMs and they really cut out almost all external noise. Maybe too much for some situations.

Now I understand that there are many very positive reviews based upon sound quality. That's one of the reasons I bought them. I don't get it at all. To me, they sounded overly warm to the point of somewhat muddy. Frequency definition was loose and bled together. Boring sound. Flat highs, forward miss and muddy bass. I've had lowest end Polk and midrange Senns that beat the heck out these in terms of clarity and accuracy, two or the areas most important to me.

I will compliment the soundstage. It sounded very accurate to me. Live and studio music both have a realistic sense of scale and space. That part was nice.

In short, there are so many other earbuds that really outshine these. I think the sound/comfort/cost ratio simply made these a poor value. I can get way better sounding buds for close to the same money or less.

These really sounded to me like $16 Skull Candy buds. In contrast, I bought some Denon AH-C820s for $199 and they sound like $500+ competitors. They exceeded expectations while these really fell short.

In fairness, I will say that I listened to these on both an iPhone 7 as well as an Onkyo DP-X1. These buds did sound moderately better on the Onkyo and likely would have gone from mediocre to pretty good if I swapped the cable for a balanced cable.

Only problem is that I don't always carry the Onkyo and I would think it's not too much to get decent sound with an iPhone. I would think that the number of people using these buds with some kind of high-end player vs those with a traditional cell phone has got to be small. Way more people listening on a cell phone. That's why I am being so rough on these buds.

I'm going to give them to my son and he will like them. He's a big bass fan when he listens to music and I think they do a respectable job there.

I recommend you look elsewhere if you are committed to this price range. The Shures I would recommend are way out of this price range. If you were will to spend a little more for earbuds that far outperform way more expensive models, I highly recommend the afore-mentioned Denons.

Purely my opinion... happy listening!"
11,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clear concise sound with just enough bass make these my favorite headphones I have ever purchased. An added benefit is the incredible design of the ear pieces. The quality sound is due in part by how solid the ear piece fits in your ear. I like the fact that when I turn my head the ear piece stays tightly fit in my ear it works great during my workouts
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones for the price! These have the lower frequencies enhanced more than the original SE215. The bass enhancement does not muddy up the midrange much compared to the originals. Treble and midrange are still slightly recessed, but nothing that you can complain about for $120 in ear monitors.

The iOS cable is great, it's very light. Supposedly it is Kevlar reinforced as well, but it certainly isn't as bulky as other Shure Kevlar cables.

All accessories are nice, including the carrying pouch. I actually use Westone Black Star tips for all of my headphones, they are much more comfortable for my ears than all others, including annoying hot foam tips.

The cable was my primary reason for purchase of the SE215m+, as I've already owned the SE215. Great headphones for everyday use!"
13,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually had to read the manual to figure out how to get these in my ear correctly. I tried them for a few subway rides and found them to be too fussy to get in, too clumsy to get out. Part of it goes into your ear, outside the ear canal, so it has a big presence on your head - almost looks like a hearing aid. The sound is amazing though. I wanted to make them work but just sent them back. I know I'll get too annoyed fumbling with them on my commute."
14,5.0 out of 5 stars,"my first review in amazon, i thought it would be rude not to give 5 stars for a great product, this is in a different league from any other earpud, specially if you are used to the crappud from apple, reasons to consider this product are
1- great sound quality
2- great noise isolation, it doesn't cancel noise by emitting voices to count them but actually isolate you from outside noise and it works GREAT.
3- it takes some time to get used to wearing it but once you get the hang of it, it will fit Perfectly in your ear
4- the build quality is superb and i expect it to out last apple ear pud which i replace them ever 2 months due to them losing sound on one side.
5- optional ear fittings with different sizes come with the product and a nice small case"
15,4.0 out of 5 stars,"very nice; a few things - the bass seems to be weak at first listen.
Also, if you're an iphone 7 user...the controls for the music will not work :/.

I had the clear version before and one of the sets died so I got this as a replacement. Overall, very nice and compares pretty well to the clear version without the music controls."
16,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds great but are very impractical for removing and putting back in your ears. Takes a lot of maneuvering to get them to fit properly.
17,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked brilliantly for about a week, then the left ear began to cut in and out. Now I have to figure out the return. ANNOYING!"
18,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Wire short in less than 3 months. Bought a replacement cable, babied it, and it also shorted out. It seems as if this is a common problem. Other than the cable the sound is great. Sent them back and hopefully they can upgrade the cable and honor the warranty."
19,2.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW. Bought them in May. A bud broke in September. Thought it might be the cord. Bought a new cord. But no, definitely broke. That's a lot of money to spend on a set of headphones that can't last a summer. After 5- years only buying from Shure, this is the end. Time to find a new company. It was nice while it lasted."
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Preface: I have owned the Bose QC15, and the jaybird bluebuds. These trump them.

I am not a true audiophile - only indulging as my budget allows - but I enjoy playing piano, and have been formally developing an ear for music since age 6. The sound isolation and quality put out by the SE215m+ are truly astounding. The foam ear(plugs)pieces isolate effectively, and allow the purity of sound to shine. I have never encountered a set of headphones that allows me to spatially relate with music the way these do. I feel as if I am in a world of my own, insulated in a private music studio when I wear these. 1st test was Bruno Mars's 24k Magic (not a conventional test, I know), but then! The bass rips and drops, the high twinkles ring off towards the ceiling, the lyrics clear and vibrant... suddenly to my right I notice my wife, beautiful as always... but what's this? She's hollering at me... a word... my name?? Alas, I decide to leave this sanctuary... and as pinky rings were to the moon, so must her blood pressure be, my man Bruno laying down a righteously starry soundtrack to that pulsing vein on my wife's temple there. Alrightg2gbblguys"
21,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the earbuds, great sound and comfort. But just like the last model 215s, a few months of regular use and my left channel started dropping out. I know the wire is replaceable but I would have expected a longer life for these after they updated the design. I guess they are happy with customers having to essentially subscribe to their product rather than have it built well enough to last years."
22,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great, but *all four pairs* I have owned have stopped working after a few months. For all 4, the audio started cutting out in one ear (apparently this is a well-known issue, see other reviews). For 2/4, the over-ear ""grip"" broke, becoming completely flimsy,

It's a shame because these headphones sound great and isolate well. Fortunately, they come with a 2 year warranty, but I'm tired of replacing headphones every few months."
23,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy. Slightly bass biased as advertised but good definition in mids and highs. This is my first pair of earphones and fit is hypercritical it took a couple attempts to get it right. Only thing I miss from over-ear headphones is there is slightly less sound stage, which I happily traded for compactness and portability."
24,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Have bought these headphones twice now, because they're incredible at blocking out noise. And they're comfortable. But both pairs stopped working after a year, despite my having taken good care of them."
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Outstanding sound quality, very transparent, and the controls work with my Nexus 5x"
26,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work so well I love them!
27,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these with the Avioms at my church. The sound of the other band people in my mix is near perfect. The only thing I don't like is putting them in. It's awkward, and sometimes I have to move quickly to my keyboard, and don't have time it takes to put them in my ear. I like the earlier design, however the sound is beautiful."
28,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound but poor quality cable. The cable of my headphones stop working before 5 months, now only I can hear the music from the left side of the headphones. I prefer buy a new cable from another company because I read that people who buy the cable from sure have to replace in less time than 5 months"
29,5.0 out of 5 stars,Had these for a few years gone through 6 cables but the iems themself still work and sound great very nice for the price as long as you get a good deal in the ear canal they are some of the best for the money.
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,A step up from the rest. Excellent everything.
31,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not excited about the fit for these earphones. I tried several of the optional ear bud covers and they still fall out of my ears and are uncomfortable. I owned an earlier model of these ear phones and they were of much better quality.
32,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds amazing.
33,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A little bass-heavy at times, but otherwise very comfy and clear-sounding."
34,5.0 out of 5 stars,fabulous
35,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound and noise reduction. I use them when I fly for work and they really reduce the noise.
36,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably the best headphones I've ever used. They fit comfortably and snuggly in the ear, and I can't even turn them up as high as my old headphones. Definitely worth the money. The bass isn't crazy or over emphasized, but quality nonetheless."
37,4.0 out of 5 stars,Liked them but the cord is too short vs the SE315. I was always catching it on things given the length and the rubbery texture. I lost this pair (I think) and am trying to figure out if I buy the same one.
38,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones for the gym.
39,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice. They do what you expect
40,1.0 out of 5 stars,"On my third occasion using these, after I had owned them for not yet two weeks, I found that if I turned my head to the right, the sound would cut out of the left earphone. This began spontaneously and I don't believe I did anything that triggered it."
41,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice color and sound. If you happen to decide between white se or blue se, take into account that they sound almost the same. Imho white have even better sound. No surprise, blue are older models."
42,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t say enough good things about these headphones... work great with my iPhone as well. Extremely comfortable for long periods of time.
43,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound really great. I had an issue as they wouldn't work on iPhone 7 (popping sound and vol controls didn't work). I contacted Shure and they recommended I exchange them. The new ones arrived 2 days later and no issues, just a bad set."
44,5.0 out of 5 stars,love it
45,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality was great. I had these for 4-5 months and they already broke and stopped working. I bought a new wire to see if it was just a chord issue but it's still not working. I expect a lot more based on reviews and the price.
46,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really awesome sound. No complaints.
47,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality, but they're somewhat cumbersome to get inserted and in good position in your ear. Noise cancelling properties quite good."
48,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great looking. Great sound. Amazing sound isolating like seriously you cant hear anything with them on. but slightly uncompfortable for people with small ears, other than that defiantly recommend."
49,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The foam tips that came with the iems weren't that great and mine didn't come with the tri cone tips but they still sound great .
Bought some comply tips and now we're in business"

51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"longest lasting , amazing..trump all other"
52,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great earphones but the part of the cable which plugs into a device snapped off... quality of sound is great though and the isolation is also great.

56,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent build and sound quality only issue for me was the jack had a very sensitive wire and l shaped plug might help otherwise amazing product
57,4.0 out of 5 stars,Received these beauties a few days ago and absolutely blown away at the quality at this price point. Absolutely no regrets.
58,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn’t even last 7 months, too expensive not to even last a year. I’m not a kid and take good care of these."
59,2.0 out of 5 stars,Returning. Left side quit after only a couple times of using.
60,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a set of clear Shure SE215 and they are bombproof and awesome. These are not. The cable is cheap and tangles easily.

Don't bother with these."

72,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Feels good to be home again. As an early adopter of E2Cs they died after years of daily use. I wandered trying a bunch of other buds, even Etymotics but nothing seals and isolates as well as Shure do and nothing blocks microphonics as well either.

These are still built very heavy duty like the E2Cs were too.

I think I'm going to finally get some ear molds done."
73,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Based on sound quality and noise reduction these get a 4 Stars, but this one is a bit on the pricey side but they work great at isolating noise this will save my ears working in a shop.
ot happy with this purchase!
I would hesitate to recommend to a friend!"
74,3.0 out of 5 stars,I first ordered a pair of the Shure ear buds without the mic and they seemed to have a much thicker wire. I just opened the package today June 11th and noticed that the wire on this model is thinner. Not sure if i am going to like these but i will try them the next couple of days to see if the wire tangles up or not. I'm not impressed so far...
75,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality is very good but disappointed that we can't remove the sleeve that fits over the ear buds to find a good fit. They seem to be glued on so can't remove them to find a better fit for my ears.
76,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was going to send them back because I can't really afford them right now but I tried them out first. Wound up with them in my ears for almost 8 solid hours.
77,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very nice earbuds. I only have two problems with them.
1. The cord is a bit too short.
- I find myself wishing the chord was a bit longer, maybe just 3 or 4 inches longer.
2. The bass isnt the best. It's there but if you're getting these expecting great bass sound maybe you should look for a different pair."
78,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these earbuds a few days ago and already sending back for a replacement. Was having intermittent cutout on the left earbud. As well the center button was not functioning as expected. You would click and hear the click but it would not pause the music. You had to press till you heard and felt the click and then a little more firm to get the desired functionality.

However, among these cons the sound and comfort are unmatched by anything I've ever owned or listened to. From Metal, to EDM (DnB, Trance, etc) these things sound great. Vocals are clear, instrumentation is articulated well, and has a very solid bass. These stay solid in the ear and the comfort is absolutely incredible to the point I don't want to take them out they feel that natural. Sound isolation is very good and the memory like foam creates a great seal.

I can only give these 3 stars at this point because of the hardware issues. I'm sending them back for a replacement. I've purchased and punished some Shure SE112-GR at $50 and they are still going strong even with all the rubber giving way and cracking and being used heavily all day for well over 18 months. To me $100+ earbuds should be able to hold up just as well. Will see how the replacement buds fare."
79,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love these earbuds. They fit nicely, but the quality of the sound wasn't as advertised. Not only was the sound worse than a pair of $30 earbuds, but the quality of the plastic felt cheap."
80,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product. Good choice for quality/price search. I bought this for my Moto G4 Plus but it doesn't works like I expected. Anyways, it a good option to listen music with good quality."
81,4.0 out of 5 stars,All fine but you need to press the play-pause/answer call button to make it actually work
82,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is superb. One of the better earphones I've listened to. The over the ear implementation is a bit difficult but after a few tries I got the on/off process down. The deal killer is the remote volume/rocker switch implementation. It's one piece with a very very small button in the center to hang up/skip songs. The one piece rocker makes it difficult to feel if your increasing/decreasing volume or skipping songs. Plus the small button isn't very tactile in sensing if you clicked it right or not. Half the time I pause the music instead of skipping a song. I have to take out my phone to change songs, etc. Thats just not how I use my earphones. I like to leave my phone in my pocket. It's too bad because they do sound great."
83,5.0 out of 5 stars,so good
84,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is inexistent in tis product. For a lower or similar price range (1More or Bose), there are other double and triple dynamic high definition drivers that can deliver quality balanced sound. Without a decent DAC amplifier, there is only a noisy bass sound that lacks high definition sound, thus making these ear headphones not worth it for the price. Good warranty (2 years) and confortable design are a plus though."
85,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very disappointed with this product. I've only been using these headphones for 4 months and they're already broken. They've only seen light use in dry conditions, but the left earpiece is unreliable and only works if the cord is positioned a certain way in the jack. I cannot recommend these headphones."
86,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love these headphones. And, for about one week, I did. Excellent sound quality throughout the entire range, capable of handling just about any genre of music I could throw at it. Once I got used to fitting them (which, honestly, didn't take long), I could easily put them on with one hand. And, because of the care given to the fit of these headphones, sound isolation was fantastic. Finally, a pair of headphones that I could immerse myself in for the 2 hours a day I spend on the train...

And then, catastrophe. I had the headphones plugged in to my iPhone 6s and had my phone in my pocket. I leaned forward to reach for something, and I felt something give on the headphone connector. Oh no. Next thing I know, I could only get audio over one channel. I took out the headphones to find the 1/8"" jack was broken. Still attached to the cord, but it was able to move in ways it couldn't before. I didn't put much stress on the jack for it to break like that, but break it did. I was heartbroken.

This appears this is a critical design flaw by Shure. If you compare the jack on a stock pair of iPhone headphones, you'll see a hard plastic casing around where the jack and the cord meet. Clearly, this additional casing is designed to take the stress of mobile use. On the Shure, nothing. Just soft rubber. The difference is clear: one headphone is up to the rigors of being used on a phone and one is not. For Shure, who market this m+ edition with the controls and mic as a mobile phone headset replacement, this is simply unacceptable. For that reason, I'm giving these headphones a 1-star rating.

No matter how good the sound quality, how comfortable the headset, or how well it isolates sound, if you can't use it on the go with any confidence, it's of no use."
87,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The audio jack comes out easily, it occasionally crackled, and the buttons on the wire went out. The sound was not anything special. (I got the white ones with the button thing on the wire)"
88,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Stay away if you don't like an unreliable earphone. Great sound, horrible reliablity! Going back to Bose."
89,4.0 out of 5 stars,"One of my first pairs of ""higher quality"" earbuds were the Shure 215K Black. I thought they sounded terrific-a ""fun"" sound was the word several reviewers used to describe them. I am writing this specifically to those people who bought the Shure and the additional kit for $50 that gave you a long cable with no ""ear contours"" that kind of flipped and flopped all over the place and really made the setup a bit unmanageable if you wanted to use a mic and iPhone controls.

Well Shure listened to their customers complaints and put together this new kit which comes with the white plastic shells and a black form fitting cable with mic and controls that works very well with iPhone and Apple devices. The controls do not work on Android devices. As far as the volume and mic, they are standard fare for an IEM in this price range, plastic but sturdy. The cable has no microphonics and is made of a relatively thick rubbery type substance similar to an RHA cable for those familiar with that brand. They are a bit bulky but work perfectly and only time will tell how they wear.

As far as comfort, Shure got it right with a very comfortable wrap around your ears and that great Shure fit. If you want a $100 pair of IEM's that sound far better than the cost would allow, spend the extra $20 and get these Shures and you will have a great pair of IEMS.

They say the bass is enhanced from the regular SE215 but it's not booming by any means. It is not a neutral ""audiofile"" sound. It is clearly a V shaped sound with slight emphasis on bass. Bass heads will love. Other will too.

They have something for everyone. Sound is subjective but you can pump up the volume of your iPhone to max, and the sound will still be relatively clear but loud. It doesn't take much to drive these.

Other reviews go into sound characteristics in detail but I am weighing in on the white M+. Give them a try, You'll probably be glad you did."

2,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because i kept a pair of E2's for 5 years and loved them, so much so that when the shielding wore off of the wire i re-shielded them until the drivers died. Thus when i saw these i just new my problems were solved, so i bought them. They sounded great, not as clean as my E2's but as good as it gets for &100. But only for about 24 hours, then i started getting a bad connection in my 3.5 jack. First i assumed it was probably my 4yr old iPod on its last legs, so i tried them on my newer iPod, my Galaxy S3, and my pc. I noticed that when i shook the 3.5 jack the connection would come and go.

I am debating whether to return these to amazon and buy a different brand like Etymotic, or just have shure replace the cable. But after all the problems i have read about with the earbud ends of the cable i am a little reticent. But i am confused since this is the same cable that they use on their higher priced models, and surely they couldn't be shipping $500 earbuds with substandard cables.

Now i know owning 2 models doesn't make me an expert on Shure brand, but now i am in a relationship and i no longer have the disposable funds of a bachelor, so when i can splurge on something i really want, it is a little more disappointing when i receive DOA merchandise that i was truly looking forward to. I am just happy my girlfriend didn't get them for me for christmas, she would have been even more disappointed than I.

Pros.....Sound great, more bass heavy than a ""monitor"" headphone, but great for everyday use. Replaceable cable could mean years of life for something prone to excessive wear.
Flush fitting which is good for use on a pillow in bed. Sound isolation is superb.

Cons.....Replaceable cable in my case realistically meant 24 hrs of use. Sound isolation, can be a bit overkill, in that my girlfriend couldn't get my attention by yelling
at me from 4 feet. Not to be worn when you need to be aware of your surroundings."

They are amazing for keeping out the howl, and have great sound quality. My music and podcasts have never sounded so good!

- Variety of ear inserts so you can choose most comfortable (size and texture wise - offer both foam and rubber)
- Cord is detachable from the IEMs so you can replace the cord when it goes out

11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the product from Shure I’ve been waiting for... They are way late to the BT/wireless game but I never really felt left out until recently. I wear a pair of SE535’s that have been around the globe and back and I’ve only gone through two sets of cables in the last 7 years. I’m very pleased with the easy of use of the BT functionality and pairing with my iPhone. I really wish they were up to par with the latest BT 5 classification, but no big deal. I use my headphone daily on my motorcycle and this the BT functionally is a huge upgrade for me. Thumbs up!"
12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are a major step above any other earbuds I've purchased, in terms of sound quality, level of protection to the inner ear that they provide, and their physical resiliency. These are more expensive than most on the market, but you end up saving money because they are nowhere near as fragile as the other kinds, and the detachable cord means that you don't have to replace the earbuds every time the cord is damaged; you simply detach the cord and send it in for replacement. It's also a lot harder to damage the cord because it's thicker and kind of insulated.

I purchased this because I have listened to music, all day at work, for years, wearing earbuds that range in price from $50-$75, and I had begun developing tinnitus as a result. Not wanting to further damage my ears, I switched to,over the ear headphones. These worked really well, but were too unprofessional for work (I looked like an air traffic controller) and didn't work well a at the gym. When I switched back to in-ear earbuds I could really tell how damaging they were; the tinnitus resumed and I began to find it unbearable to listen.

I bought these in the hopes that I could find something discreet enough for work, that produced great sound, and didn't damage my ears. Fortunately, these fit the bill. The sound-cancelling element is surprisingly powerful, which helps protect the ears, is great for the gym, and blocks out annoying co-worker chatter. The sound quality is great; not as good as my high-end over the ear headphones, but definitely better than any earbuds I've used before. The sound is buffered to a certain extent which means that it doesn't trigger my tinnitus and, hopefully will help prevent further damage. I have been using these for close to a year now, so this seems to be the case.

The only thing I don't like about these earbuds is that they're tricky to remove. This is a great feature for the gym because they do not move, much less,pop out, no matter what I do. This is less advantageous at work, when people come up to my desk and I am unable to quickly slip them out of my ears to answer a question, I kind of have to pause and unwind them and then fiddle with them to get them back on the right way. This is somewhat annoying if I am frequently interrupted, but that's nowhere near as annoying as listening to earbuds with poor sound quality that steadily damage my hearing.

The other feature I really, really like about these is that the cord is detachable. With all,of the other earbuds I've used, I found it really frustrating that, as soon as the cord was damaged, the sound would cut out and that was that. No matter how careful I was, this happened a lot, so constantly replacing $50-75 earbuds was really frustrating. With these, the cord detaches from the earbuds; if you damage the cord, you simply send it in for a replacement. Even though these cost more initially than other ones on the market, you definitely save money in the long run.

13,5.0 out of 5 stars,"About me: I'm a low-end audiophile. I'd buy the expensive stuff, but I simply can't afford it.

About the Shure SE215s: I'm on my second pair of Shure SE215s. The first pair got worn over time, then I let someone borrow them. Suffice it to say they aren't borrowing my stuff anymore.

The SE215s have fantastic sound quality. The bass, lower-, mid-, and upper-range are all crisp and clear. The bass is not boosted, but nice and even with the rest of the frequency range. I've listened to classical, dubstep, jazz, hip-hop, reggae, metal, folk, and soft rock. I've even listened to a pop song or two. Every song I try they outperform any of my other earbuds. The SE215s also block out background noise remarkably well, so there are few distractions from your audio experience. These buds also contain the sound they produce to your ears. You have to nearly damage your hearing for someone sitting next to you to hear a whisper.

One note: these buds are not meant to be worn out and about. You absolutely can, especially if you want to block out the sounds on the bus or subway, but they are not made for it. The cord is longer than normal buds for extra reach. The cord is also thicker than normal for extra durability and quality. As mentioned above, the SE215s block the majority of the background noise, so anywhere where sound is important (such as walking around in a city), they can be dangerous.

As long as you are looking for quality earbuds for focused listening, you can't go wrong with the Shure SE215."
14,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wouldn't recommend buying these earphones. They sound great, but shortly after I purchased them, the left earbud kept fading in and out. I constantly have to pull on the cord, pull it out of my ear, push the plug in and basically fiddle around with it every couple of minutes to get the sound to come back. I think the problem is due to a poor design. The cord plugs into the ear buds making it very easy for the connection to short out. At any rate, don't waste your money. I wouldn't buy these again.

UPDATED 1/11/18. I sent these in to Shure as a warranty claim, and they sent them back to me and said they are COUNTERFEIT product. DO NOT buy these from DailyDealzLA, as it's a scam. They'll break and you'll be out the $100 you paid for them. I brought this to the attention of Amazon customer service, and they did issue me a refund. Don't take the risk buying anything from these scam artists though. Amazon should remove them as vendors!"
15,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Man where do I start on these. These are some quality IEM's. For me, isolation is important because that's part of the whole point of IEM's. If I just wanted quality, I could use my headphones or studio monitors. IEM's are designed to be small and lightweight. Read: portable. If I could sit in one place I'd use my studio monitors. Anyway! On we go:

I first got into the IEM scene with some VSD1S's which were highly recommended by several websites and many reviews, saying they were worth way more than the asking price. I bought them, instantly didn't like them -- they seemed fatiguing to listen to, weren't very comfortable, and transmitted a lot of sound. Sitting in a library, I could still hear everything, even people whispering. Tried burning them in for 100 hours, still no better.

I bought some more ""isolating"" IEM's -- the Meelectronics M6 Pro's, attracted by the price. I couldn't get those to seal in my ear canals very well and they were not comfortable at all. They sounded decent. But then again, what good are they if they don't isolate and aren't comfy?

Enter these SE215's. First time I tried them on, they were noticeably way more comfortable than both other IEM's I'd had. Also, instantly (no burn in) they sounded way better. Other reviewers have said that the bass is ""heard, not felt"" -- which is true. The bass is there but not ""forward"" or muddy by any means. Very balanced. Highs are detailed and the imaging is fantastic. Vocals and mids are there but not prominent in any way. I like my music 'flat' and these do that wonderfully. They aren't fatiguing to listen to, and oh BOY do they isolate! In fact, that deserves a whole new paragraph.

The isolation is unreal. It's like wearing earplugs, that play music. It's great. I have a video of my cousin trying out these earbuds, and I ask him, ""Hey, how's the isolation? Hello? Must be good"" and his face the whole time screams 'bliss' with no care in the world. He definitely did not hear me. I was on the plane, and even with the music paused, I still couldn't hear the flight attendant ask, ""Chicken or beef?"" These definitely are the most isolating earbuds I have ever used. The only place these MIGHT be beat is with droning noises like the jet engine on a plane, where active noise cancelling headphones might beat them. But that's because of how ANC isolates versus how these isolate. (ANC is better with constant noises like droning engine sounds, and these are better where sounds are more 'random'.) In a busy city center, or a subway, or in a loud area, for example, these are hands down superior.

tl;dr: These IEM's are wonderfully comfortable (wore them on a 12 hour flight with no issue), have great sound, and isolate better than anything I've ever tried. Definitely worth the money."
16,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Shure SE215SPE-B-BT1 (special edition, bluetooth) in anticipation of getting a phone with no headphone jack. I also wanted an upgrade from my Klipsch S4i's without breaking the bank. These headphones have delivered on nearly fronts! Sound quality is more than adequate. Compared to the Klipsch S4i's, the Shure's have much greater clarity in the mids and highs. Lows are more substantial on the Klipsch, but definitely not as well controlled. I've always found the bass on the Klipsch to be a little overwhelming. These headphones are not for bassheads, but they are not lacking in bass either. Battery life is fantastic, and the connection is strong even from across the room.

SOUND QUALITY:
Lows (4/5): The special edition headphones supposedly have extended bass compared to the regular model. I do not have the regular model, but the bass does seem well-extended. Bass is slightly emphasized, but it is still very well controlled (at this price point). There is definitely enough ""thump"" to satisfy most people (make sure you get a good seal). That being said, they are a tad more muddy than my Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. The detail is much better than the Klipsch's, which seem to emphasize quantity over quality.

Mids (5/5): This is apparently Shure's ""bread and butter"", and I have to agree. The mids are super smooth and forward, reminiscent of my Sennheiser HD598. The detail and clarity is excellent, and I even heard some details I had missed on the Sennheiser's. Vocals sound very intimate. Overall, the mids make these IEMs shine.

Highs (3/5): The highs are definitely where the Shure's falter a little. There is a fairly noticeable treble roll-off (at around 16-17 kHz), which leads to a perceived lack of clarity and detail. All my other headphones have more detail in the highs (but the Klipsch definitely has sibilance issues). The headphones respond decently to EQ, but I found that a lot of my music still lacks the ""sparkle"" compared to my other headphones. However, this does have the benefit of making the headphones very easy to listen to for long hours (I've listened for 6 hours). It also makes it really easy to perceive that the volume is lower than it actually is.

Soundstage/Imaging (3/5): Pretty much what I expected for an IEM. They were better than my Klipsch S4i's. Soundstage was quite a bit smaller than the ATH-M50x and miniscule compared to Sennheiser HD598's. Good separation of instruments.

Comfort (4/5): This is probably going to hit or miss for people. I find the Shure's comfortable enough. However, they never ""disappear"" like my Sennheiser's. The memory wire takes some work to make them fit, and it takes a bit of practice to get them on quickly. The earphones themselves may be large for people with small ears. For me, it barely fits (I have small ears), but I don't really notice the size. The foam tips should be inserted like ear plugs to get a good seal. The headphones are much more comfortable one everything is adjusted to fit you.

Noise Isolation (5/5): Wow! I couldn't even hear a band playing across the quad, especially one the music is playing even at low volumes. These headphones also completely blocked out someone trying to talk to me. Great for disappearing into your own world and for airplanes. Bad for walking in traffic...

COMPARISONS:
Vs. Klipsch S4i: I found the Shure's to be an absolutely upgrade to the Klipsch's, even though they do not cost that much more. Clarity and detail overall are significantly better on the SE215's. The Klipsch's are muddier and sound veiled in comparison. However, if you like more ""fun"" headphones, the Klipsch's may still be a better choice for its booming bass and generally V-shaped sound signature.

Vs. Audio-Technica ATH-M50x: I found these to be comparable in overall sound quality, with a slight edge to the ATH-M50x, especially in the highs and soundstage. Bass is full and controlled on both. Mids are a little more forward on the Shure's.

Vs. Sennheiser HD598: My HD598's are the standard against which I compare other headphones (until I upgrade those anyways...). Here, I still find the Sennheiser's to be the superior headphones. However, they definitely excel in different areas. Clarity and detail are won by the Sennheiser's hands down. Soundstage is massive on the HD598's, so they win there as well. Even the mids, which the Shure's excel at, are a bit more clear and intimate on the Sennheiser's. The Shure's, however, do win in the bass department. People claim that the HD598's have a flat sound signature, and they do for the most part. But there is a definite dip in the lows (just look at a frequency response graph). If there is a thumping bass line, it will be much more enjoyable on the Shure's. But I still love my HD598's :)"
17,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to be a Sony guy, but wasn't able to find current earbuds with good consistent reviews. I've seen these Shure earbuds around for a while and seemed to have a good reputation.

There are plenty of earbuds included. My favorite are the foam buds that are kind of like memory foam. These help block external noise so well! I'd never seen those before so I was immediately impressed.

Being able to disconnect the earphones from the cable is a nice touch in case your cable ever goes bad, which happened to a different pair of Sony's I had many years ago.

These things are really great. I listen to music between 5-12 hours during my work shifts and they never cut out like my Sony's did; and those were about $50 more.

There are only a couple things I don't like about these is that they have to wrap over your ear. It can make quickly removing them a hassle and a little discomforting. The other is that changing the earbuds can be difficult. I don't do it often, but when I do I'm afraid I'm going to grip them wrong or apply to much force and tear them. I haven't yet, so maybe something to just be aware of.

I would recommend these to anyone in a heartbeat."
18,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have now become a member of the 3 months-and-they-fail club, as several other reviewers have experienced. A long time fan of the Shure SE wired monitors, I had hoped this bluetooth adapter would be a pleasant mobility solution, so I purchased the SE215 bundle to try it out.

Using HD FLAC recordings the sound quality is just fare, suitable for the gym and commuter trains but not for serious listening, although after trying a number of BT listening devices none have risen to great heights of acoustic performance as yet.The SE215 BT is about in the middle of the pack, and not as good as I had hoped. The controls are a little clumsy, but ultimately workable. The status voice is fine, until the battery runs low when it becomes more of a nagging nuisance than if the headset simply shut off.

As noted above, the unit has now failed completely after three months of moderate use. It will neither charge or turn on. I'll update this note after talking with Shure customer support, but at present I don't recommend these because of the apparent inconsistent build quality."
19,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am glad to have a genuine Shure product, because I know it won't harm my in-ear monitors and (at least so far) has the power and clarity necessary to drive the Shures. But the power-on process for these things is beyond annoying. I have a Google Pixel 2, and after powering on the Shure bluetooth teather, it connects to my phone in about 3 seconds. At that time, the music or podcast starts to play, and everything is cool. But about 1-2 seconds later, a female voice pipes up -- over my music or podcast! -- announcing that it has connected. Well no kidding, Sherlock! I have thus far not found any way to disable this unhelpful announcement.

Then, on the power-down side of things, holding the button first tries to act as the ""Google assistant"" or some such, and only by holding it down further do you finally get the double-tone indication that it is powering off. I would think just tapping the button would be sufficient for ""hey let me talk to the cloud"" and holding it down would honor the age old tradition of ""hold down the power button, and the electronic thing powers off.""

Separately, as mentioned I find the sound richness to be better than I was expecting after hearing all the bad things about other bluetooth connections. I find the volume to be plenty for my walking through the city. The battery life seems to be sufficient for a whole week, where it is used for my walk to work and walk back in the evening."
20,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality was fine, but the cable layout was awkward. As you can see in the picture, it's asymmetrical, with the volume/power bit on the right side.

21,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When you think of a group of people who need perfect audio in a demanding environment with excellent isolation, a group that comes to mind is live stage performers. These are not earbuds - they're in-ear monitors, and holy crap does it show. They're Shure's entry level IEM with only a single driver, but they sound absolutely stunning - there's no comparison between these and your standard earbuds whatsoever. I use one of the silicone ear pieces (it comes with 4 or 5 sets), and when they're in, absolutely all external sound is blocked, even without audio coming through. They fit into your ears in such a way that I don't know how you could fail to insert them properly (which is a bit issue with other earbuds not getting a good seal and sounding poor), and the cable near the earpiece has a slightly stiff wire in it so that it forms over your ear, further securing it. The earpiece is designed in such a way that you can wear earmuffs or lie on your side and they do NOT jam the earphones into your skull (which was one of my bigger complaints with other designs), and the wire is replaceable in case it gets damaged. Only note is that the cable is a thicker than your average earbuds - which doesn't bother me (and makes it more resilient), but is something other people have mentioned they wouldn't like."
22,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the option of wireless for my 535's. The sound quality is just as clear as wired and no sound delay with videos.

I would give 5 stars if not for the design of the wireless wire. Disappointed in the design with the extra piece hanging down. Other wireless earbuds only have the one piece with the controls and mic. I'll gladly put up with this if it holds up well and truly does give close to 8 hours on a charge.

Edit: so I moved this rating to a 5. Initially I complained about the bulkiness of the additional battery pack on the cable. But after seeing the lack of play hours on other wireless cables without the battery pack, I'm thankful it's there. I've been using the cable for 5 days and really like and highly recommend it."

24,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Used these one stage for a gig in a really noisy Greek restaurant playing acoustic mic'd instruments for in-ear monitors for all 4 band members. While I found them very comfortable and easy to use, others had a hard time figuring out the over-the-ear wire. If they'd bothered to read the instructions, it would have been pretty easy to figure out, but they kept trying to put them in the wrong ears and upside down like you would the lame earbuds from an iPlod or something.

Even though these are the ""base"" model, they sound great, even when just using them as headphones. I tested them out at home for 3 hours the night before and they were really comfortable and I don't usually like wearing earbuds for more than an hour or 2. The foam cushions come in several sizes so even if your ears are huge or tiny, something should work for you."
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these earbuds for the past several months as my daily headphones. I'm very happy with them - they provide great sound quality, excellent (if unintended) passive noise cancellation, and are easy to clean. I use these while walking but prefer more comfortable, higher quality over-the-ear headphones while at home or working at a desk as these can be a bit uncomfortable with prolonged use.

I'll agree with other reviewers in saying that getting them in your ear the first few times can be a bit difficult but you get the hang of it fairly quickly. As with most earbuds, these come with a variety of covers - both foam and rubber - to get your desired fit. The covers that came with the earbuds - I think they were foam, I don't really remember - were difficult to get off and I accidentally ripped the foam off in the course of trying to get them off. The covers in general are a little difficult to get off - my only complaints about these. Also included is a nice, branded fabric case which I use to carry the buds in.

I think the price is a bit high for what you get but I'd still recommend them for anyone looking for a step up from $5 earbuds or Apple's included earbuds for listening to music."
26,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bit on the pricey side but they work great at isolating noise this will save my ears working in a shop. I keep them run through my shirt into my pocket where my iPod sits. Fit comfortably in my ears all day with the smallest of the included buds. No longer have to blast my music just to cover the outside noise. Worked great on a 9 hour flight at isolating the noise as well.

Edit: I lowered my rating from 5 to 3 (2.5 is closer to my actual feelings) stars because the first pair of headphones I received, noticed that where the cable attaches to the post that goes into my iPod was broken causing music to skip when moved or jiggled. These were replaced by Shure for free. Now less than a year later the problem is happening again and I now have to pay to return them to Shure to have them (hopefully) fixed and returned for me. While its nice that they will hopefully honor the warranty I now have to wait a week or so to have them back. If these were cheap headphones I would not care, but considering I have had $15 dollar headphones stand up to far worse daily beatings, and still work. It is just unacceptable. If you want a good pair of headphones for travel or minimal activity these may be for you. If your searching for good, noise isolating headphones, that can stand up to daily use you may want to keep looking."

When asked by Dan Rather if he still listened to music Gregg Allman replied of course but only with head phones. That is my preference too..

28,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off by saying I am incredibly satisfied with the overall audio quality of these headphones. I have owned a plethora of various in ear headphones and these are hands down the finest audio quality. If my review were based upon that factor alone it would be a 5 star. The problem is that I purchased these headphones mid June 2015 and I have already purchased 2 cable replacements. I bought these based on the idea that instead of having to drop money every few months on headphones I would have a durable pair that would last at least a year (which I have found is a reasonable length of time based on the usage and wear I put on headphones and the previous cheaper headphones I have had last longer) but I have been very disappointed. As of yesterday my second replacement cable had an ear bud stop working just as on the first replacement. This is highly disappointing because I do really like the headphones but considering that my $100 pair of headphones is now $160 pair and soon $190 if I decide to replace the cord again. I use them fairly strenuously but I take good care of them, leaving them in the case when they are not in use. I will be contacting the company to see what they have to say and will update when I have a response."
29,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second set of the SE-215's I have own the first pair broke the sound tube, they still work but I can no longer fit a sleeve on it. These are very tough earphones, The replaceable cable are the big deal. I love the Etymotic's but they no longer have replaceable cables, and it is the cables that fail. With the Shure just purchase new cables My first pair had one fail at just over a year of use the next 2 where chewed up my Jimmy the Irish Terrier. they sound great, and as I have said heavy duty tough."
30,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very pleased with these ear buds.
I use them while motorcycle riding. They work well to diminish wind noise while providing nice clarity and sound separation-better than in-helmet speakers or standard ear buds."
31,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great neutral sonic quality, sound stage, and comfort. Wish the wires were a bit more durable, though they are replaceable which is a plus (though expensive which is a minus)."
32,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is great, only knock is that cords are very rigid. Over ear placement is nice once in but a bit awkward to put in. Very solid product for the price range"
33,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love these in-ears! The sound isolation is great and they sound amazing! There are a few times that they've maybe sounded a little muddy, but that's very rare. I've used these both as headphones and as in-ear monitors for live performance. They perform great in both areas! Would definitely recommend!"
34,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really mediocre for the price. It takes forever to get them to fit right and even afterwards, your ears feel congested with sound.

UPDATE: These require some getting used to. After a while, your ears adjust and they become easier to wear. I might update to 5 stars if they get even better with time."
35,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty great, made even better by buying the iphone cable as well as in ear plugs to replace the default tips (find them in the suggested items)."
36,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice quality , but a little annoyance putting on and taking it off"
37,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, these are good options for sound isolating earphones. I use these in a live church service setting as in ear monitors. The quality is good but have had some problems with crackling in one of them. I have read and believe it could be the connection point between the earbud and the wire. The others work fine. Overall happy with them and work well for our needs."
38,5.0 out of 5 stars,great quality in-ear headphones. Make sure you try all of the different changeable pieces that comes with it to find the one that fits best in your ear!
39,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones 1) have great audio quality, I am always hearing details music that I never hear on my 5.1 THX audio system at home and 2) The sound isolating works incredibly well for me with the foam earbuds (included). I can be in a room of people talking and literally hear nothing. My friends will make fun of me and yell my name and say foolish things about me, and I have never noticed until they wave their hands in front of my face. Great headphones for getting in the zone for computer work.

I had Klipsch Image S4i's before these and these Shure blow them away."
40,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The stock cord is abysmal. Buy one without the wire guided cords and inline controls for $15 on ebay.

Sound quality is excellent for everyday listening. I think that they give me the most I could possible get out of my music streaming services (about 300kbps). However if I were to invest in a DAC I don't think that they would improve by much.

Also the sound isolation is ridiculous. Could easily take out the cords and use them as earplugs."
41,4.0 out of 5 stars,I had some difficulty putting this on at first but i got used to it and overall they work great.
42,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited to listen to this Shure IEM. So many great reviews, not only from Amazon, but from all over objective review sites.
HOWEVER, when I received it, I immediately test it. Fit wise it was great. very tight and it was truly sound isolating earphone. But THE LEFT EARPHONE WAS BROKEN!. I could not hear anything from it, so when I fidgeted it the wire that was connected to the left earbud, it was working momentarily and as soon as I moved my head, it stopped working.
so, I am returning today.
so much expectation and so much disappointment. Shure should have much better QC on these models."
43,5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely pleased with both the sound isolating function and the dynamic sound quality. Once properly positioned in your ear these earphones tend to stay in place. Getting accustomed to how these fit in your ear took me a bit of time but well worth the effort. Very happy with my purchase.
44,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using these earphones for the past 2 years and ordered three sets of them. As everyone else has stated, the sound quality is fantastic, but that's not what I want to focus on. I want to talk about the design. I've had 100% failure rate with these within a year and all due to the shoddy connection between the earpiece and the cable. The audio becomes intermittent or cuts off whenever I move, which is unacceptable. It uses a clicking connector where there is a central lead and the outer rim acts as the other lead. It seems to be gold-coated so there aren't corrosion problems, but these leads loosen over time. I use these carefully in the office or while doing homework so I'm definitely not abusing these. I think what's happening is that as you use these earphones, the slight tolerances shimmy the connections wider over time. I'm also sure there is some friction that wears these parts thinner. You can buy replacement cables that solve half of the problem for a few months, but do I really want to drop a large fraction of the cost of these earphones on cables like that? I'm giving this one star because it has a serious engineering problem that makes failure a guarantee."
45,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like nice sounding audio. These are incredible clear, clearest in-ear phones i have ever had. Only downside is the way in which they fit in your eat. Not exactly comfortable or easy to pop in and out. I like the technology and the looks, just not the comfort."
46,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm use to using the 425s provided to me on stage with an Aviom, which works well together. I already purchased my own memory foam ear tips to avoid stranger danger in the earwax department. Since they are all breaking through heavy use though, it was time for me to get my own pair to have in case needed.

I totally was taken aback when I plugged this personal pair into a device at home without all the adjustable levels on the Aviom. I mean, my SkullCandy $30 set has a more tolerable balance by far! I have sensitive ear canals, so I'm wondering the process of trying out a gazillion ear tips, including the extra order of the 3-tiered white silicone ones, has caused my perception to be irritated in general. I would almost classify it as an overstimulated sensation. The Shure's are truly louder than the cheeper sets I have, not limited to the above mentioned. I guess you could say they are really fuller in retrospect. I think maybe I need to get used to this to appreciate it, and I'm just overwhelmed with sorting the sounds right now. There is no difference in balance between the los, mids, and his for me at this point. They're all there, but they blend to an almost unison level. Can you say ""mono?""

One thing I did learn is that the ear tips make a HUGE difference on anything past the mids getting through. I'm finding the best sound, and honestly comfort, with the memory foam ear pieces. Nothing is beating the memory foam with these for balance. The positive for me is the way I can receive the vocals in my ear in spite of a very loud environment. Sitting here at home, nothing more than the UPS man delivery making my dog bark and my refrigerator humming, really shows me these are more of my stage ears, not so much my recreational choice. Maybe my ears will become more seasoned over time, maybe not."
47,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantatic!
48,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The right ear piece died after a week. Amazons response? Send it back. No issues, no hassles. Typical for Amazon. Which is why I've already purchased another set from them. I'm using them on my motorcycle for music, phone, etc. Sound isolation is pretty decent, even at freeway speeds."
49,5.0 out of 5 stars,Always great quality from Shure. I've trusted this brand with my ears for like 3 years now and have moved up to the se315 like a year ago.
50,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my Shure 215. It plugs onto earpiece in seconds.
51,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been searching for high quality headphones that will stay in-place while exercising and running. I have tried numerous different high-end brands and styles. The Shure SE215-K are the first headphones that I can honestly say, live up to what they claim. They are great quality, producing very clear, crisp sound, while staying in-place during exercise and running. I would highly recommend the Shure SE215-K headphones to anyone having similar challenges."
52,5.0 out of 5 stars,Used these at work and could not hear any of the loud mouth people around me. Work great on the plane too. It's like having ear plugs in and listening to music. Prefer them over my bose noise canceling headphones on the plane actually
53,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE-215 earbuds are very sturdy and sound good. They fit flush to the ear, and they block sound without being uncomfortably deep into the ear. They are very comfortable and light--so much so that you almost forget that they are there.

They come with standard accessories like differently-sized foam and silicone tips, carrying case, and cleaning tool.

The 3.5mm jack is pretty wide, so you may not be able to plug these headphones into a phone with a thick case on it.

The 64-inch cable is pretty thick and should hold up to the damages of daily use.

All-in-all, these are good headphones for the price, and they are definitely worth a try."
54,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound isolation is wonderful, but the in ear comfort and sound quality is not at good as I expected, granted the sound quality is far superior to standard headphones, but I had higher expectations for these. Wearing the headphones for long periods of time can become mildly uncomfortable. To clarify I am not an audio expert or a musician, just my own opinion for a consumer headphone. I could see these being really great for on stage monitors."
55,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best earbuds period. The foam tips need some breaking in at first but after a few days you can wear these until 6 hours because thats when your ear starts feeling sore. The sound is right where it should be, clean treble and bass, none of that scratchy sound you get from most earphone products these days"
56,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable, good selection of earpiece sizes, good noise isolation, good sound quality for music and spoken. I bought these because I heard they were good for people with smaller ear canals, and I am pleased. They fit under my over-the-ear headset at work and remain comfortable for hours."
57,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Earphone quality was very good, had a clear and crisp sound that I had never experienced with previous earphones. However, the quality of the wires were sub par and broke within a few months of ownership. The wires themselves are very sturdy and well built, but the wireform (the bendy metal part near the earpiece) was cheap and broke easily. If you're using your headphones a lot, this might not be the best choice for you, because I would rather not pay 30 bucks for a new wire every time the WireForm fit breaks."
58,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these on airplanes and trains. I'm happy with the sound quality, and the sound isolation is so excellent that I can enjoy listening to chamber music (which has a huge dynamic range) in these noisy environments.

I don't like them for walking around the city. In this situation, the isolation is almost TOO good, and I don't feel safe being so cut off from my surroundings. I just use my cheapo white earbuds here.

Also not great in the gym or puttering around the house.The foam part wedges deep into the ear canal, while the wire loops over the back of the outer ear, so if you accidentally catch the wire on something and they get suddenly yanked out, it hurts! I prefer my cheapo white earbuds.

These are also not the first thing I grab when listening to music on the sofa in my relatively quiet home. After a while, my inner ear starts to feel really hot and stuffy, so here I prefer my old Sony over-ear headphones.

But they are great for airplane and train trips."
59,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great, fit well, and look awesome. Love them, I wish they came in a wireless version."
60,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just lost my Weston um10 so I decided to try this out. Not as comfortable as um10, sound is okay but I expected more. Though cable looks like it could last. Anyway, the price performance ratio is okay."
61,5.0 out of 5 stars,"TL;DR
Worth the 100. Not as full bodiedon the low end of the frequency chart. (If that's something you are looking for)

I have an 11 year old set of Shure IEMs (They're still going strong).
I also have a set of Beat Solos I'll be basing my opinion of the 215s and Old IEMs to the Solos.

I use headphones primarily for my Roland TD30, but I will also come back to review the sound attenuation ability when I play with an acoustic set.
I use the small, rubber inserts provided by Shure.
Right off the bat, These are great quality for the price.
First thing I Notice:
The Higher and Mid frequencies, seem to be more prominent compared to Beats.(Expected, Beats are marketed more for low end heavy hip hop)

First thing I did was youtube ""headphone test"" and The ""Luigi Barber shop"" came up, so I tried it. The whole beginning Scared the bajesus out of me! I kept looking over my shoukder to see if someone was in the room with me. These head phones really were crisp and the isolation of ambient noise really made you feel like you were in the barber ahop."
62,5.0 out of 5 stars,"sounds great, best design for fitting in the ear and not causing soreness to any part of your ear. There is somewhat of a learning curve to get them to fit correctly."
63,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product, i read a lot of reviews and compared with lot of other products in the price range, nothing can come close to this, just try these and you wont be dissapointed."
64,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had five SHURE in-ear headphones over 5 years. The SE215 will be my last. Each one has had a similar problem - with the connector dieing and losing sound to one of the ear buds, usually the left. The sound, feel and fit are great. But I can not recommend them on durability. All my SHURE have lasted approximately a year. So bear in mind when you buy them - if 1 year is OK for the price, I can recommend them. If not, then look elsewhere. Thus the 3 stars instead of 1."
65,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For a while I had the Klipsch S4 earbuds, and I was perfectly content until the left ear gave out. I debated whether I should 'upgrade' or pick up a new pair of S4s. In the end, I decided to go with these Shure SE215s, and they do not disappoint! I was skeptical if I would notice a difference from the S4s, especially given their high ratings. I'm glad to report, there certainly is a difference.

The high notes are crisp and the lows are perfectly balanced, with a hearty bass. Best of all, I'm noticing nuances in the music that I have not heard before. These are a great pair of in-ear monitors, I highly recommend."
66,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it...great sound and decent battery life.
67,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It could just be me. I didn't quite know how to modify the ear buds to fit in the right direction in my ears. The sound seems to be amazing, but I struggled so much with the ear phones that I had no choice but to send it back."
68,1.0 out of 5 stars,Received these earphones 41 days ago and haven't used them a dozen times yet and the left ear bud doesn't work 95% of the time. Can't return them because I'm outside the 30 day return policy. Expected much better quality for $99.
69,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sound no better then a $20.00 pair from the Flea Market. Too Bad.
70,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is a lot better that many in ear headphones I had in the past. The materials are excellent. The price is expensive compared to similar new products that cost a quarter or less, like: https://www.amazon.com/Earphone-Headphones-Running-Eartips-Microphone/dp/B00Y0F6IBG"
71,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones I've had for the price.. Far superior to the bose I had! Noise cancelation is great and the sound is wonderful (outstanding bass)! I use them for working out and the block all the surrounding noise out. You can even wear them to bed and not notice they're in.. Definitely worth the money
72,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Awful build quality. They feel cheap, and both my headphones stopped playing any sound after less than two weeks of moderate use. Only used them sitting down at work, then coiled them up and put them in my pocket for a few weeks. Apparently that's too rough for these headphones to handle. Don't buy these if you want something that lasts."
73,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are fantastic. I ride the subway every day and the noise isolation is great. They fit comfortably and they make talk radio and heavy base music alike sound amazing. The cables are the sturdiest of any headphones I have ever had ... as if that isn't enough, they are also replaceable. The noise isolation is far better than Klipsch s4 headphones and they are just as comfortable. Noise isolation is on par with Etymotic m3 headphones, but these are far more comfortable. I did notice some cable noise with these headphones but it seems to be coming from the behind-the-ear portion, which is a bit ""springy."" Overall, these are by far the best $100 and under headphones I have owned thus far."
74,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, bought these to drown out my annoying co worker that sits on the side of me and never stops talking. Put these babies in and boom silence. Granted he then proceeded to start waving infront of my face... But one problem at a time"
75,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for some headphones for the gym that were a step up from the 10-15$ pairs of headphones that I usually buy, most meeting their demise by me destroying the cord. The replaceable cord was a big seller for me and this is very reasonable bang for buck option that has a replaceable cord.

I've never listened to more than a 10-15$ pair of in ear monitors prior to this purchase. I'm floored by the sound. Even my wife who claims she can never hear the difference between any speakers that I have auditioned in the house or in a car commented how good they were."
76,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are not as pretty as my other in-ear headphones but they are by far the best ones I own. They are able to keep out the noise on the subway (including the performers and crying babies). The foam does not look pretty but its the exact material my Hearos ear plugs, so they are so comfortable and stays in my ears-- amazing! I got great sound and comfort from these!"
77,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really hated earbuds. But after using this I can't believe I've spent all this time without them. This are the best I've heard in my life. Do your self a favor and buy them asap. Only downside I've found is that now I want to try the other more expensive models.
78,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best sounding Wireless headphones out. Way better than the B&O, Bose, and garbage BEATS. I had the regular SE215's and decided to get these as my workout pair. Great Decision. These feel really good, while running, Boxing, Lifting etc."
79,4.0 out of 5 stars,I've had many pairs. They are great but the newer iterations have taken the beats path and boosted the base and limited the mids unfortunately.
80,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones and hope to enjoy them for a long, long time. I really appreciate headphones with replaceable cords. I read a lot of reviews before choosing these. The only downside is that they aren't compatible with the more heavy duty cases."
81,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe these headphones have good sound quality if they can fit in your ears. But they did not fit in mine comfortably or lock-in even after over an hour of trying to put them in.

Buyer beware that these are not very comfortable and may not fit your ears."
82,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my old Shure buds bit the dust (the cord cracked and there was exposed wire), I tried buying 2 different buds. The Klipsch and Beats. Neither came close in highs and lows. The noise isolation is great, which is important to me. I want to hear the music, not background noise. I highly recommend Shure buds!"
83,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound! But right out of the package my right bud has been cuting in and out. Not the worst situation but not great considering the price paid for these.
84,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my solution to a noisy office where people close by talk. Blocks out considerable amount of talking. The white noise that I play sounds great (for white noise). The part that fits in the ear, right outside the ear canal, is a bit large for my tiny ears. Hurts a little and takes a little while to get them in and out."
85,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've gone through my share of ear buds and Shure makes the most durable snug fitting buds I've found to date. I'm 6' tall and the cord length is perfect. A dropped player has its momentum broken just before hitting the ground, and unlike other headphone cables, the cord can take it. The replaceable cord is a great feature. Though a bit expensive for a cord, it beats having to replace the entire setup. I'm no expert, but sound quality is as good as anything else as far as I can tell. Wearing these buds makes me feel superior as I watch all the crappy-ass ear bud people around me. Don't be a loser. Pony up the few extra shekels to get a quality product."
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wearing it takes a bit of getting used to but it produces really great sound! Noise cancelling is really excellent, definitely not something you wanna wear while going for a run, be carfeul when you're crossing the road =P"
87,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok I am a motorcyclist. First let's talk about helmets. For a helmet to work it must fit snugly on your head. That means when you put it on it will graze your ears as you slide it over your ears. If it doesn't your cheek pads are too thin. If you can pull on each side of the helmet as you slide it on and separate it so it doesn't graze your ears you have one of those cheap helmets or you're a Harley rider with a beanie.
So I put the earbuds on and each time I slide the helmet over my ears it flips the wires off my ear and pulls the earbuds out, and yes I am using the triple flanges. I have always had triple flange buds and have never had this problem. Triple flanges are the most important thing to eliminate wind noise on a motorcycle. Another thing I noticed is that when putting these phones into my ear it takes two hands, one to push it in and another to hold the wire over my ear, this is not acceptable. This means I can't ride my bicycle and remove one to talk to someone.
This wire over the ear is a selling feature but it really is not needed. My buds have always had a clip on them, you attach the clip to your shirt or helmet strap and it yanks on the clip and doesn't pull the buds out of your ears, problem solved.
These are going back."
88,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these a few years ago, still sound great! Cable did go on me(accidentally broke the connector) but was swapped out, they work, sound great and are easily the best sounding/lasting headphones. If it was not for the shape of these, I could use them for longer periods of time. The Klipsh Image S4's are just as good, but function better for longer time"
89,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I read a lot of reviews both positive and negative before taking the plunge on these, and I'm really glad I did. It certainly helped with my initial experience - the truth is they really do take some getting used to putting them in. Past that the only caution I would give is if you wear glasses they feel a little awkward. Otherwise, they have immaculate sound and are built very well. Great investment!!"
90,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Picked up the SE215s to replace Bose Noise Canceling over ear headphones. I was tired of the Noise Canceling hiss and was tough to sleep on a plane with huge headphones. These have proven to be a great alternative and couldn't be happier.

Some people complain in-ear headphones can hurt after a while, but honestly, I have no issues. From rock to hip-hop, to classical to the Grateful Dead these are far and away my favorite purchase in a long time. They're small, pack in a nice little case and take up a 1/10th of the room in my carry-on as the Bose. Took a little time to get used to putting them on, but the noise isolating is awesome and the hiss is gone -

I'm sure there are a lot of audiophiles out there that will find something wrong with anything, but I can say they are a great sounding set of monitors and am really happy with the purchase. Great build quality, strong cable and nice sound. For $100 they're a great option. And if I accidentally leave them on the plane I can buy 2 more pair before I get to the price of the Bose."
91,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones for durability based on some reviews and articles and I was severely disappointed there. This set only lasted me around 6 months like any average set would under normal use. The sound wasn't very good either for the price. I would look else where for durable headphones or good sound.
92,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these for worship team with the Aviom monitors. They have amazing sound and fit perfectly in my small ears. Easy to clean and very easy to use! Great price!
93,5.0 out of 5 stars,I reviewed the Beats earphones favorably but these Shure phones are kickass. Very well balanced with good bass and excellent highs. they block out sound well and stay in position under my motorcycle helmet. Love 'em.
94,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: cool look, decently comfortable even for the gym, removable cord.

Cons: I found these earphones to be no better than a cheap pair of standard Apple earphones. I spent an entire day listening to music with them, I tried a plethora of different types of music. I usually just wear standard Apple earphones. After a full day of listening, I went back to my apple pair to see if I could tell the difference. I played the same songs at the same times for the highs, lows, mids and bass. I heard no difference in any of these other than bass. The bass didnt help though because it just overpowered the others. I had a friend try the same tests to make sure I was crazy and his exact words were "" I literally hear no difference"".

If you're looking for a sturdy pair of headphones with cheap sound, these are the way to go. If you want much better sound than your standard Apple pair, I would look elsewhere."
95,5.0 out of 5 stars,From rap to rock these sound amazing. If you get the right fit with the ear peices then you love these. Best sounding earphones I have ever owned. If all you have ever listened with is the Apple EarPods then you are missing out on so much.
96,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent balance in audio quality and price. I bought it for gigs but ended up using them for situations where there is a lot of noise around me like mowing the lawn and on airplanes.
97,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for my wife, they work great and have excellent sound. She uses them when we are reading in bed, I do not hear anything. Great for both of us."
98,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality sound. They adjust to the ears like earplugs and the sound is pretty clean and nice. I'm looking forward to using them as stage monitors too.
99,3.0 out of 5 stars,ok ear buds for just listening for middle and upper tones....no bass response....since I bought them to hear myself playing bass they were useless to me. I could hear everyone else but not me.....
100,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great earbuds. I've always been a fan of Shure electronics.The only bad thing is that the earbuds are detachable from the cord and can easily be lost. Replacements are almost the cost of a new set.
101,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these as a Christmas present for my boyfriend have he loved them. He's big on getting earphones with great sound quality and he said these are just absolutely amazing.
102,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE 215 earbuds are the best earbuds that i ever bought. I've owned many earbuds, literally, but none like these. I'm new to the ""audiophile"" world and have not been very experienced with really good headphones but on the price margin I can say that these are the best out there. These buds out perform more expensive earbuds of its price range, especially the Beats by dre, no disrespect or hate intended but these headphones blow it out of the park."
103,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Really love these but the way they sit in my ears, causes sore spots and had to switch to a different pair. also, a bit hard to keep the cables shaped comfortably around my ears"
104,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clear sound; replaceable wires. I use 'em at the gym, where the abuse is hard on the wires; the wires aren't all that cheap, but cheaper than buying a new set of not-so-good in-ear monitors."
105,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is awesome. I ended up returning them though because they are a pain to put on. I gave it a few days of use just to see if it'll get easier but they are just not easy to put on. One of the sides also kept coming out.
106,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product -- the sound quality is fantastic for the price. I purchased this back in Feb 2013 and I've had sound issues with the wire+speakers over the months. I contacted Shure about this and they fully replaced the product within 2 weeks. Great warranty coverage!
107,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, but doesn't use any specific Bluetooth chipset, no APX or APX HD support. However it works and is a great buy for the sound. Just don't forget to grab a wired cable for times of low battery"
108,4.0 out of 5 stars,These were for my husband. He uses them for traveling. He liked that he could change the size of the insert to make it fit his ears properly. He says they are. Erg comfortable. This is his second pair. He lost the first set.
109,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones. Slight learning curve to get them to stay in your ear. Too good for my music, definitely exposes the flaws in my low fidelity .mp3 digital library. Worth the price."
110,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure is a great brand. Second pair of these - I do a lot of outdoor running and lifting in the gym. Durable, never tangle, crystal clear sound."
111,5.0 out of 5 stars,"5 stars, good goods! Thanks!"
112,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If I was stranded on a deserted island, these would be my top choice along with water."
113,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the sound signature. Excellent base, warm meaty mids, and fresh, but not crackly highs. As soon as I took them out of the box, one side wouldn't connect. I wiggled the cable and it worked. Fast forward to two hours later. No sound from the right side of the headphone. I highly recommend you test the headphone immediately. This seems to be a problem with every shure IEM in this lineup. I was disappointed."
114,4.0 out of 5 stars,In terms of sound I would give these earphones 5 stars. The quality is fantastic and they really do block out a lot of outside noise. My only issue is they are kind of a pain to put on given the shape and where the wires are supposed to fall.
115,3.0 out of 5 stars,"sound quality is decent but not as good as other in-ear headphones (Bose) that i've purchased. Having to try placing the wire behind the ear with long hair and glasses is difficult to do, it's a chore."
116,4.0 out of 5 stars,These work great except for the tips. It was difficult to get them to completely seal inside my ear. I had custom molds done to fit these and was much better. I still prefer over the ears headphones.
117,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound quality for this price. Need to get us to putting the buds in the ear because it can swivel..
118,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Second pair I've had within the last year where the left channel mostly died within a few months. Amazon replaced the first pair. I'm not even going to bother with these any longer, and just find some earbuds that will last. Sound quality while they lasted was ok, but the texture and fit of the earbud was weird."
119,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using for a year, one of the wire sometimes not too often has the problem of connectivity (no sound on that side of course). Though the wire is replaceable, it is pretty expensive like 40 dollars. Anyway, it is easy to carry with. I usually take it in my pocket. The small bag provided greatly reduced the possibility of wire messing up with itself. One problem is that in a cold winter day like here in Michigan, the wire becomes really stiff if you know what i mean."
120,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are cheaply produced. The will work a few months and stop working. The wires short out easily.
121,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Prior to the SE215 i had EC2 and SCL2s. Loved both of them but managed to lose them both. Frankly. at this point, I'm glad I did. The SE215s are the best sounding headphones I've ever had. Far superior sound to both the SCL2s and EC2s. Great separation, strong but not overly heavy bass. Highs and mid are clear, with somewhat airy and transparent presence.

Some have complained about this fit -it's possible that if your ears are small, they may not be comfortable. They are a very different kind of fitting headphone. The body of the ear piece fits in the belly of your ear. Looks almost like a hearing aid. For me, they are comfortable and i run the cable over my ear. This style is much more sound isolating then the previous SHures I mentioned.

Cable is a wee bit long, which is a bit of a hassle for working out. I need to get some kind of clip or run it under my shirt. Some folks complained about noise from the cables (rubbing against shirt, each other, etc). I have not experienced that noise.

Highly recommend. I love 'em."
122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've worn these for 8 hours at a time on long flights. Good sound and comfortable. The ear pieces keep them in pretty well, even when you nod off. One thing, be sure to keep them clean so the sound pipe doesn't clog with ear wax."
123,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the money you can't have better then this. Very Good.
124,5.0 out of 5 stars,2003. First pair thousands of miles in rain ' below zero weather '. 120 deg temps. Even indoors. Work like a champion that they are . 2015 Bought another pair
125,5.0 out of 5 stars,thank u!
126,5.0 out of 5 stars,"my absolute favorite before I got a custom in-ears, highly recommended if you want seriously awesome sounds in an earphones but can't afford a custom fit in-ears, yet - or you can just save up and get the custom in-ears right away… BUY THIS!"
127,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones, make sure to change the foam piece to fit your ear because it does get a bit snug."
128,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my husband and they broke in less than 6 months. For the price I would think they should have lasted longer. I plan to reach out to the manufacturer and see if they can assist in repair/replacement.
129,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are hands down, really REALLY good headphones. I've had them over 5 years now & they still work 100% like they did out of the box. Sound quality & comfort is exceptional, & noise reduction is significant. I often use these while mowing (funny story re that later), & my exhaust decided to fall off my mower 1 day which resulted in an ABSURDLY loud 6+ hours mowing my giant lawn. Without these headphones this would be unbearable.

Now the funny story; couple months ago while mowing & listening to music, went to grab my phone to check the time & noticed it managed to fallout of my pocket & disappeared out of sight down into the depths of my mower. Music was still on & sounding fine, but needless to say I panicked & immediately shut everything off. After following the cord, I luckily found my phone sitting on top of a flat but EXTREMELY hot surface right above the blades (phew). It melted the crap out of the edges of my phone, & my beloved headphones cord, closest to where it plugs into the phone (see pic). Kid you not, at that point I had 100% accepted they were done for & I'd need to get a new pair. BUT, long story short, I'm overjoyed to report that they are in fact NOT done for, & are still somehow functioning as perfectly as they always have. I wrapped the damaged area with electrical tape & on we went!

In short, buy these TANK headphones that not only produce a wonderful listening experience, but can also somehow withstand being nearly destroyed & shrug it off. I would expect this level of performance from a product costing twice as much. Highly recommend.

**7/22/16 UPDATE - Headphones still going strong. Just wanted to add a couple notes that some might see as relevant. I mostly listen to talk-show type podcasts & progressive/nu-disco type (ie; Luke Fair, Soul Clap) mixes on Soundcloud. The range these are able to perform at is exceptional. Voice is crystal clear & bass is low & strong like it should be. I favor these over a pair of much more expensive Sennheiser over-ear headphones."
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't normally give 5 stars very easily but truth to be told; these are high quality ear buds for this price range. I used to own vmoda to audio fly buds. While they are expensive at $100, they do add the potential value of these buds. At first, I didn't know how to wear them. From there, I simply read the card manual on how to do so. Only took a matter of one minute to learn. I love the fact you can detach these buds with ease. The simplicity of keeping the buds healthy for long term is pure genius. The simple fact ear buds headphones can get ruined from wear and tear while it wont happen likely due to the interchangeable cords.

Now as for the ear buds itself it's tangle free. I was worried whether if they were going to get tangled badly due to having a rubber like finish. Instead, they don't stick. Most importantly it's bound inside the cords of wires, fabricated cloth, and finally the rubber of its exterior.

The sound is where the love truly comes in. Pure, crisp, and detailed to note. These ear buds were made primarily to listen, enjoy your sound tracks to its full amount, or even play by ear when making music.

Comfort is all around 10/10 in itself. It doesn't slip off, stays on the ears, and good for long term use in the canals."
131,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are durable as hell and will last a long time. In a week they went through: going through the laundry, being chewed up by my dog, and then slammed in a car door. They still work fine. My only issue is the wires. The wires are extremely durable, until you get to the part that is meant to bend around the ear. There is a thin metal band in it to keep the wire shape when you form it around the ear. After about 2-3 months, the metal will snap, and rip through the plastic. It will also cut some of the wires, making your music cut in and out at certain angles. This is a huge design flaw. Fortunately, they have a two year warranty. I have had to send them in for wire issues twice for the same problem, but each time they're replaced they work as new again. Make sure you keep the damn receipt guys. Print it, make multiple copies of it. You're gonna need it so you won't be paying for Shure's design flaws.

The sound quality is amazing. The bass is super punchy. It is average and good in the high ends and mids, but not poor. I am a bassist and I can clearly hear the bass line of every song, which is nice for me. I also practice bass with these, and the quality is perfect. Overall, sound won't be an issue.

The wires are meant to bend around your ears and both ear tip designs are super comfortable. I can sleep with these on because they don't protrude out. Comfort isn't an issue.

Overall: buy these. keep the receipt so you can easily replace them when the wires without a doubt break."
132,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for these based on the Shure brand (which is highly respected). However, these have a very flawed design. In order to get the ""in ear canal fit"" you have to really tweak these things into an angle that is uncomfortable and causes the cord (which is detachable) to detach. This is a pain in the rear especially if you are at the gym. I find myself spending more time trying to rearrange these rather than enjoying them.

A detachable cord is great in case the wireform cord wears out over time (which all will do) and then you can buy an inexpensive new cord to continue using the earbuds. However, they detach WAY too easily. A simply twist in your ear to get a tighter fit can cause it to fall off.

They also lack deep bass. If you listen to classical music these will be fine, but then again you probably would want an over-the-ear design for that.

These are NOT for working out, running, or anything where you are in motion. They are not comfortable and they lack bass."
133,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As a preface: I really like these headphones. The sound to price ratio is fantastic. Very comfortable, and the behind the ear cord has really won me over.

Now for the bad part: The sound often cuts out at the joint between the IEM and cord. Only happens when you move your head though - fine for those in traction. Looking through the forums, this is a fairly common problem thought to be caused by sweat or the connection becoming loose over time. I use these at my work desk, where I neither have reason to sweat or put any stress on the cable (haven't even been using them that long). Will experiment with some of the DIY fixes suggested on the forums, but for now I can live with it (wiggle the wire a bit). I hear this issue crops up with the entire line, so buyer beware at the high end (if I paid $500+ and this happened I would be livid - one star review regardless of sound).

That said, THIS set is $100, and although they have problems, I really do like them. It kind of balances out? Not sure whether I'd buy them again or not. Would definitely get the extended warranty."
134,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, rather than writing it all out in paragraph form, I'll just bulletpoint everything. **Note: I am not a musician or someone with a great ear for acoustics, but I consider myself somewhat of an 'under $200' earbud connoisseur.**

Pros:
- play with the cushions they provide as one will fit - I use the medium memory foam ones and they have created a tight, but more important, comfortable seal
- wires are thick and well-made - I haven't experienced much disturbance or interference from touching them - they seem like buds an actual musician would wear on stage
- over top and around the ear wire placement is new for me, but it didn't take long to quickly get the hang of them
- the sound is top notch - deep bass, vocals are clear - again, I'm no audiophile, but I can't hear anything wrong
- case is handy for storage

Neutral:
- I thought I read somewhere that the wires didn't have to go over the ear, but I can't figure a way to have them just hang down. That said, as mentioned previously, I've gotten the hand of wearing them this way so it's not a problem now

No real cons I can think of at the moment. I've had the buds for a week now and am very happy with them.

That's my review. I'm John Pace and you're not."
135,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Motorcycle Full Face Helmet Trick: When putting on my full face helmet, I could not get a good seal. The helmet pushes on my ears and earbuds, and opens a gap where sound gets through. By unlooping the rigid portion of the cable from behind my ear and using it as a spring to push between the helmet and the earbud, I can now get a perfect seal.

Pro Tip: Pull your ear lobe up and back to open your canal. Roll and massage the foam down like a foam earplug. Insert and hold into your ear canal, allow the foam to expand. If they don't muffle everything like an ear plug, try again.

Back story: I was not impressed with these. I bought them to protect my ears from noise, but they barely seemed to be better than normal earbuds. Well I had some time while sitting on a plane to try my luck and it turns out I only had them half inserted. The trick is to massage the foam and really open your ear up. Maybe I have small canals, or they turn sharply, but now that I have them in properly, they sound A-MAZE-ING."
136,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great. I don't have golden ears, but I believe I can at least partly tell the difference between good and bad headphones/earbud. I loved my last pair, sony buds that I only replaced because the cord finally gave in after probably 6 or 7 years.

The complaints about putting these in are founded, but honestly, if you spend a little time practising, it's not complicated and you can find easier ways. Sometimes I'll put the cord over the ear first, then fold the bud into the canal. Other time, the opposite. I tug on my lobe with the thumb and ring finger and use my index finger to apply pressure on the body of the plug to seat it in my canal.

I do run with these in. They block a lot of sound, but not everything. I' pretty hyper vigilant about my surrounding when I'm running, so I'm usually very aware anyway. I wear them to listen to music while working in the workshop and it turned the quite loud combination of my radial arm saw + shop vac into an EXTREMELY manageable background sound, and I could still hear my son yell at me to shut it off when he wanted to ride his bike in the garage - all without taking away too much from the music.

In less than perfect settings, like resting my head against a pillow (or car seat) they do start to hurt a bit after about an hour. General wear, however, hasn't really had that effect.

The cord doesn't tangle remotely as much as my previous pair, but I hope to keep up the habit of winding them and putting them in the pouch that comes with them.
I got the ""black"", but they are transparent black. I'd rather opaque, but really, it's not a big deal.
I do sometimes wish the distance between the ""Y"" where the L/R cords connect was a little longer, again, it's not bothered me enough to dock points, really.
I'd actually give a 4.5/5 but don't feel the need to take away an entire star.

(Update)
7 months it made it without a hitch. Then the right side started to flake on me. I have to contort the wire and get lucky to get sound, which usually stays fine until I remove them and have to do it again the nest time I use them. I'll be returning to Shure for a replacement, but I have to say that my previous Sony pair, with near daily use, lasted 6-7 YEARS without issue, so this bothers me. I'm certain Shure will replace at least the cable, otherwise I'd be dropping more than the one star I took off. I'll update if I have other issues with the replacement process or otherwise."
137,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Damn, who knew getting just the right ear bud at the right price would be so difficult. I run about 3 miles a day on a treadmill at my health club. If I can hear myself breath, or there is a cable thump or the bass is distorted or too shallow, or there isn't enough treble, or too much treble, or they are not loud enough, or they are too loud, or they are uncomfortable, I can't use them. Boy, now that I am reading my review I sound really picky. I guess that's cause i am with buds. I've tried; bose, Sony (not bad but not good enough) Yurbuds, Klipsh, an active type of Sony buds, Etymotics, Adidas Senheisers, and a bunch I can't even remember. All around the $100.00 to $125.00 mark. I have to admit that when I got these I was not overwhelmed but had resigned to using them as I was more tired of exchange and lost all hope that there was something great waiting for me to try. I used the white triple flange rubber earpieces (licked them before I put them it) and viola! I got a tight seal that provided the right mix for my exercise. I have to admit they are a bit of a pain to get into my ears at first, but when they're in, they're in for the duration. There is very minimal thumping and the cord tucks away over my ears around the back of my head so they never get tangled while in use. I think the people that complain about the cord are losers because it is a bit thicker but who cares as you never see it anyway. I've only had them for a few weeks but so far they are really eggsellent. Two thumbs up as long as you use the white flange ear tips. Oh almost forget, cut a smidge of the rubber from the end of the tuby like end of the flanges so they didn't reach so far in my ear and now they are comfy as all get out."
138,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I picked these up after growing tired of metronome bleed during recording, and noisy practices overpowering some pretty crucial, ""need-to-hear-please"" parts of songs. Not surprisingly, they're amazing. The fit takes a little getting used to, as the cords connected to the buds put up a bit of resistance to folding over your ear, but once they're in, they're really in. Nearly dead quiet for ambient noise during recording, and snug enough to allow freedom of movement. The buds themselves are very comfortable, and I've yet to have any reason to pull them out of my ears other than being done with recording. The construction itself is very nice, and I particularly liked the disconnecting drivers, as storage is pretty simple with the included case once all is unplugged.

Sound quality is superb. Very transparent response across the low, mid, and high frequencies, which came as a very pleasant surprise from a single driver ear bud. Definitely a useful reference tool during mixes.

My only complaint is the cable length, but it's not an unusable length.

Overall, I love these headphones to death, and I'm sure they'll continue to see use with me over the years to come."
139,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They broke after less than 2 weeks. Almost no sound comes out of the right side. And it seems to be the right bud itself since I tried my friend's cable and they're still dead.

I took great care of them, always carrying them in the pouch and only used them around 5 times total. Never been so disappointed, will be returning for a refund. I've had $5 earphones that lasted much longer."
140,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would like to say I was kind of hesitant upon buying these since I never tried I near earbuds before in my life to think of it these are actually pretty good, funny thing is one of my ear conals are smaller than the other one which was ok because I had the sizes of the ear tips. Overall these are good to have and if these are your first purchase then good props."
141,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound great, replaced a very old pair of Shure in-ear phones. Wore them for 3 hours today while at work, very comfortable."
142,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very good headphones, great sound quality and look l, especially for the price. My only complaint is the headphone jack is massive and I cannot use a phone case (Spigen) at the same time as these headphones."
143,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, I can't hear a single thing besides the music when using it. Just what I needed."
144,3.0 out of 5 stars,Underwhelming sound and kinda flat. They're okay as a travel set if you don't want to risk your nice cans.
145,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are fabulous quality. They do the job and were a fair price. Very effective. Only hear instruments I have qued
146,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is all I wanted and then some. I was hoping to find something I could use to listen music on while I cut the grass. Yep this set of ear monitors did that and did it well. Now I can cut grass and enjoy music and I don't have to listen to the roar of the mower.

148,5.0 out of 5 stars,"work well, easy to use, easy to carry around, no issues at all. Work as advertised. I like the fact they are very compact. would recommend to others."
149,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these things. Worth every penny.
150,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure is considered by many to be the gold standard of microphones and audio products. And since their corporate headquarters is right near where I grew up, I was excited to try these earphones and didn't mind paying a premium for them.

I wish I actually liked them, but, alas, I really don't. I expected a rich, full bass and full-spectrum sound reproduction. Instead I found the bass was weak and the rest of the sound, while not poor by any means, simply didn't wow me at all. Worse yet, they are the most annoying earphones I've ever worn. Difficult to insert in the ear canal, they also have a wire designed to go up and around your ear to help hold them in place. While effective, it's not the easiest thing to put on compared to anything else I've ever worn, And more annoying is that the tiny earphone itself is actually detachable/replaceable so there's a tiny snap fitting that tends to rotate when you're trying to insert them in your ear. Like many things it takes some getting used to and after a while it becomes easier with practice, however, for my money, the annoyance factor, combined with the high cost and mediocre sound made these a real disappointment. Sorry, Shure, I'll keep an eye out if you come up with a better device, but this one just doesn't cut it for me."
151,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't expect them to be such hard to fit. My ears are not large at all, but the part used to fix the plugs on ear is too short, making it really hard to fit."
152,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound very good for the price. The noise canceling is also fantastic! Personally I found that they can get my ears a bit sore with prolonged use, but it may be different with different ears.
The fact that you can also fully replace the cable if it life ends up damaging it so these have an even longer life than normal due to that feature."
153,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off by stating that I do not consider my self an audiophile. I just have a particular sound signature that I like. I like some bass (leaning toward accurate, not overly enhanced) with nice full warm mids and non-sibilant highs.. I HATE sibilance.. I can now say that the SE215-K Fit the bill perfectly for me.
This was initially a rocky road for me. I found these to be extraordinarily uncomfortable for me and none of the supplied sleeves would seal properly for me. I tried the Comply brand sleeves and still no joy. Swallowing and side to side movements would break seal compromising sound. Next I tried the tri-flanged sleeves from Shure. Dear God I thought I was driving a 2 penny nail into my skull. The sound improved dramatically for the five minutes I could tolerate them. With the knowledge that I would never use these sleeves unless I felt a had to do a penance for some horrible wrong I had done, I went ahead and cut off the the first (smallest) flange with an Xacto knife, then braced myself and proceeded to jam these things into my ear. To my surprise all discomfort was gone, the seal was solid regardless of my heads position or what my jaw was doing. The next couple of days entailed me getting used to the idea that these where firmly in place and where not going to fall out. I found myself constantly checking the fit. The third day I could finally concentrate on the sound. I was quite impressed. I could make out different instruments in my Dave Matthews tunes that I could never distinguish before and Florence's ( of Florence + the Machine )voice was so warm and powerful and distinguished I was simply floored. One month of nightly listening and the sound has improved in regards to being able to distinguish instruments and the like. I actually fall asleep and lay on my side with these on every night. So far none of that dreaded noise cut off others experience from the wire connector. I find its much more stable to tighten the wires under the chin rather than behind the head.
Had my initial journey in getting a proper fitting sleeve for these things not have been so arduous I may have given it 5 stars. I'm very happy I didn't give up on them and return them. I'm so pleased I may upgrade to one of there higher end models when these wear out. (If I can get passed the significantly higher price tag)
Would I recommend these to my friends? Yes, with a caveat on finding the right fitting sleeves, Since I have all these extra lying about I would let them try before they buy.

Have a Great One!!

154,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unbelievable sound! These are great at drowning out background noise. For only around $100, they are totally worth it. They are also very high rated on head-fi.org, the foremost authority on headphone quality."
155,3.0 out of 5 stars,"cord durable, but very heavy. fell out of my ear"
156,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for someone else. I tried them and the sound quality was very good as well as the noise isolation. It wasn't complete but to 35dcb. Therefore only could rate a 4. Also a little clumsy getting them adjusted to your ear.
157,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave these a shot. I have Shure 425, and an iPhone X, so I was excited to make my premium Shure headphones wireless. First, let me say that my view of Shure as a brand was very high. At $99, this was a expensive, but given the Shure name, my expectations were high. I had considered other MMCX compatible wireless settings such as Westone and other much cheaper 3rd party, but didn't like the lack of multipoint Bluetooth in the Westone and others.

Also -- one other note... I don't write 1 star reviews. I also rarely return stuff. This product was an exception disappointment. I would return but I'm about a week outside the 30d return window All told, I have use these for maybe 3 hours, each time thinking it must get better.. but it never did. The eye opening experience is when I put my AirPods back in and realized how much better they sounded -- that's saying something....

Pros:
-Wireless - Ahh... my headphones are wireless. I guess that is something.

Cons:
Virtually everything that matters...
- Sound quality -- there is a noticeable drop in audio quality from wired. My Apple AirPods (which are good, but not great headphones) have superiors audio quality to the wireless Shure.
- Form - There are several bumps in the wire (the control and the battery pack). I'm not sure how you are suppose to wear these, but they are always in the wrong spot. If you lean down, this giant battery pack comes swinging around your neck. I'm a big dude and these just never fit right.
- Price - No way this is worth $99. I would buy the cheapest MMCX headphone adapter and give it a shot... it can't be much worse.

No comment
- Battery -- I can't comment on battery life since I couldn't stand to wear them long enough to get thru even 1/2 a battery.
- UI -- The user interface is just fine. Power button is pseudo intuitive. Pairing is pseudo intuitive. Audio UI guidance in headphones is fine."
158,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love! I have been using these earphones for a couple months now and I haven't had a problem with them. The sound is clear and it does a great job of blocking out unwanted sounds. I sing on a worship team and normally stand right in front of the drums. Since using these earphones, I haven't had a problem with the drums overpowering every one else. So happy!"

160,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an earbud problem. And by that I mean, for many years, I purchased what felt like at least 1 pair of earbuds a month...mainly for working out but also to drown out my surroundings (and sometimes people I didn't want to hear). As a college student, durability and noise isolation were important...but I also didn't have several hundred dollars to drop on a pair of earbuds. These things were exactly what I was looking for: detachable, braided, really strong cable that seemed like it could both withstand a lot, and, importantly, could be replaced if it broke. You see, every month, I'd go through a pair of earbuds and the cord would break on something. An elliptical machine, a bicycle peddle, getting caught on something and ripping. It was rarely the actual earbud that failed. Just the freaking cord. So, I was really happy to get something where the cord could be replaced.

But if that was all these things were good for, I wouldn't be writing this review. I've owned various qualities of earbuds--klipsch X10s, various sennheisers, bose...and these things sound AMAZING. I now have a triple driver Westone W30, and, well, these don't beat that. But, those cost $400, and the difference is NOT amazingly significant. I have no idea how Shure made what are likely relatively cheap dynamic drivers sound this good. I say that because...these things cost $90, and the quality of the cord, construction, and multitude of earbud tips themselves probably come to around $40. Then lets assume a $10 profit, and they've got $40 for two drivers...so these could well be $20 drivers. Yet, they sound as though they're hundreds of dollars (once you get the right eartip fit). Not only that, they freaking don't break. Now, being my clumsy self, I've still managed to break the cord a few times, but I was able to replace that. And they've endured myriad of sweat and grime that I've thrown at them through my daily activities. They're still going strong more than 2 years later. And when I did have an issue with them, Shure's customer service was responsive, fast, and efficient.

In summary...these things sound great, don't break, you can replace the cable if that breaks, and shure's customer service is great. I wish all products were like this."
161,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are perfect. Since they block out virtually all sound, I can leave my volume low to save battery life and still have tons of sound. Also good for studying if you just want to block out the sound of those around you (in a cafe or pub) without having to put in actually earplugs. For the price, I highly recommend these earphones to anyone."
162,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these. I've been trying to get by on cheap earbuds in my performances. The sound quality was never good. A friend put me on to these Shure earbuds. They are the best. We'll worth the money.
163,5.0 out of 5 stars,"wonderful soun range, very good attenuation of ambience sounds. we recommend use ambience mic to your personal monitoring mix"
164,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these as in-ear monitors on stage while playing bass. The sound is great, the low end is very clear. I'm still working on the fit, but have only been using them for about a week. Very pleased so far."
165,1.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe I'm slow since most people gave these headphones a favorable review but I think these headphones are awful. They're uncomfortable and the sound quality isn't that good. Maybe I didn't get it in right because they did easily come out but headphones shouldn't take more than 15min to put in. My ears were literally hurting from messing with these to fit in my ear. I tried different sized ear pieces as well since usually the small size is the one that fits best. I've tried numerous mid/high quality headphones right around this price and up and I can say with confidence that for $99 these are definitely not worth it.
166,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Awsome to be able to fo cord free on my 215 and 425 headphones. I don't have any issues like others have had with the battery and controller which I just clip to my collar with the included clip. Battery life is okay. I am getting about 6 hours. Volume is a bit lower that I would like. I often use them in noisy environments. Sound quality on my samsung S7 is about 80% what it is when corded. Much more noticeable with the 425 than the 215s. I have also been able to improve the quality by using different bt and sound engines on the S7. Compared to the other cheaper bt headphones I have tried these are substantially better, just not perfect."
167,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Shure ear phones are the greatest sounding ear phones I have ever had. And the true sound isolation is beautiful. I even was able to listen and approve a time sensitive audio mix sent to me in a gymnasium during a basketball game. Almost total isolation. It was quite strange listening to music as the players beat on each other mercilessly. It lent a cinematic quality. Anyway I would highly recommend these. There is a bit of a learning curve to the correct placement in the ears. But once you figure that out you are set.
168,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like these earphones. I am in my private concert hall every time I plug into my Fiio player. Het the most fom your music and try this product.
169,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good....sound isolation is awesome...they work great. For in=ears monitor...the best for the price!
170,3.0 out of 5 stars,These will not fit in everyone's ears. I would suggest trying them on before actually buying if possible.
171,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and truly noise cancelling. I did ""break them in"" by playing them for 24 hours at my normal volume a mix of music but I cant say I noticed a huge difference in sound quality. My only issue with them is that they are currently lost and I cant use them"
172,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, if you care for them it will last for years! however, you need to take them out every once in a while because they get a little uncomfortable resting on the bottom on the ear. despite that minor flaw i still love these headphones!"
173,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed with bass response - there is none
174,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound on these monitors is great (after breaking them in of course).

The real reason for the review is Shure's great service. One of my earbuds inexplicably went out. I cleaned them with the tool provided to no avail, so I decided to send them back to Shure. They received the earbuds on a Friday night (confirmed via email) and by Tuesday I had a replacement pair from them. Great service. Very fast. They clearly are standing by their product. Great company. Highly recommended."
175,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, the sound is outstanding. They have just enough bass and plenty of treble. You will hear sounds in your music that you never knew were there. This is kind of spooky, especially in a quite area with no one around. They are very uncomfortable and hard to get use to. I have worn them for about 80 hours and still find it hard for them to be comfy. This is why I gave them a four star rating and not five. They come with a small, medium, and large foam buds and small, medium, and large rubber buds, so you have plenty of options to get the comfort you desire."
176,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones with excellent sound, good bass, and wonderful isolation. Sometimes the low-end can be a little strong and distract from the highs and the mids a little, but with a little bit of EQ adjustment they sound amazing. Very durable. Easily the best earphones I've ever had."
177,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These do what they are advertised to do. I gave them 3 stars because I have a very difficult time inserting them in my ears. Once in, they're fine. Also, the cord should be longer."
178,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best earphones for the price.
179,5.0 out of 5 stars,as good as anything shure. I'm sure the better ones are better but they work great. No noise at all and fit the ear well
180,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it. I am extremely picky about my headphones. These have fantastic sound, especially good bass for earbuds. Would definitely recommend. The style takes a little getting used to and may feel uncomfortable for a while."
181,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use to use really cheap earphones...and someone convinced me to try Shures after my most recent earphones died on me. The sound is great...and i have a feeling i won't have to replace them for a while.
182,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a back-up pair to my custom Ultimate Ears IEM's while those were being fixed. I am a drummer and need in-ear monitors when i'm playing live. The sound is fine, but the cheapness of the plastic moulding is the true flaw of this product.

The outer plastic is very rough and is quite painful against the ears. I suppose you could try and sand it down, but ultimately I'd pass on these cheaply crafted in-ears."
183,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the Shure earbuds for about 2 months now. I swear by them. They really have the best quality for their price. I was hesitant to purchase based on some of the other reviews and I have experienced some of the issues.

If your sound is tinny, you need to find the appropriate sized ear buds. I have rather large canals and need to use the largest foam ones to create a perfect seal. Not only does this help block out sound, but it is also required to get the full sound effect. When I tried to use the smaller silicone earbuds, They sounded tinny and had extremely low volume.

My cables have been working like a champ without any issue and they are my daily use earbuds."
184,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earbuds sound amazing. I use them as in ear monitors at church and they are the best earbuds I have ever used. I like how the buds are removable from the cable and the cable can be replaced.
185,5.0 out of 5 stars,"$100.00? Insanity for what you get. And don't get me wrong, I mean that in the best way possible. For the money, these things are awesome.

For comparison, I previously owned a pair of SE115's that I was a pretty big fan of. Those weren't quite what I was hoping for, but they were cheap. Well, I had some extra money so I started looking for a new pair of earbuds. I looked at Shure's line because I've always been a huge fan - the company makes good earbuds. Well, I looked at the SE215's and the SE315's. For the money, most people seemed more impressed with the SE215's, so that's what I went with.

They are awesome.

Get them, you won't regret it! A huge step up from the 115's."
186,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely very durable.
Sound quality seemed best with the black foam sleeves. The foam needs to be
fitted perfectly into the ears (not too tight, not too loose) for excellent sound quality.
Found that switching the left and the right earphones helped improve the fit."
187,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice headphone, good noise canceling. only complaint is how long it takes to put them on. ones you are locked in you are in a different reality though. overall a good headphone for the price and i would recommend them"
188,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product great service but sound was lacking little bass to me
189,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely crisp sound. The only issue is the sound cancellation is as isolated as possible, which is what I was looking for; however, people have yelled my name right next to me and I have not been able to hear them. The behind-the-ear design takes like 5 minutes to figure out, I had to look up a video, but once you get the earbuds in snuggly, you don't forget how to do it."
190,4.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly good quality for a pair so cheap. I've had them for about a year or so and have had no connectivity issues that seem so common. Voices do sound a bit empty but other than that they're a solid option for the price range.
191,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible product. The conectors between the cable and headphones are not reliable sound is constantly on and off. The wire in the interior of the cable broke off with only a couple of week of use, making it impossible to fit it around your ears.
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
192,5.0 out of 5 stars,fast ship .. good headphones
193,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound very balanced the bass is good even for a single driver
194,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these because of other reviews I had read of them. I play drums and sing background. They sound better than the Shures' that came with my monitor system. It beats carrying around a 50 lb. wedge (that feeds back).
195,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Broken...right ear stopped working after only a few weeks of Sunday morning Worship use.
No help from Amazon, my loss. Don't waist your $, try a different brand or company."
196,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not going to say much about the sound quality--it lives up to everything the other reviews say. I purchased this as much for sleeping (I travel a lot, so I use earbuds/IE earphones as earplugs on planes and in hostels), and find that wearing these for more than two hours just isn't very comfortable, and I can't really recommend them for this purpose."
197,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent range of sound (particularly in the bass frequencies) and I can hear absolutely nothing else outside once the music stars playing. Great for working out in a gym if you wish to drown out the crap they might be playing there with your selection of music.
198,2.0 out of 5 stars,"For what I paid for them I expected a much fuller sound. These sound tinny. I think you must have a music player that has a built in equalizer to get them to a more fuller, rich sound."
199,5.0 out of 5 stars,very good quality
200,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these buds for my wife. She is by no means an audiophile but even she can appreciate the quality that Shure provides. Her favorite thing about these buds is the sounds isolation provided by the various tips.
201,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these when I play drums live. After two months of use, the right side started to give disconnect sound when I move sometimes. Not a big deal yet , but it's not as sturdy as I thought. And I keep it/use it very carefully, and don't even move that much."
202,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Those are some sweet headphones. Wore them almost 12 hours straight on my flight from Las Vegas to Frankfurt. They fit perfectly. And you hear almost nothing of your surroundings anymore.
Changing the actual ear pieces seems a bit tricky though.
They meet all my expectations though!!"
203,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is good. But you have to pick the flexible bud that fits your ear to get the best effect. The bass is good as the highs. The complaints I read about adapting the buds around the ear is not as bad as mentioned. I fly a lot and have to place them on my ears often. After the third adjustment I know exactly how to use them without difficulty. Its really simple. The cord is a little long but better long than short. I like the cord. Of five different buds I own these are the best.
204,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these to replace an earlier model of Shure Earphones (that are discontinued). I am pleased with them. Like I mentioned I got them to replace a pair of Shure earphones that I lost, I think that they sound great and are comfortable to wear. My wife also has a pair."
205,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones. Good sound and a good fit.
Takes a little getting use to placing them in the ear.
The cord is heavy duty and a little unconfortable to wear.
Love the Clear look they do not fall off when exercising."
206,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, perfect fit and fits flat against my ear. I have used them for 100's or hours biking as they cut wind noise and replace it with tunes. Would buy again if I lost them."
207,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215-K are really good and strong earbuds. I had the Sony MDR-XB90EX and I broke them accidently as I snapped the connector when my lamp fell and took my phone which was charging with the cable. From Japan so no warranty. The Sony's are very strong and were my ""beater buds"" (durable headphones for everyday use). I looked for another durable set and the RHA MA750i, T20i and Shure SE215 were on my list. I bought it cause of the detachable cable. Better audio than that of the vSonic VSD5 I had previously. The Shure has wide soundstage, low bass can be heard and not too overpowering, it felt like a huge jump in audio quality and performance from the Sony ""Bass XB90EZ"". The cable has problems and that's why I've given it 3/5 stars. Look at the previous comment on June 8 by H. Yasli, I'm experiencing the same issue, the audio breaks on either the left and right on occasions when moving and you have to tilt or move your head to get audio fixed. Would have given it a 5/5 for the price point. Sometimes, it's fine and works with no breaking in audio, but then a small head movement and the audio breaks. Luckily, it's a detachable cable so I'm going to order a new detachable cable which is not from Shure with an inline remote control for iOS (pause, play, volume controls) and it's a great decision I didn't buy the ios version of the Shure SE215 model with their inline remote for extra $50,"
208,5.0 out of 5 stars,Looking for high quality sound isolating earphones? Want to save some cash? This is the route to go. Top quality from shure and you save some cash with amazon.
209,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound ..great stereo separation .. good bass high treble...cant do better for 100$$
210,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are, quite simply, an outstanding pair of earbuds and a tremendous value.

The key to getting great sound from them is inserting them correctly -- READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! You can easily insert them incorrectly; if you do, they WILL sound bad. I think that many (most?) of the negative reviews must have been written by buyers who weren't using them correctly. The biggest difference between the SE215 and, say, the SE200 (which I previously owned) is the quality of the seal and sound isolation. The SE200 fits like a pair of earplugs (the kind you'd wear to sleep); the SE215 fits like a pair hearing aids, held securely in the ear canal AND in contour of your ears. With the cables looped over your ears, there is absolutely no reason why these should fall out.

What really matters is sound quality and in this area, the Shure 215 shines. Bass is full without being overpowering, mids & highs are clear & crisp. I literally heard qualities in my music that I never heard before. I recommended them to a musician friend who was initially skeptical that they could be as good as I claimed. We rarely talk on the phone but he called me just to tell me how stoked he was about these earbuds."
211,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sure, I've changed the cable a couple of times, but I use these things on an almost daily basis. I used them in my commute, for running, at work for music and to video conference (I bought a cable with a mic a while ago), and with my PS4. These things are solid!"
212,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The shure are an ok earphones, first the cable is freaking long almost looks like u can use it as a jumprope, second putting the earpiece at first it looks annoying get ready to spend like 5 minutes trying to figured it out how to wear it and last the Earbuds hard to change and uncomfortable to use."
213,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphone's plastic body really hurts my outer ears after about 60 minutes of use. I tried using the different ear tips in the hopes of changing the geometry/fit against my outer ears, but it didn't help."
214,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Greatest in-ear phones I have ever owned. Couldn't say enough about the fit and quality in design, materials, and construction."
215,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love my earphones! Only complaint is that the included earbuds are crap. If you get these then also purchase a separate set of Shure sleeves made specifically for this model.
216,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These isolate the s*** out of sound, I can barely hear anything when they're in. And the sound quality is just preposterously good. The cord is super duper long too so they're great for the gym. Biggest complaint is that they just look nerdy as s***."
217,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is excellent, and the sound isolation is awesome. even without the foam tips, just using the normal silicone tips isolated enough noise that I would feel comfortable drumming with. Great!"
218,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These feel like high quality and extremely durable headphones. I usually only use buds, but these mold to the ear comfortably. The sound quality is excellent. My one complaint is, I wish they were a bit louder. Headphones usually only last me about a month so we will have to see how these hold up and if the extra price was worth it. Updates to come."
219,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this headphones to use as In Ear Personal Monitoring System at the church. I play drums and the noise canceling is great, the sound is flat (sometimes too flat for my taste but is not a bad thing) but has great preasure. It takes some time to know how to fit them properly in your ears, but once you learn you understand why they are constructed that way. They realy worth every cent. It's shure, no more words needed."
220,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is great, the fit is a little hard to get used to but I am trying different ear plugs to see if I an get a comfortable fit."
221,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Items just as described, shipping was nice and fast as well!! They can get some getting use to, but once you find the best fit they are worlds ahead of the competition out there."
222,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them. It does take a little while to break them in. But he sound is amazing.
223,5.0 out of 5 stars,super great
224,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have invested nearly $4000 in ear buds over the last 10 years from companies such as Klipsch, UE, Shure, and others. I use these units all day at work as well as at night to fall asleep and I love them. They fit my ears well with the foam inserts, and all of the hardware holds up fairly well."
225,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've paid more for earbuds that have not performed as well as these Shure earbuds. The earbuds are comfortable once the proper fit is established with the various sizes supplied. Quality of the cables and the buds are heavy duty and durable.

Have already used the buds for air travel on some longer flights noting exceptional cancelling of outside noise and excellent comfort."
226,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these earbuds. They do an amazing job of isolating and cutting out the background noise. I also like that they fit comfortably and stay put when I run.
227,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Build and finish is great. Sound isolation is the best I've experienced. I couldn't even hear people talking around me. Bass is good and overall its a great listening experience. The only things I don't like is that they don't feel very comfortable, although I wonder if this is something that will mitigate over time. Also, they are a pain to put on properly. Other than that though, no complaints. I suggest that if you get a chance, you should try them on first and judge the fit and comfort for yourself before buying them."
228,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headset but wears on ears is a bit weird. Fit almost like a hearing aid. sound is amazing. Once get used to the fit, they will be the favorite pair. Well worth the 100 bucks"
229,5.0 out of 5 stars,I originally bought the Dr. Dre Powerbeats and returned them immediately. After reading several reviews I decided to buy the Shure SE215. I just used them for a 75 minute session on the stationary bike. I could not hear any noise at all from any of the pieces of equipment min use around me so the noise isolation is outstanding. Being an audiophile I found the the sound very well balanced with very good bass extension. They were not affected by moisture at all and stayed firmly in my ears for the entire session. I extremely impressed.
230,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Strong solid cable. Great for in a gym due to being more durable than normal ear buds. Excellent sound and very comfortable. The piece that goes around your ear can actually be bent to whatever shape you need it, then it holds it shape so they stay on snug. Plenty of foam and rubber ear pieces came with it. Overall a good buy."
231,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, but too difficult to place in the ear, which is critical to the sound quality, especially the low end. I found myself having
to use a mirror just to see how to insert the buds properly, and the cable is a bit too cumbersome around the ears."
232,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good fit and very comfortable for long wear. The sound quality is neutral and compared to my earphones that came with my Galaxy note of years ago is noticeable on another level.
233,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I find it ironic that the first ear buds by Shure to have replaceable wires also have the most reinforced wires. These sound great to me, and you can get all of the technical details from the other reviewers.

I have owned the E2Cs and SE210s, and these are my favorites out of the batch."
234,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I made a decision to purchase these Shure SE215 headphones based on all the positive reviews here.

The issues I have experienced are:

I can't get a proper fit with the foam buds - I can get them on in such a manner that the sound is good, but if I turn my head one, or both may fall out.

Sound quality, especially bass,is very diminished if not worn perfectly.

Sound quality - These are definitely studio monitor headphones. Different audio sources and recordings sound as perfect or imperfect as they were engineered. Not a bad thing, but I'd rather just enjoy the music and not think, wow that sound guy must have been half deaf when he mixed that.

Bass - I found the opposite of some reviewers. I thought bass was a little light, even slightly de-emphasized.

I spent half my flight the other day fiddling around with these buds. People behind me probably thought I had lice or something.

I much prefer the overall sound and ease of use of my $8 Sony EX10 buds than these. Just ordered another pair."
235,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simply to explain; Perfect.
amazing bass and sound details,
its name is correct; really a live sound monitor.
It will satisfy all your expectation from a headphone below 200$.
good sound isolation
very good material quality and details.
but I suggested you to listen music with it when you are not jogging / running."
236,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these 2 months ago and they have already broken

i was satisfied with the quality and comfort, but unfortunately, one earbud is already broken.

Is there any recourse or warranty for these when purchased from Amazon?"
237,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best.
Tried. 8 different buds sent them all back.
These things are fantastic.
Sound is amazing."
238,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These have plenty of volume and the sound is much better than previous earbuds I have used. Of course this comparison is of earbuds in the $20 range. If your not an audiophile, don't spend the extra money. They will need to last a long time for me to consider them a good value."
239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these earphones for about a year now and can say that they will last a very long time if you use the included carrying case (which is nice). The sound isolation on these are very good, and the sound is very clear. However, if you are used to and love bass heavy headphones I would not recommend these as they do not produce the lower frequencies with as much power."
240,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Interesting. Initial response: never had in ear monitors before, getting used to putting them in your ears is kind of tricky, only have done it 3 or 4 times so far, and I always end up getting them backwards or something. BUt they feel good and feel like they will stick in your ears and not pull out like some ear buds. i could see jogging in these. Little disappointed in the cord length..feels like 3'...i thought they were a little longer. but then I could see people complaining about long cords too. Its a decent size, i just like the length of recording headphones - so you can move around. i use them at work so would be nice to plug in the computer and be able to walk around a little. But nice length if have a device on your person. They sound great. been listening to daft punk - decent bass - wasn't looking for a super bass earbud, sounds kind of gimmicky (beatz!!!!) i like true sound - and monitors i suppose help achieve this? In ear monitors may be the ticket! my ears feel cool! not the case with my studio AKG's at home. They tend to get a litle warm. Got to get used to the style - over the ear thing and people might look at you weird, but they feel good, sound great. I like them. Wasn't sure what to buy and for the price, meh. Wanted the other cord with mic and volume control for android, but saw poor reviews. and i don't know if i'd use the mic/volume as much as I think i would. but would be a nice option. I like these because the cord can disconnect from the phones. always a good feature if something happened to the cord or vice versa.

Cons: connie (the name)"
241,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow... it is a excellent in-ear earphone with respect to the price. Sound quality is very high. Specially BASS and TREBLES are great!

Another thing, the background noise sounds are almost blocked by the earphone body! It is great look and the connection code is very long! The only problem is There is no Volume Control with this. It should be additionally purchase.

I have already written a book about the ""Everything About Earphones"" and I studied almost 100 earphones for that with various brands the cost below US $ 300 earphones. This is one of the best earphone that I studied so far, others are BOSE QC 20i, Yamaha EPH100, ... .

Anyway I strongly recommended this to others!

I am planning to buy a High End Shure Earphone (That is Either Shure SE - 535 or Shure SE - 846), because It has a 3 or 4 drivers with balanced armature technique! The price of Shure SE - 535 is not so bad, but Shure SE - 846 is very very expensive than 3 drivers one!"
242,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first purchased these headphones the left side blew out within a couple weeks but I was able to exchange them for a new pair. I should've asked for a refund. The new pair lasted just long enough that the return window would expire and leave me stuck with a useless pair of 100 dollar headphones. The sound quality and noise cancellation is great when it works but don't waste your time. If you're going to spend a little more on headphones, invest in something that'll last. Don't make the same mistake as me."
243,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Through a couple of Apple iPhones, a Samsung Android phone, an iPad and Nexus 7 tablet I've kept searching for the perfect in-ear monitors with an integrated microphone. The earbuds shipped with the devices fell out of my ears in seconds. And the inexpensive replacements I tried sounded so bad I dropped them in the garbage.

I finally got a pair of V-Moda's to fit and sound decent. But the microphone was just okay for phone calls. Then, after a while, one side started losing low end. A couple of weeks later the volume of that side was about half of the good side.

I tried the Bowers & Wilkins C5's and they sounded pretty good but they never were comfortable for an extended time. The worst thing was they kept turning the volume down on my Android phone at random times. Every now and then some head movement would trigger the mute button. I couldn't just relax and enjoy the music.

Then I realized that I'd made a classic mistake. I'd tried to get a tool to do more than one job well and was disappointed when it did not happen.

I'm a media producer with over 35 years experience in audio and video production. I use headphones and in-ear systems for monitoring audio during video production, checking mixes in post-production, monitoring audio during online calls, and listening for pleasure on weekends.

I dropped the idea of using my in-ear monitors for anything other than listening. I kept reading about the Shure SE215's and decided to give them a try.

Out of the box they had a pleasing, balanced sound. In fact, they sounded better brand new than some units I'd burned in for hours. And they not only fit my ears, they stayed where I put them.

They become almost invisible after a couple of minutes. I'm talking about the audio field disappearing as well as the physical fit. The music just happens and it's so silky smooth it makes me smile.

Yes, you will need to try different sleeves to find what fits you. And the sleeves are difficult to remove at first.

Yes, you might want to find a youtube video showing you how to put them on correctly. It makes a huge difference when they are seated properly with the cables over your ears.

Yes, they block almost all the sound in the room. That's what they are designed to do. That's why musicians on stage like to wear them. I need that, too, when I use them in a production environment.

Just make sure you get the left and right monitors in the correct ears. I switched them once by accident and couldn't believe how much difference it made when I had them on the correct sides.

If you're like me and want a pair of comfortable, affordable, accurate in-ear monitors that just sound great then I highly recommend the SE215's. I paid $99 for them here on Amazon and they are one of the best audio purchases I've made in a long time."
244,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Shure headphone fan for a long time. I love the quality, sound, range, etc.
But the world is moving on and my iPhone lost its headphone plug...the adaptor is a pain, depression that I could not easily use my beloved Shure SE 525's set in...BANG!! Shure delivered the best adaptor out there, simply detach the earphone from the original cord, plug in the BT-1 cable in, connect via Bluetooth and WHAM!! you have a wireless SHURE EARPHONE...great product design.
Shure, thank you for providing a pathway to wireless, once again you have made me a customer for life."
245,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphone are pretty good. Some pros and cons. First off, the wire is really long. For some people this could be a plus or a minus. The wire is incredibly durable and I like the protection at the end of the plug. Its is a little big and bulky, but it still fits into my otter box defender series case for iPhone 6. Next, the ear buds. They seem really durable as well. They fit into my ears perfectly. They took maybe a day for me to get used to putting them into my ears. They are flush with the ear so you can lay on your side and still be perfectly comfortable. After a few seconds of having these in my ears, I barley notice that they are there. I love the memory phone ear tips. They are amazing at canceling out outside noise. I can't hear anything when they are in. The sound is relatively good. They sound no better than my stock apple headphones that came with my iPhone. I was expecting better sound quality from $99 headphones. All that being said, I am still very happy with my purchase and would recommend to a friend."
246,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these headphones for about 3 months now. I purchased them to use while I lift at the gym aboard my ship. These appealed to me because of the over-the-ear design to keep them from slipping out of my ears like my previous headphones, and because of the noise isolation. The gym on my ship also houses the A/C compressors for the accommodation which are incredibly loud.

Pros:

These headphones have excellent isolation and feel pretty comfortable when you find the right size foam for your ear. I have slightly different ear canal sizes so I had to use two different ones.

The sound quality is pretty decent although, as some have noted, it may be a little bass heavy for some. Messing with the equalizer on your media player should help that.

Cons:

The cord is very thick and heavy which I thought would be a good thing but ended up making them a little cumbersome. Along with the thickness, the cord is also about 8 inches longer than any other headphone cord I have dealt with which makes keeping the cord from getting caught on things is difficult.

As many other have experienced, one side of the detachable cord went out and only works when the cable is manually held in a certain position. It is probably pretty easy to see how this can be a problem. This happened after the second week of light, one hour a day use. Because I work on a ship, I didn't really have a chance to return them before my Amazon return period ended so now I am forced to go through the warranty return process. I have heard some bad things about Shure's customer service.

Conclusion:

Overall, if it was not for the failure of the cord and having to go through the warranty process to get it fixed, I would recommend these headphones. However, since so many people have encountered this problem (some more than once), I would say to look elsewhere for some headphones. I am fully expecting to have to do a warranty return on these multiple times and really wish I could have returned them during the warranty period.

Update: I contacted Shure after my headphones failed and they sent me another pair that have been working for the last two years. These ones don't seem to suffer from the same problem so I have updated my star rating."
247,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure is an trusted audio company that produces fantastic products, and offers a 2 year limited warranty on their in-ears. The SE215's are a great option for the $100 price point. Since they block out so much noise, they are great for commuting, working in noisy areas, or for on-stage performance.

PROS
- Great sound. Can't stress that enough.
- Great noise isolation. Comes with 3 foam and 3 rubber earbuds (in S, M, and L sizes of each type). These earbuds block out up to 37 decibels of sound, with the foam being more effective. Because they isolate so well, I do not (and would not recommend) wearing these while exercising or in any circumstance where you need to hear what is going on around you.
- Solid cable construction. The cable is sturdier near the ear (so it doesn't break from wrapping the wire behind the ear). The cable is also detachable at the earpiece so you can replace a cable/earpiece cheaper.
- They stay once you get them on. I have had trouble with in-ear headphones staying in my ear for long periods of time, but these fit well and stay put. Wrapping the cord behind your ear helps a lot with this.

CONS
- Changing the earbuds. I had a lot of trouble getting the Medium foam earbuds off initially. I would recommend using you fingernail to slowly and carefully slide off the earpiece. Removing the foam earbuds is more difficult than the rubber ones.
- Achy ear canals. After wearing the buds for an hour or so my ear begins to ache a bit. They fit snugly in the ear, which is what blocks out so much of the noise around you. A bit of aching is a price I am willing to pay though.

FINAL THOUGHTS
These in-ear earbuds are the best I have ever used. I ended up changing to the rubber small earpieces and love the fit. Some people recommend a burn-in period of 20+ hours before these work to their true potential, but I have not noticed any difference after many hours of listening."
248,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have another pair of shure headphones thats more than six years old and also happen to cost more than double what i paid for the 215, i was worried these would be noticably inferior to my other Shures, i have to be honest i'm very impressed, the bass is amazing, your not going to beleive me till you actually try these on, most people see these tiny headphones and automatically assume theres probably no bass

I had custom ear peices made from a third party, i recommend anyone who uses these during workouts to do the same, i tend to sweat a lot during workouts and the original ear peices always fall out

i actually look forward to going to the gym just so i can put these on,

Btw i bought the clear ones, they look awesome :-)"
249,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Performs nearly as well as my Sony MDR-7506 headphones. Keep in mind, those are made for professional studio monitoring. They never leave my desk. These, on the other hand are just perfect for travel, running, working out or anything else. The bass comes in clear as day, exactly what I wanted. The sound is warm and creamy and I get no distortion when I run them through my DAC or phone. I was skeptical about how they fit into my ear at first. When they came and I tried them on for the first time, my worries quickly went away. You forget that you're even wearing earbuds because they just make them float in your ears. This style allows you to lay on a pillow comfortably and watch Netflix on your phone into the wee hours of the morning. Before, I couldn't leave home with my Sony's or my Grado Labs SR80e's, due to the size and the Grado headphones being open-back. These have almost no leakage according to my brother who sits right next to me while using the computer. They do not fall out of your ears, which is a blessing. If any sound is coming out of them, they isolate everything perfectly (I have yet to take them on an airplane, so maybe they don't block everything, we will see). The releasable cable is a fantastic addition to these beauties. Although the cable is extremely tough, eventually every pair of earbuds I have owned in the past have had their fair share of wear and tear. If these ever suffer a break or tear, Replacing them should be effortless and inexpensive!

Overall, they are by far the best earbuds I have put in my ears, and I am picky when it comes to my sound. My family members swear by BOSE, and I just laugh when I put their headphones in. The sound quality on these is infinitely better and look way cooler! I might even take these in to see if I can get a custom mold one day, we'll see!"

256,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just began using these and purchased them chiefly because I wanted to use them in my motorcycle helmet. They fit closer to my head than either the MEE or the HF5 earbuds I own.
I purchased the MEE for this reason, but they are not as closely fitting to my head as I had hoped. So, I took a chance on the 215s and am glad I did. These are recessed a bit from the outer edge of my ear, the best I could hope for.
I was very pleased with the sound of these buds. They sound better than the other two above and I can't quite describe why: they seem to be amplified? I tried all three at the same volume on my iphone 5s and these were louder, but also fuller sounding.
If I knew what I do now, I would only have purchased these buds.
I have owned the HF5s for several years, I am actually on my second set which has lasted for 4 years or so. They are constructed with thinner, tackier wires that do not detach. I paid around $100 for them.
The MEEs cost $179 and are constructed very sturdily with detachable wires...but the buds are heavy and they protrude too far, but they do fit in my motorcycle helmet better than the HF5s. They do not sound as pleasing to me as the 215s.
If these 215s hold up under normal usage as well as the HF5s, and from appearances I would guess that they should do better, then I will be pleased with this purchase.
3-17-18: I have had some difficulty putting the ear buds in my ears. They are not as easy as the MEE ear buds, U think it is because of the reinforced wire near the buds."
257,5.0 out of 5 stars,The product arived right on time before the weekend. I enjoy the headphone a great deal. The sound is clear and natural but not imposing. Need a little get-use-to to put them on. The are more comfortable than the pair I owned for 5 years until recently. A little bigger than the old pairs (the 3-level). Sound isolation works as expected. A lot less wire noise than my old pair. The low is not as significant as expected and described by other users. After all it is a 2-level.

263,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've owned these for about 2 months now and I have to say they are fantastic. The bass is low and fat but round it's not wobbly sounding.

267,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Anytime I purchase anything, I find I peruse Amazon for its customer reviews, and decided to finally post, and hopefully this will help someone in a similar situation find what they are looking for.

That being said, I was looking for a quality set of in-ear buds that would be: immersive in its sound range, fun with a significant amount of bass, and durable in its build quality. Iphone functionality would be a big plus as well. My budget was around $100-125.

I purchased the Sennheiser CX series earbuds, which were obnoxiously bright and yellow. I got a great deal from a friend, so decided to try them. I also purchased the Shure S115i, and the Klipsch S4i, with the full intentions of settling on one and returning the rest to Apple. The Sennheisers were pretty mediocre all around, and I use them when I know I'll be beating them up on a long run. I loved the warm tones of the 115s, but they lacked the oomph in the low end I was really looking for. The S4i I have to say, was the most fun out of all three. The bass is killer, and I actually find the oval tips rather comfortable. However, the build quality is absolutely shocking, and ended up being a dealbreaker for me. I returned all of them and decided I'd continue my search. I stumbled across the 215s on here and decided to check them out after seeing so many positive reviews.

The build is fantastic. The cable isn't kevlar, but seems to be a thick rubber, and is fully replaceable. I love the design of the buds, and after a little molding of the behind-ear cabling, it fits and feels great. I truly love the foam tips, and the flat design is easy to lay on if you are in bed listening to them.

Sound quality is what I expected, and was pleasantly surprised with the bass response. Mids and highs come in crisp and clean, and the bass kicks without being boomy. You are not going to get the earth-rattling bass of the S4 but it definitely holds its own, and is very defined and tight. My collection of music ranges from bass-heavy dubstep to acoustic rock, and it plays every track clean and accurately. I almost wish it had just a touch more kick-in-the-pants bass boom to it, but I wouldnt sacrifice the clean and tightness that you get here for it.

All in all though, I stand behind this as my favorite of the bunch. I don't have the sophisticated ears of an audiophile, but I enjoy losing myself in every subtle note when I listen to music. I really found what I was looking for in these, and recommend them for anyone looking for Shure quality and build with the added bass thats missing from the 115s."
268,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my first pair of Shure earbuds over 5 years ago. I use them for listening to music in the gym and while studying. They've consistently delivered excellent sound quality and durability, When I began to think about going wireless in the gym, I was thrilled to learn that I could buy a detachable BT cable rather than buying an entirely new set of earbuds. The cable arrived in good condition and worked wonderfully for the first few weeks of use. My only complaint would be the bulky control module that bounced against my chest while running, even with the battery pack clipped to my clothing. While I wasn't using the earbuds and BT cable, I stored them in a carrying case in my gym bag, as I had with the wired version. Upon bringing them inside from near-freezing temperatures, the cable stopped working completely. No LED indicator, voice prompts, or music at all. I initially blamed myself for storing them inappropriately, but after reading other reviews, it seems that the cable won't even stand up to sweat from regular gym use. I would expect that a product marketed for use in the gym/running would be able to withstand temperature and moisture challenges. I had high hopes given Shure's usually excellent products, but unfortunately I will be looking elsewhere for BT earbuds."
269,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones have amazing quality of sound for what they are. They lack a bit in the bass range of course, but all the sounds they produce are clear and crisp.

279,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After researching forever I went with Shure. The Bose I had heard and not to impressed with, so I thought I would try these. The lows, mids and highs were great for my listening habits. Also being able to remove the cables and replace them are great. Try them. They are great."
280,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of SHURE. Like the first one, the right ear piece is not working very well now. Didn’t purchase any warranty when buying this pair. Don’t know if I can get it fixed?"
281,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these earphones for almost 2 years now and hardly a day goes by where I don't use them. I've used them everywhere: on the plane, on the bus, in the car, on the subway, while walking to classes, and so on. The sound isolation on these earphones is excellent and ensures they can be used in pretty much any setting. Cable noise (microphonics) also isn't an issue.

I'm not going to comment on the sound signature because 1) I find from my ventures on head-fi that it just leads to increasingly pretentious and empty-sounding adjectives (cold, analytical, warm, fun, juicy...), 2) I use these IEMs frequently in noisy environments (which is the whole point of getting an IEM right? if I didn't need the isolation i'd just walk around with my headphones) and 3) I believe that it's the job of the artist, not the headphone, to make the music sound good (I listen to classical music). For me the ideal earphone would be an exact replicate of what one hears in real life (I think audiophiles would call this ""neutral""). What I will say is that I also own a pair of Shure SRH840 full-size headphones, and that music from my headphones and IEMs sound pretty much the same except of course with a smaller soundstage on the IEMs. In other words, I've never had any complaints about the sound quality of these earphones, and I think they offer at least excellent value, maybe even the best, for their price.

My one complaint is that after owning these earphones for about 2 years, sometimes the music doesn't come out properly from the left earbud and one has to give the cable a twist or two to get it to work. I've owned my Shure SRH840 headphones for 3 years and they have a similar problem, the music doesn't come out properly focused sometimes and one has to adjust the plug until it does. So I think this might be a cable problem with Shure products in general and I'd be curious to know if others have had this problem.

In short these earphones offer excellent sound quality and isolation, but after a few years you may find that they don't work as perfectly as hoped, which is a little disappointing considering they do cost a nontrivial amount of money. If I were to buy a new pair of IEMs today, I'd take a really good look around and see if I can't do better than the Shure SE215, but even if you can't, it's not the end of the world by any means."

The convenience and simplicity of Westone cables is the best I have ever used but the overall sound quality and extremely reasonable cost of the Sure SE215 earphones have already become my absolute favorites.
These definitely take a bit of cable manipulation to optimize comfort per individual but the overall sound is terrific. The mids and highs are sharp and bass not sacrificed. I actually think Westone has not adequately adressed the mid/highs which is important to me.

300,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I listen to mostly rock, metal, blues etc and these are perfect. Once I found the right nubs that fit my ear"
301,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these to replace my dual driver Ultimate Ears which broke and these are not nearly as good. They are pretty good for the price, but I would save up for a dual or triple driver earbuds."
302,4.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones have amazing sound. Much better than the $300 Bose earphones. The one design issue is that they have an abnormal design where the wire goes over your ear and around the back. This is via a more rigid conforming wire and can be preferred by some and not by others.
303,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned these for about a month now. I use them daily at work, and I have to say, I LOVE them. The sound quality is amazing. Like others have said, I hear things in my music now that I did not before. Of course, I was coming from the cheap Samsung ear buds that game with my Galaxy S III, but I don't think this invalidates my point.

As far as fit, once you get the hang of putting them in (there is a learning curve if you're coming from standard buds), you can pop them in and out with no problem and when they're in, they're IN. They don't move around at all and the rigid part of the cord helps as it serves as an ear hook of sorts.

I do have to agree with the previous reviewer on my ears getting tired out. Because these block out a lot of ambient noise (they might as well be noise-cancelling - people have had ""conversations"" with me that I have not heard while listening through these), your ears do get tired out after a while. I LOVE music and I LOVE listening to it for hours on end; but I definitely do feel some level of relief when I pull them out of my ears after long listening sessions. They have been great for my needs though - they block out most, if not all of the noise around me (namely, my co-workers' conversations) so that I can focus on my work.

I'm also a musician, and I'm hoping to get to try these out in a live sound application at some point; I just haven't played anywhere that has an in-ear monitor system.

So here's the breakdown:

PROS:

Clear, balanced sound
Build Quality
Nice zippered case with a big ""Shure"" label so people know you mean business when it comes to your music listening.

CONS:
Learning curve with learning how to put them in (It's a short one).
Tired ears after extended use.

I'd ABSOLUTELY buy these again, but I guess time will tell how they hold up."
304,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first product I've felt the need to write a review about so here goes:

I have a lot of headphones..
Panasonic in ear
Beats by dre in ear
The new Polk nue voe in ears(consumers choice)
Monster Jamz in ear
AKG over ear semi open
Klipshe over ear closed

And these.

The Shure SE215s are my favorite by far. They aren't the easiest to put on. They aren't the most convenient either. What they offer is pure performance. Sex for the ears. The first time I got these to fit and turned them up, I got almost teary-eyed. Chills. I clearly had been missing something.

$100. They out perform all 6 of my other headphones. All of which are valued above $100. Extremely impressive noise canceling. You've probably read other reviews say the same. DONT buy these for riding your bike/motorcycle etc on public roads. You will not hear anything but music. I'm not sure if you'd even hear a car horn to be honest. So take it on the plane, to the gym, at home, at work or wherever else you don't need to hear anything else.
The clarity is outstanding. Precise highs and rich, accurate lows. Mids aren't the best of my bunch, but I'd say they're pretty good overall. The cord i believe is made of Kevlar. It doesn't behave like other cords you've had. That coupled with the 'around the ear' design keep it from getting in the way at the gym or flailing around while running. It will also never tangle. Never. It's not so great because you can't crumple them up into a ball like I know some of you do when you put them away. I've lost a few headphones to the cord breaking, so I know why they reinforced these so much. I welcome their heavy dutiness, but that's not to say you'll find them as convenient. I don't know why there's no volume control. It doesn't bother me too much, because I have to take them off to talk to someone anyways.(again, you won't hear much with them on). The overall max volume of these are on the good side compared to other $200 sets. I've heard a tiny bit of over modulation but only at max volume which I never need to use. I've also noticed the sound can cut out if the jack isn't seated properly. This is rare, but annoying.

Overall, well, I've told friends that this is my favorite worldly possession. I guess that should tell you something too. $100 is a steal for this kind of audio."
305,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy, stays in place, sounds great, sound isolation is amazing. Buying a pair for my lady. ok update mine went out after a couple of weeks. rt side kept cutting out, think its a short in the wire. very irritating. time to see what sue service is like"
306,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the second set that I have owned. The last set lasted at least three years but finally needed to be retired. The sound quality is unbelievable on these and the noise cancellation is more than adequate to filter out most of the background and let you enjoy quality sound at a much lower volume. Definitely recommend these.
307,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To all the drummers...If you're looking for an inexpensive way to have in ear monitors for purposes of playing to a click (and also for vocal monitoring purposes) these buds are great. When inserted correctly, Isolation is comparable to the roll up foam 32db ear plugs I have been using live for many years to protect my hearing in a VERY LOUD stage volume band. These buds have excellent isolation and make playing to a click live very easy."
308,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not really impressed, just not of low end. Right side is now hardly audible any more."
309,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank You
310,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been searching and searching and searching for a headphone that will NOT fall out when I'm running and sweating. I have had this headphone for about one year and a few months and they no longer stay in my ears. When I first got them, they seemed to work at staying in, but now the wire that goes over the top of the ear is worn out and I'm constantly fidgeting with them to keep them in my ears even after changing the buds. I cannot even use them for just sitting around. Great sound if you are NOT using them for serious exercise where you will sweat a lot. The cord is also heavy and awkward to put on. Overall these are NOT worth the $100 price tag for an exercising headphone that you will have to dispose of in one year. I am online now because I am AGAIN searching for new headphones that will STAY IN MY FREAKING EARS WHEN I RUN AND SWEAT!! ANY SUGGESTIONS?"
311,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband loves them....just disappointed in the late delivery as they were his birthday present!
312,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely weird wearing headphones that wrap around the ears- regardless they're really comfortable and the sound quality is great. $100 price tag isn't bad at all. I could see my self buying these for 170. They cancel noise pretty good, doesn't block my screaming roommate out tho."
313,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not really what i expected, for 100 dollars i expected quality sound. Unfortunately i only got mediocre sound. They are good with the noise cancellation but the sound did not even pass the sound of the apple earpods which are only about 30 bucks. So overall not worth it."
314,5.0 out of 5 stars,huh I cant hear you?
315,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for blocking noise without the noise canceling technology (which I got with the bose, but they made me nauseous and I returned them)"
316,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been playing professionally for about 10 years, and touring for 5 of those years. This is my 3rd set of professional in-ear monitors. I have previously owned a set of Customer molded LiveWires and Westone UM-2's with detachable molds. To be completely honest, the sound quality, clarity, fit, and finish of the Shure SE215's are AS GOOD, if not BETTER THAN both sets of custom buds I had in the past. I highly recommend these to any professional musician, or music enthusiast looking for a very reliable set of in-ears."
317,5.0 out of 5 stars,this is my second pair of these headphones. they are the best in-eat I've ever used. they have great sound isolation. I use them while running a chain saw and they are Great War protection. I also use them to work out and they stay in no matter what you are doing. very comfortable to wear.
318,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own several pairs of headphones for a variety of situations. These are my ""go to"" headphones when I want great isolation (i.e. when I fly or am in noisy environments). Full audio spectrum comes through clear and sounds wonderful."
319,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've had several Shure earbuds over the years. I have tried others but always come back. They don't fall out and they sound great!
320,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid earphones in this price range. Highs are very clear, however as someone who likes more bass, it's not amazing. The bass is definitely there, but it's not overpowering like I'm used to with my subwoofers at home, but I can't really expect too much bass from earphones in this price range. Also, the headphones are very comfortable, secure, and sturdy. Looks pretty cool too."
321,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sooo these are the ***ken best i have ever had. I work i n powder coating and I get to have my headphones in all the time next to a big roaring fan I can't hear a thing music is really loud. Would highly recommend them.
322,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this earphone. Isolation is very good and the sound is great. A good bonus is that the cable is quite sturdy compared to other in-ear headphones. I've been using it for over a years and the cable has no signs of tears.
323,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. Good quality for a basic set of In-Ears. Love that you can replace just the cable if needed.
324,4.0 out of 5 stars,"not bad. i use this for my se535ltd. not as good as powerbeats for sport. however, u don’t need spend addition money on bluetooth headphone if u already have shure"
325,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible sound isolation! The only thing is that I was listing to music when my house caught on fire and didn't know until my parents came running through my room. But great headphones otherwise!
326,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these because I have had several headphones fall apart after limited use. These ear buds are great. Built to last and the sound is great for me. I wear them while walking and traveling. The only small complaint is that the ear buds do expand into my ear and if I wear them for several hours at a time my ears start to get sore.
327,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality is amazing especially for the lows and bass. They are a little weird to put on and are not as comfortable as my cheaper pairs but they really do stay in
328,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do yourself a favor and buy some decent headphones. You deserve a pair of these. Buy them. If you've been using those cheap white headphones, you'll be amazed at what these IEM's give you."
329,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these when I'm riding my motorcycle; they sound very good, and they work really well for me."
330,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The ear hooks keep the buds in. The sound quality is much better than my Klipsch S4a. They are comfortable, even after long periods of wear. I really like their sound signature."
331,5.0 out of 5 stars,sound is great. I like the comfort and I'm excited to try them live on stage
332,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great device. Best sound on stage. Fits in ear correctly and tight.
333,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These were my first ""sound-isolating"" headphones, and I wish I had fully appreciated the meaning of that. They are, in essence, earplugs with a hole through which sound is piped. I found them awkward to put on due to their ""over-ear"" fit, uncomfortable to continue wearing, and bothersome to pop out when somebody wanted to talk to me. These are headphones to wear for the long haul -- a walk, a workout, or uninterrupted tasks.

I had no complaints about the sound quality, but coming from Bose IE headphones, the bass seemed quite light in comparison, and the sensation of sealing off my ears did not add to the experience.

Finally, after less than a week of usage, the left channel cut out -- but only when connected to my iPod. Apple products do seem to be pickier when it comes to connectivity and power chargers, but that's not much of an excuse. Other headphones work fine with the iPod, and the Shure headphones work with other devices.

I was disappointed with this product. The reviews were promising and they looked very cool, but they are not the answer for my needs. I've since purchased a pair of Bose IE2s and I am much, much happier."
334,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These Shure SE215-K are my first ""real"" headphones. I have been using skullcandy for a few years, and have been plagued with failures, they die within 6 months.
I decided to pay $100 for quality instead of $50 for junk. I am very pleased with the quality and comfort of these Shure 215's
I often travel on noisy airplanes, these are very effective in blocking out ambient noise, so you can enjoy your music. The way these block out background noise is also great in my workplace, however if you need to be aware of what's going on around you, these may block out too much noise.

These are comfortable, and appear to be reliable, time will tell how they hold up. I have had them for several weeks, and I am very pleased so far."
335,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to finally shell out for a proper set of earbuds for riding my motorcycle and these were the most often-recommended on forums for that purpose. Having used a bunch of cheap earbuds and fairing acceptably well with them, it was tough to get myself to pay for these but I was about to ride a week-long trip and wanted to finally do it right. The short version is that they are totally worth the money. I will use these for the foreseeable future and am glad I paid for them.

The sound really is vastly better than any pair of cheap earbuds. Wind noise inside a less-than-very-well-designed motorcycle helmet can be surprisingly irritating to the point of being fatiguing, so before figuring out how to get earbuds to stay in while donning a helmet I had always worn disposable foam ear plugs, and good, more-expensive ones at that. These do a much better job blocking that noise, as well as making it easier to hear the quieter parts of music at the same time without jacking up the volume until you do permanent damage to your hearing.

I picked up the recommended triple flange sleeves but haven't tried them yet. The included soft black rubber sleeves have done a good job of sealing noise out and sound in, this is important as the better the seal the better they sound, and less volume is needed to be content with the sound which is important for both your long term hearing and short term endurance. If they make your ears sore after a while, try a different set of sleeves, there's a good reason they come with a bunch of different sizes.

The cords are pretty smart. They are easy to remove from the buds themselves but I haven't had them pull out of the buds while donning my helmet. There's a short length of stiffer, bendable wire at the bud ends that curves around the top of your ears which makes it much, much easier to keep the buds in your ears while putting on a helmet, which was a huge learning curve for me with cheap earbuds, and caused no end of frustration both to me and riding buddies who had to wait for me to get it right every time we'd get moving after a helmet-off stop during a single outing.

You probably won't get your money's worth from these if you aren't skilled at using a graphic equalizer. I run Jet Audio Plus on my Android phone and even with the included equalizer I find that while listening at home, I can adjust it for each track and improve my satisfaction. This is not viable or necessary while riding, but if you don't tune your audio source at all, you're wasting money on these. They sound as good as a $100 set of big fat over-the-ear studio headphones and most smartphones really don't drive them right in factory configuration. Start with a standard parabolic curve and bring the lower third up another point or two each. If using Jet Audio, try, from left to right (6, 5, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3). Adjust each up or down while listening to one track and see what works for you."
336,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband loves them!! They are comfortable, the sound is amazing, and the do an excellent job of canceling out noise!!"
337,5.0 out of 5 stars,I found Shure ear buds several years ago and fell in love with them. I use them while running and they have held up great. After my first pair finally gave out due to physical activity I bought a second pair which I use for running as well. You can't go wrong with Shure!
338,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use it to listen to all types of metal and the sound quality is amazing.
339,4.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased these for my son per his request. He is pleased with them and uses them daily.
340,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I fully agree with SK. Although this headset has great sound and isolation it is not able to be fully realized because the plugs are painful to the concha of the ear. It's difficult to listen to an entire album in one sitting because of the acute pain inflicted by the earphones that are much too wide and too deep. The awkward, heavy, inflexible cables don't lay well over the outside earlobe either. I'm not so wild about sound quality that I will tolerate the poor fit of these headphones -- so I say back to the drawing board, Shure."
341,1.0 out of 5 stars,My $100 of pair Shure headphones broke in less than three months. The left earphone no loner works. I hope the company will replace them. I am pretty upset.
342,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wear my headphones way to much. I find them very comfortable often wearing them without playing music just to knock down some noise. Their sound is far better than any comparably priced and slightly more expensive buds I've had. Their quality blows the competition away. I've had mine for a year plus now.... Get yourself some Comply tips. Loved these headphones from day one.
343,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these! Feel very secure when placed properly. Really helps block outside sound. Was able to connect these to my Galaxy S7 with the case attached.
344,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a previous model and was throughly satisfied, it was advertised to reduce ambient nosie by 15 db. This model is rated at 35 db which I doubt; however, I just think that the selection of earpads they sent aren't compatible with my ears canal. I'm going to call Shure and ask them about my concern, I'm sure they will send an assortment of ear 'plugs' that will block about more noise and permit the unit to stay in my ears.

I did meet with CS and they showed me how to properly insert the plugs. This new model is just great. They agreed that the instructions on how to insert the plugs needs to be updated."
345,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If it's quality sound and noise isolation that you want, these are what you should buy."
346,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exactly what you’d expect from Shure. If you already own a par of Shure earbuds higher than the SE2xx series just buy the cable. If you don’t, pick these up instead. Best bang for your buck. Will they sound as good was Shure earbuds three or four times the price? No. But, they destroy everything else at or near this price point. I recommend these without reservation and have already have told friends and family to pick a pair up."
347,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not usually tend to purchase in ear headphones. however I thought I would give it a shot and it was well worth it. This product not only sounds amazing, but they fit great in my ears, (which is usually my problem with earphones) and they come with multiple different attachments to fit different sized ears. I like that the cord goes over the ear so that they stay snug in your ears. They shipped very promptly and I would recommend these to anyone who is a passionate music listener."
348,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've owned these for a year now and it beats the 15$ ones I used to get that kept breaking and sounded meh.
349,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these things. They really block out the sound even at a fairly low volume. I think the sound quality is very good, but you may have to EQ the things to your taste."
350,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for nearly seven months now. During this time they have been used nearly every day for several hours at a time. I use the medium foam tips and medium silicon tips mostly but have tried the large to see if the seal is better. With the large foam tips the seal was slightly better but they were too much pressure for my ears.
So while using the foam tips they provide such fantastic passive isolation that I couldn't hear anyone talk while wearing them even without anything playing. The silicon tips were slightly less isolating but still provide plenty for a pleasant experience. I use them while sleeping because of their extreme comfort. I can't believe how comfortable they are to sleep in. With their over-the-ear design and reinforced ear cable, they do not move. I move around a lot in my sleep and they have come out only a handful of times throughout my entire experience of using them. I really do love these. The sound is very nice has a fairly pronounced bass for the small drivers. Only thing I'd change is just better sound because the comfort is a 10/10 but the sound definitely falls in the 8/10 but still wonderful for the money. I've recommended these to multiple people and cannot recommend them enough to those who haven't paid more than 20 dollars on a pair of headphones before. They're moderately priced but definitely worth the investment."
351,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these earbuds a few months ago. If you don't share an audio obsession with me, let me just summarize this whole review and say that these are without a doubt worth every penny. These earbuds are fantastic. Inevitably they will unfortunately wear out,and when that happens I'll get another pair.
Build Quality:
These guys have about as thick of a cable as I've ever seen on earbuds. It's a braided Kevlar cable that feels kind of textured-rubbery like. The earbuds themselves are made of a transparent plastic that lets you see all of the inner workings and little wires and stuff inside. Cool! These fit into your ear and then the cable goes over the top of your ear using a flexible length of the cord you can shape to match the way your ear is shaped. Not like those other earbuds that just fit right in and the cord doesn't rest against anything,these rest against the top of your ear where your glasses ride. I wear glasses and I have no issue wearing these and my glasses together. If you sweat a lot and or like to run I advise you to be careful with moisture buildup. Since the inner workings of the little speakers and the outside world are not separated by anything water/sweat can build up inside the earbuds. This happened to me a few times and each time they were just fine.
After using these a lot while running I had some issues with the sound going out in the right ear. fortunately you can replace the cables, so I bought an extra pair. What's strange though is the next day when I tried them again the next day they worked just fine. Maybe it was water inside that caused them to not properly work for a while. I'm still using the original cable 3 months later. Pick yourself up a spare cable anyway just to be safe so you can repair them when the cable eventually breaks( It'll take a while!). These come with a big 90° plug. It's big and sturdy compared to lesser audio equipment. HEFTY!
Sound:
These sound wonderful. You can hear the cymbals crash over there and the bass over here. They're very balanced and sound great no matter what you pipe through them. They do a good job of blocking out outside sounds so be careful to be aware of your surroundings when you wear them. If you like really low rumbly bass that really isn't here. They sound good with bass heavy songs,and they do HAVE bass, but they don't rumble the way a ""basshead"" set of earbuds would. Bass isn't everything though,and these sound awesome. Don't let the lack of ear quaking bass stop you from jammin' with these.
Features & Extra Stuff:
These come with a nylon zipper pouch, an ear wax removal tool( really useful!,don't lose it!!) the earbuds themselves and some memory foam and silicone earbuds tips in 3 sizes of each material. The pouch is not water proof or crush proof, has an inside mesh compartment for perhaps a spare cable or the ear tips and the cleaning tool. It provides just enough room to coil the earphones up without having to potentially damage them by winding them too tight. The pouch is pocket sized and has a small carabiner on the outside.

Excellent sound, excellent build quality, a steal of a price at 100USD as of July 31st 2015.
5 Stars!"
352,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a guitarist for my church band and mainly use these as in ear monitors for when I am on stage. For this purpose and the price, these headphones are great. The music can get pretty loud when I'm on stage, but I'm always able to hear everything I need to hear because of the fantastic seal/noise isolation.

As headphones for musical enjoyment in a quiet room or while I study for extended periods of time (multiple hours), there are other headphones in the same price range that will sound much better and will be more comfortable. To clarify: these headphones are comfortable and stay in your ear fine, but can get very uncomfortable after wearing them straight for a couple hours.

In summary: I recommend these for onstage in-ear monitoring because of the great sound isolation and the great entry pricepoint for in ear monitors. I would not recommend for extended listening for multiple hours."
353,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Paired with my SE535 IEM's, the Shure RMCE-BT1 (henceforth ""BT1"") sounds as transparent, clear and correct as the 535's do with a cable connection. The unit arrived fully charged and instantly paired with my Apple iOS, WatchOS, and Mac devices.

Overall quality is as expected from Shure, with the wire-form ear section providing for a comfortable and completely secure solution and good-quality control feel.

The voice prompts are clear and professional sounding, and the Shure uniquely expresses battery life in available hours of use, which so far has proven slightly conservative- the unit is outperforming the predicted available time.

UPDATE: After 8 days daily use for 4-6 hours/day- every bit as favorable as the initial impression. Excellent connectivity, not one instance of a drop-out with an iPhone 7+ or iPad Air 2, averaging 7+ hours battery life driving my SE535's."
354,3.0 out of 5 stars,I sounds good but the plastic clip that connects it to you cloths broke within the week after I started using it. That clip is important because I'm always in fear of losing it. So now I use a metal office clip to attach it to my clothing. It is much stronger. I decided it was not worth calling and complaining about it. The product though gives the quality I was hoping for. I've only owned it a short time so I don't know if it will act like so many others that over time will
355,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these earphones for over a year, and I've just now had to replace the cables, for me that's great. Prior to my Shure SE215 headphones, I was going through headphones every 2 to 3 months. I'm a heavy headphone user and sleep with my earbuds in. I found the replacement cable for the earbuds on Amazon for 17 dollars, they are like new again. Love them!"
356,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm no audiophile, but even I can tell the difference between these and other ""less expensive"" ear buds. I was amazed at the sound quality out of the box and did my own listening test vs. several other pairs of ear buds that I have. First pair test vs. the Shure were relatively cheap $20 Skull Candy. No comparison. Second pair tested were Bose IE2. Closer to discern between the Bose and the Shure, but the SE215-K is clearer, crisper and rich deep tones. The last pair that I tested was the Samsung phones that come with a Galaxy S4 smart phone. Again, no comparison, Not even close.
The only downside was it was a bit difficult to change to try a different type of sleeves. It took a little time and patience to figure out, but ultimately not too bad if done carefully.
They fit great and feel great wearing them. I never tried the over the ear style before, but they are really comfortable and secure. I've only had them a couple of weeks, but they work well for every use I've used, from walking to riding my motorcycle and using them with my Sena SMH10 Bluetooth com system."
357,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earbuds on December 16th, 2016, so as of 10/13/2017 I have almost owned these for an entire year.

Wear and comfort: 9/10
Why the lost point? These can be SLIGHTLY uncomfortable to wear for over an hour. The bendable cable portion that runs just above the ear does not stay bent often floats slightly above the ear.

Cable quality: 9/10
The cable feels very solid, and has been holding up very well since purchase. The cable does bend a little, but it does not bend into sharp angles.
I reduced 1 point because the plastic casing that surrounds the bendable section directly above the ear has cracked slightly on the left side and is exposing the (presumably) steel cable reinforcement.

Packaging and Assortments: 10/10
The carrying case is well made, I have not seen any noticeable wearing. In one side of the case there is a small mesh partition to store the included accessories. Included is 3 different sizes of silicone tips and 3 different sizes of ""spongy"" tips reminiscent of ear plugs. (all in a plastic bag) and a wax pick with a wire and plastic nub tips.

Sound: 9/10
Since everyone and their cousin seems to be a bass head, I'll start there. Low end is decent, producing enough punch to notice and feel it deep in your brain but overall, it lacks the quality definition to notice subtle changes in low end pitch. One could say it sounds a little muddy. Bass drops out around 30Hz. The SE-215 really shines in the mid to high frequencies, my two favorites to listen to. Mids: Vibrant yet smooth. Well defined. Maybe a cloud shrouded but overall excellent. Highs: Also vibrant, and smooth. Sound insulation is a WOW, with the spongy tips producing the best all round frequency insulation, followed by the silicone tips which insulate well, but let higher frequencies such as keyboard typing and scratching wood through. The silicone tips sound the best for mids and highs, while the ""spongy"" tips absorb the higher frequencies easily producing a low end focused experience. Cable noise insulation is decent, but movement along clothing is noticeable but not experience ruining.

Overall, I have not regretted buying these."
358,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased the Shure SE215-K, in tandem with the westone UM pro10's, to do a comparison on these two companies entry level high end IEM (in ear monitors). Between the two i spent about 40 hours on these headphones and here are my initial thoughts:

1) i thought that the Shures were more consumer driven, as the low end is alot more accentuated as there is probably a bump in the 50-300 range.
this could be good for stage performers that need to hear that bass response in loud enviornment.

2) the Westones were a lot more flat in the frequency response, specifically in the low end, and as expected it was a lot more honest in the high end. There is a lot of accuracy with the Um10's. an application of these Specific IEMS would be more towards studio use and less towards live use.

3) Fit. The Westones had a much better system for fit. but this could be partially due to my person physiology, rather than actual design.

Overall, these are two really great headphones, and it really depends on the application in which you need some IEM's. The Westones are the more expensive between the two, being 50% more than the Shures. The sound quality between the two units is superb, but it recommendation between the two models depends on what you want to do with it."
359,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Shure 215s are the best earbuds I’ve ever owned. The RMCE-BT1 just made them even better! The sound quality is still excellent with only slightly noticeable drop in the low end. That said though these ear buds have never been known for their deep bass. The controls are easy to use and intuitive. Bluetooth set up was a breeze as well. I highly recommend the RMCE-BT1 and would buy them again in a second, even though they are greatly overpriced."
360,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife had a pair of Shure EC3s she purchased in 2006 for $135 and worked great until she left them in the plane on a flight home from Chicago last month. The SE215s are superior in sound qaulity and construction, and just as good in fit and comfort. The zip pouch does not have a spool inside like the EC3s but it works fine."
361,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic earbuds! Great sound quality and superior build quality. The ability to replace the cord is definitely a plus too. I'm not a huge fan of the wrap around design, but it does keep them from falling out."
362,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these earphones, good price, great sound level."
363,5.0 out of 5 stars,Have had these same earbuds for almost 2 years. Literally put these through the wash last week and they still work. Won't buy anything else ever again.

365,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am very pleased with this purchase thank you very much !!!
366,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice quality earphones. Blocks out most of the ambient sound without blasting my ears.
367,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure has an awesome reputation for high quality sound equipment, but they dropped the ball on this one. These earbuds sounded tinny. The highs were muddled as well as the mid and low ranges. I sent them back."
368,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound for a great price! These buds fit and perform with the best of them. My first pair of Shures eventually wore out after 5+ years and when it was time to replace them, I had no doubt I would stay with Shure."
369,3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't like the way they fit. Sounded pretty alright. Returning.
370,5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect!!
371,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Let's be clear on what we have with the Shure SE-215's: the in ear monitors are an excellent fit, with tips that should comform to almost any ear size. They are very comfortable to wear and seal well vs. outside noise. Yet the key factor in a headphone rating for me is the sound. While sound is a subjective rating, in my opinion this product is not much better than standard iPhone earbuds. They are good at reproducing mid-range, however there is no punch on the bottom end. I even tried adjusting the EQ on my player to increase bass, and the results didn't do much for me. Let me clearly state -- I am NOT a bass head. But I do want a balanced playback across the spectrum.

The reality is the fit is exceptional which is the saving grace of this product. Perhaps a higher end version of these monitors would deliver the sound I prefer and expect."
372,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can tell a difference between this and cheap earbuds.
373,5.0 out of 5 stars,Whenever I try using a different pair of ear buds I always end up coming back to these.
374,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm fairly disappointed with these to be honest. They sound OK, but for the price I would have hoped for a little more midrange clarity and the top end has a sibilant fizziness that I assume is a compression artifact from the dated bluetooth spec these support. I may get a wired cable to see if the problem is in the actual drivers or if it's just the bluetooth receiver. On the plus side the foam tips are pretty snug and isolate well.

Wearing these around the battery pack & controls make wearing pretty uncomfortable. The whole contraption swings around a lot with moderate physical activity. I'll stick to my wired Etymotics and a pair of cheap Anker BT buds."
375,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great set of in-ears for the money! Why spend more than double the price if you don't have to? Playing lead guitar, I use them with a wireless transmitter/receiver pack and am free to roam the stage...awesome!!!"
376,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, not great. Quite honestly expected a lot more balanced sound and richer bass for the price point."
377,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great bass and sound details and superior fit/feel and sound isolation.

The ability to remove the buds from the cable is a nifty feature is case of damage but the wire feels pretty robust so I doubt that'll happen during everyday use.

In short, these earbuds are easily the best headphones I ever bought. I'm happy with this purchase."

379,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good quality.
380,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these in 2014. Three years ago on this date and they still hold up!
381,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, the sound is very deep and acostic. Never seen something like this earbuds. It is next level. U can hear everysingle pitch and tune with it."
382,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great earphones for such a great price. I'm a huge fan of Shure. As a bassist myself I appreciate the deep and clear sound of the bass that these earphones give me. It has a nice response to treble too. It also looks really cool.
383,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite earphones for Shure! Use them on airplanes and for recording webinars. The best!
384,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are some great earbud headphones better then the last pair I had that gave out in two months (denon Ah-250). Sometime it's hard to get in but once their in they don't come out and the sound is awesome the bass and mids sound great. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for something different.
385,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful sounding earphones. Great for stage or running.
386,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these, bought them because I lost my 4 year old predecessor pair. The audio quality is stunning, from lows to highs with little to no distortion."
387,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound good. Fit in my ears isn't gread, but that's probably my own fault as most ear buds don't fit me well. It could use a clip on the wire to clip to your collar to keep the wire from pulling down in the earpieces."
388,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of Shure earphones. The first lasted five years of heavy use before the cable failed. I purchased these largely because of the replaceable cable. The quality is outstanding....the cable is thick and supple, the cable connector fits tightly, and the selection and fit of the eartips is great (Shure eartips have always fit me better than any other brand). The sound is very good, with full bass, warm midrange, and clear treble. However, these do have a somewhat forward, slightly heavy sound, not quite the precise timing and spacious soundstage that some other quality earphones have (the Etymotic HF2's have a much more precise, although light on bass, sound). That said, I think that 99% of users (myself included) will prefer the warm, powerful sound of the Shure's. In the future I'll probably buy some higher end Shure's but for now these are great. My only real complaint is the cost of the iPhone cable sold separately (see my separate review). Please note that Shure earphones are designed for the cable to be passed behind the ear for a secure fit. something that some glasses wearers (again, myself included) can find a little awkward at times."
389,4.0 out of 5 stars,"sound quality good, easy to use, but battery need to improve use more longer"
390,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty decent sound quality, I don't have any other item at this price point to compare them to. I think they're worth the money."
391,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just replaced my Beats earbuds with these and love them. Nice rich sound & they keep out the outside noise much better than the Beats. Glad I switched.
392,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my needs!
393,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Initially, it did take some effort to get the buds to fit comfortably in my ear. However, once configured properly, these ear buds are comfortable for an extended period of time, and sound amazing."
394,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great. I've had them for about 5 months or so and they satisfy. Does block a lot of noise out. I have to use an equalizer to get the right sound but the stock sound isn't bad
395,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately the left earphone cut out after a week. I have heard that this is a somewhat common thing with these earphones. I enjoyed the sound and It was nice that they came with Foam Tips as I think they offer better sound isolation, but will not be buying them again due to them cutting out within a week or so."
396,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So the Shure SE215 Blacks are my 3rd pair of earphones over $50.00 that I've purchased in the last year. Prior to the Shure's I had the Klipsch S4i's and the Beats Tour HD. Without a doubt the Shure's beat both sets. The Klipsch had a poor fit for me and lasted about 4 months. The strain reliefs weren't very good and eventually I lost signal in the right channel. In comparison, the Shure's are designed in the professional monitor way and the strain on cables stops at the top of the ear instead of at the hub. Additionally having a replaceable cable helps too. The Beats Tour HD's were a disaster, especially for 150 bucks. They also had poor fit and the although the ribbon cable was interesting, it wasn't very sturdy and quickly sustained a tear through the rubber. The right channel on these also went out in less than 4 months. As far as fit goes for the Shure's, these actually are designed to fit in the ear comfortably and the foam cushions seal up really well. It takes a minute to get used to the cables going over the ears. The sound is tough to qualify. Its for sure less punchy that the Beats but that is to be expected. I'm using an iPod Touch 4th gen and tried both the standard music player program and EQu with a customized equalizer setup. The standard music player emphasizes the base alot. Using a custom equalizer setup, you can dial down the bass a bit and bring out the mid's and highs. The Shure's sound great after some tweaking. Overall I would definitely recommend these monitors over the Klipsch's and Beats at the price range."
397,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for my church band, this is the first time I've used in ears. Clean and clear, good separation in the frequency ranges. Lows stand out, the mids and highs sing. LOVE THEM!"
398,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hurt my ears. Stiff wire near the buds making a comfortable fit impossible. My Sony's are very comfortable and sound better and cost 40% less.
399,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, I like the sound quality and all, but you have to dig the earbuds so deep into your ears it almost feels unnatural. It also takes a lot of messing around to put them in correctly. They're not really mobile earbuds. The design just isn't for me. I returned these a day later. Don't let my bad experience deter you from getting these though they sound great, just not the style I like."
400,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Shure earbuds!
401,4.0 out of 5 stars,amazing sound. after a while you have to wiggle or wrap the cords a certain way to get the sound to come out of both (and not just one) of the headphones. Had this happen in other Shures too
402,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clean sound, after they are broken in the bass is solid, highs are not brittle and there is a great mid range. Take you time on the wires over the ears and they are comfortable, these blow the Bose out of the water !"
403,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sounds produced by the SE215. Very well balanced and the Bass is not too heavy but still packs a punch.

I would say it is one of the best earphones in the under $100 group.

Only thing to consider is the unusually long cables that comes with the SE215. I aint very tall so when im using the SE215 with my phone, the excess cables can be a hassle.

But if you dont have a problem with cable length, i highly recommend getting the Shure SE215"
404,2.0 out of 5 stars,Could not get them to fit. At all. With any earpad. It was like trying to stuff a shoe in my ear. I have not problems with my Shure 530s.
405,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Considering the features and usability of many other Bluetooth options, this cable is a little archaic. Reminds me of the first Bluetooth jaybirds I bought for working out. This cord is extra funky in that it's big and the plastic housing makes it feel cheap. On the plus side, I don't see too noticeable of a difference in sound. However, i'm certainly no audiophile. I bought the earphones about 8 years ago and have used them mainly on short flights (<8 hours) to block out airport/plane noise. Why 4 stars? For my uses it's great. Easy upgrade to some old, but pricey ear buds. I just love how comfortable my Shure's are and how well they block out noise. Pros: no problems pairing to my iphone X, Ipad etc. Sound is good enough, no noticeable hissing so far (literally just took it out of the box and tested for an hour only). Cons: cord is really weird and cumbersome. Voice does not seem to work very well. Siri had no idea what i was saying. even holding the mic right up to my mouth. I'll do some more research. Perhaps my mic is broken. Rather use my old jawbone anyway than having the weird cord wrapped around my neck."
406,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are what I expected and sound ok for my band. Not too expensive and I use them with the MiPRO wireless system.
407,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is ok, but the stiffened wires and unpluggable connections are a giant FAIL
The wires are ""stiffened"" for about three inches out of the buds. I suppose someone thought this would make the wires form around the ear. For what reason? But in fact, they actually PREVENT the wires from forming around the ear, which leaves the wires difficult to deal with, and I'm in an extremely hot climate near Cambodia, where the malleability of the plastic shrouds over the wires would be greatest. Imagine trying to deal with them in a cool or cold climate. Regular wires work just fine and fit far better around the ears. Also, the plugin connections between the wires and the buds are for....what? When they twist and turn they introduce scratchy noises, which you know, you KNOW will only get worse in time as dirt finds its way into the connections. No doubt these little connections contributed to the high price, but I cannot see that they serve any purpose whatsoever, only headaches. I have a set of &12.95 Skull Candys that I am going back to. Same sound. Fewer annoyances. More wasted money on Amazon."
408,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound GREAT! Love they are detachable
409,4.0 out of 5 stars,Took me a couple weeks before I realized how to properly insert these things. I was on the verge of sending them back when I realized I was using them incorrectly. Once I figured that out I realized the great sound quality. It's not the best I've ever heard but it's probably in the top 3. So I would recommend this product. FYI I use the large foam ear pieces.
410,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works as describe, no issues. came very quickly. Thanks."
411,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good thank you
412,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Took forever to get them to fit. Got to be patient and wrap the wire just so. Once in they are fine with good sound. If I press on them with my fingers the sound really improves telling me that I need the foam or flange sleeves. I'm not made of money and don't think I need to pay this much for ear buds and then have to upgrade them. A friend just bought a competitors brand and says they came with sleeves. Will check it out.
The pair that I bought for a gift may have a loose wire leading to the left bud. I'll have to ask for them back to check it out. Nice gift huh?
Maybe I'll just walk around with my fingers pressed to the buds. I should have noticed that the majority of reviews started with ""I got mine free or at a discount"". Not sure what else is out there but wish I had a discount."

418,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I unboxed these earphones not twenty minutes ago and was greeted by sound dropouts from broken connections in the cable, which is super frustrating because when they work properly with some persuasion they sound great for $99. So excellent earbuds, but even though cables are a problem for all headsets it's a real pain to have to ship back the whole kit straight out of the box, especially as it's a detachable cable."
419,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these earphones.They are sturdy and durable. The fact that the ear buds are detachable is a plus.I would buy again.

421,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great sounding for sure. I used these headphones at work where i am constantly lifting things and moving around. My sessions with these headphones would be anywhere from 2 to 4 hours of straight listening and I must say I did enjoy the sound! My only problem was the overall design on the headphones. This was my first over the ear experience and I must admit that I did not enjoy it for long term use.

Pros,
Sound isolation was insane! I work in a cold box for the majority of my shift and I could not hear any rattling from the generator used to power it.
Sound overall was very good and well balanced. Personally more of a bass head myself but thoroughly enjoyed my time with these headphones.
Cord is long and thick making it very durable
Earpiece selection that is given to you is amazing and the foam sleeve as they call it makes it hard to go back to the standard silicone.

Cons,
- Biggest con for me was the detachable cable. I ended up losing one of the ear pieces because this was my daily driver. I did not have time to use the case and therefore lost one. Very disappointing because if you lose one the pair is pretty much useless.
- Over the ear design hurt my ears after long use, mainly on the top of my ear where the cable wrapped.
- Personally did not like the L shaped headphone jack, as I moved around I pulled it out several times by accident!

The sound quality is there and the noise cancellation is some of the best I have ever heard. However, if you are like me and are wanting to use this as your daily driver for long interval listening i would recommend you look at something else for this price range."
422,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic! Light years ahead in SQ from even the mid-grade old in ear buds from Shure! And those were over 2x the cost of these!

The one short coming is that they have absolutely no bass.

Update 12-20-13 Shure has excellent customer service. I had the ear buds about 14 months when the cord broke. They came with a 2 year warranty. I mailed the damaged ear buds to Shure and received a brand new pair within two weeks. Thanks Shure."

431,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product for the price. Not for the professional, but close. Great sound, good noise cancellation,"
432,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these for the sound quality, and for sound isolation. I use them on the Motorcycle and for mowing the lawn. Highly recommended. Sometimes it takes more than one try to get a good fit for best sound isolation, but I imagine that's true of all in-the-ear monitors."
433,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I researched multiple earphones and ended up ordering these because the reviews were good...besides an occasional complaint about having to get used to fitting them around your ear correctly.

After testing them out myself, here is what I came up with:

Pros:

1) Sound was pretty amazing, especially for the price. I was also testing out some other earphones at the time that were $100 more than the SE215's, and I really couldn't tell the difference. Bass punched well and felt like the perfect amount, although might not be enough for someone who was expecting to be blown away. The mids and highs were clear as well, I really had no complaints about the sound. The isolation was also really good, the fitting around the ear and the way they fit in the ear really made sure of that. I was really satisfied when it came to this.

2) They're secure in the ear. I mowed with them for an hour and a half and didn't have to readjust them once. Although many people complained about having difficulties wrapping it around the ear, once you get it figured out, it's really an easy task and is what keeps them on so well.

3) The earphone wire is think and has an ""L"" shape at the end, so it's pretty durable. It's also detachable, so if it does get damaged, you can just buy another wire instead of having to buy a whole new pair of earphones.

Cons:

1) I have small ears. The earbuds themselves, (not the sleeves, which you can change to a smaller/larger size), are rather large. No matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't stay in like they should have. And since I had so much trouble getting them to fit correctly, within about 20 minutes I could feel my ears getting sore from them. Again, this had nothing to do with the sleeves, but the earbuds themselves. No complaint on their part, I simply have small ears.

2) Changing the sleeves was a real challenge. They sit on a plastic thing, (great description, I know) and you have to take your fingernails and slide the plastic thing off. While this is great because it means the original sleeves won't fall off anytime soon, it sucks trying to change them because you feel like you're going to destroy the sleeves in the process. After some practice though, I'm sure it'd be easier to do.

3) Although I complimented the earphone cable in the ""pros"", since it is pretty long and heavy, it can be somewhat awkward and isn't extremely good for a lot of moving around, as it can make some cable noise. There's also no mic, so to change the music you have to take your phone/whatever you're using out of your pocket and manually change it. Of course that is in the description, so I knew of that beforehand.

I would give them a 5 star for the sound/isolation and for the price, I was very pleased with that. But in the end, I personally couldn't stand the discomfort (due to my small ears) and ended up returning them."
434,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things sound incredible and are very comfortable.
totally recommend to anyone looking for a quality set of buds."
435,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned them as I didn't like the way they sounded at all. On the plus side, they were comfortable even with the side of my head buried in a pillow."
436,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second time purchasing these pair of headphones. The first time, the wire within the memory foam snapped off and Shure declined the repair after the first year."
437,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's Ok, maybe the other models in the same line will be the best option. To hear the bass you have to use the bigger earbuds."
438,2.0 out of 5 stars,hard to use
439,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A good fit is essential to the sound of these, but when you have it the sound is really nice and the bass is punchy, good for a workout."
440,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good, not excellent, before these I was using a similar sennheiser the price was the same, but the sound much better"
441,3.0 out of 5 stars,hard to keep on
442,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a big fan of Shure for at least 10 years now and there is one big problem I always had with the SE215. The cable is too damn long. This problem was exacerbated by the iPhone 7 and its dongle instead of a headphone jack. With this i decided to give Jaybird X2s, and Jaybird freedoms a try.

Jaybird X2: These never fit my ears right. I found the foam tips to be very uncomfortable. They have some a texture to them that just doesn't agree with me. The silicon tips feel like sticking suction cups in my ears, and the wing tips cause my ears fatigue after about 20 minutes.

Jaybird Freedom: Better for me than the X2 as the foam sleeves are similar to the Shure but not as good quality. After about 2 weeks of use they would fall apart.

Back to Wired Shure: I was working out one day and got the cable caught on my knee. I was done with this long cable. I was about to break down and buy the Jaybird Freedom 2. Then I saw them.

Shure SE215 Bluetooth: This solves 80% of my problems with the wired 215s.
Pros: Mostly Wireless (make some truly wireless version of these and i'm in regardless of the cost)
The cable is detachable so i could use them if up upgrade to one of the better models, and it has a clip to keep the cable from bouncing around. You can also wear these in front of the neck or behind.

Cons: Who ever came up with the battery indicator should be reassigned. It just gives you lines like ""more than 2 hours left). That's not that useful. These are also devoid of any cool features like fitness tracking. My opinion though get an apple watch or a fitbit if you want that kind of nonsense.

Bluetooth performance: For me they cut out one time while I was setting up for a bench press. They have not cut out sense.

Conclusion: If Shure earbuds fit your ears and you want them mostly wireless get these."
443,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Remarkable earbuds, under $100! I've had these incredible earphones for 4 years and I'm still amazed at the quality of sound they produce. They compare with earbuds twice the retail cost, and blow away everything else at this price point. I use other headphones for my line of work (as a filmmaker and video / sound artist) such as my pair of Sennheiser HD25-1 II, and these little Shure earbuds are right up there in quality and clarity. Once you get the right seal, the bass is unbelievable.

Another note: I've twice wrecked the right channel by snagging them on camera rigging. Both times, Shure has sent out replacements for free. Free! I've always offered to pay for replacement right cabling or driver components (they come apart easily), but Shure has simply replaced the entire earphone set - both drivers, new cables, and a new carrying case both times. Outstanding technical service, which is hard to find these days. They're based in the Chicago area and, thus, send out replacement parts within a few days, not like some other companies which still use China as a distribution hub, thousands of miles away. I like buying from Shure - a dedicated audio brand - and will do so in the future. Keep up the great customer service and technical achievements Shure!"
444,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Top of the line quality of sound and great noise isolation. I put these on and I can't here the person next to me talking, let alone the noise on the airplane. The memory foam earbuds make all the difference."
445,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are no better headphones than Shure. I can run, sit, and sleep with these headphones on and won't hear anything else. They also don't fall off."
446,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent well balanced earphones. I use them in a small rehearsal studio where live drums are played and work great. Sound can only be heard through the earphones so levels can be maintained low.
447,5.0 out of 5 stars,Standad shure fit provides great isolation. Great natural sound.
448,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are easily the best headphones I've ever used. They meet my demands for music and it really brings out the details in lots of my songs. The sleeves do a great job of sealing in all the noise and keeping the ambient noise out. It also helps that they're very stylish (IMO)
449,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound. Very long cord, not for walking,running or the gym. However for other intended uses they are wonderful."

I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a nicer set of IEMs."

456,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So I have been reading qualitative and quantitative reviews for probably the biggest market right now, earbuds in the $100 range.

Obviously these aren't going to be your bottom basement earbuds but they aren't going to be world class monitor earbuds either. I think it's a great range for your enthusiast who is willing to spend some extra money for a better product.

Initial Comments: I have had a few good earbuds but most of them are almost disposable. I was in the market for earbuds around $100, give or take a few bucks. I had narrowed it down to these Shures and the Sony MDR-510. I have always been partial to Sony earbuds since I bought a bluetooth headset for my phone to listen to music w/o cords to the phone. The only issue is the Shure's are widely recognized and reviews are aplenty. The Sonys were just released and almost little to no decent reviews by any major website or amazon. I chose the Shures and it's almost a regret.

Pros: First off the cord seems up to the job. It feels heavy and somewhat stiff, it's not going to rip under normal usage. Some don't like the long cord but I do (although the Sony's have an option for a long cord or short). The case is normal, a stock item in this level of earbuds. I like the different sizes / materials for the earbuds as well. The little tool to clean the earbuds is a nice touch (I'm a bit of a germophobe). I like the replaceable cords. The earbuds look nice but that doesn't really matter to me since I want performance and performance they give. Obviously I have never had this level of earbud but there are definitely the best I've had. That being so, I felt some of the reviews overly hyped these earbuds. I get over the ""new product hype"" and take a more pessimistic view for almost all of my purchases. They fit really comfortably in my ears and I love I can lay down with them in. I have been flying to and from the states to Asian countries so comfort for 14 hour flights was a must. These work well.

Cons: So obviously they're great headphones but I feel people want to hear the short comings more so than overall praise. First, these are the first earbuds I have had that wrap the cord around the top of the ear and down. While that helps keep the cord out of the way and more stable, the cord is too stiff and so they kind of don't hug my ear well. Sometimes the cord itself ""swings"" away from my ears and hits my cheek. I have tried to bend them to be more tight against my ear but to no avail. Also I wear glasses, sometimes taking off sunglasses or my glasses will pull on the cord.

The biggest con I have so far is intermittent cutting off of sound. I don't know if it's these particular pair or the earbuds themselves, I have not see anyone else have this issue. Sometimes I move around and my left earbud will cut out of sound. Now it's kind of random because I will bob my head around and it won't cut off. Mind you I am sitting the whole time, I'm not running or exercising. I have never had an earbud cutout like this. Maybe it's the fact that the cords are replaceable is causing the cutoff. I find this has almost ruined my whole experience with these earbuds. Unfortunately I bought these a week before I left the country and have been gone for 4 weeks (I'm still out of the country). So I can't return them although if Shure's warranty is as great as I hear, I shouldn't have a problem getting them replaced, fixed, whatever is necessary to have them not cut out. $100 pair of headphones shouldn't cut out, even my cheap $15 audio tecknica's have never had this issue.

So there you go. Yes there are very good, probably one of the top sub-$100 earbuds. They are comfortable and should last. The only reason it's getting 3 stars right now is the cutoff. I mean that is almost a deal breaker at this price."
457,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound great. And after getting used to them, they become very easy to put in and tighten up.

My only complaint is, they don't come with a clip to attach the cord to the back of a collar or to a tag on the back of a shirt. Over ear mics come with these to prevent pulling. As a guitar player, if I put these on with the cord in the back, the guitar strap will eventually pull on the cord and then pulls on the ear buds.

My solution: Alligator clips. I attached alligator clips to the rubber part where the cord Y's. Once clipped to the back of my shirt, his gives me enough slack to move my head around and enough cord to run under my shirt. This works great for both the stage as well as listening to my phone in my back pocket."
458,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic. I listened to an album that I'm very familiar with, and was amazed at how much detail it brought out. The sound isolation is fantastic, although at times I wish I could hear more of the world around me when walking."
459,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best I've ever used. I don't know what to say that's bad. The sound is crisp and deep. Nothing ""added"" no ""extra bass"" or anything. If you want that, that's what the EQ is for. They seal in your ear. On airline travel they block out just about all of the noise. When I cant grab my BOSE noise canceling, I grab these. They are with me all the time. I don't wear them to work out, so can't answer about being sweat-proof. Like I said they seal, so when I am at the gym, I want to be able to hear things around me a little. When music is playing, you can't hear any background voices/noise. Love the way the cord is ""stiff"" the first few inches to wrap behind your ear, very secure. Prevents cable noise when it rubs on your clothing that I have had in past headphones."
460,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a big fan of Shure products, and this pair of headphones is no exception. The sound fidelity is excellent, I'd say they probably sound better than any set I've ever had. I have a pair of over-ear Beats Pro (Detox) that I got as a gift, and in my opinion, though being half the price, these sound twice as good. The low range is great, bass is deep when you want it to be, and they get plenty loud with no distortion. I like foam earbuds, and the ones included fit very well and reduce environment sound by a lot. Standing on the subway platform, I sometimes get startled by trains approaching because I don't hear them coming until they pass me.

I rely a lot on my headphones due to my NYC commute, taking buses and subways. It's very noisy. These headphones truly are great, and worth every penny.

The only thing I'm not 100% fond of is the over-ear wire thing. It works great, and I get it, but sometimes I wish they were just regular earbuds because they can be difficult to put in at times. Not difficult, just a little weird. Once they're in, though, you have to physically take them out. They won't fall. I have had no issues with them to date."
461,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To my ears these buds sound fantastic and produce a deep, rich sound! The passive noise cancelation is great! I work in a small office where the constant coworker chatter was driving me nuts and effecting ability to focus on my programming! My old set of buds had to be played on high volume to even begin to drown out the chatter and even then they never completely dampened the noise. With the correct sleeve and with music playing on low to medium volume, these buds block out ALL external noise without damaging my eardrums or giving me a headache. No joke, I don't hear anything but my music! The ""over the ear"" style takes some getting used to but it didn't take long. While I use these earbuds primarily for work, they sit nearly flush with my outer ear making them comfortable to wear while sleeping as well. I've owned various models of Shure earbuds over the last 10 years and these do not disappoint. They might be a bit pricey but worth every penny in my opinion, especially with the 2 year warranty that Shure offers. My one complaint would be the lack of a microphone on the base model."
462,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I dont know if i was just super excited and expected a new world of sound when buying these, but i was somewhat not impressed by these headphones. I like them, just not impressed. Anyways. I received these headphones earlier than expected. Im new to IEM and sound isolated headphones. They are very comfortable when you get them in but they are a pain to get them in in the first place. Which i assume ill get better over the months i use them. I bought these to play drums with my band, which are perfect! The headphones blocks most things out but just enough so that i can hear what the headphones are pushing through and a little of what my band plays, and my band is LOUD. Anyways, for all those casual users out there, the sound quality is just like your typical semi-high quality headphones. The highs mids and lows are all there, but thats the same as dre beats, skullcadies, even the new apple headphones. Not trying to bash, but for people that are crazy insaine about music and quality, go with something higher up, for those that want a dependable product and dont wanna her a jet engine take off right in front of them while listening to their jams, go with these!

Or if your crazy rich go with the 846's i heard those headphones introduce your brain to a whole new world of sound, almost as if you were seeing new colors for the first time. But hey, thats just what i heard!"
463,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, this is a review of the Shure SE215 in-ear headphones, or in-ear monitors (IEM), but it's also a story of terrific customer service that's indicative of long-term thinking on the part of Shure.

Before I dive into the Shure's, I'll give a bit of background of my musical preferences and what I'm looking for in headphones. I like clean natural sound. I typically avoid using equalizers and like my experience to be close to the natural sound of what's produced. I typically listen to classical, jazz, folk and pop, but my musical taste are fairly eclectic and across the board. Throw in a little R & B and dubstep over the top of Lindsay Sterling and you have it. So while I want to sense the thump in Bruno Mars' Grenade I want to hear clarity in Anne Akiko Meyer's playing of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. I hate bass emphasis especially if it results in muddy sound.

I also want to note that I'm no audio expert, 80% of my listening is done on my smartphone (Nokia Lumia 920) and I probably spend as much or more time listening to audio books on the Audible app as I do listening to music. Most of my music is streamed from Beats Music service at 320 kbs or downloaded from Amazon at 256 kps vbr. If it's local, it's encoded either at 320 kps MP3 or vbr 320 kps WMA. All of this is to say, this is real world listening, mostly using my smartphone in a normal, active life. So while I'm serious about music, you could even say passionate, I'm not a hard-core audiophile who worries if his cables touch the carpet.

For full review: wp.me/p2XCwQ-Zh"
464,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm really astounded by the sound isolation ability of these headphones. I can wear them in an airplane with crying babies and not even have to turn up my music more than one click over what I use outside the airplane (and I don't listen all that loudly). I can also wear them on a bike or as a passenger in a car with the windows rolled down and I can still hear perfectly well with almost normal sound levels.

It's really important to get a tight seal though, but it comes with like, 6 different ear fittings so you can experiment with different fits.

Also, I like the hard wire that you can wrap around the the top of your ear to help keep it in place. These very rarely fall out, even when working out and exercising.

The sound quality is also quite good. I have big can headphones, so it's definitely a downgrade from them, but considering how small, portable, performance in windy/hot/loud areas, and how convenient these are, it's well worth the drop in quality. Besides, they're better than all other in ear headphones I've tried in every sense."
465,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent addition if you already have a set of shure earphones. Great battery life and decent quality, I would like to have seen the braided wire that comes with the heigher end earphones made by them. Caution though! It’s a wireless connection, therefore the sound quality will be affected by it. Specially if you have the 535 and up, the souls will not be as rich and full. They are handy though."
466,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I find these to sound extremely neutral and a little boring to listen to without an EQ and headphone amp. They have a true monitor sound. I prefer to listen to them with my headphone amp - this is where they really shine. When amplified these little guys can put out some impactful sub-bass down to 35htz while keeping the balance of your music in check. Meaning, the mids and high's are not distorted. I will say the 4k area of these IEM's can be a bit harsh sounding, but a simple adjustment to the EQ can correct that.

I have around 80 hours on them currently. I do not know if they need a burn in, but I did the usual day of alternating pink-white sound, then the rest of the time with a variety a music ranging from rock, metal, electronic and dub. I wish i could say the sound changed, but I don't think it did. Unlike some headphones that really re-shape themselves after a burn in, these just seem to remain consistent, clear and fun to listen to.

If you are going to listen to them on your phone or tablet, you might not be too excited about them, but with a good amp and equalizer, i find these to be a very warm, full sounded IEM, and would purchase them again should I lose or break mine."
467,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First, I'd like to say that these IEMs are very well constructed. Rugged design, replaceable cable, and all major junctions are reinforced. I foresee these lasting much longer than the comparable Audio Technica's, Skull Candy, etc. that I've owned. However, where I was surprised that Shure fell a little short with these is the overall sound. Don't get me wrong, they're leagues beyond any of the main stream brands (i.e. Skull Candy, Beats, etc) for the price. However, the mids are quite overwhelming and it's pretty lacking in the highs (2.4kHz and up). You can clean most of it up with an EQ but you really need to boost the highs or just sounds plain muddy (maybe it's just too warm for my liking). I'm mildly disappointed in this respect (and I hate to compared IEMs to closed ear headphones but...) because for ~$30-40 more dollars you can get the Audio Technica M50's which blow these out of the water. For the price tag of $100 I would've expected these to perform much better, especially because they're Shures.

Recommendation: Bottom line, these are fantastic IEMs in terms of ruggedness of construction and are good in terms of sound quality for the average (or even above average) listener. However, if you've got a picky ear you'll find these overwhelming warm even run through a EQ. Not unbearable but I would probably splurge on the two-driver model of these Shures because they're bound to be a more satisfying audio experience than these."
468,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these IEM's and after reading lots of reviews I wanted to state the following: all earbuds with dynamic drivers need some break in time, please believe this. If you think that they will sound the same right out of the box, as opposed to after you listen to them for many hours, you are wrong in that assumption. I own several pairs and purchased these for their boost in bass response over the less expensive Shure model. I listened to them out of the box and then after every ten hours of break in. You can use white noise CD's or the like but here's what has worked for me breaking in 4 to 5 pairs in the past 6 months. Get yourself an adapter plug and plug your IEM's into your receiver or your boombox or your radio. Put them on and raise the sound level to where they are comfortable then take them off and crank it up to where you can hear them while you're holding them in your hand. Play talk radio for 10 hours, rock music for 10 hours, classical music for 10 hours and after every 10 hour session listen to the IEM's. The difference with the SE215's after 30 hours was striking, no sibilance, the midrange and the lows were so much clearer and deeper. After another 30 hours I can honestly say that for 100 bucks these buds are definitely worth it. Now having said that, I also have to state that a pair of Monster N-Lites that I paid 60 bucks for after 20 hours of break in sounded almost as good as the Shure SE215-K's I purchased. What's my point? There are a lot of really good earbuds in the 50 to 100 dollar range. the Shures are excellent and I use them at home for their superior bass and I use the N-Lites for the gym and running. I own and highly recommend the RHA-MA750's, the HiFiMan's for 99 bucks, the Klipsh Image S-4's and the Monster Turbos that I paid 100 bucks for. I am a bit of a fanatic when it comes to my music and just like speakers I find that headphones and IEM's all seem to have sonic signatures all their own. The SE215's are a superior product, with a 2 year warranty, replaceable cords and once broken in, sound quality above the purchase price. When I listen to my laptop through my Dragonfly DAC and the Shure SE215's I am one happy camper. Folks, I can be more technical and try to impress you with terms that make me sound like the audiophile I am but what's the point of that? These are for 100 dollars worth every cent.
After break in I had to turn the volume down even lower and was amazed at how well these IEM's performed and gave that sense of being outside of my head. Audio is very subjective, what one person hears another may not, that's why I listen through differing pairs. That and the fact that I'm a bit maniacal about my music! When I am ready to spend more on IEM's the 315's or 415's will be the ones I buy from Shure and I must add, Amazon's service is beyond belief. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and I reiterate, break them in for sonic bliss, a minimum of 40 hours before critical listening."
469,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These IEMs are great for musicians. I am a lead guitarist and lead vocalist in my church band and I use these with an Aviom/wireless monitoring setup. The sound of these is basically warm, with full bass, enhanced midrange (awesome for vocals), and just enough treble to keep it from sounding dark. I would not call these ""flat"" by any means, but I find them to be excellent for live performance. More reviews on these can be found on HeadFi which I recommend checking out if you are not convinced here.

My favorite tips for these so far are the Shure yellow foam ones found here: Shure EAYLF1-10 Foam Sleeves (10 Included/5 Pair) for SCL3, SCL4, SCL5, E3c, E4c, E5c, E500 & SE Earphones (Yellow). These give me the most balanced sound of all of the included tips and the Comply tips I tried."
470,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound. I have a bunch of earbuds but these are the best. Like these better than my Bowers & Wilkins C5 and my Klipsch S4's. Takes a little getting use to putting them on but worth it. Use the foam tips for best seal against ear canal and sound.
471,5.0 out of 5 stars,My nephew loved them. Christmas gift.
472,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile, but can tell a huge difference between these and low end models. I don't think I would be able to pick out difference or want to pay for the next step up as the quality difference would be marginal and very pricey.
I like these because they fit directly in the ear and fit very snug, creating a nice sound cave."
473,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highest quality audio ive heard in the ballpark of this price. Very precise lows and mids. The only con of these are that they lack the bass of higher end shures
474,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these when mowing the grass on my John Deere LA-175 lawn tractor. I can keep the volume down to a level that won't destroy my ears and the mower sound is greatly attenuated. I can still hear enough to know if there is a problem with the mower. These are great if you need sound isolating ear buds.
475,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I experience fallouts when i am running. 5 times on a 5 km trip. Quit annoying. And bluetooth still can't be used as IEM, because of a lot of latency."
476,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Once I got these earbuds, it took about a day and a half before I got them to fit the way I wanted. After that, the sound was much like my audio technica ath-m50's with a little cleaner highs and a little stronger bass and greater isolation. Overall, a relatively flat sound with a slight v curve. Well worth the money and time to get the fit right. I ride the bus to school all the time and these block out nearly all the sound of the bus and other passengers."
477,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned some of my music for several decades, but now, listening to it with these earphones I feel like I am hearing it for the first time! These are extremely well made and worth the money for what they deliver!"
478,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great set of earbuds. You'll be spoiled after owning them and will never go back to $30 sets.
479,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these earphones after losing my Sony MDR Ex-series earbuds at school. I loved those headphones as they were comfortable and provided excellent sound quality (balanced hi's, mids, and punchy bass, and isolated sound very well) for only around $30. Instead of just buying my trusty sony's again (I used them heavily and bought a new pair every year), I thought that I would try something different, something more expensive that would produce higher quality sound and last longer than my Sony's usually did (about a year of VERY heavy use).

I spent hours researching different headphones that did the same thing my Sony's did, but better. I wanted to stay below $100 because these are earphones, the quality can only go so high with the limited space for drivers, so any in-ear headphone more than $100 really just becomes a pole measuring contest. I came across the Shure SE215 after reading several reviews and top 10 lists for earphones. People raved about these earphones and claimed that they were the best sub $100 earphones available. Sadly, after several months of use, I am glad to say that I lost these and will be purchasing a different brand for a cheaper price, with better comfort, and the same, if not better, sound quality.

COMFORT: 4/10
Initially, after finding the most comfortable earbud (the included foam), I thought that I had made a great decision in purchasing these. But, after about 24 hours of using them on the bus, walking to and from classes, and then sleeping in them, I found them to be uncomfortable. I could not go more than an hour before I had to take them out because they made my ears hurt. I never experienced this with my Sony's and I was very disappointed.

I have small ears, so the earphones just barely fit and they protruded, so they were clearly visible to other people, and resembled very large hearing aids from the 90's. They often slid out of my ear as the very thick memory wire would not stay behind my ears. Since the cord is so heavy, when the memory wire slid from behind my ears the earphones would completely fall out.

DESIGN: 4/10
These headphones are not designed for people with small ears. The earbud itself just barely fit into my ear and would become extremely uncomfortable after only about 30 minutes of use. This greatly effected the ""sound isolation"" feature because a tight seal is needed, and with the earphones constantly popping out of my ears, a seal was never constant.

Moving on to the cord that comes with these earphones. They are easily the worst and most difficult earphone cables that I have ever dealt with. For it to be a cable to a set of earphones, it is extremely thick and heavy. They tangle EVERY single time I put them in the carrying case, in my pocket, pretty much any time that they are not in use. The worst part about that is that they are HARD to untangle. I think this is because of the memory wire/cord that is at the top of the cable. After you mold them to a comfortable fit around your ears (I never achieved this, cord was too stiff and never held the same shape) they essentially become hooks and tangle the cords making the untangling process lengthy and VERY inconvenient.

With my old Sony earphones, I was able to pull them out of my pocket and have them in my ears, and plugged into my phone in 10 seconds or less. With the Shure SE215, it takes me almost 1 minute to complete the same task.

The cord itself is the reason I am glad to be purchasing a different pair of earphones. It is easily the most difficult cable I have ever dealt with on any audio device. It's so thick and heavy, that when you have the headphones in your ears, you can hear every single move that the cord makes. This is terrible if you are walking or jogging, because the cord will be bouncing off of your body, you'll hear a very audible thud with each bounce.

SOUND QUALITY: (8/10 With great seal, 3/10 with decent seal)
The reviews I read praised the sound quality in these earphones, so I was terribly disappointed when I discovered that they sound similar and sometimes worse than my $30 Sony earphones. The thing with these earphones, is that sound quality is extremely dependent upon how good of a seal that you have between your ear canal and the earbuds. The few times I was able to create a great seal, the sound was on par with my $30 Sony earphones. Balanced Hi-mid range, punchy but stable bass, and a very nice amount of clarity. When there isn't a great seal with these headphones, the bass completely disappears, and the overall sound becomes very tin-like, thin with no noticeable range.

Overall, I would not recommend these earphones to anyone, especially not to people with small ears. The over the ear design is uncomfortable, the sound quality depends on how deep you can fit these into your ear canal, and ultimately they are just frustrating and uncomfortable because of the cable that comes with them. If you look around, you can find headphones that are more comfortable, and have equal to or better sound quality for more than half the price of these.

Sidenote: I had a red winter coat, and with the cord constantly rubbing against it, it eventually took on a dingy red color."
480,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a basshead, so the bass was disappointing on these headphones (regardless of the tip used). When paired with the Fiio 17k, they work wonderfully! It is sometimes difficult to get the headphones to stay in securely when walking around."
481,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had Shure 5 series, 3 series, and now these 215's. For me the difference in price and the total range quality of these 215's is near equal. I am not an audiophile but I know what sounds best to me. The 215's at the price of around $100 are by far the best value for the money. And the carabiner snap carrying case will hopefully prevent me from leaving these on airplanes!! Very expensive losses."

484,4.0 out of 5 stars,"input jack shortened out after 2weeks and right earbud quit working after 3 weeks, The wire is pretty cheap, however headphones sound good when the wire is working."
485,4.0 out of 5 stars,"IEMs sound great but the cable doesn't wear well for users with glasses, 5 stars with the MEE audio MMCX High-Fidelity Silver-Plated Cable."
486,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have spend the last 3 years looking for great sounding earphones, and have spend at least double the cost of these amazing earphones in that quest. I finally broke down after reading the wirecutter's review [...] and ordered a set. I have been extremely pleased with both the sound and build quality, they block out almost all of the external noise, and the highs sound great, and the lows are nicely balanced (no more stupid skullcandy too much bass issue for me)"
487,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this item 3 months ago and one of the ends of the cable is no longer working. Poor customer service.In general very disappointed.
488,1.0 out of 5 stars,"seriously unimpressive. Firstly the play/stop music function no longer works as with the ""hold"" to advance song tracks. They worked for about 3 weeks then just don't work anymore. I checked my phone if I somehow disconnected them from ""media"" control but i did not. The only functions that work now is the volume control and turning them off.

Second 'hot mess' is the microphone/phone call quality. Piss poor no matter if you are on 4g or wifi, phone calls or ""internet calls like Skype / LINE""...all bad quality sound.

Thirdly the wire is just too long. Just looks dumb hanging so low behind your neck. You can 'loop' them as they have a thingy to clap the wire but then you are still stuck with a huge ""loop"" bouncing on the back of your neck.

Some nitpicking...the voice that tells you when you 'turned it on' and the battery life left....is very very loud. Just doesn't make sense to have it that loud.

The problem is I moved overseas so I cannot return them...otherwise I would have."
489,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Blew the klipsch image s4i II i had before out of the water. Trust the reviews above the fit is extremely difficult at first but is quite easy after that. the isolation is better than the klipsch, the bass is better. Its comfortable to sleep with them as well. the only negative thing i have to say about them is the rather flat soundstage but that is to be expected from a pair of iems. Awesome buy"
490,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones although for me some long listening sessions can get a bit uncomfortable as the over ear cable can dig in a little bit even with the cord binder thing loosened. overall great product and recommend for anyone. Also the foam tips will get much more dirty than your typical plastic earbuds.
491,5.0 out of 5 stars,I will never buy another brand of headphones! These are amazing. I use them daily at work to block out distracting noise. The noise cancelling ability of these headphones make it possible to play music at low volume and not hear people talking in the next cube.
492,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound quality!
493,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality and very comfortable after you get used to wearing them. Noise isolation is much better than I expected.
494,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a replacement for my SE-530 which were stolen at an airport. The sound is very good; not equivalent to the 530's but very good. I am very satisfied with the sound quality for this price point.
However, I often find that I choose not to use them because it is such a battle to put them on. They have a junction between the earbud and the cable that is designed to allow the wire to rotate for a comfortable fit. But this junction is flimsy, so 50% of the time the function disconnects. This requires removing the earbud from your ear and starting the process all over again.
I prefer the sound from these, but I find myself grabbing my $15 Panasonic bud because I can just put them in and listen rather than going through a 10 minute ordeal of multiple attempts to insert the Shure's and keep the wire connected.
My 530's also had a junction in the same place, but they didn't fall apart. Apparently one of the ways that Shure saved money was to make the materials used for the junction thinner and cheaper."
495,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent choice if you are looking for good bang/buck ratio. Structure allows bigger capsule enabling sound quality that beats any small-format plugs hands down. Foam plugs offer excellent background noise insulation for motorcycle use and profile is low enough so that these will sit comfortably even under full face helmet. Cables break in surprisingly fast to fit around your ears.
496,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are literally the best headphones I've owned I have some beats by Dre pro studio headphones but nothing compare to these I am a musician and I played at a big festival and could not hear anything but the tracks playing in my ears. Just to test out how good they block sound while they had music playing before the show started I stood by the speakers with the head phones in and played music from my iPad and all I heard was the music from the iPad playing they are great the best money can by......!!!!!!!!!
497,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love how they sit flush with my ear and I can use them in bed with out driving the speaker into my eardrum. I agree with other reviewers that the sound cancellation may be too good. By the time I here my wife yelling my name she is already upset.
498,5.0 out of 5 stars,great quality. amazing durability. good sound. not too much bass for my preference and i do not listen to bass heavy music. the over ear design was odd at first but i do like it now that im used to it. Very good for noise isolation. only complaint is that the chord is a bit long for me. im pretty short however and it is only a minor nuisance so 5 stars anyways.
499,5.0 out of 5 stars,Used them for recording and they work great for a nice balance of your drums and the click track. Used them with rehearsing live and was getting too much noise from the guitars and bass so I couldn't hear the click track very well. Again these are perfect for recording drums but not good for all the extra noise that comes from the guitars and bass in rehearsing situations.
500,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing. High quality, stay in my ears, excellent bass response while I play bass live."
501,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for the price
502,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome for the musician who wants to give in-ears a shot. They're loud, they isolate well, and they fit pretty nice. The pack of buds offer rubber fittings in 3 sizes and foam plugs in 3 sizes. if you like to use the ""ear-plug"" style, i suggest ordering more tips. they can be had for around $15 for 5 more pairs.

these are also great for just listening to music on."
503,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased about two months ago, I just occasionally used it but already the cable broke down and the right-side is not working. In contrast, I've used Etymotic ER-4P for three years and had no problem until it finally died away a few months ago even though I used it constantly.

The replacement cable is quite expensive and I don't want to spend more money within just a couple of months after making a purchase; hope that this is covered under warranty but the procedure looks very inconvenient plus time and money consuming... Honestly I am quite frustrated and regret my decision trying Shure product instead of one from Etymotic."
504,5.0 out of 5 stars,They sound amazing takes a little while to put but they don't fall off. & customer service is amazing!
505,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is about my third pair of specialized earphones, and these are the best. I have a small head and the around-the-head style earphones are just too bulky to be comfortable for me. I initially had trouble fitting them around my ear properly, but once I got them on right they fit perfectly. They are the most comfortable earphones I've owned. They also block out most outside noise. And, the sound quality is great."
506,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does not fit as snug as my SE110 which blocked out the whole world once inserted but these SE210 do a great job.
507,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are fantastic sound isolating in ear monitors. Great for when you want the outside world to just stay out
508,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best sounding, best noise cancellation, most comfortable earbuds on the market period. They sound so rich and full when properly placed in the ear. I've been through every brand except Bose and nothing compares."
509,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome headphones, really full sound and the bass is surprisingly good. They do a great job of blocking out external sound which is nice, and the low profile means I can fall asleep with them on without it hurting our bothering me."
510,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's slightly ugly and the fit takes some getting used to (especially putting them on). But the sound quality is one of the best I've heard especially given the $99 price point.

It's great value"
511,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The ear buds themselves work great, however, if I don't position the wires just right the sound doesn't come through. Considering the price, everything should work great. Not just one part."
512,1.0 out of 5 stars,"There is nothing good about this Bluetooth adapter. I have no idea why Shure put their name on it.

They hiccup. They sound terrible for anything but voice. The max volume is inconsistent from moment to moment. The charge port is difficult to open and the cover doesn’t swing out of the way entirely so it will undoubtedly wear out. The battery is so tiny you are not sure there is one the first time you pick them up.

And the play next and play previous function? Hold the volume up or volume down button for three seconds. So to skip 3 tracks takes ten seconds.

What’s most frustrating is that there’s another company that makes a highly reviewed alternative for the same price."
513,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a nice design, they are very harsh in the 6-8KHZ frequencies, limiting the volume. the bass is good, I'm not much of a 'Bass Head', but with these its not overpowering. To me, they are quite uncomfortable, i have small ears. So that may be a problem for just me. Worth a look, personal opinion."
514,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are easily that best head phones that i have ever had, i got these to replace my beats audio which gave out on me. super comfortable, if you are the bubble of getting a pair, go for it, you will not regret."
515,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They are great earphones, I just couldn't get used to the behind the ear types. I was paranoid that it would fall out."
516,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Connector too short for iPad Air with cover on. Over ear design difficult to wear. Ear pieces just OK., none stay put in my ears therefore sound isolation is not as expected."
517,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pair has amazing sound quality. The bass is still there, but not as pronounced as a speaker. You'll hear it, but not feel it."
518,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelente
519,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the shape, color and strong wire. The rub makes me a little uncomfortable but it really does a good job in sound isolation.

As for the acoustical quality, it does not give me much surprise than my old cheaper Sennheiser."
520,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound for the money. Only complaint is that you have to wrap around the top of your ear, so using for jogging is a pain, as the cord is a little stiff and so they don't stay in that well. But otherwise awesome value."
521,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gift, he loved it!"
522,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is very good.
Fit in my earis terrible so I can't wear them, too uncomfortable"
523,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent sound. Seem study
524,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were totally worth my money. They had everything I needed and more, as is beautifully illustrated by other reviews. But one thing: you may notice that the sound is a bit flat at first. If that is true, switch the default foam caps to the plastic ones. It dramatically increased the note range, resonance, and clarity for me."
525,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are my first dive into the world of hifi audio and I am not looking back. The IEMs are somewhat tough at first to get into your ear but once you get it down it is easy and quick. They sound amazing and are not uncomfortable at all. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for IEMs in this price range.
526,4.0 out of 5 stars,needs some time to get used to. also a little too much bass
527,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got these for my step-son for Christmas and he loves them. He is thrilled with the sound quality.
528,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love it!

thankyou"
529,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them. Snug fit ensures clear, rich, and uninterrupted sound from external noise (great for music and even the Indy 500). Sound is detailed, plenty of low rich bass, and terrific for Classical as well as pop/rock. Took a while to figure out how they fit into the ear, but now they're easy."
530,3.0 out of 5 stars,I love how these headphones sound but after 3 years of using them I am fed up. I have got them replaced 3 times in 2 years. Every single time one or the other sides stops working. Shure customer services promptly replaces them as long as they are under warranty. But now my warranty has run out and am not going to be buying another pair of Shure's again. Still trying figure what brand I should go with.
531,5.0 out of 5 stars,What? i can heard what you are saying because i have my SOUND ISOLATING earphones on. love them
532,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are great sounding earbuds and when placed properly in the ear they eliminate a lot of noise. My only complaint is that I have trouble getting the wires to dress the way I would like them to go.
533,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best in ear headphones ever. This is my second set; only bought new ones because first ones were stolen after 4 yrs of use.REPAIR PARTS ARE AVAILABLE, I never needed them after 6 yrs of total use though."
534,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is great but quality.....

I had these headphones for 6 months and the cable is braking down already.
Also getting static nose while walking.

This is a shame as these are probably the best headphones in the price range."
535,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first Shure earbuds. Takes some time and practice to put on, but once they are in there, the sound is great and they are very comfortable and secure in the ear canal. Comparing to Klipsch S4 which are also very good but getting old and fray, these are better in the bass and treble ranges.

Highly recommended"
536,5.0 out of 5 stars,As Advertised. Thanks.
537,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great workhorse earbuds. Durable and reliable. Very good sound for the money.
538,5.0 out of 5 stars,work well
539,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best headphones I have ever owned
540,5.0 out of 5 stars,great for the Price
541,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great set of earphones with quality sound and performance. They sit pretty comfortable on ears and can be used for long duration.

My gripe is however, with the cable itself, the detachable piece-of-s*** barely lasted for 2 months and then the replacement lasted 11 months. All the good quality of the earphones is being undone by an simple audio cable.

I actually bought these earphones especially for the ease of replacing the audio cables. My older Bose earphones didn't had replaceable cable so they lasted as long as the cable which on average 2 years. But the cables on SE215 are barely lasting 7 months on average. Most of the people are complaining about the low quality of the audio cables from Shure."
542,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are really well made, the cables look really sturdy etc. The one thing I don't love is the monitor v. regular headphone fit. Would have gotten non-monitor headphones if I had to do it all over again."
543,5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound awesome. Especially if you know how to use an equalizer.
544,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are every bit as awesome as ones I spent twice as much on 5 years ago. Excellent, durable, and affordable."
545,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
546,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you take the time to fit these properly the sound is fantastic rivaling my high end headphones. I am very impressed.
547,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Someday I'll be able to afford the SE535's but these are fine for every day commuting. The foam tips that Shure provides do a great job on the subway. I don't listen to bass heavy music so the flat response is perfect for classical, experimental, and other full range music. I use Poweramp on an Android so I can boost bass when I want and they sound great. The equalizer lets me fine tune all frequencies and bass is fine when I push that. Rolling Stones,Amon Tobin, or Juno Reactor sound fantastic when you set frequencies correctly. What is amazing about these earphones is the detail of the music that is completely missing from so many other brands like Beats or Logitech. It's a different listening experience.

The flexible plastic that are bent to go around your ears doesn't stay in a consistent shape. I find myself bending it into a loop each time I put these on. It's not a big deal but makes it hard to use them several times a day. I use the foam tips mostly to reduce noise from the NYC subway and if they're inserted correctly, it's amazing how you aren't assaulted with noise from passing trains. I've noticed a big difference in tinnitus after using these.

I've read that in-ear earphones can be more damaging to hearing that on-ear headphones but I'd rather carry around 2 oz than a bulky 10oz set. I don't listen at high volume and I'm careful about high dynamic range music."
548,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic sound quality. Unfortunately they aren't as comfortable as other headphones I've used. It really depends on the shape of your ears
549,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible sound, it's just missing a little bit of bass even when you are totally covered with the Earphones,
I gave four stars because the isolation isn't perfect it can be such as 2/3, what's pretty good...
the earphone's cables seems to be robust...
Thanks Amazon for the quick delivery of the product... I'm really satisfied."
550,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic IEM's. I use these for live performances, and I love how discreet these are, while being so comfortable!"
551,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best in ears ive ever used. Love them.
552,5.0 out of 5 stars,"just got these today so i am still exploring, but first impressions are GREAT! i've had a couple other sets of noise-isolating earphones before but these WAY outperform the others, both in noise-blocking and in sound quality. (most recently i had a klipsch set with comply foam tips for extra noise reduction.)

the SE215s come with several different sizes of foam ear buds so you can find the perfect fit. bonus feature to that is the fact that the units swivel on the cable. so far, for me that means they seem much less likely to yank out of the ear. (used to happen to me a lot, hasn't once yet...)

sound is crystal clear and balanced. (i use the 'bass booster' setting on my ipod, for whatever little bit that does. next i'll be adding an alpen DAC headphone amp once it arrives in the mail.) and i commute on the NYC subway, which is loud as hell from screeching turns/breaks and rattling metal to loud-talkers and generally large amounts of white noise. but today i listened to music i could NEVER enjoy before and the environment faded right out. in fact, there's enough reduction that i might advise people who'd be in danger if they couldn't hear something of their surroundings to get a different product.

another nice feature is that the units are detachable so that if your cable bends/breaks, you don't have to throw out the whole set. just order a (cheap) new cable, swap, and off you go! this was a selling point for me, along with the strong reviews, as the last two sets i've had both went bad where the cable enters the earpiece.

one feature that's not a negative, yet, but might get tedious: the cable is rather long, so from ears to unit-in-pocket there's a lot of slack. maybe enough to get annoying/caught on stuff or tangled. maybe not, we'll see...but it's definitely longer than the other sets i've had. for whatever that's worth...

another possible drawback is that the cable is just the 'raw' wire with a very thin clear coating. this seems to increase the sound-in-ear of the cable rubbing on clothing, etc. (the klipsch come with a cable coated in special ""no tangle' rubber that was a lot quieter against fabrics when the cable moved around.) so far this isn't a disaster--and the 'naked' style of the cable looks cool--but it proves to be the only negative i can find so far. certainly not enough to make me wish i'd chosen another product!"
553,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product great service
554,5.0 out of 5 stars,comfortable after a few weeks. took me a little bit to get used to them but they are great other than that.
555,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these last February and by July I had to replace the cable cord, after replacing the cord a month later the right headphone gave up. The sound is good for the price but sadly the quality doesn't last."
556,5.0 out of 5 stars,"(that I've tried)

I mostly listen to full sized phones but wanted a pair of IEMs for working out and for days when i don't want to lug my ah-d2000's to work.

I started out with the thinksound ts01. It had amazing spacial details but was all bass, few mids and hardly any treble. (costs less than se215)

Next i tried the Sennheiser ie6 (costs more than the se215)they had the mids that i missed in the thinksounds but were veiled from the mids onward.

After the Senn's broke I switched to these, priced between the aforementioned models i found the to have the most balanced sound signature. They don't really play up into the highest treble regions, but they do have better treble than the previously mentioned phones. The mids are the real star of the show on these phones, but the bass is HUGE when the seal is right. These phones literally have some of the best bass ive encountered. huge and full while maintaining punch and clarity. they lack the depth of the senns or thinksounds but they have much better balance. They dont come close to my ah-d2000's in depth or clarity but those are full sized cans at 3 times the price so its not a fair comparison. I do prefer them to my 7506's though.

Being as the sound tube goes kind-of far into the ear, im not sure id want more treble anyway, any sibilance is bad sibilance in that sort of situation.

The isolation on these things is crazy good, and could be dangerous in the right circumstance (jogging by a busy road would be out of the question). outside noise can barely get in, with music at even low volume you cant hear a thing."
557,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Exactly what I ordered. Sound is great. Only drawback is that it takes a bit of time to figure out how to wear them. I use them to run in. They work great. the cord is a little long, but I just tuck it into my shorts."
558,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As always, these in-ears are the best"
559,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only pair of headphones you will ever need. I replaced an older model of Shure earphones and very happy. Clear sound, great fit. Always purchase Shure and very happy with their products. Top quality and good prices."
560,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the way these headphones fit. I can bike, run with no problems. Also these headphones perfect for subway commute as they block all noise. I would not recommend using them while biking in the city or any area that you may need to listen out for your surroundings. Bass quality is great on trance and rap tracks; however, it can be distorted when I listed to Rammstein."
561,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these earphones for about a month now. I don't know if I would consider myself an audiophile, but I enjoy my music when it sounds good. When my old pair of Sony earbuds fell apart, I decided it was time to step up to an entirely new level of earbud sophistication. After some research, I decided on the Shure SE215, which had received many favorable reviews. Plus, at roughly $100, the price was reasonable compared to other kinds of headphones out on the market.

Ultimately, the Shure SE215s are the best sounding in-ear headphones I have ever heard. There were, however, a few initial problems with these earphones. This next portion of the review is going to sound overwhelmingly negative, but bear with me!

The first problem I had with these earphones came down to comfort. For the first week or two of ownership, the SE215 is a difficult headphone to wear comfortably, and finding an easy way to wear them is a long and awkward process. The SE215 is shaped quite differently than any other earphone I have owned, and therefore resulted in some unique kinds of ear pain and fatigue from even the briefest periods of use. The cable on the SE215 is designed to curve up and over the ear, which was once again completely different from any other earphone I have used. Problem is, the cable is quite rigid and will not curve around the ear easily. In fact, it took me a good three hours before I had found a way to keep the earphones in my ears without the cable falling off and bumping into my cheek, which was annoying. Then, after I found a way to keep the earphones in my ears, the next issue presented itself. They sounded terrible, alternating between a slightly ""tinny"" sound with no bass and having the right earphone muted in comparison to the left earphone. This was confusing, because the SE215 was supposedly the best sounding earphone in the world for the price.

Now, any sane person would be asking themselves why I gave these earphones a perfect 5/5 if I had such a rough time with them. Rest assured, there is a light at the end of this tunnel. Allow me to explain.

The ear pain and fatigue is common with any new kind of earphone. As mentioned before, I have owned Sony earphones over the years. I remember each one of those headphones bothering my ears for the first few weeks of ownership. Eventually, your ears just get used to the new earphones, which leads to lessened pain and fatigue. After a month or so of regularly listening to them, the SE215 no longer fatigues my ears. They are actually rather comfortable. The cable has also limbered up a bit, making it easier to fold up and around my ears than before.

But the biggest improvements have to be attributed to the foam ""sleeves"" included with the SE215. These headphones come out of the box with six pairs of interchangeable ""sleeves,"" which are the parts of the earphone you insert into your ear. Three pairs are rubber, and three pairs are made of a fragile foam. Having no experience with foam sleeves, I immediately attempted the rubber sleeves. I am not too sure why these earphones come with rubber sleeves, because they are largely useless. The rubber sleeves refused to stay in my ears and made the earphones sound awful. So I moved on to the foam sleeves, which were a revelation. Not only are they very comfortable, but the foam sleeve really allow the Shure SE215s to work their magic. In order to work properly, the instructions state that the earphones must have a good seal against the outside world. The foam sleeves provide that seal, leading to a sound experience that rivals even the audiophile-spec Sennheiser HD 595s I use for serious stereo listening. The foam sleeves are fragile, though, so handle and replace them with care.

The Shure SE215 really is a fine piece of audio equipment. They sound phenomenal, easily matching much more expensive headphones and outclassing everything I have tried up to this point in my life. There are some initial problems, but these problems will either go away over time or can be erased entirely by using the foam sleeves. I would not use them for exercise, but that's what a cheap pair of earbuds are for. I highly recommend the Shure SE215 to anyone wanting an amazing earphone."
562,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used the SE425 at a larger venue and they were awesome. Of course I couldn't afford those at the I ordered the SE215-CL, but for the money I can't beat them. I am well pleased. Shure you're the bomb! Thank you!"
563,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best earbuds I've ever had. When i received them i dropped everything i was doing to open and use them. Bending the wire behind your ear is a bit tricky and took about 2 minutes when I first opened them but now it takes me about 2 seconds. I plugged them in my phone and turned it to max volume and closed my eyes and I was transported to a magical place, I would compare it to the scene in Ratatouille where the mouse eats the cheese and he trips out on them, it was like that but music. It comes with several different buds 3 sizes of foam and rubber 6 total pairs and a tool for cleaning the wax and taking the buds off (I think that's what i use it for I don't know what else it could be) the wire is very sturdy and the plastic is clear so you can see the silver and bronze wires inside it as well as the internals of the bud itself. They are the best noise cancelling earbuds I've ever had, they tune out noisy high schoolers and anything else you could think of. The sound is unlike anything I've ever heard. I love being able to feel the vibrations in my ears from my obnoxiously loud music. Overall, these were one of the most worth it products I've ever purchased and would recommend it to everyone."
564,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband uses it for drums at our church and he loves the sound isolation he gets with these
565,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones for this price. A wide scene. Very detailed sound and vocals. The deep bass. The treble is a little small. In general, a good product from Shure.I am pleased, I recommend."
566,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sounded really good until they broke 9 months in. The ear bud snapped clean off while it was in my ear, very bizarre. I'm considering it to be a fluke and will re buy due to how much I enjoyed them prior."
567,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall reasonably good sound and they appear to be sturdily built. However the bass, touted in the promo blurb, is really not all that good, And, I do use the expandable ear buds. I have less expensive earphones with as good or better bass response."

569,5.0 out of 5 stars,"favorite IEMs for the price range, great warm sound, and super comfortable with the foam tips"
570,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these headphones every day while using shared transportation. I appreciate them because they block out the noise of other people talking and any other annoyances. They isolate to the extent that you might not hear the person in the next room calling you. Expect to replace the foam tips after less than a year, but the price is reasonable.

Having come from earbuds where the cable doesn't go over your ear, I was somewhat worried about comfort, but these are comfortable enough that you can sleep with them on. They cable is well made and has lasted over 6 months without issues, and won't end the life of the headphones if it breaks.

Audio quality is warm, as the charts show. I recommend EQing the treble up somewhat if you like a more balanced sound, as I mainly purchased these for isolation. After EQing, these are well worth the price when it comes to audio quality."
571,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap price for such amazing quality. I have Bose IE2 and the wire broke. Bose said I can purchase a new set at a discounted set for $70. I no and I ended up with the Shure. Best decisions on in-ear headphones I made. They fit great and does not come loose a d they also sound amazing. The Sure has a more ""life"" feel to it then the Bose where it has a ""flat"" feel to it. I also use the Comply foam so sound isolation is really good. Better then the Bose IE2.
I won't even compare them to Beats because its not even fair for Beats. Comparing Shure to Beats is like comparing a finely tuned supercar (Shure) to a turbocharged Civic (Beats).

The SE315 was another one I was looking at but I go though headphones quite easily just due to all the travel I do and the amount of usage I use them for, $200 was a bit much for me to spend but the SE215 was in my budget and they are amazing. The fit does take a little getting used too but not too bad."
572,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound Quality
Since the moment you hear decent music with the SE215 you notice an amazing quality, crystal clear, sharp, deep bass but not too much, and perfect balance across all music genres, I've tested it a lot with FLACs, Audio CDs and good quality MP3s and the sound quality is amazing.

Sound isolation is very very good, I will not use it for outdoor sports, nor walking on the streets, sound isolation is really that good.

Build
Is feels strongly build, and even though I've just had it for about a month, it feels is durable and will last several years.

Fit
This is why i'm not giving it 5 stars. My ears gets tired after long use, just putting them on is not simple and are not that comfortable. One point in their favor is that I can see myself walking, jumping, moving a lot and the earbuds staying right where they are supposed to be.

To summarize it, I'm quite happy with my SE215s and I would recommend it very much. I'm an audiophile and love music and this is quite a return for my money, as sound quality is awesome."
573,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these back in 2011 as emergency/backup in-ear monitors but have also used them when I run and workout at the hotel. These have lasted quite a while and sound great... heavier bass/mids are to be expected with the number/quality of drivers that Shure puts into these suckers... that's just what you get-- not a huge deal.

What does start to be a huge deal is the cables-- I hate, hate hate the swivel ""feature"" of the cable. Anyone can tell you, and I'll attest that, that these cables are terrible and will fail eventually. I tried contact cleaner, rubbing alcohol, etc and did due-diligence cleaning these. Still, the cable has given up the ghost and I've had to purchase another. Considering I've gotten five years out of them (I've gone through two sets molded ears during this time) I'm pleased with the quality and sound."
574,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pro: I've owned variety of earphones from different brands over the years ranging from Sony, Skullcandy, to Bose. The shure by far has the best sound quality out of all the pairs I've owned. The bass is punchy but not overpowering and the highs are clear. The mids blends in well in between. The build quality of the earphones is good, very sturdy. It is very comfortable to wear and fits very snug and gives excellent isolation. I travel by subway everyday and these help create my own world amidst the hecticness of the loud background noises.

Con: Now I will say something about the cables. I maybe be of good quality but it is way too long. Many like their cables long but these are unnecessarily long. The ipod and/or the phone sits insides the pant pocket that's less that 1 meter from the ears. It does not need to be so long that there are excess amount of wires hanging outside of the pocket. As mentioned above, I travel on the crowded subway everyday with lots of people and the extra hanging wires would be a hazard as it can get damaged when it gets caught on other people's cloths or bags. Other than that it's a great pair of earphones."
575,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent earphones. These are wonderful sounding and do an excellent job of blocking external noise as well. I bought these to be my sweat resistant monitors. I use them for workouts and for yard work. They drown out bad people at the gym and almost completely block my lawn mower. The cords are a bit stiff, but that does not warrant a negative in my mind. The only con I would give is that I am a bit on the tall side, so I could not wear my device on my hip or in a lower pocket. Easy recommend in my book."
576,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I should start off by saying that I am not an expert on headphones, and don't have any data to back up my opinions, but I have owned quite a few pairs of headphones/IEM's over time (enough for my family to make fun of me.) The other headphones most recently in my rotation are Bose Sie2 for working out, Bose AE2, and Audio Technica ATH-M50. The Bose AE2 are supremely comfortable, but just don't sound that great. The Bose Sie2 are great for working out in that the cord is so conveniently short, and they stay in regardless of the rigor of your activity. And the M50's sound better than any other headphones I've ever owned, with their highly accurate sound that lets you hear everything in the recording. So where do the SE215 fit in?

In my use the answer is every time except when I'm working out or sitting at my home desk and in the mood for high accuracy. I find myself reaching for these IEM's constantly. They are comfortable and easy to put in your ears, and they sound great. And I'm saying that as someone who appreciates M50s for their accuracy. These IEMs are certainly more exaggerated in the low end, but I find that to be necessary for IEMs considering the environments I use them in, plus it's just fun to listen to.

They also block an incredible amount of sound, so that I feel that I have no need for big sound-cancelling headphones, and I can easily tune out or even not hear noisy environments around me. They come with a nice carrying case that is easy to get the IEM in and out of. This once again makes them great for carrying everywhere. And finally they are very discreet, especially in the clear color, which can sometimes be convenient."
577,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update 9 July 2014:
I have had no end of problems with the left ear bud cutting out. A little wiggling and it would work, but it would cut out again shortly after. I thought it was the end of the ear bug pushing against my ear canal, sealing the end, but it was not. It ended up being a poorly fitting connector on the ear bud. I took a very small screwdriver and bend the center pin just a tiny bit and it now they don't cut out anymore.

After living with these things for three months (I wear them 1/2 hour a day, at least), I am no more excited about them. I have managed to bend the wire near the ear bud to get them stay in better, but I find the wire will flip around (off of my ear), making them want to come out again.

I also used a paint pen to paint a red stripe on the right ear bud so I can tell which is which. Shure should have done something like this from the factory. The tiny red dot they put on there is difficult to see, especially when light is poor.

The rotation of the ear bud makes a big difference is fit. Unfortunately, rotating the ear bud changes where the cord exits, and affects the fit, so some wire bending and trial and error is required to get the fit right if I rotate them. While these ear buds can be made to fit OK, it ends up being a project, and I don't want a project to wear ear buds. I have never had so much problems with ear bud fit before.

It's really too bad, as the basic concept of a good sounding, passively sound isolating ear bud is a great idea. I use them when in the garage -- they double as a music source and hear protection in one. It's an idea that worked very well in their previous versions.

Original review:

This is my fourth set of Shure sound isolating headphones. They have historically died by the insulation cracking after a year of two. I was excited to see that they updated their design - removable cables and the extra layer of insulation around the ear gave me hope that they would last longer.

What I did not expect was that they fit has changed drastically. I have worn the previous generation for countless many hour stretches when working. I've worn them on many 12+ hour plane rides. I have never had any significant complaints about the fit for the previous generation models. This generation is completely different and don't fit me well at all. The right ear manages to stay in, but the left doesn't. There is a lot more bulk of rigid plastic to this model and if they don't fit your ear, too bad, they will fall out. I understand that everyone's ears are different, but dealing with that is the name of the game when making headphones.

On top of that, the extra insulation around the ear makes the cord very stiff, which makes them more prone to falling out. I was looking forward to the extra insulation, thinking it would help longevity, but if they fall out all the time, then it won't matter.

I suppose these will be my last Shure product."
578,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound quality. Very happy with the range. A little tough to get the fit right, but once you do you'll be very satisfied.
The cords are thick and beefy. I like that because they don't bang around and give me artificial sounds. They feel like they'll survive longer than a few months.
Pretty decent sound isolation. I use them mostly while traveling to drown out the noise of my fellow passengers. Work like a charm.
I've tried them while walking the dog and won't dot hat again. Too efficient at isolating the noise. Couldn't hear the ambient noise well enough to feel safe. I have a different headset for that anyway so I'm concerned. Just wanted to try them out.

I'm not an audiophile, but I was impressed with the range. Sounds aren't muddy but there is ample bass. Clear midtones."
579,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always had a difficult time with earbuds breaking. It didn't seem to depend what brand or style I got, beats, skullcandy, random brands, they all performed the same; breaking after a few weeks or months or in the case of the beats 3 uses... I am not hard on headphones, in fact I treat them reverently and have many audiophile quality over the ear headphones that I love including Martin Logan, Bowers and Wilkins, and Senheisser. But for some reason beyond my understanding, earbuds tend to fall apart at my merest touch. Not the case with Shure. They are perfect (once you figure out how to put them on, which for some people takes a while to figure out), with amazing build quality, durability, and sound production. You may hesitate at the price tag, but to think of how many pairs of useless headphones you could go through and how much money wasted, it is a no-brainer. Go with these and stop wasting your hard earned money on garbage."
580,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Im not a audiophile, so I wont say much about the sound quality. The vocal is pretty clean. The build quality is really excellent. Its comfortable, but the stock ear tips are not really good for long hour use. (I'd suggest getting the comply foam tips)"
581,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality and fitment were fine, the cable broke within 6 weeks of usage."
582,5.0 out of 5 stars,you can't buy a better sound than sure !!!!!!!!!
583,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound was great. Did not last 6 months.
584,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fits perfect, great sound for the cost. I use them to play live, totally isolates the sound. Long chord, useful for playing at home connected to my Line6 floor POD."
585,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound in as advertised--balanced, nice bass, great definition of all instruments, no complaint there. But, they are a bugger to get fit into the ear correctly and then move the cord over the ear easily. Once the wrangling of the cord is done, they are fine. If you are planning on using these a lot to work out with, as I do, be prepared for some issues with how the cord hangs and cups or forms behind your ear. Otherwise, for any other activity, sweet headphones."
586,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality when listening to voices. Eliminates pretty much all external noise. A little awkward with the over-the-ear cord, but overall not an issue. Ear buds are very comfortable and can be worn for many hours."
587,5.0 out of 5 stars,"By far the best pair of IEM's I've ever owned. I've been through Bose IEM's and Klipsch X10's and these are by far superior and are only $99 right now. Buy them, you will not be disappointed. The bass is incredibly rich sounding, I'm no audiophile but I love great pairs of headphones. I was hesitant about the cable being placed over the ears however they feel great and the cords do not brush against your cheeks like other head phones."
588,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great isolation. Great cord. Bass does bleed through the mids a bit. Use an amp with a. Eq and it can be cleaned up. But a well built set if iems with good low end.
589,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Basically, I agree with most of the positive reviews here. Going strong at 2.5 years!"
590,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is defintiely good, no complaints in that department. However, these are probably the most uncomfortable feeling headphones i have ever used. I have tried using all different sizes of the foam and rubber earbuds that are provided, and none stay in the ear and just feel very intrusive."
591,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exceeded my expectations and more comfortable than my other sets of in ear headphones. Deep but realistic sound.

Be sure to follow instructions on wearing earphones carefully."
592,5.0 out of 5 stars,work great.
593,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought 11 pair and 4 didn't work right and 1 has since quit working. This is a lot of money for earbuds that are not going to last.
594,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality in this headphones is (Ok) i don't like the bass at all it makes them sound a little muffled. And the peace of plastic that goes around your ear it's uncomfortable....
595,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones I own!
596,1.0 out of 5 stars,In less than a year the sound in the right earphone is barely audible. For the money I thought these earphones would be better quality.
597,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these, great sound isolation & perfect for iem"
598,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones! durability is questionable, both the left and right channel went out on me."
599,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is great but the problem is the cables are too stiff, sure I can replace them but that's an addition cost. It's difficult keeping them in place, keep falling off. Gonna keep looking for the right pair that sound good and will stay in place. I want to hear music not spend my time keeping them in place."
600,4.0 out of 5 stars,I had an issue with the cable breaking about 3 months into my usage. It wasn't really a problem since I didn't use that one anyways. They sound very good to me and I was pleased with the price to performance on this.
601,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Some of the best sounding dynamic single driver headphones around, these are worth every penny and sound better than monitors I've tried with multiple driver layouts... The low is full and open the midrange is present and clear and the high end is smooth, maybe a bit attenuated but still clear... they are not trebly. I really like the frequency response of these, mostly flat with just a little high end roll off in the ""tinny"" frequencies that will not matter to you at all.

Build quality is great. I've had a pair of these for over a year, I feel like they just sound better and better the more you use them. Sadly I lost them recently, I think I was digging in my pocket for something and just didn't realize when they fell. I Immediately bought a new pair...

They do require a little break in, after leaving them on at mid to mid-high volume for 12 HRS the low end and low-mid frequency response filled in quite nicely.

I love the long cable it comes with, and it prevents tangling, also when you're walking around a lot with a coat on it makes it easier to put the cable under your coat (especially longer coats on men) and take your media device out of your pocket without any pulling or having to adjust something down by your pocket. You can bring you device up to chest level easily without pulling out your earphone... definite plus.

Again on the cable, these do not come with a mic cable but you can get one separately. Highly recommend these, especially if you're a music junkie or musician. If you're going to use them as stage monitors check you're impedance and you might want an EQ especially if you're a singer."
602,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great, but are challenging to fit into my ear correctly."
603,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Looked at so many headphones, even the bose noise cancelling headphones and earphones. Honestly, the 215s are not noise cancelling but with music on, YOU CANNOT HEAR ANYTHING BUT YOUR MUSIC. It does a great job at giving you a great music experience. The 215s are lasting, durable, great sound highs and lows, and they are cheap compared to bose."
604,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very happy with these earphones. I sleep with earphones every night. I prefer ones with memory foam since they are, in my opinion, more comfortable. I had been buying inexpensive ones and they were becoming harder to find and broke easily. I would end up buying new ones approx once per month. The SE-215-K have been great. Because of the low profile design, the part that rests on the outside of your ear does not push into the side of my head when I'm sleeping. They block out more so therefore I can keep the music I'm listening to at a lower volume. I love the fact that they come with multiple size buds in both foam and their ""soft flex"". The fact that you can also change out/replace the cable was the main reason I decided to try these, since that is the part of the previous earphones that have failed for me in the past. I've been using the SE-215-Ks now for four months and have had absolutely no problems with them and and extremely pleased! I was hesitant to spend the money on earphones, but decided since it's something I do use every day it was worth the investment. In another two months time I would have spent the same about for cheaper ones that I would need to keep replacing. These, I will have for a long time."
605,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these in April 2015. Used it sporadically, today the right earbud is intermittently working, looks like the cable connection to the earbud does not make a solid connection anymore. Regular usage, I did not snug, tagged or pulled on the cable. Just poor design. Just looked at other 'one-star' comments and I see others had same issue. With so many positive comments I was thinking they've worked out the issue. The warranty expired on May 23... Don't recommend!

Updated 24 Septermber 2015:
found out via shure web site the product has 2 years warranty if you happen to live in USA. I've sent in the Earphones describing the issue and got a new cable 4 days after. Quick service, did not get charged, seems that earphones work."
606,5.0 out of 5 stars,Way better than my old Bose IE2 in-ear headphones that fell apart due to its cheaply-made wiring. Have only had these SE215 for a few hours and I am highly pleased with the sound and quality upgrade.
607,5.0 out of 5 stars,Affordably perfect
608,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent
609,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Company and product, EXCELLENT!"
610,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is excellent, I couldn't ask for anything better in a pair of ear buds.

The draw back is that it is a nuisance to put in your ear."
611,5.0 out of 5 stars,For my live sets
612,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these. I use them for personal use and on stage. Higly recommed them. Great sound
613,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and external sound cancellation. Could be more comfortable. I like how small and portable they are.
614,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound great nice and clear and fast delivery .
615,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these in December of 2014 and after 2+ years they are still going strong. Every weekend, I play in venues that require in ear monitors. And when I'm not rehearsing or performing, I use them while I practice so as to keep the wife off my back....""It's too loud""....blah blah blah. :-) I'm just a lead guitar player and I don't sing, so I do not need a custom set of IEMs or one's with more than a single driver.

The only thing I do not like is that I have to replace the foam tips often because they wear out. I recommend picking up some of these, in your appropriate size: Comply Premium Replacement Foam Earphone Earbud Tips - Professional P-Series (Medium, Black, 3-pair)

Overall, the quality is good enough (for me) to use as a professional yet cheap enough to replace if they ever get lost or stop working. 5 stars!"
616,5.0 out of 5 stars,just love it
617,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
618,5.0 out of 5 stars,I own the 535s also. I wanted a second pair to leave in the car. I smile every time I put these in. They are 90% the quality of the 535s.
619,4.0 out of 5 stars,They sound fantastic and the music sounds true. They have proven to be durable so far. I also like that they are very inconspicuous.
620,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Came in good condition, it was to be given to a friend and he loves it for an entry level."
621,4.0 out of 5 stars,Been looking for sometime for a good set of ear buds that would work for my motorcycle helment. Finally.... been very pleased with them so far
622,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am really struggling with these earbuds. Audio quality is great but, I cannot get them positioned so they will stay in my ears. Slight movement and one, or the other, or both, will pop out. Then they are difficult to reposition."
623,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They're good headphones. Overall quality of how they're built is great. But my complaints are they are not worth 100$. They do sound great, but not 100$ great. I wanted to get some headphones that would replace the ones that come with an iPhone 5. And compared to those, these are not much better in my opinion."
624,5.0 out of 5 stars,sounds awesome!
625,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You won't find a better set of earbuds for the price. They have just a very slight bass boost which is nice, otherwise they're pretty neutral in sound reproduction. Shure has a real winner with the best value in the market!!"
626,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Our family has always bought Beats. I wanted to try these to see if they would fit my ears better. I love these headphones! They fit great, sound amazing and are very durable. I would highly recommend these to anyone. Plus, they are a great value. I would by this brand again!"
627,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They don't escape Shure's history of weak cables around the ears (mine didnt tear or stop working but you could deffinantly feel the cables coming out of place), but they sound good and are comfortable. I would recommend to a friend."
628,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great! My son is 18 and he has had all brands and he really likes these! The said the base is good!
629,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound great and fit nicely under a motorcycle helmet (if you are careful enough to get it on).
630,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is phenomenal, their really really comfy and beautiful. The only issue I had was that it was pretty hard to take off the pre-installed tips I ended up ripping one to take it off, it didn't really matter because I didn't like the fom tips."
631,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe one of the best sound isolation in the market, great for in ear monitoring live, also great prices for us musicians on a tight budget"
632,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent, and all claimed to be!"
633,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great bang-for-buck. The different tips and case are great.
634,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For someone who typically has issues with the fit of in ear headphones, Shure has been the best for my money yet. I had the older model which fit great and was concerned buying these since they changed the style slightly but was pleasantly surprised. Also, for those not wanting to pay the extra $ for noise cancellation, even playing these at low volumes drowns out almost all background noise."
635,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It comes with a variety of sleeves, I found the large foam ones the most comfortable. It takes a while to get used to putting them on, just know that youll spend 10-15 seconds just fitting them into your ears, but its definitely worth it."
636,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am wearing them now loving it
637,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are very comfortable, it sounds amazing and the noise reduction is incredible, highly recommended"
638,5.0 out of 5 stars,As a pop punk drummer these earphones do an amazing job blocking out my kit while delivering great song clarity! these earphones get the job done

641,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these today and the build quality is great and they sound amazing, the only problem was that I couldn't find a way to wear them without them pressuring my inner ear and causing pain after 30 minutes ish of use. Had to listen with one ear to avoid my ears getting sore. I have used a few other regular types of earbuds (i.e., ones that you aren't meant to wear with the cable behind your ear) with no problem and I don't think my ear canal is irregularly small either. Perhaps I just have to find the right position for it to stop causing so much pressure and stress but it seems like an inevitable problem given how huge the earpiece is. Will give it a week or two to break in and get used to but unless they suddenly stop being uncomfortable I plan to return these. Was really excited too :/"
642,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Shure and after wearing out my last pair, I was excited to get these. The sound is still great, however, it is a pain to get these not only in the ear but to stay in the ear. Not designed well at all. Only 3 stars due to the design and stiffness of the cord."
643,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound amazing battery life.
644,3.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using these for several hours since they arrived and they sound amazing but these rest on the cartilage of my ears which after about an hour make my ears sore.
645,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound GOOD. My struggle was figuring out how to put them in. There is no clear guidance on that - the diagrams are not big enough to comprehend. Also, if the chord was made formed to bend around the ear, and marked R and L, that would be very helpful. I find that once I bend them, they fight me. I use them for performance, and I think I have to fiddle with them more than I'd like. I do like their durability, and the way they are reinforced at the fork. I like the texture of the chord and the length. I purchased the clear chord, and I like the way it does not call attention to itself. I would recommend that you get the built in mic, as the inserts are noise canceling, so if you're on the stage, you will not hear other non-mic-ed voices. I did not, and I know there are drawbacks to that feature, but they may be worth dealing with."
646,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These Shure IE2s are awesome. I tried the Bose IE2 headphones prior to buying this pair. The Bose had lots of bass but seemed to be missing the high and mids. These Shure headphones have both the punchy bass of the IE2s and crisp, bright mids and highs. I had the Shure E2Cs and Bose TriPorts prior to these. The Shure IE2s are quite an upgrade."
647,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn't fit great on first try, but changed foam ear pieces to find the ones for my small ear canals. Now they stay in and give me the a great experience paired up with our Avion monitor system. Thanks!"
648,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound AMAZING. They're great for when I'm working out, as they don't get in the way because I wear them alongside my back and underneath my shirt. The way they hook around your ears and the rubbery piece to tighten the cord around your head means they don't come out unless you want them to.

My only slightly complaint is I wear glasses sometimes and these are a bit tricky to use with those. The headphone cable either makes my glasses slightly uneven or I can't adjust my glasses if I put the cable on top of the glasses. Minor inconvenience, but it should be noted."
649,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With the first time that I put these earbuds on and turned on the Ipod, I was hooked. I have also used them as stage monitors in a band. No complaints, well worth the price."
650,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most of what you hear about these buds is true. They are excellent with all around great sound. A little rolled off at the highs but beautifully warm with big sound. I've had the previous version prior to this and there is a big improvement to the sounds quality. Great choice for the average to discriminating listener.
651,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really good quality, sounds amazing, if you use with Fiio E6 or E12 sounds incredible clear and decent quality. Buy one you can't go wrong

Only part which may other new buyers needs to watch out is how the ear pears sits inside your ear some May found. really uncomfortable, but works excellent for me.

Over all I will give 9/10 for this product."
652,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Package crushed, right ear doesn't work"
653,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is ok, for the price, quality of material used is good. Difficult to insert compared to my old Shure, and the wire is way too long, uncomfortable to wear overall."
654,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect. Honestly what I was expecting. Isolated any and all sound around me so all I hear is the musicians and my drumming in the in ears. I love them.
655,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After getting used to winding it around your ear, it works great. I am hard of hearing and must wear hearing aids. These allow me to hear the vocal mix from the pa board very clearly."
656,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these headphones. Blocks out any ambient noise and is crystal clear in the sound. I can only imagine what the next level up must sound like! Overall, a great bargain for what you get."
657,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great, and the slightly longer cord really helps onstage."
658,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't like the in-ear headphone before because my ears get itchy after a couple minutes. But this one doesn't. Works great on iPhone 6s, I mainly listen to jazz and balance is great."
659,5.0 out of 5 stars,No joke. These are quality headphones.
660,4.0 out of 5 stars,For the price you cannot beat it. I bought these earbuds to use when I ride my motorcycle. The negative profile provides ample clearance between my ears and the helmet. I would rate the clarity above average.
661,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely fantastic.
Best in-ear headphones I have ever come across-- great detail in the whole range of frequencies. Fits comfortably and, most importantly, the isolation is superb. This set has better isolation than most studio monitoring headsets I've tried."
662,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son loves this product. It seems to be worth the price.
663,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these inears! I got them for my inear monitor to use on stage at church and end up using them for everything from flying to listening to my ipod. I think I get a second pair for personal use and one for work.
664,4.0 out of 5 stars,sound is perfect but to handle these things/ getting in and out of our ears is a painindabutt even after 1 year of use

666,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best ear phone I ever bought, if you like a deep base these are the earbuds to go for"
667,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to tell which ear and around ear never stays in place.
668,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these over a year ago at this point and have been using them daily. I am very rough with things, and have been impressed with how long these have lasted (most headphones only last me 4-5 months max). Excellent sound quality as well. I couldn't recommend these more."
669,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphone love them
670,5.0 out of 5 stars,They have a nice even sound. Very well built and durable. I bought them as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves them.
671,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using typical skull candy and default apple brand headphones for all of my life, these things were a huge step up. I am very please, the quality is amazing. It is like listening to all of my favorite songs for the first time. It muffles out other sounds extremely well, the fit is great, and the quality is perfect. Users should know that these are bass heavy, so I wouldn't get them if you don't like the enhanced bass. But who doesn't love enhanced bass?"
672,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound no is the best
673,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros - As I've come to expect of all Shure earphones, the sound quality on these babies is excellent. And the noise isolation is as it should be. I'm no audiophile per-se, but I personally can't settle for less than this kind of quality in a set of earphones.

Con's - Compared to the 115's and 210s, the 215's construction is a bit trickier to learn to fit properly. But once you get used to them, you can come to appreciate their ergonomic form."
674,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really good headphones, very comfortable! They block most background noise and have never fallen out for me! The reason I didn't give it five stars is I would prefer a little more bass but overall the sound quality is very clear."
675,5.0 out of 5 stars,thanks
676,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound great while they work which was 6-8 months of daily use of 8 hours a day. Can drive them hard till you can feel them shaking in your ears. Right channel dies. Really wish it hadn't cause they are great cost to performance
677,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and I can hear them on my Harley. Highly recommend.
678,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Shure buds (SE535) with this cable sound better than any other Bluetooth alternative out there. Thanks Shure!
679,5.0 out of 5 stars,Doing pretty good so far.
680,2.0 out of 5 stars,"While they sounded great, my daughter used them for iPhone/iPad earbuds. They have not been subjected to the harsh conditions these are known for and does not yank/pull the cable. And the only device has been her iPad as of lately. Well, three weeks ago, they stopped working. Based on the reviews, I bought new cables. No joy... as the earbuds are still not working. For paying nearly $100, I expected more. Sorry, Shure - won't be buying anything more w/ your name on it."
681,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones has lasted me longer than any other set of headset I've used. I used it daily for working out and travel for 3 years. It took a moment getting used to, but I love them! They're a little long, but that allows me to have movement and the phone stored in my pants pocket. no problem.

I seriously I cannot hear anyone or anything unless my ears pick up the noise through my body. Superb sound isolation. I feel isolated and focused.

Sound: great! Even better with the foamies
Design: durable and moldable.
Price: more than willing to pay it. 3 years of a good product

Mine started to cut out... I have been through hell with them, but I think I wore a connector at the joint by smashing them often in a work out routine"
682,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful, balanced sound. Six different foam kits are included (three sizes, foam and silicon each). Great build quality. Unfortunately they were not a good fit and the foam plugs did not come off for me. There are instructions out there telling you to put the things in a freezer and stuff, but that was not quite something I was prepared to do"
683,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well first off I am no audiophile so probably couldn't tell teh difference between Mozart and Cher. Well maybe those two but I'm no professional. Saying that I think the sound they produce is pretty good. I also liked my Skull Candy Titans but they seem to keep hiding on me.

Now for the design. Figuring out how to install them took a while. Yes I used the work install instead of put them in because that seems more appropriate. After doing it a couple times though it seems easy enough. I normally just used the regular ones you just push in the ears so the wrapping the cord around the ear part took some trial and error.

In the questions there were some concerns about using them with glasses. While I would think they would be a big problem based on how they fit, they are not. They seem to work just fine with glasses.

Phone cases. This is one area I had a problem. The case on my phone and tablet did cause some issues though. The jack does not fit them. I already had a solution though for my tablet which was a short 3 inch male to male cable with a female to female adapter on the end. Adds some bulk to the cable but otherwise works ok. It would be better if they could redesign the plug to have more clearance.

If the plug was designed better I would probably give them 4.5 stars. If they didnt wrap behind the ears I would give them 5 stars."
684,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To be honest, these are the earphones you can get for the price! Sound quality, Build quality, and packaging is all top notch!
Lets start with the build quailty! When i first recieved the product and realized that the product was made out of plastic, i thought it wasnt going to last however, i have dropped it, i have dropped it in water, it got covered with sweat while exercising and it held up pretty well! I legit abused the product and it held up just fine.
The sound quality is just phenomenal! The bass is deep and not to boomy and not to over the top, the bass it produces is the type of bass that lets you dance. The mids are bright and crisp and emphaize on the vocals of a song which makes makes it feel like a large sound stage. The highs are not as crisp and clear however are decent and dont get in the way!
In conclusion, for a 100$, these are the best pair of earphones you can buy while still looking amazing by showing all of its glory and guts!"
685,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure SE215-K Sound Isolating Earphones with Single Dynamic MicroDriver

Excellent! Too well built but break-in quickly. When I first plugged this into my Samsung S6 I was sad with distortion. Also hated the stiffness of the heavy cable. The earbud cable has a bit of memory wire but not too much. Distortion soon disappeared (I guess a little break-in period is always necessary). After 2 days the cables are also loosening up and more flexible. The sound of these DRIVERS are satisfying but EQ is always needed for different ears. I prefer to set my EQ and then lower the EQ PRE Level by half - which seems to make less fatigue and safer in ear volumes. Not all media player apps allow changing your preamp (at eq) but aside, these buds are keepers, perhaps as my primary set.

I find any in ear buds need the foam tip. The shiny clean silicone tips .. bite in my opinion. These buds with foam, fit into the ear and stay there. With silicone, they fall out for me anyway.

These in ear monitors have a two year warranty which explains the heavy construction. Again - its very usable and becomes flexible quickly.

My set came with EASILY removable connector at the driver.

Recommend."
686,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Buy these! Buy these now. Stop reading and buy them. Less than $100 and the sound isolation and sound you receive is well above any competitor that I have tried and I have tried many! The fact that they make a wireless setup now to use the existing earphones...sold! Shut up and take my money. I have been a fan of Shure headphones for at least a decade now. They do not disappoint for running, mountain biking, during a work out whatever really. Long cord is the only is awesome but must be managed but like I said, wireless setup if that is a problem for you."
687,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, but have a little trouble getting the ear position right. Love the sound isolating ear pads, but the ear position seems to be off and causes discomfort after long periods of use. I frequently fly long-haul flights (8 hours plus) and find that these cause pain after about 4 hours of use. If I adjust the fit and twist them forward in my ear, it relieves the pain...but they seem to slip back into the painful position after just a few minutes.

To clarify, these are shaped to fit inside your outer ear canal. The best fit for me is when the cord exits my ear at about the 9 o'clock position, and then loops up over my ear. However, the natural weight and pulling of the cord, rotates the earphones so that they exit at the 11 o'clock position causes pain after a while."
688,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I knew based on reviews from Amazon and audiophile websites that these would be a good pair of headphones, but I didn't expect nearly the fidelity these have.

Real bass and fine treble, I'm hearing things I've completely missed. As my typical speaker test, I hook these up to a greatest hits station. Songs that everyone has heard a million times in the car, in your headphones, and on home stereos, so you get a great comparison from what you expect the song to sound like.

Definitely have a great clarity. On Sloop John B, I was hearing backup vocals and parts of the harmony that I'd totally missed before. On Walk like an Egyptian, I heard stress and cracking in Susanna's voice that is covered up on your typical car speakers."
689,5.0 out of 5 stars,"not 5 star more like 3 but read to find out why, they only really show 5 star reviews but honestly these headphones were okay but not worth the price or hassel. The sound was okay, not the best and not the worst but expected more since the price was so high and i thought they would be good and i even bought two pairs. That is something i regret, honestly not worth a buy, in order to change the ear pads u had to grab it, twist and turn n pull iy off and it damn near destroys the one you ate pulling off plus they arent too comfortable in the ear, it gives me a headache sometimes but any headphones will do that when you were them too long and they dont stay in very well plus really confusing to actually twist the thing to figure out had to get it in your ear. So in the end i recommend some sony headphones like 40 or50 dollars worth, dont spend too much cuz at the end of the day the headphones can only sound so good plus theyre just headphone use your money on more importany things, trust me i bought two of these and i wish i hadnt."
690,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the best product that I have ever put in my ears. I have owned everything from beats to bose. These top them all. I would really suggest buying them and dropping the rest. The cord is extra thick and doesn't like to tangle. great!!!
691,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Hard to insert, don't fully block outside sounds because you can't get them completely in your ear canal unlike the older SE models."
692,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound...as expected. I had a pair of e2 and wore them out.
693,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality! Great clear sound. Fit is perfect it has several alternatives. Plug can be tricky for somw devices since it has a 90degree angle. Color code is very useful for detecting which ear bud is right or left.
694,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is not nearly as good as the reviews I had read prior to purchasing, and the over ear fit was cumbersome."
695,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very full sound, nice clarity, not sure how good it is for runners. One side kept coming out as my ears got sweaty. Great for in-ears for musicians at church."
696,3.0 out of 5 stars,Really difficult to get in my ears. Sound was average
697,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Alright you guys. These headphones, how can I say it.. They are fantastic. At least they are now. I went and bought myself rubber tips for my refurb SE-215's (the SpinFit CP800, if you're curious) and not only do I now get a fantastic seal on the monitors, no, the sound quality (particularly the bass) has significantly improved! The monitors are able to distinguish very clearly between instruments, and avoid the mushiness that is often a problem with cheaper corded and cordless versions (and some very expensive Bose-products). The resolution at which they can fill your ear-holes with noise is fantastic for both the price, and the size of the driver. They are more evenly tuned, giving less oomph in the bass department as many would prefer, but the bass these headphones sport is exciting in its own way. Precise, and not mushy or overbearing.

So, if you are regretting your purchase, or are still undecided: The 215's are excellent monitors, without foam tips more so than with. The foam tips take a lot of the crispness and precision away that make these monitors so amazing."
698,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure still provides a good quality product...priced right too

Older models have more bud adaptors and kit is included also."
699,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great IEMs for the portable audiophile!
700,3.0 out of 5 stars,these headphones have a good clarity of sound but the lower sounds are really weak. my old $50 sennhiesers were better. these definitely were not worth the price
701,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound incredible, but the bass is subpar. Maybe it's because I'm used to such bass heavy headphones, but these almost make the bass sound muted. They're also quite uncomfortable. Can only wear them for around two hours until my ears start to hurt."
702,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently bought a pair of these headphones because my power beats ear hook broke after 2 years of heavy use. So what does a person do when they broke there headphones buy new ones right ? I go on Amazon and mind you 2 pairs of headphones before my power beats I had bought a wired version of the 215 so I had a wired connection for the 215 ( I thought just in case I want to go wired I have the option , but mainly bought them for Bluetooth) so I had an extra wired connection. Package arrives I go to unbox it and I get both pair of earphones on the Bluetooth cable and yes on the Right and Left side. Press middle button on remote part of mic , Headphones pair icon replaces Bluetooth icon ( iOS ) and on right side shows battery life so I am thinking ok it's connected. Squuzes Foam on earbuds to put them in my ear and began to test out my pair New URE SE215SPE-W-BT1. I hear the head ones say paired and battery percentage but only the right side works !!!! Me thinking out I must of done something wrong right ? I read the manual and go through everything again and still nothing so I am ok let me get my wire connection to see if it's the earpieces ? I connect Both sides and they Both Work and sounds sooooo Good way better tham my power beats hands down . So I go online to see if I am the only one with this problem and turns out I am not. SURE please make sure your cable work before you send them I love the product so much I pretty much just kept them because I have a wire connection to make them wired and they sound so amazing plus I have no headphones. I hope to resolve this issue with SURE because if not I am going to look elsewhere for Bluetooth headphones such as the air pods but I would stay with SURE in a heartbeat because it's a better sounding product simple as that."
703,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great. 2nd pair purchased. Great sound
704,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A little weird to get used to as they're so different, but worth it."
705,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product and sound isolation. I'm using this for an in-ear monitor system and it is fantastic.
706,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best wireless earphones on Amazon. I would buy these again!!!
707,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Warning: If you use these, you will not hear anything outside of your ear buds / music.

This is why I absolutely love these ear buds. Work extremely well when you are in a noisy environment and want to hear nothing but your music. The audio quality is better than any other ear bud I have used before. Definitely worth buying."
708,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a pretty great pair of earbuds with a rich sound, but I just couldn't deal with their wear design. Maybe it is because of my long hair, but they were horribly uncomfortable every time I wrapped the wire around my ear. I had to return them a day later."
709,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very difficult to put on. Also the ridiculously long and thick cable.
710,4.0 out of 5 stars,Above-average
711,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Both the earphones which i purchased, came in good packaging and the sound quality was awesome. Good amount of bass, music clarity was awesome & the isolation from external sounds is damn good, as the ear buds contours to your ear shape. Wires are good and thick. Suitable for both indoor and out door use too as the wire goes behind your ears and wont slip that easy."

717,3.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones themselves are great and work wonderfully but my package was missing the different size ear bud pieces that fit to your ear so I'm stuck using the large ones that came on it. :(
718,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this set better than my clear pair!
719,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: These make the world around you silent. I went from Beats Studio's with active noise cancellation to these and the difference is dramatic. Sound quality is great.

Cons: They hurt my ears when I first put them in, but I got used to putting them in and taking them out."
720,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I know that it is unfair of me to review a product that I didn't even get to use, but this product has given me an absolutely dreadful experience. I didn't see any other review about this issue, so I am stepping in to warn others about it.

After removing my product from its packaging, I discovered that the stock sleeves (foam) had fused to the stem of the earbuds. I took to the Internet, searching for solutions. Even after trying increasingly aggressive methods (including freezing the earbuds), I was utterly unable to remove the sleeves. Rather than coming off, they have torn, and their remnants still wrap around the stem like a glued-on sheath. It is unacceptable for this to happen at this price point.

Even if you're not dealing with a completely fused sleeve out of the box, it seems that many people have difficulty switching out the stock sleeves (so much so, that it is a known issue: http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3788/~/removing-earphone-sleeves). If you are considering this product, and want to be able to customize the comfort of the device, know that you face a hurdle right out of the gate. I pray that your experience goes much smoother than mine.

***Edit***

Ordered a replacement pair after experiencing the difficulties outlined above. On the new pair, I was able to (not easily though) get the stock sleeves off and find a set of sleeves that best fit me. Now, after actually using the earbuds, I think that they are pretty good. The fit might bother some individuals, and putting them on certainly is not intuitive. But those are minor issues that disappear after some practice. The much more likely deal-breaker is the sound quality. The sound quality takes a little getting used to. My previous earbuds were the SkullCandy Heavy Medals, which lasted just shy of a full 3 years, and survived heavy use. When I fired up the Shure earbuds, I was a little disappointed. The Heavy Medals have better lows and have higher volume (keeping volume settings neutral--which is not that big of a deal; easily fixed by turning up the volume). But, after giving the Shures some extended listening, I found that they gave me a better sound in general. I now prefer the sound of the Shures to that of the Heavy Medals. That said, the Heavy Medals are fantastic earbuds, and I recommend both of these products. I feel as if many earbuds emphasize bass, since it has such a tremendous effect on the listening experience. So, when people try to upgrade to higher quality earbuds and find that things are a little tinny or ""reduced,"" they are ultimately letdown. If you are a bass-head, you probably won't like these earbuds. But, if you want a very well-rounded listening experience, these earbuds shouldn't disappoint.

As of now, I can't speak to the durability of these earbuds, but they feel solid enough."
721,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound.
722,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound and great sound damping I would highly recommend them at this price point I find it hard to believe they can be beat.
723,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked my Etymotic headphones, but I am in love with these Shure. Much stronger bass, they are more flush with my head so I can take a nap with them in, and the overall sound is incredible for the price point. Definitely worth the money."
724,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If your looking for earphones that sound great and have nice bass, then these earphones are a great choice. They are very comfortable but only if you put them in your ear properly. At first they seem weird because they are different from other earphones that I have worn but after a few days I found out how to properly put them on my ear to fit very comfortably, and this position also gives you the best bass. I am very satisfied with these earphones."
725,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great for moise reduction and sound even better.I'm a singing drummer and am very pleased with this product.
726,4.0 out of 5 stars,"High End-ish, that is. Had them for about four months.
Sound quality is so much better than Skull Candys, Apple earphones/""earpods"" (or whatever they're called), those cheap earphones you get at 5below or Walmart... I can't go back to those after using these because they sound just terrible.
I appreciate that it comes with a carrying case and has all the different sizes buds. They stay in my ears much better than Skull Candy earphones, though I've always thought those were a joke anyway. BUT, they do still fall out sometimes. Seal is good, and I'm using the correct size buds (I think) but they just do. Only reason they lost a star for me is because of that."
727,5.0 out of 5 stars,Received my headphones in a very timely fashion and and really pleased with what I got. They sound amazing and are really good quality. Would totally recommend.
728,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm used to owning cheap $40 earphones so this one required a bit of diving into the pockets, but it's worth it. For the price, the sound quality is unparalleled. I literally cannot hear a thing when I am listening to music. I also use it on stage as I play in a band and the bass packs a good punch. Considering it even has a two year warranty, I consider it one of the best investments that can be made."
729,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones. Awesome. After about 2 months, the sound stopped working in the left ear. AWESOME!!!! *sigh* I mean, the sound quality is really great, but if I'm gonna pay $100 for these things, is it too much to expect them to last me quite a while? $100 is a lot to spend on something that will only last me 2 months."
730,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound good and definitely isolate. Putting them in takes some getting used to. I don't use them daily, so it's not second nature yet. Singing on stage, I've been mostly using only one, which worked great in that particular setting."
731,4.0 out of 5 stars,Everything the description says. I use them everyday and the construct seems very durable. Its just a bit annoying trying to put them on because of the way the wire are coiled above your ears.
732,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these earphones for use while motorcycle riding. Any rider knows that wind noise can be very fatiguing, and I was looking for a way to combat that while still being able to use my in-helmet communication system. For the price, I think these achieved the desired result pretty well. The sound quality is surprisingly good - certainly good enough for the road, which allows me to turn down the volume and still be able to hear clearly. I have ridden 14 hour days with these in and they remain comfortable, and I am noticeably less mentally fatigued. I have not experienced any distortion at higher volumes, but this could be because I can't turn the volume up loud enough to try without killing my ears. I love that the cords are quick disconnects and that the potion that connects directly to each ear phone is wrapped in a shielding that retains its position once bent, which makes getting a full face helmet on easier to achieve (although it does take some practice the first few times).

On the negative side of things, the cord for this is much too long. Figuring out how to stash all that cord will be an initial frustration. I didn't knock of stars for this, though, because I'm using this product in a manner that was not intended. I did knock off a star; however, for the foam pieces that insert into the ear. I have two complaints: 1) they don't retain their shape well enough, which means that if you don't put them in exactly the same way every time, you're going to get some unwanted noise. 2) The foam becomes slippery as you sweat inside a helmet. Again, I know that I'm using them for an unintended purpose, but this is aimed at musicians. For those of you who have never been on stage, we musicians sweat... alot - those lights are much hotter than one would think. My point is that I would consider this issue to be an issue regardless of the fact that I'm using them on a motorcycle. This issue doesn't affect me much, as I always wear a full face helmet, so the helmet holds them in my ears; however, I could see riders who ride without a helmet or who ride with a half helmet having greater and greater trouble getting the earphones to stay in their ears over the course of a long ride."
733,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sure mines came defective as I can hear static when listening, but I also noticed the earphones have great background sound but the singer's voice sounds far and hollow. Not worth $100 My Image S4 earphones sound better and they're only $40."

735,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had a lot of headphones. Everything from Sennheiser over ear headphones, to Klipsch in ears, a few varieties of Koss headphones and even Skull Candies in my younger days. I can say that these are without a doubt my favorite headphones that I have ever owned."

737,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For it's price, the bass is powerful and tight but not overwhelming. The Mids are decent although not as warm as I would like. The lows are decent and the highs are very clear. Overall, the best $120 I spent on earphones. It competes well with earphones twice the price but wearing them takes some getting used to."
738,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones provide fantastic isolation, and very directed sound. When I take them out, even if they're blasting, you can barely hear the music coming out of them. Well, in my office. YMMV, of course."
739,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, Have had the for 2 years and I don't see them faltering any time soon."
740,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best earphones you will find for $100.
741,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved my last pair of Shures so much, I decided on another pair after trying other less expensive options. None of them do such a good job of noise isolation as the Shures, period. And the sound quality is very nicely balanced, not too bright, not too boomy, just right. And the replaceable cables make these the very best value hands down. No buyers remorse here."
742,5.0 out of 5 stars,works very well - a noticeable improvement in design from the last set that I bought in 2008 (the old version's cables are cracked up and there was no way to replace the cables so i like the new design of replacement cords).
743,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome quality. Fair price.
744,5.0 out of 5 stars,Professional Sound at a Modest Price....well made with Replaceable Cables...
745,1.0 out of 5 stars,"i really wanted to love these, but after a couple of days, i have to send them back. i have the SE215 wired, and also the 315 wired. they were amongst the best headphones i've ever had... and when i found the bluetooth wires for the SE215 drivers, i jumped on it immediately and couldn't wait until it arrived.

so first the pros:
- the drivers are solid, fit in my ear like a glove
- the wire itself seems to be solidly made and looks like it could withstand some daily commute abuse in NYC.

the cons: from the moment i put them on, the music consistently cut out in the left ear, only the left. the right sounded great... now if i can just get both ears working. when worn around the neck and the drivers over the ear, the microphone fell right below my ear. i thought that was a bit strange and the cable too short, but gave it a go. the result was horrific. the voice being transmitted sounded as if i was using a cordless phone from the 1980s and i walked too far away from the base. the static was louder than the actual voices, and when the voice actually came through, it was garbled or sounded robotic. i thought it could've been a defective cable, so i switched out the driver onto the second pair i purchased... same result. actually, it was worse.

i'm now returning them in hopes that Shure will step up and fix the issues, and lengthen the cable so one can actually talk into it rather than have it hidden behind the ear."
746,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this on stage as an in ear monitor and it worked great. Going to buy another one for another musician.
747,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These aren't reference grade, but when it comes down to it, they are good enough."
748,1.0 out of 5 stars,Left side fail just from factory! Poor quality! Shure come on!
749,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love em !!!! Amazing sound and clarity. Using these in my worship band at church, on stage. Cheaper than most, but couldn't ask for better sound. I highly recommend these to anyone performing on stage or just lookin for an awesome earpiece for an ipod or mp3."
750,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound so smooth........it's like being on stage or in the studio!!!!
751,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's hard for me to find earbuds that are comfortable for any extended period of time. These aren't perfect but they have great sound (clear highs and mids, and enough bass to support both) and are plenty comfortable while traveling around. I haven't taken them on a plane yet, but on buses/trains they do a great job of reducing outside noise."
752,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent, just what I needed."
753,3.0 out of 5 stars,He seems to like them. They are a major step up from what is included with the iphone. Would recommend them again and again.
754,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are amazing. I love the sound quality and how they wrap around the ear. I recommend them to all my friends who ask about a good headphone to buy
755,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality. These won't cancel out sound, but they do cut down most of it. Good bass as well. I am a machinist and a drummer. I don't need to blast the music to clearly hear it."
756,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this ear phone a year ago and used it during travel and workout. The left speaker stopped working after a year. Sound quality was good and was comfortable to wear. Disappointed with the quality that it did not lasting longer.
757,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good sound...
758,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality and shipping!
759,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Takes some time getting used to the fitment, but audio is great for the price"
760,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If your an audiophile, this is the best headphone in its price range! The clarity is incredible! The details are definable from its 22.5Hz to 17.5kHz. I am a musician and I wear these daily in the moments of when I'm in transit.

If I could change one thing, I do wish it had a highs extending to 20kHz, but nonetheless, totally satisfied with these."
761,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was pretty disappointed with these. Special ordered them for a work-related music event to use them with a sound pack at a show. They fell out of my ears during the entire gig. Ended up returning them.
762,4.0 out of 5 stars,great sound for the price though ears get sore with long use
763,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these to sing with at church and I can't hardly hear anything that isn't going through the speakers. Sometimes good, sometimes bad 😉! But I can hear the music really well, so it's great to sing with."
764,4.0 out of 5 stars,better sound than the bose one. I bought it for my husband and he was pretty happy about the sound quarity.
765,4.0 out of 5 stars,I looked around for a relatively affordable quality pair of headphones and saw this product reviewed a couple places online. After receiving these I carry them everywhere with me - I'm addicted to the quality of sound they provide and how well they reduce incoming noises from other sources. I use for sound monitoring at home while editing as well as while I'm out listening to Pandora. For me this was a great purchase.
766,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these about 3 hours ago and am truly impressed. I purchased them mainly for working out and they excelled with staying in the ear. Not once did I need to adjust them, which is something I was constantly doing with previous earphones. Great sound and they stay in the ear!! My wife tried them and now she wants a pair. Don't hesitate on purchasing these little gems!!"
767,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a former Bose ""over-the-ear"" user, I decide to give these a try after my Bose headphones literally fell apart after nearly 10 years of flying every week for work. Bass response is better, noise canceling is better, no batteries, less bulky.. what's not like? Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"
768,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome, they work wonders when I'm playing the drums. I can keep them at a low volume and not worry about blasting my ears."
769,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not sure why my experience seems to be so different from the majority of the reviews here. I bought these based on a recommendation from someone at a local GC and the reviews here. Here are my beefs:
Sound: I find the sound to be thin, very little bass.
Fit: I have tried all the buds and cannot find one that just feels right for me. They always feel loose which might contribute to the sound seeming thin. The over the ear design is somewhat odd for me.
Sound Isolating: this is the area where my experience is really differnet from many of the reviews. I would not classify these as sound isolating at all. I wore them on a plane flight the other day and frankly I felt they blocked no more noise than a cheap pair of skull candy's that I have.

Overall I'm glad I had used a gift certificate on these because if I had paid full freight for them I'd be even more disappointed than I am now. I'll probably just use these at work and try to find a decent pair of noise cancelling headphones elsewhere.

**Update**
Well I feel kind of stupid. I just couldn't understand why these things just never felt right. Well, I had them in the wrong ears! I noticed one had a very small red dot on it and I thought that maybe meant right, but it just didn't look like it would work in the right ear. After working on it a bit, I got it in and it fit and felt much better, making a large difference to how it sounded. Still not ""sound isolating"", but pretty good. So now I upped my review to four stars and will see how they do the next time I'm on a plane."
770,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile but these headphones are awesome, sound great and isolate the noise."
771,5.0 out of 5 stars,love these headphones for their quality and durability. i definitely recommend these as the minimum to any appreciator of fine sounding music.
772,4.0 out of 5 stars,"LIked: The sound quality is incredible!

Disliked: The way they wrap around your ear. It's like I have to figure it out each time I put them on. LOL it's just a small thing but it kept me from giving them 5 stars.

I'd definitely recommend these!"
773,5.0 out of 5 stars,Delivers great sound and ear buds stay nicely in ears. They provide a nice carrying case and extra ear cuffs.
774,4.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely a good value. Great alternative to over the ear headphones. Decent bass response for the size and cost. Blocks outside noise as well as in ear noise protection.
775,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like these for both listening as well as wearing for some gigs for in ear monitors.
776,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is ok, but they're extremely uncomfortable, at least for me."
777,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Truly sound-isolationg - can't hear anything but the music or movie when they're in my ears. Nice bass and range that will be appreciated by a music lover. This is one of Shure's ""entry level"" earphone sets - but still great quality at a great price. This is my second pair - hubby borrowed the first set and misplaced them. Glad I purchased another!"
778,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't even sound as good as a 25 dollar pair of Sony earbuds. Do not purchase.
779,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I could not get these to stay in my ear no matter what sleeve I tried. The over the ear cables were so stiff, they would not bend to fit, and would then pull the earphones out of my ear. Didn't get to see how they sound."
780,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple the best at its price range.
781,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Clear precise sound, but bass is accentuated a little too much and it's hard to get a complete seal."
782,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality is godly especially for the price tag.
783,3.0 out of 5 stars,Is the little uncomfortable for you here
784,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are some fantastic IEMs for the price...
785,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The good:

Decent job of blocking outside noise. Not great, but decent.

Once you manage to get them in your ears, they're not going anywhere (unless you tug on the inflexible cord, see below.)

The bad:

Sound quality is very poor. I'm no audiophile and can't use all the fancy sound descriptions that professional reviewers use, but I'll try my best. I listen to a lot of power metal and heavy rock. Vocals are generally fine. Drums have some decent punch to them. *Everything* else in the midrange and treble blends together into one muffled, muddied mess. These earphones make the instrumentation lose every ounce of subtlety. I've tried it on three different audio devices. I've tried messing around with equalizers and treble/bass sliders. Nothing helps at all. I don't necessarily expect perfection here, but I've had $20 earphones that sound three times better than this.

Speaking to less important features: it's a small challenge to get these properly settled in your ears, although this may be easier with practice. The cords next to the speakers are particularly stiff, making it difficult to get the curve around the ear, too. The cords end up going over the ears and look really dumb (I wouldn't normally care, but it's insult to injury). The unit as a whole is rather heavy, especially around the ears; it's difficult to forget you're wearing these.

For all the good reviews and professional recommendations, this is a profoundly disappointing buy."
786,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Used these 4 times. The left headphone went dead, then the right. They are totally useless now"
787,2.0 out of 5 stars,connectivity is spotty. Bulky and gets in the way.
788,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought what I thought to be a nice set of EIM for a 2 month trip through Asia as I wanted something more compact than my over ear noise cancelling headphones. These headphones had problems almost immediately. They are quite comfortable and do a good job blocking out sound but they hardly ever work. Sound only comes from 1 ear the majority of the time and I have to fiddle with the cords to try to make the other ear work. Hoping this is an isolated issue and Shure will be willing to replace them once I return from my trip. For now I am stuck with some crappy headphones for a rather hefty price though.
789,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good isolation, good soundstage, nice sound separation, a lil bit of lack in bass, but definitely worth the money. They're also kind of weird to put on, but you get used in a couple of days."
790,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great for the money. These would make wonderful studio monitors. They block out a ton of sound. I can't even hear my mechanical keyboard as I type (i can always hear it). The sound these things make is great, nice and even albeit a little warm. I'm not a basshead but there is a tad of bass emphasis on these IEM's. The sound signature is warm, like I said, and because of this the treble is not that poppy. The treble is the only downside to these, but if you are looking for a nice mid-tone IEM than look no further. If these are to expensive, you might want to take a look at the v sonic vsd3s or vsd3. As for build quality, i would probably have faith putting this cable through a blender. I like how long the cable is, maybe not the most convenient for using with a phone, which buy the way can drive these, but still great in the long run. The addition of the detachable cable extends the lifespan of these earphones indefinitely, given that you don't overdrive them. I've tested these with a few songs most of them being chillstep (lossless quality of course): Odesza, say my name; The Glitchmob: carry the sun; Blackmill, friend; and Muse; MK ultra. I would say these headphones are great performers for the price category, slightly better IEM's are available if you have 20 or 30 more dollars, but the detachable cable is an amazing feature imo. I gave these 4 out of 5 stars because the lack of rich treble (don't worry its still there and sounds great its just not as emphasized as I would like, maybe not good for a lot of pop music) and also because my 215's weren't packaged correctly from the factory.(This is probably a purely isolated incident.) Amazon did a fine job with packaging, but it looks like the machine that puts the IEM's in the plastic blister part scuffed up the foam ear-tip and damaged it, it doesn't affect the quality of the music or the seal at all (thankfully). However, i think this might decrease the lifespan of the tip, but it is no big deal as as the 215's come with silicon tips as well. I found that the silicon tips give punchier bass while the foam tips provide more isolation and maybe a tad bigger sound stage. I think the foam tips are also nicer because they have a small filter that prevents debris from going inside the housing. Overall, great buy, probably the best earphone for greater durability and good sound quality at exactly 100 dollars. If you want insane sound quality, look elsewhere, maybe the westone line; however if you value durability slightly more these are great.
Update: these are not great for people with small ears. I'm a guy with tiny a$$ ears, smaller than some female's. These do leave a sore spot in the back of my ear after about 30 minutes, still great, guess I'll have to get a tough spot there.Also negative profile fit is great for sleeping."
791,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just purchased these for the third time. I've also held off on buying a new iPhone because I have yet found any Bluetooth or lightning cable headphones I feel would match these. I use these in the gym, and they not only cancel all outside noise out but sound fantastic. The only negative is they don't last forever. After two years of heavy gym use including a lot of sweat one of the headphones started shorting out."
792,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Help! Instructions were unclear. I don't know how to remove it from my ears.

Really though, fits perfectly, comfortable, the cable seems strong and durable. The detachable and rotating plugs should prevent damages to the wiring, common in all earphones I had till now. It's just too well built, can't phrase it in other way.

The sound. It's crystal clear throughout all ranges. Clean bass, clean mid, clean treble. Haven't experienced saturation at any level. It's also very loud, compared to my HyperX Cloud, which I wear over it for comm. It is also very responsive, you can boost the bass and it will not hurt the trebles as much.

It's expensive, but it's by far the most clean, responsive earphone Ive had."
793,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, I've been using SE215's since 2012 and I'm more than happy with them in every way. I use them every day for extended periods and for running and they're comfortable and enjoyable each and every time.

The one downside is with the clear material used in the product-- it's less flexible then the black version and over-time (this has happened three times with me) the connection where the cable runs into the sheathing on the thicker/protected area of the piece that rests on the ear becomes damaged.

I'm sure if you carefully put it away in the case after each use this wouldn't happen to you, but I use them daily and feel that I use them as a regular user realistically would after the first week of ownership. Even with that downside (I invest in the replacement clear cable, or get a new set each time it happens) I'm happy because the clear ones are less obtrusive, especially if you're wandering around with them in a work-place. So even with that issue, I don't feel it's worth knocking a star."
794,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones as usual from shure. I bought this to use with my SE535.
BUT the wireless cable is way way too long, super uncomfortable when running or training in the gym,
It bounces, it tangles, all bad!! I don’t recomend it for any kind of training, just regular listening.
Also the Bluetooth is not very good, I use it behind the neck and I lose connection all the time.
Not worth the high price."
795,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Firstly this pair of earphones are rather comfortable. They fit very nicely flush into your ears so using them while lying down on your sides is not a problem (something that I do quite often). This is compared to the UE triple-fi 10 which really sticks out and makes you look really weird too.

Sound quality wise they are pretty much one of the best in this price range. They are not flat or neutral sounding, the sound is slightly coloured, more towards the bass side of things but I feel that that makes it a good pair of casual earphones as flat sounding earphones tend to get fatiguing to use after awhile. So if you're not an audio professional and just using this for your daily commute it does a fine job.

However if you're the running with music person this is not the pair of earphones you want to wear while exercising. Even though the removable cables make it easier to change cables that have worn out, the connectors between the cables and the earphones are another point of failure that has been introduced. Sweat can get in easily to wreak havoc with your earphones and I have a pair that suffered a loose connection but Shure's warranty took care of that nicely.

The cable's 3.5mm jack is also L-shaped and kind of large so if you happen to use it with your phone that has a case with a tight opening for the audio jack it might not be able to fit.

Despite some shortcomings I still believe that for this price this are the earphones to get. In fact I've gotten an additional 2 pairs as gifts for friends and the feedback has been very positive."
796,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had Westone W20's (three sets). All purchased directly from Westone (trying to avoid Amazon's CA sales tax). All failed within the warrantee period. On the last set one of ear piece cases simply fell apart - lost the other case half so couldn't glue it back together! The other two had cable and electronic issues. Fidelity was okay with the Westone's but they kept falling apart. Frustrating! AMERICAN made? Hardly!

I now have a set of Shure SE215-K's and they are GREAT! Much better cables! Better construction! Very comfortable! The fidelity is as good as Westone, IMO! My music voice is classical guitar, Celtic instrumental and some ""new age"". They all sound wonderful! Not too much bass and not too much treble. Well balanced for my music choices! I don't use the foam sleeves preferring the Soft Flex silicone sleeves - they work great! To each their own....

I wonder what took me so long to wake up! Guess it's my devotion to the idea of ""American Made""."
797,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so glad Shure created this cable. I currently own the 3.5mm which came with my se215 special edition in-ear headphones. I also purchase the lightning cable that I really enjoy, but this is exactly what I was hoping for. Love this cable, sounds great and the controls work very well with iPhone. The inline mic also works very well. I couldn't be more pleased."

799,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're going for noise isolation, these are by far the best headphones in the $100 range. After going through a pair of Beats Solo, Bose MEI2I - or close to that model, and another pair of Klipschs I found the Shures to be outstanding in the sound quality and isolation traits. A few notes below.

PROS
• Complete noise isolation. Really, you can't hear anything if you have them in and 25% volume on your phone or computer
• Cable is long and can easily reach wherever you have your computer/laptop/phone/etc
• Cable can be routed behind head and there is a slider that will hold the headphones tight to your ears
• 3 different tips shipped with headphones for personal fit
• Extremely durable cord that can be replaced, swapped for different color separate from the ear piece

CONS
• After wearing them for 6-8 hours, your ears will get tired. I've never encountered a pair of in ear headphones where this wasn't the case"
800,3.0 out of 5 stars,The cables wore out very quickly.
801,4.0 out of 5 stars,"very sturdy construction and flex ear buds are best I've used. Design of the ear piece takes a bit getting used to, but snug once adjusted"
802,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty comfortable and a great alternative to the stock mobile headphones. Having a case is a bonus.
803,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Delivers powerful and rich sound amazingly. However, it's not comfortable at all after wearing for 15 minutes. Beside that, it will take you a while to wear them, not that easy to wear and make it fit perfectly."
804,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelent.
805,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound insulation is way better than the Bose SoundTrue..maybe it's because of the foam tips. The wires are really thick and feels tough, would be better if Shure could offer a clip."
806,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and great price. I love using these headphones. They block out enough sound for practice and live applications. Awesome low end and wide range sound.
807,4.0 out of 5 stars,These fit under my motorcycle helmet and stay in place well.
808,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can ditto the responses here. I play bass full time and these things sound great. If you are looking for a way to not go into the red buying gear for your gigs, I would look at these. They sound fantastic. You can certainly spend a lot of money on ears, but for the price these are more than usable."
809,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, hard to place in ears."
810,5.0 out of 5 stars,they sound great and block out the noise.
811,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best earphones I've found. This was a 2nd pair to replace a set that I lost.
812,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First pair of headphones that cost more than $20 and I am so glad that I bought them. Noise isolation is fantastic, and the sound you get for the money is phenomenal. Highly recommend these to anyone."

VERY pleased, and VERY well made."
819,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelent
820,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality of these earmuffs may be outstanding but the sheer size and awkward feeling when wearing them really limits their use. Not headphones I would wear while engaged in any physical activity or on the move.
821,5.0 out of 5 stars,These have been great earphones. Awesome sound quality for the price. They have been sturdy and reliable on the go during my transport to and from work. Different sized ear pieces and carrying case are a nice touch too.
822,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it so much just wish it had controls for volume and pause and play buttons
823,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If your looking for an above average ear bud that will last, you can't find a better deal. Quality!"
824,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have you ever though “I need better headphones”? If yes, the Shure SE215 Sound Isolating Earphones are some of the best you can buy. These headphones will fit every need you have surrounding headphones. They are made with quality materials, have amazing sound quality, and fit extremely well. Also, the Shure SE215 headphones are considered to be relatively cheap when compared competitors.

SOUND
The sound quality of these headphones is extremely good. These headphones have a much brighter sound compared to competitors and preform well with any kind of music. Many headphones are not produced with range that the Shure headphones are produced with, which is why these headphones have a much better sound quality. These headphones also offer sound isolation. This is not the same as noise cancelling headphones as the do not emit any frequencies to counter act any noise surrounding you. However, these headphones fit extremely well and provide a high degree of sound isolation, the ability to block out noises from the surrounding environment. This sound isolation is better for sound quality because you only get the frequency of the sound and not the frequency used to cancel outside noise.

FIT
These headphones do not fit like normal ear buds; they wrap around your ear. This is not something you think will be better than traditional ear buds, but that is not the case. Because they wrap around your ear your headphones rarely come out of place. Also when being active, it provides extra support and a firmer hold. The Shure SE215’s also come with a wide rage or tips for the headphones so you can be sure they will comfortably fit in your ear.

QUALITY
Unlike most headphones these are made with high quality materials. The cord is made out of braided steal covered in a resistant yet foldable plastic. This means the cord will not rip, tear or break in any manor. The part that wraps around your ear is made from a very thick plastic which holds the shape you bend it to. This is beneficial because when they are wrapped around your ears you do not want them to move. The tips are also very high quality. They are made thicker than usual so they are more resistant to tears and fit much better in your ear.

These headphones are great for everyone, but mostly specifically someone who is looking for an affordable upgrade. They have incredible sound quality and almost as high of materials quality. As an added bonus, Shure made the ear buds detachable so if one earbud breaks you only have to the part instead of brand new headphones. The purchase of these headphones comes free of buyer’s remorse and will blow you away!"
825,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great audio quality & comfortable to wear
826,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband is a professional musician and he uses these for mixing and for live performance and they are a great price for the ear phones which are comparable to these.
827,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bass is bit weak but noise cancellation is quite good.
overall a soild earphone and I have yet to have any issue with build quality."
828,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these earbuds. I've been using them almost daily and if they ever wear out, you can bet I'm investing in another pair!!"
829,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excelentes headphones, usarlos es absolutamente adictivo porque (en la medida que la fuente de sonido sea de buena calidad) se escucha TODO lo que hay para escuchar.
Son bastante aislantes del ruido exterior, al punto de generar cierta desconección de lo que pasa afuera.
Definitivamente los mejores headphones que he tenido."
830,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love Shure! Very comfort and great quality for the price.
831,1.0 out of 5 stars,"pros
- i had the ear piece things already (broken cable)
- charging w/ regular mini-usb

cons
- would forget about paired device once-a-week, the little voice would say 'connected' but the phone didn't think so. a power-cycle to get back to training mode would fix things for about a month, and then...

- the voice would say 'connected' but the phone didn't think so and no amount of button holding / pushing / etc would power-cycle until the battery died. charging would let me re-pair to my phone, but it would get back into the same cycle of the device thinking it was connected but the phone thinking not and unresponsive to buttons / anything."
832,1.0 out of 5 stars,They only lasted a year before one of the buds stopped working. I was really disappointed. There not good for running.
833,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these under a motorcycle helmet: the sound is excellent and they are comfortable all day.
834,5.0 out of 5 stars,"VERY GOOD, SERVICE EXCELENT"
835,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best in earphones I have ever tried with great sound quality. I have used them for music, watching movies and gaming. The sound is very clear with awesome bass. I have had mine for over a year and they still work like new."
836,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love these headphones. They are great for their price range. Only complaint is I feel like every once in awhile I feel like something is missing in the audio quality, but I believe I'm expecting too much from this price range for that."
837,5.0 out of 5 stars,incredible headset with a premium look and feel. very comfortable after the awkward beginning phase as they are worn different than most other earphones. sound isolation is the best ive ever experienced and bass is strong and clear.
838,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wear these IEMs maybe 6-times a month or so as I play at church. This morning, I was greeted with a blown right ear monitor after 6-months of use. I hear SHURE is fantastic when it comes to warranty and they are a local company for me, so I have full confidence SHURE will take care of it, but I expected better performance. We'll see how the warranty claim goes...

UPDATE: I live in the Chicago area and so I brought my SE215s directly to SHURE. They changed out the bad ear bud and I was on my way in 10-minutes! Yes, the ear bud blew and I'm not sure why, but the customer service was impeccable. I am probably going to upgrade to 1964ears, but the great service makes me think long and hard about going away from SHURE. My first rating was 1-star, but I have upped it to 4 now...3.5 is probably more accurate, but I can't do half-stars."
839,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great beginning in-ears. Good sound quality. Only reason its not a five star rating is that they will occasionally slip out of your ear when performing. If you're looking for elite sound quality, dish out more money, these are not for you"
840,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use a pair of these for all of my general headphone applications (I have another set of cans for studio use though). These sound great. I was concerned with physical ear fatigue from wearing relatively heavy drivers in-ear, but I've had no such problems."
841,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only reason I had to buy new Shure ear buds was the fact that I left mine in the seat pocket of the airplane! The price is reasonable for the quality of sound you get, the fit, even for my small ear canals, is comfortable, and no ear fatigue. We travel almost every month so they do get a workout and they just keep on going!"
842,5.0 out of 5 stars,BUY THESE. Seriously if you're on the fence trust the good reviews. I'm buyer of in ears for years and wish someone had convinced me to get these much earlier. Impressive in all aspects. For the audiophile the soundstage could be bigger and the mid-highs/highs more sharp and sparkly but they're very crisp. Easily the best option under $150.
843,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very durable sound quality could be better 4 $100
844,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't workout with these, they will get messed up and are a hassle to put on. Other than that it's an excellent product just as advertised"
845,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones perform well but are unfortunately not as well made as they used to be. I bought my first pair in early 2013 and had them for 2 years before they failed, which to me was not bad as I wear these daily. I then bought a replacement pair of these earphones, but have found the quality to be tremendously worse this time around. After 6 months of use, the jacks where the cable attaches to the earphones have come loose. This results in me hearing an annoying knocking sound whenever the cable moves (which is all the time). Consequently 6 months in and I'm left with some very annoying headphones. Now I am stuck looking for a non-Shure alternative to replace them."
846,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound on these is very good. They are so uncomfortable and unwearable. The sound, again, is good, but it's hard to give a better score to something when I don't use them because they are so annoying."
847,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
848,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality was great but my left earbud stopped working after a day of use, pretty disappointed."
849,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite. Very comfortable and sound is fantastic for the price. This is my third pair. Don't ask... Lost one pair and dog chewed the other. Block outside sound moderately well.
850,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this for studying and sleeping (listening to a downloaded sound file of rain on a loop) in a college dorm setting and it works very well.
851,5.0 out of 5 stars,Out standing earbuds.
852,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good sound at a reasonable price, and am interested in possibly trying one of the more expensive models in the future."
853,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile, but I listen to music pretty avidly. After buying so many $10 buds that break every few months, I thought I'd settle on something better. I've owned my pair for about a year and two months, and they're still as durable as when I first got them.

As mentioned in other reviews, the sound is crisp and clear. The cord is a bit long, but it's thick and smooth, and doesn't become tangled easily.

What I'd like to emphasize on most is how comfortable these are. The fit itself is perfect once I got used to them. It did take a while to break in, maybe 2-3 weeks of moderate use - my ears would ache from wearing them after a mere 30 minutes, but now they sit comfortably around my ears and never fall loose (and most importantly, don't hurt to wear at all). Personally, the foam tips caused some pressure and discomfort to my ear canals, so a few days into owning them, I switched to the silicone ones (problem solved!) and haven't gone back.

These are completely worth the investment."
854,5.0 out of 5 stars,That's good
855,2.0 out of 5 stars,BE WARNED: The cables break very easy. However Amazon was very good and have replaced them 3 times already.
856,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love that they share the casing and detachable cable design with the SE535, though like some of the other reviewers I too had an issue with the audio cutting out in one of the ears (left) due to what I imagine to be the detachable cable. I got around this issue by simply turning the cable 180 degrees and bending it the opposite direction around my ear and haven't had any real issues. I also bought the CBL+M+K cable for my iphone 4 which eliminated the issue as well, so it must be in the cable itself, not the actual connector. Either way, with both cables, they sound great for the $100 price tag.

They fit fantastic as well! I can't stand IEM that stick out to far, or buds that just rest in your ears. These offer as much isolation as any others, and provide decent quality sound for casual listening or even stage performance. They aren't super accurate given the single driver, and I've heard crisper highs and better mids... but again, at $100 I am very happy with them so far. There is PLENTY of low end if that's important to you, but low mids are a bit much on some records, but again... GREAT bang for the buck! I would have much rather bought the 535's or some of the much better Westone custom products, but the savings was worth it!

I would recommend these to most anybody looking for a decent IEM for iPod's or stage monitors... again if accuracy is important, you will have to spend more."
857,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are well-priced, have nice sound insulation options, and most importantly provide excellent sound. The bass response is a bit more accentuated than some may like, but it can easily be EQed down, and it isn't boomy or sloppy."
858,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simply excellent.
859,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for several years now, still going strong, no problems."
860,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using this product everyday for months now. It has amazing sound quality and bass and has great sound isolation. Also, it is pretty easy to hide while i have it on which benefits me a lot."
861,4.0 out of 5 stars,"We got these as a present for our son, and he loves the noise-canceling that they provide. But the way that they fit over your ear is a little wonky and it took him some time to get used to them. He appreciates how thick and sturdy the cord is."
862,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wasn't really expecting to much but was pleasantly surprised how good they worked, the bottom end was very good and I could here my Bass guitar a lot better than I did with the 400$ ones I was using before. Would recommend for anyone using them for live playing."
863,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Only had these a few months so far since my Sennheisers kicked, I think I'm hearing things I haven't heard before, and I like it. They are surprisingly comfortable. Singers - go for the clear ones, I wish I did..."
864,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound
865,4.0 out of 5 stars,"sound is good, seem super durable, can get a little unfortable after awhile"
866,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superb for the price, highly recomend...using with in-ear monitor system..works great."
867,5.0 out of 5 stars,First time I've found a comfortable pair of headphones.
868,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lost my old pair! They didn't take long to get use to and I enjoy the fit like any other. Great product, I can't imagine anyone rating low on a Shure headphone product exemption of defection like any product. Brilliant Mids,Lows and highs. Bass is not overwhelming, but satisfies, does the job perfectly."
869,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had for two months before the left bud loses sound unless I play with the position and angle of the cable where it attaches to the bud. Crappy build quality?
870,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Whoa! I had to buy some in-ears for a new church gig I took on. I play bass. The first rehearsal I used my studio cans and it was OK for a live gig, but I can't play with those beasts on (Apple earbuds forget about it). The drums are loud, even with a plexiglass shield. I was recommended these and I was skeptical the bass response would be any good. Got them just in time and wow! Very impressed at the quality and bass response/tone on these. At first, I was a little picky about the tone and quality, but as soon as every started playing it was totally fine.
Also, they seriously block out everything! You can't hear someone talking in front of you with them in and the foam tips on."
871,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound for the price point!
872,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is excellent, and they fit snug in your ear canal. I also like having the additional ear buds'"
873,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked hands free, very good sound and battery longevity"
874,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Left side just stopped working about a month ago.

Never had any spills or impact damage. Daily use at the gym, but that's all.

Would have hoped that something like this would last for more than a year. Guess not."
875,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Actually super disappointed to write this review. These came recommended from a friend of mine who knows his stuff when it comes to audio but these missed the mark drastically.

The headphones themselves are really not well designed. Quarky to fit in your ear and constantly fall out when they are in. Even after bending the chord, etc, they still feel really unnatural. Aside from the earpiece, the blue tooth connector/chord are fairly cumbersome and did not mesh well with the fact that I have to wear a jacket (NYC winter) and were constantly getting pulled off my ears.

The bluetooth was atrocious. Constantly bouncing the signal depending on if the chord was under my jacket, etc.

When they worked, the audio was strong and good quality but since the chord that plugs into the earpieces is movable (can spin, etc) - the audio would get really scratchy and turn off/on if the chord moved the wrong way.

Ended up tabling these after having them for a week and bought beats, which I was not happy with since I'm sure there's better quality out there for less $, unfortunately - these just weren't the fix."
876,2.0 out of 5 stars,I was looking forward to using a these but when i look closer I saw that they were glued and used. Supper disappointed.
877,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very pleased with the sound quality, especially for the price point."
878,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Most days, these are in my ears more than not. They have great sound and I find them very comfortable. When I lost my first pair I didn't even consider shopping around for a different model."
879,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really good sound and Shure have redesigned these so they don't break where they used to on the wire. Used with the handsfree kit, they are perfect for music and also any hand free calls etc.

The sound isolation is amazing and really comfortable,"
880,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mine went through the washer and dryer. They still work.
881,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound great quality. Love how they feel in my ears but some times the make them feel sore if they're in for really long periods of time. Other than that they are great. Use them almost everyday!
882,5.0 out of 5 stars,"THESE ARE AMAZING! They have an amazing sound quality for bass, midtones, and even high notes! These work well espicially with a personal mixer such as a ""P-16""! Definitely worth $100!!!"
883,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the money the best I've had without having the triple driver ones. Not as good as the ultimate ear triple driver I had but for less than half the price they are close.
884,1.0 out of 5 stars,ironic it broke 2 days after the return window closed - left earbud works fine but right is empty - it's an expensive earplug!
885,4.0 out of 5 stars,"didn't fit as I expected, but will work with them"
886,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After 2-3 charges the BT unit stopped charging, making the headphones useless.

That issue aside, I'm on the fence about whether I would buy this product again. I had the Shure SE210, which I first bought over a decade ago. After going through other in-ear headphones, I ended up going back to this. I miss the sound. I tried a couple of different set-ups prior to getting these. Alas, the SE210 has been discontinued, and I started to try different bluetooth options for when my primary set up gets totally obsoleted. Primarily, I use an iPod shuffle+ SE210 (using the short wire), so I will compare an iPhone with Shure215 BT with my previous set up.

Sound. The sound using an iPod+SE210 is better than the sound over iPhone+SE215BT. Having said that, the bar is high. The SE215BT sounds much better than any other BT headphone I've owned - Beats, Jaybird, and JBL. My Jaybirds were first generation, and the beats were also first generation. The JBL is still on the market today.

Form factor. The form factor of the iPod+SE215 is better. This is because I don't have to carry a phone around me. In addition, the wires are neat and behind my back. With the bluetooth headphones, I have a heavy battery behind me, and a dongle on my side. The weight is all over the place - I can manage the battery by tucking it in my shirt, but I still have a control dongle flapping around. I weighed the iPod+SE210 set up and the SE215. They are about the same weight, with the SE215 coming about .1 oz lighter. But the bluetooth headphones *feels* heavier in use. (I think it is like carry a political protester... these guys/gals are like 100lbs wet, and are easy to lift if they want to be. But when they ""go limp"" cops who can bench 150 will struggle carrying around 100lbs of flopping limbs. The SE215 is a protester ""going limp"".)

Electronics. Obviously this is more of a ""BT v wired"" debate. Wired is just easier. BT requires extra charging. My iPhone started connecting directly to the headset, then stopped. I had to forget the device, then bring it back on. I was adding 2-3 minutes of messing around with the set-up prior to a workout on a regular basis - checking the battery, checking the connection, inserting the headphones, correcting each step. A little of the extra time is getting used to putting on these headphones. A little of the extra tension is trusting that an inherently untrustworthy connection is there every time.

Finally, as noted, after a few weeks of using this, the battery will no longer charge. I'm still under warranty, and expect to get this issued resolved.

I would recommend these, despite the warts (except the battery issue, which is kind of a big deal if not resolved). The warts are all BT related. The sound of BT is just not as good as similar wired headsets; but as far as bluetooth headphones are concerned, these are very good sounding. The form factor is not good because of the BT components needed. And inconvenience of setting up is really sometime I've come to expect with BT. (Even when connecting an iPhone to the car, it takes a minute longer than just turning on the radio. But it's a minute without peace. Is there enough charge in the headset; is there enough charge in the phone; will the phone connect; will I be able to listen to the songs I've been looking forward to all day when I workout? It's all not a big deal, except that it can ruin your commute or workout, start the day just a bit off kilter, or end it with a sour note.) These are all issues inherent with BT of any kind.

So, if you need to go with BT headphones because Apple and Samsung and others have taken away the headphone jack and replaced it with an inferior dongle, the SE215 is a good to excellent choice (assuming this battery charging issue gets fixed). But it is not as good as an obsolete Shure 210 with an obsolete Apple iPod Shuffle. It is tough to give 5 stars to a product that is not as good as the previous generation. It is tough to give 4 starts to a product that doesn't work after 3 weeks. But it is tough to give 1 star that seems to be the best of its class (BT headphones) for sound. I guess 2 is fair."
887,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for starting out and new to in ear monitors
888,5.0 out of 5 stars,Look no further- just buy these....The Best!
889,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first bought these earphones, I was unsure about the quality and build of the earphones themselves, but I've been proven wrong. The quality of the earphones is great, very well built all connectors are gold plated, and the wire really allow them to tangle. In some pictures they don't look completely clear but they are transparent, the wires have a cream tint but are clear.
The sound quality is great, really high volumes, my right ear phone starts to pinch at my ear, but that's only at full volume on most devices. These are great at noise canceling, I can't hear besides the music most of the time. People will raise their voices and I'll still be in peace. These are originally made for a musician in a band, or soloist. I wouldn't doubt these working great for hearing what needs to be sung or heard. Also another thing Id like to point out is if you like sleeping whilst listening to something these are very comfortable and fit great. They also come with different sets of bits that go into your ears, they all feel great.
Another thing is these are not extremely bass heavy, they just improve the sound quality equally. So worth the price? In my opinion, yes they are great and work awesome, for any time your traveling or in school, or in a loud place where you just want to be to yourself and enjoy music, these are perfect."
890,1.0 out of 5 stars,The wires on these are tarrible they started shorting out after two months. Sound quality is great but they need better wires!
891,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a great phone
892,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear buds are a great price and all our vocalists think they sound great high quality, and they are very durable!"
893,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are a good value for the price. They did not block out all sound but for the price they worked well.
894,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After many years loyal to the Shure brand I am very sad to write a poor review. I will start by saying the amount of sound from these things is by far the best for the price. When they work. Bass and sound depth is all you could ask for. Now for the bad. I have been buying shure since 2004 for military travels around the world. Since then, I have only had to get 2 new sets because I lost one. I recently got my third set because it was time. I put them in and it sounds like the speakers are popped. Very staticy and distorted. Amazon sent a replacement right away because amazon is amazing and the wire is shorted out. I don't know why the construction is so crappy, but I am seriously disappointed."
895,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound quality. Also great for noise reduction while studying. I would buy it again for sure.
896,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Today i had both buds in. My wife was talking to me so I took the Left earbud out. 7 seconds later i put it back. No sound! Tested. Left earbud worked on Right side so it's the connection just like everyone said. I was aware of the issue, but it would never happen to me. But it did and i know Shure is aware of these problems and sends out potentially defective products anyway. Bad company. No pride. These earbuds have not yet been abused. It's really too bad Shure. I was satisfied with then before today. I know you wont miss my money, but i cant trust you. Have a good life and it's not personal. It's business."
897,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound quality and comfort in these headphones. Definitely worth the price.
898,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, excellent isolation good quality product"
899,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the 215s mainly due to their footprint: they recede almost entirely into the ear and so can be slept in comfortably, and they do sound pretty decent, for $100. The included case is serviceable (though not hardshell) and the standard variety of foam and silicon tips is included.

Relative to the HiFiMan RE-400s I was using previously, these exhibit a generally more accurate sound and wider soundstage, and the cable/strain relief appear to be of significantly higher quality. Plus, the cable is replaceable.

They are NOT in the same league as my Westone W30s. The low end is comparatively boomy and the entire spectrum sounds somewhat muted by comparison. That being said, the W30s retail at $400 and have three drivers, so I do not expect the 215s to have equivalent performance."
900,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using SHURE earphones for quite a few years now, and it has been about 2 years since my last pair broke (old design before you could unplug the ear piece from the wires) and I always said I would get a new pair. I just never got around to do it, until in a spur of the moment I ordered a pair in the morning. I love being in LA where we get same day shipping! YES!! BE JEALOUS! j/k

But back to the headsets, hands down SHURE has been the best in ear headphones you could buy. This will be my 3 headset over the past 8 years and if these ever mess up I will buy another pair. The sound on these is just superb! And these are like there entry level ones... I can't even begin to imagine what their high end headsets sound like. I just don't make that kind of money! lol But I love these and I always recommend these to all my friends because hands down they are the best!"
901,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is really good, they are comfortable and noise-isolating, and the price is right. Unfortunately within two months of buying them the cable gave out and would only transmit a soft intermittent signal.

The the credit of the designers the ear buds easily detach so you can replace just the cable rather than the whole unit. This is a step up from the last Shure earphones I owned which were attached to the cable and had to be discarded when it broke (after many years of use).

The part that's tough to swallow is that the cable is over $30. A pair of standard Apple headphones, complete with ear buds and remote control, retails for $29 and is notoriously over-priced. It would be easier to shrug off if there weren't so many reports in the reviews of cables breaking. If the cable was high-quality enough to justify the high price tag, it wouldn't break so often.

I believe that part of the problem is in the old-fashioned, bulky, L-shaped design of the jack which is ill-suited to pocket devices. As you move around during the day the jack can rotate perpendicular to the device so it hangs off the edge, which can subject it to stress that's not an issue with a straight jack."
902,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a jaded guy. I've had everything from electrostatic headphones to just about every major brand of earbuds known. I have some Sony sound cancelling headphones that are hard to beat, along with Yamaha earbuds that shine like new money.

This set from Shure shames them all.

Once you get the right foam tip on the end, and finally get it just right in the ear, the sound experience is unequaled. These buds are just like I like them, bright and flat. The bass is outstanding, not only in range (downward) but in clarity. These buds do not get the least bit 'boomy', which can happen frequently with earbuds. Some manufacturers seem to be overcompensating in the bass department, just because they are earbuds. These buds perform near perfect bass, without any doubling, rattling, or muffling. Quite an accomplishment.

The mid range area is really good. Vocals come through with a vibrant clarity I have never experienced before in speakers that fit inside the ear. The only experience I can relate it to is the mid-range horns in my Klipsch Heresy speakers, which absolutely KILL (in a good way) the vocal range. Excellent. (Stuff it Klipsch haters, there is no 'honkiness', it is a figment of your imagination.)

The high range is also quite good. High frequency overtone reproduction is so very important for completing the stereo imaging of mid and bass frequencies. This device delivers.

You would think it would be impossible to get such high definition bass, mid and high frequencies out of one driver. My hat is off to the engineers at Shure for pulling it off. Even the Yamaha EPH-100 can't quite do it, and they are really good.

Overall, I can't believe I waited so long to get a pair of these. Get some for yourself. These may be too good, in a sense, because such quality sound is not really needed in most applications that use earbuds: exercising, casual listening, etc. All I can say is it is better to have the capability and not need it than the opposite. With the Shure earbuds, I can tell if I am listening to a CD or MP3 where I cannot tell when using my JVC buds. You need to decide if you need that much quality. As for me, too much quality is just what I want.

The cords are a blessing and a curse. Being super (Kevlar) tough, they are a blessing since they will hardly tear up in normal use. Also, being replaceable is a fantastic option that should be on every pair of $100+ earbuds/phones like all cars have steering wheels. However, the material has to be 'taught' to stay in place. The over-the-ear cords do take some effort to get used to. It is worth the effort, believe me, although YMMV and it is a deal killer for you.

Also, I used some Radians earplug material to make myself some custom molded earphones, as many people do nowadays. The experience is 5 times better than with the expanding foam seals. You just will not hear anything from the outside, so driving with them is out of the question. I do use them to do yard work, and listen to my fave MP3's, so even while weed eating, I am listening to music with no interfering noise to speak of.

If you are an audiophile that needs some earphones, GET THESE NOW!!!"
903,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like most Shure products, these earbuds have both exceptional sound and a high price tag. However, if you are like me and have had trouble finding ear buds that fit well (my canals are big, making a good seal difficult), these could be for you.

With a wide selection of sleeves materials (foam, silicon, rubberish) and styles, you will have a great shot at a good fit if you have massive canals. With the fit of these Shure's, I get a full range of bass that is impossible with a bad fit.

Also, the earpieces come apart from the cables, so a frayed cable can be replaced without the expense of an entirely new set of buds. Over the long-term, this could easily save you the incremental cost for these.

The only drawback is that they take a little getting used to due to the over the back of the ear way you wear them. I wish the part of the cable near the earpiece were a little more rigid to keep the right fit of curve over your ear. They are bendable with some rigidity, but once you take them off and store them, the exact curve you bent into them pretty much goes away, so you have to do it again when you wear them the next time.

If you do NOT have bizarrely large ear canals and are looking for a better value with very strong sound, try the Klipsch IMAGE S4 In-Ear Enhanced Bass Noise-Isolating Headphones (Black). I thought they sounded great, but I needed to hold them in to get a good seal. With normal ear canals, these would be a great purchase."
904,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My review will be on 2 parts the first one is for the SE215 with the bluetooth cable and the second one will be on the bluetooth cable with the SE846

The SE215:

It sounds amazing for it's price range and it has no hissing with the bluetooth cable.It's comfortable and light weighted. It's good for running,gym and travel !

I would give it 5/5

The SE846

Am so disappointed with the bluetooth cable and the SE846 it sounds worse than the SE215 and there is a cutting in the sound every few seconds and there is a hissing when no sound is playing

if you're planning to buy the bluetooth cable for the SE846 and you care about sound quality just don't!

It's waste of money and it will make your SE846 sound like 50$ earphones.

I didn't use the microphone yet but the controls are great and the cable is comfortable"
905,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
Nice simple design.
Design helps it fit perfectly in the ear. Does not fall off easily.
Portable carrying case.
Great noise isolation. Helps keeps outside noise out.

Cons:
Not very easy to detach.
Price is too high.

I've been using this now since for almost 3 years and is still going strong without any issue."
906,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll start by saying I only awarded 4 stars (so far) simply because I literally just took them out of the box, fitted them to my ears, and have them plugged in just to listen to music right now. I have not yet tested them on stage. However, I'm certain they will be successful in isolating sound well. I sat here while the music was streaming into my ears while just holding the volume button on ""up"" on another (loud) sound source and I could hear absolutely nothing apart from the music already playing through the headphones. I will say I did not prefer the foam ear plugs to the soft flex sleeves. I liked the easy installation the soft flex sleeves offer-and they were just more comfortable for me. To each his own...it's nice to have all the options. Plus it has a handy carrying case! Anyway, back to the headphone quality. I'm going to give them a major thumbs up!! Of course, they're a little heavy in comparison to products by MEElectric or Sony and that of the like. But one should expect that considering how they're made and etc. Do yourself a favor and make the investment if you plan to use them for more than just everyday music listening. I'm glad I did! I'll use them while I sing. If it helps, I also read other reviews where percussionists also recommended these for their own purposes. Enjoy!"
907,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Audio quality is abysmal for the Shure brand, even given the standards of in-ear headphones. Flat and tinny audio. Cable noise (as it hits the body with walking action) is extremely loud- something that should never occur with >$20 headphones.
If you wear glasses, they are near impossible to comfortably wear.
I find myself defaulting to my free pair of cellphone headphones just for the comfort factor."
908,2.0 out of 5 stars,"a few years ago I had a set of Shure E series ear buds, and they were great. I lost them somewhere and, so wanted to replace them, so i went with Shure again. Problems are twofold. ONe, These new ones have cheap foam and rubber ear pieces which don't stay in as well as the old silicone ones and don't block sound as well. Two: for some reason shure thought putting thick plastic sleeves on the wire closest to the ear would allow the user to mold the wire to fit over the ear. This would be great if they held the position, but they don't. they just make them hard to put on and uncomfortable to wear with glasses. they also seem to get tangled very easily when you put them away.

It's nice that sure decided to make the wires removeable for when they go bad and the pivot at the point of attachment would seem prevent the the metal fatigue that probably caused the older non-pivoting style to fail; but between the tangles, fall outs and discomfort I simply couldn't wear them for more than 15 min at a time. I just returned them."
909,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Now, I'll start by saying I'm not an audio-phile. I purchased these after doing research into in ear headphones that are both comfortable and sound good. I can honestly say that I am impressed. I ended up using the foam tips, as they seem to provide a better sound range than the silicone tips. I work in front of a computer all day and I was surprised how I can wear these for 4 hours straight and never have it irritate or hurt my ears.

They sound really well for me. I am a bit surprised because I wrote off in ear headphones as always not sounding very good. I'm pleasantly surprised with these.

My one con: the sizing on the foam tips included are a little odd. the smallest is slightly smaller than the middle and it is a slightly different shape. The large is a big jump in size from the middle. One of my ears works great for the middle size, and the other makes the middle size feel small. So I don't get a good fit with the middle size. The large size is almost too big for that ear. I use the large size, but it always feels a little odd when I first put them in.

I would recommend these for anyone that is looking for good quality in ear headphones and doesn't want to drop 300+ on really nice ones."
910,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing headphones, less noise pollution than many noise-cancelling headphones."
911,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent
912,3.0 out of 5 stars,It worked for the first 20 minutes and then it stopped
913,5.0 out of 5 stars,so so so!!!! good!
914,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Sound great,lots of clean bass, wide range, sound isolating, quality tips, detachable headphones, comfortable

Cons: Putting these in is harder than it should be, may not work with phone or music player case, not a very secure fit, cut out every once in a while for just a split second(almost only during heavy lifting though)"
915,4.0 out of 5 stars,"While the sound is good I expected a larger soundstage
Everything feels so .. enclosed.
However, for it's price and size they are amazing earbuds.

Not they do need a little more power to make them better so if you dont have an amp it kinda limits the sound even more."
916,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the good thing that I bought. One of driver died on me last year, lasted me for more than 4 years!"
917,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned the Shure E2 ear buds and the wire was completely worn out after 4 years of use, which is understandable. I purchased these to replace the E2 set and there is not much of a difference. The overall design is slightly better, the ear buds are smaller and thinner causing less inner ear discomfort. The old ear tips do not fit on the new ear buds, but the new ear tips are very similar except now you don't have to fool with the sticky guard that never stayed in place anyway. The swivel feature on the ear buds is nice but it's hard to automatically realize which bud is right and which is left. I always have to look for the R or the L instead of just looking at them and knowing which is which like with the E2. The sound is slightly better than the E2 ear buds but that could also just be that they are new. Overall they are a nice upgrade from the E2 ear buds so if you are in the market for a new set of Shure ear buds buy these, you won't be disappointed."
918,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality but the cord was cheaply made; falls out of my phones headphone jack and doesn't wrap around my ears properly.
919,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice earphone, nice sound & comfortable to wear."
920,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great earbuds. The sound quality is really nice (I am no audiophile) and I enjoy using them during my workday at my desk. The cord is fairly long which can be nice for running it down to a pants pocket and into a cell phone.
My one complaint about their design (and more broadly of other earbud designs as well) is that they tend to accumulate earwax in the small aperture. This, of course, obstructs the sound to your ear. It can be bothersome to remove the rubber earbud from the electronics, clear it out, and reinstall. There was one instance in which I was nervous that earwax would get past the rubber and into the earbud itself. Be careful about that!"
921,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these for 90 and they are worth every penny. They isolate noise incredibly well, have great bass, and stay in place with a bendable wire that wraps around your ear. Only problem is people try to talk to you and you can not hear them at all."
922,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound!!! Good bass and isolating.
923,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Major durability issue. Returning the product.

After 2 days or so, left sound start cutting depending on the position of the cable. Don't think I would trust Shure again."
924,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work great for playing live as in ear monitors. Just make sure to adjust the wires right so they don't make your ears sore after practice!
925,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If the cord didn't keep breaking requiring a new one almost every year, these would be the perfect headphones."
926,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Needed some good headphones for drumming and practice.
They have great isolation depending on the ear foam you use.
And my ears are no longer ringing when i'm done with my gigs.
Quality is great!"
927,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fit isn't so great, especially the part that wraps around your ears. Inferior to Westone but the cable is replaceable."
928,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not well balanced sound. To expensive for what you get.
929,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Every musician should have one of these, now i can hear everything in a very peaceful way when im playing live, they have great bass response and high end too, they look very durable, and the detachable cable its an awesome feature."
930,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are good quality. Only negative is the buds are too big for my very small ear canals. An optional size bud available would be nice.
931,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound great, but they are a pain to put on."
932,4.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are very comfortable and produce very good quality.

934,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is decent. This is NOT what you want if you love bass-heavy earbuds
935,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The cable started stripping after less than a month of use. Sound quality is amazing, but the wires not coming apart is not so great."
936,5.0 out of 5 stars,produce nice sound
937,5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound amazing... much better the the ones that came with my shure in ear monitor system.... Much more comfortable too!
938,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great set of midrange iems. They take a little getting used to putting in correctly, but the sound is great."
939,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was great never fall off sound quality was good for its prise especially for female voice
940,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the SE215 they are well worth the price and the best in ear headphones in its price range. I suggest reading the manual before doing anything as these headphones need a little practice before putting it on.
941,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All I can say is... Wow. As a rule I am a bit of an audio snob. I bought these as a replacement for my gym beaters - ancient Shures (SE205 I think). They had taken a beating, even though they still sounded very good. But these sound absolutely amazing... honestly they made me think ""Why do I even have the SE535 for my snobby, more concentrated listening?""... This is amazing value for the buck, and simply an amazingly extremely well rounded piece of gear. Sublime sound - make sure you fit them well every time, and enjoy. They provide every acoustic nuance and resolution you need.

They are not as immediately comfy as other stuff, but the sound quality is worth investing the extra time in the fitting. Every second of it. I think these are the best in-ears for the buck on the planet. By a big lead. I also own the 535s, and honestly... if these new 215s were my only set I'd be just fine."
942,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was looking for noise reducing headphones that were not $400 and but worth owning. This by far is the best deal out there right now. I searched far and wide as I play acoustic drums but love the ability to play along with music in the background if not live on stage. This works perfect and is essentially like having full foam ear plugs in with the ability to hear the music cleanly throug a monitor.
943,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair of Klipsch S4's before these and thought I would try something else based on tech website reviews and although the sound quality is good, they are awful for working out. I don't run or jog or do anything too active just weight lifting and I'm constantly adjusting these. Switching out multiple tips don't seem to make a difference. I'll more than likely go back to the S4's or try something else."
944,5.0 out of 5 stars,if youre willing to shell out the money these are amazing buds. they are tough as nails (compared to must ear buds) and ive never had this level of bass from a speaker so small. truly a great purchase.
945,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best earphones for the price.like I mean they sound really good.you buy these you will have no regrets.
946,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
947,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, the cord it's too long and heavy."
948,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product works better than expected. I have bout 4 of these for gifts and everyone agrees they work exceptionally well.
949,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had these less than a week and the right side stopped working all together.
950,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great while they lasted. I used these for my headphones while riding my motorcycle. One, day I got a coughing sound from one earbud and now only one side works. What a waste of money."
951,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them looking forward to being able to hear my own mix and singing in key for a change.
952,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The bluetooth portion could be better. To skip a song or to replay it, you press and hold the volume up or down. I'd much prefer double taps than a long press. Also, i can't seem to have it go back one song, instead of replaying the same one. The worst part is how long it takes to call up Siri. You have to hold the play/pause button until it beeps. Then you wait until you hear the Siri tones. That's way too long to wait.

The quality of the earpieces is very nice. I feel its a bit overpriced though."
953,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using Shure earphones for a decade and these are the best so far. They make a very tight seal in the ear to block out noise and the sound quality is excellent.
954,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love these things. I will be happier after i can find a set of tips that will last longer than 2 weeks.
955,5.0 out of 5 stars,They sound great and they block enough outside noise that I'm not deaf at the end of the night.
956,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works as expected and pretty comfortable as well.
957,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got my Shure SE215-K headphones today and oh my! I must say I was a bit turned off by the packaging. It look as though it was something I would buy at Best Buy. Don't be fooled though, once inside the package I was greeted with warning galore. I like warnings. Hearing loss etc. Ok maybe these are some serious headphones.

I got them out, put the ear pieces that fit me best and gave them a shot. I figured the style would be uncomfortable and yes it takes a second to get used to inserting them but once in I can barely tell they are there, it's like having the wings of an angel fluttering aside your head.

Let me tell you, I'm not an audiophile but I love music as much as the next person. I'm very particular about the balance I like. I like sharp tones from techno but also massive bass drop from dub step style music. These headphones are perfect. The bass doesn't overpower everything but on a song that's designed to push its there enough bass to bring a huge smile to your face. Music is crisp and clear. I didn't know crisp music until I listened to these. Each note is perfectly placed in your ear for an eventual eargasim.

The sound canceling is amazing. My previous headphone (Monster Turbines) I used for years and was so happy with until they came up missing. They blocked sound so well from their metal construction. I was worried with the Shure being what looks like plastic but let me tell you, with them in and no music sound is about 50/60% cut. The second any music is played all and you could be in the middle of a Gettysberg reenactment and never know it.

I've tried a few different genres and have yet to find anything these headphones don't perform spectacularly with. I'm well pleased, I can't begin to say how amazing these headphones really are, seriously, they are really that good.

I would recommend these to anyone who wishes to have some amazing sound, and are particular of the quality of the music they listen to."
958,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and fit
959,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great, take a little getting used to with the wire wrapping back over your ear but I have no complaints."
960,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a owner of an Audio Technica MTH 50, these are perfect in ear headphones. They are worn over the ear, which may be an issue for some. Overall, the quality is amazing, but one may not like how they fit in one's ears."
961,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are great. You really can't beat the price on these for how good they sound.
962,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am long time owner of SE215's and was excited to try the BT1 version. Audio quality is superb and it can pump out a lot of volume, but the product has a major design flaw. The volume adjustment steps are way too large, and the minimum volume is much too loud. Even at the minimum possible volume, some audio is uncomfortably loud. The problem is that you turn the volume down one more step, it is off! Contacted Shure tech support and received a response that basically told me they don't care. There is no firmware update available or planned. No fix for the volume problem available."
963,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent. Good quality and clarity.
964,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounds, would definitely recommend and purchased them again."
965,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands down the best earphones for under $100. These are awesome for use as an IEM on stage or just for listening. I use them in class and on the bus aswell as on stage. They're awesome.
966,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Once you figure out how to put them on, these earphones are easily the most comfortable and durable I have ever used. Highly recommended."

968,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these on a whim for my commuting and running. The noise isolation is impressive. I find they sound better and are more comfortable than my last Bose ie2 pair. Overall a good purchase if they are in your price range.
969,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I must say this model has been doing pretty well in terms on sound quality so far. The only problem I have with it is it's kinda hard to take out the ear buds to change them.

It's good in the sense they don't fall off easily, but bad in the sense it's too good that I couldn't take it out=="
970,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using my new Shure SE 215-k for several weeks now and I like them better than the first pair that I got 4 years ago (they finally broke). The fit is far superior, more secure than before. The cable is a little stiff compared to the previous set, but it should make them last longer."
971,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good
972,5.0 out of 5 stars,What are the best earbuds I have ever on takes awhile for it to be comfortable but other than that it sounds amazing
973,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and rugged.
974,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just bought and am loving it. Had the Klipsch S4's before. Although the sound quality was great, the comfort was terrible and the quality of the wires were bad. After one year of use, the right ear stopped working. Tried the Bose MIE2 at the store. The fit was awkward and was not noise isolating. The quality was only good when you pressed the earbuds into your ear.

I like pros/cons list, so this is how I'm going to do my review for the Shure se215

Pros:
-For this class and price range of in ear headphones, absolutely amazing sound quality. Crisp sounds, great bass.
-Was skeptical of the different fit. However, it conforms to your ears very well. The tips are also more foamy than rubbery which creates a nice comfortable fit
-Wires are replaceable! GENIUS!

Cons:
-The wire is a bit bulky and long. This could become annoying if I had to store in jeans pocket, etc. But I guess it's a tradeoff for durability

I also bought the iPhone mobile accessory. Although a bit steep at $50, I think it's worth it. Great functionality (volume, next/last track, forward, play/pause). The cable is also shorter (but a still a little bulky).

Bottom Line: After a lot of research and debate, I am very satisfied with my purchase."

The fact the cord is replacable is fantastic."
990,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These look like nice headphones, but I received them and only one of the wires worked properly to provide audio. I switched the ear buds to see if it was them but both worked properly on the one working wire so it seems to be a defect. It's a shame because the ear buds seem like they would be comfortable, but I have no confidence these would not break easily. Probably not worth getting these if there are more reliable brands."

993,5.0 out of 5 stars,these work well if you play the drums. They sound good and they do really well at blocking out the sound of your drums.
994,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect! Great phone to use in live concert!
995,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This the is second pair of Shure earbuds I have owned. The first pair (don't remember the model) I bought about 8 years ago for about $150 and the sound was incredible. I lost the earbuds, so naturally thought that these SE215 would fill in the void. Well, these are not even close to the one's I lost. This review is not based on the old Shure earbuds I lost.

The quality of the SE215 very good, but that does not equate to the sound these earbuds produce. The sound quality is not much better than the ear buds that came with my cellphone. The bass is poor, the mid's is average. Not what I expected from Shure. I think if you are going to spend $100 on a pair of earbuds, shop around, these are not worth the money."

1005,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things are great. They sound good, are cost effective, and I have no complaints. I use them for my in ear monitors with my band and am totally happy."
1006,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall sound quality is not as good as my Klipsch Image S4s. These have excellent noise isolation and bass, but the mids and highs are not quite as good as the S4s. The cable is durable, but the fitting of these earphones is awkward."
1007,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is clean and clear.
1008,2.0 out of 5 stars,did not come with carrying case or any extra tips. Came packaged in a plastic bag. After buying some after market foam tips they sound great.
1009,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, beautiful range, and once broken in after a few days, very comfortable. If you're looking for good quality headphones with a great sound for fairly cheap, these are great. Also, great for playing video games"
1010,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound great, but this shape of earphones really just isn't for me. Personally, I find them difficult to put on. It's a two hand job. You have to route the stiff part of the wire around the top of your ears, while using another hand to place each side into your ears. If you're using the (included) foam tips, it almost requires a third hand to smoosh the foam down to fit into your ears.

Even after doing all that, they just didn't stay in well, at all. Yes, I tried all the sizes of tips, and both the foam and silicone ones. It's just no fun walking around with only one side actually playing any audio, since the other side keeps pushing itself out.

I went back to a pair of Sennheiser earbuds I had before."
1011,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For $99 you can do a lot worse. Truly. There are so many products out there that hype themselves as standing out from the crowd, being something unique (using wood housing instead of plastic, I won't mention any specific names but I can assure you they don't sound as good as these. I've tried them, believe me). These are absolutely phenomenal earbuds at their price point. The drivers are lively and separated but not shrill and cold which is often the case with balanced well separated headphones. They are neutral and give a perfectly balanced presentation of the music you are listening to but also give a lively and impacting presentation. A total joy to use. Any EQ tweaking will only make them sound inferior and bring out the weakness of whatever program you are using to alter the EQ. These are really quite good. Speaking as a person who has owned Sennheiser 650 HD with a $500 headphone tube amp. These are really the best headphones in their price category.

I am not a Shure fanboy. Actually. My first pair of shure, e2c broke with light use. I had sworn them off (hence my foray into wood housed and otherwise earbuds, which is why I am giving you a highly appraised review despite my previous bad experience) but back with the 215k and I am really very satisfied. They are sturdy headphones. The cords are very robust. The quality is high. And I can't give you any faults. They are really very good and I would recommend them to anyone looking for earbuds in this price category.

As an added bonus you won't have to hear any boneheads when you are on the bus or otherwise. They are really very good at blocking outside noises. Like, totally block any outside noise under 100db. Love these earbuds. They are really the best in this price range and you can't go wrong if you chose them."
1012,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I arrived at these I owned, urBeats , Bose Sound True, Sennhieser Momentums, and a small pair of Monster earbuds. upbeats was a good product. I didn't mind them. Sound True was horrible for the price tag. I have to have a ear bud that complete fits in your ear and seals in the sound. They were horrible for that. urBeats provided great sound, but during working out, they often started to get loose. My Momentums are awesome but I have to say an over the ear headphone isn't ideal for lifting to me. Personal preference. Great headphones for movies and casual listening for sure. Before these headphones the Monsters were ultimately best sound for the price tag out of all the above.

FINALLY, I rolled the dice on another pair of earbuds, us sure of the lever the ear wire, how they might fit, great name in sound but am I buying a name and not sound? Lastly the price difference between these and the higher is extreme, am I even getting something worth it?

What has resulted is easily hands down the BEST earbud I have ever owned. to date. The ear piece is made of ear plug type foam, you squeeze them and lt them settle in your ear and they aren't going ANYWHERE during ANYTHING! (If you talk in the gym more than workout, you won't like these, quick remove isn't happening.) These are great for the person going into the gym and there to ignore everyone and just workout in your own zone. The wire around the ear? A few reviews said it took some breaking in. Not for me, I formed them to my ears first time and they feel GREAT.

SOUND. The sound is unbelievably amazing. You know that equalizer on your phone? You can actually use that and tell the difference significantly with these earbuds. You want bass? OK, You want low bass? They work well with that too. These earbuds are simply amazing. For this price tag I can speak from owning a few different brands that these are hands down are a STEAL from Shure. They could charge more for this kinda sound and isolation. If you a questioning the money, DON'T, if you are questioning the comfort, I am a huge snob on comfort and they are amazing. POWER? check check and check. Don't hesitate on pulling the trigger on these. My best amazon purchase and it's not even close."
1013,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update to the review. I have been using these headphones now for a few more weeks. The more i use them, the more i appreciate them. The sound is clean. It is critical to get the right fit using the various sizes of buds. I used the rubber ones, not the foam ones for a dramatic difference in performance. I want to reiterate how well these are made. They seem to be very high quality and the cord engineering is supreme. There are so many ear buds where the cord breaks in one fashion or the other and you have to throw them out. This actually has a replaceable cord. However, the cord itself is a heavier gauge which gives it a very solid feel and it does not tangle easily like thinner cords. The jack is heavier duty also than most ear buds i have seen. The sounds seems quite detailed and not bass heavy. The efficiency and volume are fine now that i got the right fit. I have not heard the higher end Shure's to know if there is an appreciable difference in the sound, but these sound quite good compared to some Bose ear-buds i have and Dre Beats which i think are too bass heavy.

I have been using the buds for a couple of weeks now. I have Bose ones and some cheaper Dr Beats I got with HTC phone. At first I was quite disappointed with these phones. The low end was largely missing and when plugged into my laptop volume was poor. Then I started playing around with the different buds in the kit. This made a huge difference. I ended up using the rubber med ones. It dramatically changed the sound from the foam ones. These buds provide good detailed sound. The bass end is decent but not heavy if you like that. The Beats provide a much better low-end but are not as nuanced and detailed as these in my view. I think these provide a bit better sound than the Bose and are more isolating. So all in all these are good buds. My only issue was whether it was worth the money to step up to the 315's or higher in their line.

One more thing, I was impressed with the connecting wires on these. They are independent units. They are of a heavier quality wire and seem to be higher quality than I have found on other buds. If they should ever break, you can probably just buy a new cable and not have to throw out the entire product which is what usually happens. I think this is a great innovation."
1014,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant to drop $100 on a pair of ear buds, fearing they would not live up to my expectations. However, I'm pleased to report that they exceeded them. These are bar none the most comfortable, and best sounding earbuds I've ever owned. If it weren't for the cable (unavoidable with any wired headphones). But to their credit, way the cable loops over your ear makes the headphones both very comfortable and very secure. When you have the right size of nib selected, they don't move, loosen, fall out, or fatigue your ears, even when moving actively (working out, working, etc). I mainly bought them to wear while delivering papers to rooms at the hotel I work at, which is a tedious task, but it would often make my previous pair of ear buds fall out, but I found myself using them constantly. The memory foam nibs are fantastic, comfortable, and seal your ear from outside noise for an outstanding acoustic experience.
Pros: Excellent sound quality
very clear highs and lows, strong (but still clear) mids
warm sound
comfortable
Well constructed - cable quality is nice, and ear buds are solid with no vibrations, rattle, or noise
Detachable cable
Comes with case, cleaning tool (for the inevitable earwax invasion) and a plethora of ear nibs.
nice, gold plated, right angle 3.5mm plug
fantastic for planes, trains, road trips, relaxing, jogging/excessive, etc

Cons: Chord is not braided, just rubber insulated, however it is very robust feeling.
would have been nice to have a microphone and/or an inline volume control, but not a deal breaker by any means.
Having these headphones in makes you absolutely oblivious to any other sound outside of what you're listening to - it blocks out noise that well. Use with caution, wouldn't recommend for situations when you still need to be able to hear some stuff even with the headphones in, although that's sort of a given.

Final thoughts: These are not cheap headphones, and the saying ""you get what you pay for"" is absolutely true here. Having owned a pair of the beats ear buds (which ironically were half again as much) I can tell you these are a much better product. Comfortable, clear, dynamic sound, and intuitive design. You can't go wrong buying these headphones. I use them with a FiiO E6 amp because it's Equalizer is much better than my phone's built in equalizer, but an amp is not by any means required."
1015,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For in ear headphones. these are by far the best. im a huge adiophile when it comes to loud music. Im a big fan of the cambridge soundworks bookshelfs speakers hooked up to my denon. I have some bose and beyer headphones that are over ear stereo types. and these are for when i travel.

first part, the headphones come apart from the actual cord. why is this good? well when your cord wears out or it gets cut somehow, you dont need a new pair, you just need the cord.

The hadphones if put in properly with the wire around the ear, are phenomenal and even hours of plane use from NYC to london, these wont hurt your ears

The bass and just overall quality of the sound is superior. I also can blast them in a public area without anyone around me hearing a thing

i had a pair of the 435s or something and my puppy at the time chewed those up. since i have bought these and they sound amazing as well. GO FOR IT."
1016,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones which I use constantly. Sound quality is definitely amazing. I suggest when you try to get those factory buds off, work from the bottom. You must get a very good grip and when you try to pull them off try to twist a bit as well. For some reason that tricked worked for me and I'm a guy so I don't have cool fingernails like the ladies. Other than that they work perfectly, look great, and just take some time getting used to(weird shape). Also, another tip for when you put them on. If you want to be really snug in your ear, take your hand opposite to the earbud your going to put on and lift the tip of your ear while you place the ear-bud in. This trick worked like a charm for me so I'm just sharing some random tips. Well, I highly recommend these earphones. Their very popular among artist and you can't beat the quality! Enjoy everyone, I'm ""shure"" you will!"
1017,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215-K Live Sound Monitor headphones are good in-ear headphones. After some tweaking of the wires and understanding how they best fit in my ears, they performed really well. I recently traveled via the train and these headphones cut out all the noise of the train and most conversations surrounding me.

These headphones are best used while looping over the year and they fit snug in the ear cavity much like professional in-ear monitor headphones used by professional singers without the multi-thousand dollar price tag.

The headphones have a great sound and deliver a beautiful and dynamic range within your ears. The bass is measured appropriately in comparison to the mid and high ranges. The words of your music cut through music with clarity and give the customer a great listening experience.

These in-ear monitors do have a little learning curve to them since they sit more into the ear cavity then other headphones, but if you want a great listening experience and can afford the price tag then you should consider the Shure SE215-K Live Sound Monitor headphones."
1018,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Boomy bass bleeds into the lower midrange. Fun for a few songs but annoying in many as well. If you're used to extra bass, though, you might not notice it.

Comparing against my SE210, the SE215 had a harsh sibilance (the ""ssss"" sound for voices) and yet violins, cymbals, etc. sounded just as muffled as they did in the SE210. A sine sweep found a loud peak around 4.3 kHz. It's a heck of a lot of sibilance for $100+ audio. Everything above 5 kHz is rolled off as it was in my SE210.

You could equalize these, but if you're going to equalize you may as well get a decent pair of $20 earbuds and equalize those instead. Just flatten any offending peaks, and you'll probably end up with something just as good as the raw SE215 if not better. Equalizer APO + Room Eq Wizard work well in Windows."
1019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, the main reason that I wanted Bluetooth capability is because I travel A LOT! The cord always seems to get in the way. I wanted something that I didn't have to worry about recharging for at least 10 hours, but figured 8 would be acceptable. My flights, including lay overs, are generally about 12-14 hours so I figured that I could recharge while waiting on my connecting flight. When I first received the bluetooth cable, I charged it up completely. I wanted to know about how long I could play music before they would quit. By the way, I already had a pair of SE535's, so that's what I would be using. Anyway, paired them up to my Samsung phone with no problems and started the music. Long story short, they played for an astounding 13 1/2 hours!!!!! These are advertised for playing music for 8 hrs. and taking 1 1/2 hours to recharge. If you do deplete the cord completely it will take a little over 2 hours to recharge which is absolutely acceptable to me. Overall, like all Shure products, this thing outperforms it's claims! I am absolutely thrilled with this (as with all Shure products), because I don't have to sacrifice music quality and I don't have to worry about recharging in the middle of my travels. By the way, once you go past about the 12 hr. mark you will begin to get an audible ""battery low"" warning. I am a very happy customer!!!!"
1020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Work great, can't even tell they are in my ears, only with they had more bass."
1021,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works good.
1022,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I lost my previous pair of 425s and bought these as a replacement (hoping to find the others). I didn't expect the sound to be on the same level and it isn't. It is worth the money.

My chief complaint is the stink and stifness of the cable. I mean wicked bad order. My 425s had a black cable and maybe if you ordered the 215s in black that wouldn't be a problem. Looking at buying just a black cable would set me back $30. So I'm stuck with the wretched things. My option at this point is to send them back and buy the black version and hope that doesn't smell to high heaven."
1023,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound for the cost. Sometimes the sound canceling works too well with our stage
1024,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good
1025,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these to use as a keyboardist and vocalist for my church's worship team. I appreciate that thiese earphones come with multiple size and type ear buds and also a cleaning tool. I have been careful to store these well and never drop them so I can't report on their durability over multiple falls. But I have had them for quite awhile and they are still just as good as new. I've also used these during air travel and they are extremely helpful in blocking noise in airplaines and in airports. I would highly recommend the Shure SE215's as an entry level in-ear monitor. These are far superior to other ear buds and the fit is very secure for multiple size ear canals.
1026,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is definitely worth it.
1027,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these so much. When I have them in I seriously cannot hear any outside noise and I love that. The quality is superb and I recommend buying these.
1028,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just Sheer and pure high quality sound... The sounds are just exactly as they are... No ""artificially"" enhanced bass and sharp trebs... If you can afford this... get this!!! If you can afford more... get the Shure SE 315. In all the price ranges, Shure is just the perfect bet..."
1029,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are not very naturally fitting headphones, having to adjust the earpiece each time you put them on, and multiple times for active wear like gym sessions. After ~2 months of normal use, the right side earpiece intermittently stopped working, then a week later broke altogether."
1030,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best earphones ever! Awesome sound quality, been using these for years and I'm a dedicated fan. They've also improved the model so that damaging the wires through pulling won't happen any more."
1031,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These iems provide amazing isolation with a proper seal, and have amazing bass which they are known for. The build quality is superb with the removable cable."
1032,3.0 out of 5 stars,i have always loved Shure headphones. However this latest purchase i am still not sure about. I love the sound but i am not to excited about the fit of the headphones. i am still trying to get used to the cord going up around the ear. It might just take a little time.
1033,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215 are very, very nice and worth every cent! Fantastic well balanced sound and well thought out and balanced as well. After I finally figured out the red dot is on the right plug and started compressing the foam before insertion, I was set for a pleasant listening experience. I rate them favorably with my Sennheiser HD590 headphones, which is amazing!"
1034,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome, used it for church and no regrets"
1035,3.0 out of 5 stars,The foam earpieces feel etchy and perhaps rubber inner earpiece would be better. Sound quality is disappointing.
1036,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I use earbuds to run and workout at the gym. These are awkward to put on but I am used to wearing the wire over my ear (have done so for years with this brand and another). The problem with this particular pair of earbuds is that the cord is very stiff so when it curves over the ear, the rigidity bothers the outside of my ear. It is Ok for 5-10 minutes but then after that, it becomes super duper uncomfortable. I have tried to not curve it around my ear but they are not designed to be worn that way so it doesn't work (they fall out). I have tried various ways of bending the wire so it doesn't keep rubbing me in the same spot... Nope. I give up. Too bad, the sound quality and noise cancelling is pretty good. Maybe it is just how my ears are shaped, I don't know. But I figured I would write this review in case it helps someone. Had the cord been more flexible or not as thick, it would probably have been fine."
1037,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very dissatisfied with these pairs of headphones. I am not an audiophile but I was hoping for a pair that offers decent quality and a considerable build, but what I got was something else.
Pros:
Long cable for tall people or place it in the backpack and it'll be fine.
Con:
Sound nearly identical like the earphones that come with the iPhone except slight bass boost.
Uncomfortable ear design unless you have ears like dumbo. Tried all the sizes and I have an average ear size.
Wires that go around your ear won't stay in place.I had to constantly bend the wire, which is meant to do that, in order to keep it in place.
The little pouch it comes with is worthless, it broke when I was headed to the the airport just by walking and having it hooked to my belt making me loose the headphones

Please becareful of this earphone. I highly do not recommend them"
1038,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love these! I'm a drummer and I am not a big fan of floor wedges so in ears were a must! They have great sound quality and the right amount of bass. I've heard things that I have never heard before on stage. These are a great piece of equipment definitely a must buy!
1039,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cables were a little stiff out of the box and headphones do require a few hours of burn in time. But these are the best headphones in the $100 range that I've heard. These are my second pair.

1043,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't ask for more for this product. I love it so much. The sound quality is the best for its line. However, for the first time user you will find it's hard to put in your ear due to its unique model. I love it especially for studying. The voice isolation works really well."
1044,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the sound quality of these. Great isolation and great bass along with amazing middle and highs.. you won't be wrong to buy these
1045,4.0 out of 5 stars,"it's ok if you are having the first experience with this kind of monitor.
I hope to upgrade to the 2 or 3 ways in ear
but it is ok"
1046,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Yeah, they look a little goofy. It takes some time to figure out which ear sleeve size is right (and if you use the foam ones, be ready to replace every few months). The cord easily tangles, especially when it's cold...

But the sound is great. Very well-balanced. With the foam earpieces, all sorts of stuff could be happening outside and I wouldn't notice. I use these instead of earplugs for flights across the Atlantic. On my last flight, these were playing something loudly and I almost didn't notice the person sitting next to me attempting to pickpocket me. True story."

1054,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My current favorite headphones are my over the ear Audeze LCD2s, which I generally listen to at home or work with my Meridian Explorer DAC. I've been in the market, however, for some decent in ear monitors (IEMs) for fitness use. While the greatest audio fidelity possible is a far greater concern than cost for me when listening at home, I'm willing to sacrifice some quality when exercising if it saves a few hundred dollars because I'm generally listening to lower quality compressed files stored on my phone or streaming from Amazon Prime Music anyways. By no means did I expect to find a pair of IEMs equivalent to my LCD2s at any price point; I think I'd have better luck seeing my Prius outpace a Ferrari. What I wanted (and arguably needed) was something that didn't constantly leave me on the verge of losing my gym membership for randoming shouting obscenities at the pitiful sound quality of my current gym IEMs. Besides that, I needed a pair of IEMs that could stay securely in place while bearing a hurricane load of sweat and movement.

I fruitlessly reviewed every ""sport"" earbud on the market and found largely disappointing reviews. It then dawned on me that stage musicians sweat like ecstasy junkies at a rave in Death Valley and their IEMs always seem to stay in place. Altering my search queries, I quickly found the Shure SE215 and related higher end models. At this point in my buying habits I generally convince myself that money is no object and buy the highest end model of a given item. Still being slightly hesitant of their long term durability in harsh environmental conditions and bearing the knowledge that they'd be often left in areas much more labile to theft than my LCD2s (e.g., my car), I convinced myself to start low and work my way up the price ladder until I found what I desired.

Needless to say, my search stopped at the SE-215. These headphones offer easily 60-70% the quality of my Audeze LCD2s at roughly 10% the cost. That's a sacrifice worth making in my opinion. Like many others have recommended here, you should try all the supplied ear tips provided to get the best fit and sound. I've had equal success with the foam and rubber/silicone(?) tips staying in place during vigorous exercise, but I feel the bass response is exponentially better with the rubber tips. Additionally, these IEMs definitely benefit from some burn in time.

A word of warning to outdoor athletes, these definitely isolate you to a great degree from external noise. I'm still hesitant to run in congested traffic areas with more than minimal volume because of this.

So long story short if you require some secure IEMs that withstand any degree of sweat and movement and provide decent enough sound quality to keep you pumped up through your workout, the SE-215 do not disappoint. And keep in mind saying these are decent is a strong compliment considering I'm used to listening to a $1000+ pair of cans with a dedicated DAC at home."
1055,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good
1056,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these with expectations that they would provide clear highs and enhanced bass. The bass part is great. It definitely is deep and a pleasure to listen to.

The highs and the soundstage are what I find issues with. These headphones provide a more narrow soundstage, so the music generally stays in the center of your head. The highs are also muffled or have a veil. The right ear piece did a bit of crackling but by moving it around I got it to stop.

I really liked the foam buds that came with this. They really seal out the sound."

1060,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the Shure E2c for a good while and loved them. They got stolen and I found these crazy cheap. They outperform the E2c's, in my opinion, especially in the mids range.

If you can find these for around $70 like I did, you can't find a better set from any other brand! Even at $99 that I frequently see there are only a 1 or 2 other choices that are comparable. Each with it's own set of strengths and weaknesses."
1061,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently replaced my E3 in ears with these because i lost my E3s. they are single driver instead of dual driver. but other then that the comfort is the same and they sound grab. since they are single driver i would only Recommend these for singers or personal use. they just won't give you what you need if your using them for Guitar bass keys or drums. well they will but will surely distort.
all and all i knew what i was getting and i am happy with this product.

ow small side note. They added a clip to the case which i am a big fan of (if my E3s had that i wouldn't have lost them)"
1062,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was using the original iPhone earphones for over 5 years. I decided to purchase this earphone based on many internet reviews and I'm very glad i did it. The sound quality is superb compared to my last earphone and the noise isolating is fantastic. Im using it right now, wile I'm studying and my neighbors are not disturbing me anymore. It is good to listen classic music, Hip-Hop, electronic, rock'n roll, reggae, etc.
One of my main goals was to turn down my music volume, specially wile I'm at the gym (they put the environment sound to loud) cause i don't want to be deaf. Mission accomplished!! Its working perfectly. I can run or workout and set the volume beneath 20% (using my iPod nano 6th generation). It is not coming out wile I'm running and the sweating is not a problem anymore.
The only con is the comfort of wearing it. Despite being way better than the iPhone earphones still a earphone so it take a wile till you get used to it.
Conclusion: The internet reviews are right. This is the best earphones available under U$ 100."

I am still pleased with the sound quality and noise isolation of these ear buds. The problem for me is the shape. They are kind of flat and nestle into the ear. However, particularly in my right ear, they bump up against a bone and become uncomfortable in about 1 hour. I'm sure they are fine for some people, but I wish Shure would return to the old ear bud shape."

1067,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sounding earphones under $500...i can hear everything in detail now :-) love shure products...money well spent.
1068,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is really bad quality.
Used it 5 days, and one side is broken.
The wire is really bad.
Don't buy it, not worth it."
1069,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing IEMs. Worth every penny. Sweet sound signature, great comfort for an IEM, great isolation .Soundstage is nice too. Sturdy build quality. Cables are not flimsy at all. Overall, it is a great product from shure."
1070,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was excited to try these since I read good reviews about them. They sound pretty good. The bass is good, but the mids are slightly muddy which causes it to sound a little distant and muffled. Despite that I would have love to have kept them because they are better than a lot of other earbuds. However, trying to the replace the eartips is a pain! I followed the manufactures suggestion to freeze the entire earbuds (yes you read that right freeze the electronics, but not for the 24 hours the manufacturer suggested) It worked, however, after they warm up the eartips get to tight again again. After couple of eartip swaps, literally 3 hours after I opened the box, the plastic nozzle connecting the earbud to the eartip broke off. I can't justify replacing this item since the plastic is so brittle."
1071,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you ride a motorcycle and would like to listen to music while not losing your hearing due to wind noise and excessive volume these earpieces are for you. I purchased them simply because my previous pair of earbuds broke due to an intensive cleaning by the washing machine and was not looking for real sound isolation at the time. When I first put them in though I could hear nothing going on around me, they keep out noise better than the foam earplugs I have floating around the garage. They sit inside of your ear and don't stick out horizontally like some earbuds do and I had to try put my helmet on as I had been looking for a way to hear music on the road for a while. They. Fit. Perfectly. They don't fall out, the volume is great, and it keeps wind noise at a minimum. This all depends on helmets of course but I have a Shoei Qwest helmet and no windscreen. I have not tried riding above 70 MPH but anything up to that point seems to work. If you have a windscreen on your bike I am sure the results would be even better."
1072,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are good for a 100
1073,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound good if you can get them in your ears and have them stay there. The fit and shape of these is now pretty outdated. They are supposed to go around the back of your ear and drop down, but that makes them uncomfortable. The design makes them look like hearing aids. The sound is better than most earbuds, with a pretty flat frequency curve and decent low end bass, almost to subwoofer levels."
1074,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Love them ..they are awesome!!
1075,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update, my left earbud stopped working. It seems the connection went bad and its not the wire but the earbud part. Now I have to send this in for repair. Not a very well constructed earbud because they are so fragile.

I had the old Shure headphones from back in 2006 that finally broke at the connector so I needed a new replacement. These sound great with a good balance of sound. Overall sound is much better than my old pair. The wire that goes over the ear is cumbersome, I'm still not used to it but once you bend the wire near the ear and cinch the rubber thing up its secure. I expect the speaker part to last awhile, and if the wire goes bad you just have to replace that part which is great. Approved."
1076,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I loveD the sound, and the fit, but if it works less than a year it's just not of very well made."
1077,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Today I heard my music for the first time. Apparently, I've tolerated bad headphones for far too long. I listened to Knifes ""Silent Shout"" on the train ride home tonight and I wanted to hand the phones to other passengers and say ""you've got to hear this!"" I'm a Shure evangelist from this point forward."
1078,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been through at least 15-20 pair of in-ear headphones over the past decade or so. Over the past couple of years I'd settled into my all-time favorite -- the Grado iGis -- but decided to try out a new pair after losing those and being unable to grab a new pair because they've been constantly sold out here on Amazon. This is a solid pair of headphones in terms of construction and overall sound quality, but the lack of definition in the highs and the harshness in the high mids leave much to be desired. I also found that the wideness of the stereo field is a bit shallower than the iGis and other buds that I've owned at the same price point. Additionally, I'm not a fan of the design element that requires you to wrap the cords behind your ears. There was also an issue getting these to output sound from both ears when I plugged it into my iPhone 5s, although it worked fine plugged in to the 3.5mm jack on my macbook pro, so I'm not sure if it's meant to be compatible with the 5s. Looks like I'll have to continue my search for some good (hopefully temporary) iGi replacements."
1079,4.0 out of 5 stars,Study build. Takes a bit to get accustomed to the fit of the memory foam ear buds.
1080,4.0 out of 5 stars,"great sound isolation.
very good music reproduction.
the fit takes time to get used to........very weird feeling at first.

i would recommend these to a friend or enemy."
1081,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for my hubby while he's gaming... he can crank it up & I don't have to hear it! He says they have good bass sound too. Did mention the different end piece sizes run a little big, but they came with a size that fit well still."
1082,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these in February of 2014. They sound great, but around September, one earphone and then the other began to short out. Eventually one was completely dead. I returned them for repair in October. It's now August of 2015. I've had the repaired headphones and the left one is beginning to short out again. I'll give them one more shot at repair, but it seems to me that the way the cable wraps around the back of the ear will put stress on the connection. Seems like an inherent design flaw that may cause some of these to short out.

The cheaper headphone, SE112, has a different connection design and may not be impacted. All of the more expensive Shure models seem to have the same design."
1083,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a drummer, I was looking for an affordable quality transition from over ears to in ears for work in the studio and live. I would highly recommend this to any drummer on a budget looking to make the switch."
1084,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice noise cancelling earphones for a long trip
1085,4.0 out of 5 stars,"sound good but I expected a little more from them, I have had hearing aids that have a price less than or equal improved performance.
example, the ear pods"
1086,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These worked great the first year until I noticed a tear in the plastic where it molds to your ear. I decided to get them fixed and found out I had to pay for shipping. As long as they were fixed I didn't mind. When I received them back, they only worked for a few weeks until one side of the earphones stopped working. I had to ship them again (thankfully for free this time) and wait another couple of weeks. I received them again only to find out one side was broken again when I put them on! This is my third time within the past few months that I have to get it fixed. I am not impressed with the longevity of this product and don't recommend it unless you want to go through the hassle of continuously sending them for repair. It's unfortunate that I know that the cable is what's broken and yet they require me to send the whole product in. Other brands like sol republic send you new ones free of charge without the hassle of having to ship your earphones. Also I encountered a rude person in repair services that told me my shipping slip would come that day but ended up coming a couple of days later. I am not happy with this brand or product."
1087,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've worn these for over a month now and I'm still not used to the over-ear set up. I wear glasses and tend to wear my hair down at work so it's always a pain to put them on and take them off when I need to go to the printer and walk away from my desk. If the sound quality was better I wouldn't mind the tradeoff but it feels like my Klipsch S4's have more noticeable sound qualities than these Shure's do. If I were to get a do-over, I would get the Bose earbuds instead of these since they're around the same pricepoint"
1088,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these so I could use my Shure 535's wirelessly. It was easy to pair with an iMac, but the audio quality is horrendous. It manages to make my lossless iTunes library sound worse than telephone hold music. It sounded better when paired with an iPhone, but still not great. From the Shure website: ""The RMCE-BT1 uses the SBC codec, which is neither high resolution nor low-latency."" So it's not possible to use higher quality codecs (AAC or aptX) with this Bluetooth adapter, you're basically stuck with phone call quality audio."
1089,5.0 out of 5 stars,2nd time purchasing headphones from this brand. The upgrades on this version are great
1090,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was in need of quality ear buds that have the high tech capabilities and functions for studio work and stage stuff. Very pleased. You will not be disappointed!!
1091,5.0 out of 5 stars,great
1092,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product. Great sound. Great ear fit. Delivery as promised.
1093,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sounds of these headphones. The only complaint I have is if the plug twists in the jack slightly there is a brief sound disconnect. I've observed this on some other higher-quality headphones/earphones, so maybe it's to be expected."
1094,4.0 out of 5 stars,Their wires are thicker and I like that you can replace these earplugs if the wires get smashed or torn. The sound is good but they can be a challenge to put in your ear.
1095,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These paired with a high quality mp3 player, gives you ear candy. Despite being small in-ears they pack a lot of good sound and some bass. Great buy. :)"
1096,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an audio enthusiast I have used many sets of headphones from Sennheiser, Bose, Beats, etc. But these Shure earphones/sound monitors are the best I've used so far. They fit comfortably after getting used to and don't look ridiculous but rather inconspicuous. Overall great earphones. 5 Star rating from me."
1097,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelent product
1098,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great, and the buds stay in my ears because of the moldable wire that attaches to my ears even while running. I put them in and don't have to touch them once."
1099,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are AWESOME!!! Only complaint I have is that the sleeves that actually go in the ear are a bit hard to get off, but since you shouldn't be changing them every hour anyways its not a problem."
1100,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wasn't expecting the bass to be as good and was going to eventually get a pair of dual drivers. These convinced me that I'm fine with single-drivers. Great product.
1101,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't recommend these, because they won't use either the AAC codec (which seems like it should be supported) or the aptX codec (which isn't supported by the bluetooth cable) on macOS. Possible they use the AAC codec on iOS and would sound good there, but the SBC codec that gets used on macOS is noticeably worse than ACC/aptX.

Pairing was easy and build quality is great. They are a beautiful looking pair of earphones. If they supported the aptX codec these would probably be the top bluetooth earphone at this price point.

I had high hopes - figured they'd at least be able to use AAC. I'll be returning these and holding out to try the MA750 wireless."
1102,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound. When my $350 monitors stopped working, I got these. These sound just as good (possibly better, but I am unable to hear both at the same time... since my other pair, which goes for $400 NOW on amazon,, STOPPED working) for a third of the price."
1103,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome awesome awesome. Simply awesome lol
1104,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound incredible.....and the ""over the ear"" design helps them to stay put."
1105,5.0 out of 5 stars,Vocals are very clear and headphones fit comfortably in my ears.
1106,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am speechless! If you want to listen to the music you must buy one, and if you just want to hear the music don't buy them, seriously, you will just complain about something not right...... I am glad to spend $100 for a QUALITY! Absolutely Love them !!!"
1107,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't really used them yet for the intent of stage monitors, but when listening with my laptop music, they are really nice. Takes a little adjustment to get them just right in your ear, but overall, seems like high quality at an affordable price."
1108,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before getting these I had Klipsch Image S4's, which I loved but were not that well built. The headphone jack on them came lose making them useless, after only 7 months of use. The Shure's are much better built, with a strong, thick (but not cumbersome) cord. The heads also swivel on the cable meaning that they don't get tangled. The way you put them on seems weird at first (in, then up, over, and down the back of your ear) but you get used to it quickly, it's very comfortable, and it seems almost impossible that they could fall out.

Sound quality seems to be around the same as the Klipsch, but I do think that vocals sound a little crisper, and they tend to emphasis little things (like soft high-hats or piano in the background of a song) that I never noticed with the Klipsch. All in all, they're a great, and I would probably buy from Shure again."
1109,5.0 out of 5 stars,best earbuds ever - worth the price
1110,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great bass, full, round sound - overall much better value for money than the Etymotics so if you don't need precise sound and tonal clarity in the mids and highs, these are the phones for you"
1111,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound like a quality Shure product, but I find them too uncomfortable to wear. No, I'm not wearing them with the cord sticking out as if they were iPhone earphones. I simply find the body to be unnecessarily large such that it puts pressure on some parts of my outer ear. This becomes painful after just an hour. The cables also have a very thick plastic jacket that is not very pliable. They do have a beefier connector between the earphone body and cable than my Westone UM Pro30s which I like."
1112,5.0 out of 5 stars,They arrived on time and are perfect. they stay in my ears and don't fall out. Took a bit of getting used to to put them in.
1113,5.0 out of 5 stars,these earphones have been great for the gym. they are comfortable and have a durable construction. i would recommend these for anyone looking for comfy earbuds that stay in your ears.
1114,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a good pair of headphones pretty good but they aren't going to sound good on there own. I had to plug them into an amp to get them to sound the way I thought a $100 pair of headphones should sound. They just weren't loud enough for me and to bass was differently not as good as I expected after doing some research on them before I bought them. I also took away another star because one of the cushions that came installed on the headphones was smashed and it still hasn't popped back out to normal and I'm not sure if it will (its the medium sized one and those are the ones that fit my ears the best).

Maybe I like something different than other people in my headphone because I have some Nuforce NE-600X that I got from mass drop for like $10 and I think they sound better off my phone without the amp. If I would have tried the SE215s before buying them I might not have bought them cause I don't think they are worth the price.

I might return them but I'm going to keep using them for a few more days to see if I change my mind."
1115,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received my Shure SE215-K in Singapore today and i have to say that the sound is warm and i can hear a lot of minor details which i could not in the stock iPhone earphones. However, the cables are too long and slightly heavy."
1116,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Lasted long enough to not be eligible for return/replacement. They worked well until they stopped working, <3 months."
1117,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using Shure headphones for my I-Pod for several years now, and this model is the best yet. They deliver an amazingly full, clear sound. Using these headphones, I hear nuances in songs that I never noticed before. The bass sound is incredible. I would highly recommend them."
1118,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, these sound great, but the way they fit in your ear is a bit awkward. I would prefer something more straight forward."
1119,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, these have a wonderful sound to them. It took a bit to get the perfect fit with these, but that seems to be the norm for me on any in-ears that are not molds. I think that these are toward the top of the list in my mind for in-ears at this price point. I am also always very happy with Shure's cable quality across their entire range. These things last!"
1120,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I put these on some 535's and can honestly say this is the first Shure product I was actually disappointed in. The microphone in this is horrible, you cannot use it anywhere that has any background noise because it picks up every sound. The mic has no noise canceling what so ever.
The voice that announces the battery, is WAY too loud, deafening in my opinion. I actually power them on before I'll put them in my ears because of how loud she is.

I would not recommend if you're going to be using it at all to talk on the phone.
For simply listening to music, they work great. I'd give them 4 stars, but the lady who announces battery life is still too loud.

I still love my 535's but this product is not worth the money."
1121,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for the convenience of wireless, and the quality of Shure. Been using Shure products for about 5 years now and have loved them all. This one meets my expectations overall, excels in some areas, but fall short in one. Like I mentioned earlier, I love the convenience of these being wireless. The bluetooth feature to connect to two devices and simultaneously switch back and forth depending on which one is playing something / has a phone call is great. I used to have to disconnect and reconnect my old wireless headphones all the time when switching between devices. I especially like how you route the wire behind your ear to kinda hook it around your ear and keep it more secure, just like on the regular wired Shure earphones. Other bluetooth earphones I looked at did not do this, and I was concerned they would fall out all the time. This is one reason I bought these Shures over others like Jaybirds or Bose.

When you turn on the BT1 wireless headphones, you hear ""power on -- battery (how many hours you have left on your battery)"". She always says ""battery: 6 hours"" when it's fully charged, but I've had this going for 8 sometimes upwards of 10 hours without dying on me. Just be sure to always charge them every night if you're a heavy user like me.

Sound quality to me sounds very similar to my pair of regular SE215s with the 3.5mm wire. I also own SE535s, and of course these are nowhere near that quality sound-wise. I'd say they're a small step below regular wired SE215s, which are probably my pick for best bang-for-your-buck earphones on the market the past few years.

One downside is that after about a month and a half, the clip that you put on the (I assume) battery pack and clip to your shirt has broken. It's made out of plastic, so I kinda wish it was a more durable plastic or even some sort of metal for better durability. I contacted Shure support about this, but it's the weekend right now so I haven't heard a response yet. Will update this review later if I get a response.

When the clip was in tact, I really liked how it kept the microphone + play/pause & volume rocker piece kinda floating between my shoulder and jaw for me to easily reach and use. People I've talked to on the phone while wearing these say I sound like I'm speaking on speakerphone, so take that into account if you expect to use these a lot while on the phone.

Overall I'd recommend these."
1122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve owned a few different audiophile headphones over the years, phonak audeo pfe215, shure e500, e535, vmoda m100, my review is coming from the point of view of someone who appreciates good audio quality. These headphone strike a good balance of performance, affordability and ease of use. The audio is great...for a Bluetooth headphone. There is a little fidelity lost going from the transition of the wired shure 215 to the wireless model. The question is, is the reduction in quality enough to still make this a worthwhile purchase? My opinion of course is a resounding yes. The reason is simple, shure has managed to keep enough of the sound quality that their wired headphones are known for. The soundstage is smaller compared to the wired model, the bass is tight and forceful, but not boomy. The midrange is forward, so things like singers voices come through very clearly without having to overcome boomy lows or overpowering highs. The highs are a little recessed, which for most music styles I listen to isnt a issue. I listen to mostly r&b, soul, jazz, rock and rap. The battery life has been better than advertised, yesterday I was using them at 30% volume and after 7.5 hours, I still had 70% remaining. I’d imagine that if you listen to music at higher volume, your experience may be different. The answer to wether I’d recommend these over other Bluetooth headsets is a definite yes. The added bonus is that you can detach these headphones from the cord and use the other shure 5 series or later headphones wirelessly by connecting them to the proprietary Mmcx cable used in all the recent shure headphones."
1123,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got these IEM's yesterday, and I love them! I may not call myself an ""audiophile"". Mainly because I think it's overused and anyone who does lay claim to the title, without either a sound engineering or music degree of some kind, or major studio experience, is being pretentious. That being said, I do have a decent ear. My family is composed of more than it's fair share of musicians, and I happen to be genetically gifted with an ability to hear some things in sound that others apparently do not. I do not have six different pairs of $100+ headphones laying around to compare with. But I have had several pairs of mid-range priced ""premium"" earbuds/IEM's. These have a decent soundstage and excellent separation of high's, mids, and lows. Bass has clarity without losing it's punch. All together I'd say they are a good option at this price point. After all, unless you're listening to FLAC or WAV files (or CD's heheh), on some impressive sound processing hardware, I doubt you'd be able to hear the differences between these and a pair that costs double the money. When using IEM's, most of us are listening to either streaming music or MP3's on mobile devices or laptops. Unless you've got the rare kind of ear that can differentiate betweem a 320 kbps MP3 and a FLAC file in blind ABX comparison, just get these 'phones and enjoy some great sound.
They come with a nice carrying case which is sturdy enough to actually protect them. The cabling is tough and reinforced at the right points, and they seem to be of good overall build quality, but only time will tell on that count. As stated earlier, they come with more than enough ear-tips to find your perfect fit. There is even a tiny cleaning tool enclosed to help remove any kind of residue buildup.
*ONE WARNING* -because of their shape, I think they might not fit well on someone with small ears. I have (I think) average sized ears for an average sized man. The plastic driver housing is fairly large, and rests in the curve of your ear. The actual ear canal junction (all important with IEM's) is very customizable since they come with a variety of tips, but the large driver housing is either going to sit comfortably on your ear, or it's not."
1124,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I both love and hate this product. They work great for workouts and very casual listening, but with any type of critical listening you can hear a faint hiss in the background. I am using these with an SE215 so I would imagine any higher models will be even more sensitive."
1125,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm waiting cautiously, as I've seen a few people say that the earphones developed problems after a few months. I bought mine exactly three months ago, but so far they are great. I was first pairing with an iPhone 6, then have been pairing with an iPhone X for the last month or so. The pairing has consistently worked, and the connection has been excellent too: it works for real from 35+ feet away (for example, keeps working no problem while I'm walking around from room to room, including when I round a corner and signal must go through one or more walls), and it works for hours on end without any even momentary drops of sound signal. On the latter point, there ARE signal drops sometimes in first couple mins after pairing, as if some sort of buffering or similar needs to get nicely established in the connection. But I have found that after about the first song, the connection is flawless. Battery life is 6+ hours on full charge, including when using the earphones in very cold temperatures skiing. Sound quality is exactly the same as Shure modular earbuds when hard-wired, namely way better than any other Bluetooth earphones I've found - and I've looked far and wide."
1126,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Superior sound for most genres of music. Isolates sound very well. Multiple ear tips so you can tailor your fit. Once they are in, they don't come out.
Cons: comfort-the hard plastic nestles well into the outer ear, but will eventually cause fatigue. I don't recommend sleeping in them. The wires bend over the ears, which takes some getting used to fit-wise. Ultimately, I had these earphones about 15months before one of the buds started going in and out. This is with light usage (about 5 hours a week) and careful cord care. Finally, my fellow eyeglass wearers, there isn't much room behind the ear for your glasses and these wires; my eyeglass earpieces rest on top of the wires.

I've owned multiple brands of earphones of varying quality and have yet to find a pair that last much past a year. These earbuds are great, so long as you know going in you will be replacing them in about a years time."
1127,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had these for around 6 months now and am still very happy. I have tried a number of earphones in the past, usually in the $100 range, including the Bose SoundSport. These are by far the best. The sound is very well balanced. Many earphones either have no bass or way too much bass. These are just right. They seal will in the ears to block out external noise and are are almost as good as ear plugs. This allows for clear sound at less volume. The good seal is also nice for physical activity as it blocks most wind noise. Solid construction is with thick cords. So many earphones have thin cord that are easy to break. Thick cord is a must for those who want to use them during physical activity like running or cycling.

What I like:
* Fantastic sound over good frequency range. From electronic to classical to spoken word, all clean.
* Seal well in ears to block outside noise.
* Comfortable for long hours.
* Long cord.
* Heavy duty cord that can take continuous daily use.
* Buds themselves can pivot along the wire allowing them to be positioned in ear correctly.
* When worn as directed (with the wire wrapped around the ear) they stay firmly in your ears and don't need to be adjusted over time."
1128,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a fan of the Shure SE215's - this is my second pair. My first set works fine, I ordered this pair because I wanted one wired set and one wireless set. After having owned a wired set for a few years, I can say a lot of good about them. Strong noise isolation, good audio quality, great build quality... easily the best earbud in its price class.

But you can read reviews on the SE215's on their main page. I'd instead like to focus on the killer aspect of this new model - the bluetooth experience.

For people interested in using these headphones for music, or placing personal calls - they work great. They're particularly good in the gym, where the light weight and formable wire portion come together to make a very comfortable experience, and Shure's background with professional musicians gives you the confidence that you can sweat in them without creating issues. The only minor annoyance I found is that if you want to skip songs the control is a bit wonky - it involves holding the volume up or down button for a few seconds - but that's pretty normal and keeps the number of buttons down. So unless you're always skipping songs, if either of these are what you're really buying these headphones for just press ""Buy It Now"" - you won't regret it.

If you're trying to use them at Work on the other hand, you may run afoul of what I think is a critical defect. Shure knows that making/receiving hands-free calls are major reasons people would buy this product, and yet... they don't provide a ""mute"" option. That's right - if you're on a conference call with your wireless headset, you will still likely have to hold your cell phone because you will need to access the mute button. This significantly limits the functionality for me, because if I have to turn on my phone every time I want to mute/unmute I might as well use wired headphones and save myself the recharge hassle."
1129,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first purchased these several years ago, I recall thinking at the time that they were fantastic. I enjoyed them for two years, then switched to a cheaper pair (Vsonic VSD3's) for a short while, which sounded comparable. After purchasing a second pair of these shure's when the much cheaper V's broke, I was horrified. The sound I remember fondly was now shrill and irritating, despite my fiddling with the high registers on my equalizer to try to tame it a bit. The mids were pleasantly forward and warm (as I remembered), but the bass somehow managed to be simultaneously both depressingly thin and alarmingly booming. I had a headache after half an hour.

Not sure if the design has changed since the first time I bought them, or maybe I got a bum pair, but man, stay away if that's the sound you get for that price. Check out the VSD3's, they sound excellent and cost half of what the Shures do: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AHU1LNC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

That being said, I'll give the Shure's points for build quality. Mine survived two years of college life fraught with hours of use each day, spills of God only knows what, and just about every sort of physical abuse my roommates and I could inadvertently dish out. The Vsonics are still going after eight months, but I have to frequently glue the housing on one earbud back to the cable base when it comes loose. Still, it's a chore I'm glad to take for such superb sound at such a reasonable price.

One last little note regardless, DO NOT get the Shures if you live anywhere that's consistently cold. I'm in Chicago, and whenever it dips below 20 or so the cable freezes stiff at awkward angles. Annoying as heck."
1130,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy! Great sound isolation. The sound is nice and balanced. There is the right amount of bass and the highs are clear without being piercing. The ear pieces are very comfortable. This is my first pair of earbuds that I spent over $20 for and don't regret it. Any cheaper ones I tried were either too this sounding or were very artificial bass sounding. These are really clear and you hear everything without any frequencies drowning out others. These are now my main pair to listen with and I listen to music or podcasts all day long at work so comfort and sounding good are very important to me!
1131,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used many headphones across the spectrum covering Sony, Sennheiser, Skullkandy, SoundMagic, etc. After using for more than 6 months now, I am extremely happy with the SE215 headphones.

Design:
Unconventional yet well-researched. I always had issues having in-ears intact while on bed but that is where Shure's unconventional design does magic. Even during workouts in gym, these stick well in the ears.

Sound:
Audio through the SE215 feels like a breeze. Lows, mids and Highs get equal importance. More like a profession studio headset, the music balances between treble and bass. The sound is definitely far better than Beats or Bose in this price range except that the Bass isn't as punchy as Sony XBs or Beats.

To add to all the above, noise isolation is 100%. Even without music, barely any sound gets through. Accessories and extra tips provided pretty much make these in-ears the best in range. I would recommend these to everyone."
1132,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound pretty good. I am spoiled by my Sennheisers. I use them to monitor my electronic/acoustic drums. They do a great job to block out most of the drums volume, I use the mixer and some mics to let in only the sweet stuff. Experiment with the foam plugs, I had to use the small ones to get a good fit. They are a little hard to change out so don't give up. At a closer look the engineering that went into these is amazing, im glad i got see through."
1133,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones, because I moved into a new space at work. The new space has surprisingly loud A/C units running full time. Sony and Bose noise cancelling headphones were unable to significantly reduce the noise.

These earbuds include 6 pairs of sleeves: three sizes, one set in foam and one in rubber. The foam sleeves are exactly like foam earplugs. They do a great job of expanding to fill your ear canal and block a great deal of noise - even without music playing. These can take a little while to get used to. I've been sleeping with this type of earplug for years and had no difficulty acclimating to these.

The sound is great. They sound significantly better than my slightly more expensive Sony noise cancelling headphones.

As other reviewers have noted, the noise isolation is so complete that you should not use these in an environment where they might cause a safety issue. For me, I had to invest in a mirror for my desk. I didn't like how easily people snuck up on me. Others didn't like the fact that they could be talking to me for quite some time before realizing that I hadn't heard a word. :)"
1134,5.0 out of 5 stars,"About three and a half years ago, I got fed up buying pair after pair of $20 earphones after each one broke on me. I decided to spend a little more for quality earphones and don't regret it at all.

Sound quality is great. I can hear everything and the bass is amazing in these buds.

I use my earphones at work everyday for at least 4 hours and my pair has finally stopped working out of one ear. Along the way, I may have put these in the wash too...I also use these when I'm out doing yardwork or playing drums.

I'm not a studio producer or anything, I'm just a dude that likes playing music and listening to music. These give me sound quality that I think is worth the $100, and are durable beyond belief.

10/10. Once the ones I have completely break, I'll be ordering another pair of these."
1135,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good: Battery life, Controls, Weight, Quality and Bluetooth connection is quick to connect and never drops. Also the microphone and call quality is exceptional for both me and the person on the receiving end. Works with all Shure SE model earphones.

Bad: I find the cables a little longer than they need to be, Holding the volume button for 3 secs to skip tracks is a bit tedious."
1136,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For $100, these sound amazing and do a great job of blocking out ambient sound. They are comfortable in my ears for hours at a time and stay firmly in place thanks to the cables that wrap behind your ears. I will reiterate that these really sound fantastic. The only catch is that the cable built quality is poor. This is the third pair of Shure earphones I have purchased and the cables invariably fail within a year of purchase. One earphone or the other will start to cut out when the cable is twisted in a certain way and then eventually that earphone cuts out all together. I had them replaced via Shure's warranty one time and bought a replacement cable the other two times. It is very nice that the cables are replaceable independent of the earbuds, but the replacement cables are about 1/3 the cost of the whole earphone set and you have to go through the hassle of ordering and replacing them. These are great earphones, but I really wish they would fix the cable issue or offer cheaper replacement cables."
1137,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The SHURE 215 headphone set is my second set of noise-cancelling headphones from SHURE. My first set was the SHURE 425 EAC model. I was expecting the same headphone, but they are not. The SE 215 design is set to twist into your ear. This is not too much of a problem, but it does irritate me. The sound is good, and you get very good customer service. As long as you have access to your invoice for the headphones, you are pretty much guaranteed a strong warranty. I accidently broke an earpiece last month. I called SHURE, and was told to send it in with a printed invoice. Since I had purchased the SE215 from Amazon.com, it was easy to print a copy. The piece was replaced quite quickly and without any hassle. I have not had the headphones long enough to give a strong write up on the SE215, but I have no problem providing good comments on the SHURE company itself. Also, the 425 EACs were awesome. I just wish I could have purchased another set of those headphones. I had used them for 7 years while riding my Harley Wide Glide and could hear my music very cleanly and without hearing my exhaust note. I do not have the same statement for the SE 215s. When I wear my full-face helmet, I can hear the music cleanly, but then my ears get irritated from the headphones rubbing against the helmet intermittently.

Overall, I currently say that if you wish to wear the headphones while riding your Harley, you will be fine; but you will not have 100% noise reduction. If you wear a 3/4 or full-face helmet, you will hear the music cleanly, but might experience ear irritation. For most other purposes, you should be fine with the headphones. As for customer service, provided you have your invoice, the company is VERY ACCOMODATING.

I have now had the earphones for a few months and have gotten used to wearing them. Trust me, it does take a while to get used to wearing them properly. When worn properly, the headphones DO cut out the exhaust note of my Harley. And, the music sounds clear and interference-free. SO, for those of you who wish to purchase these headphones, know you are gettng quality headphones and quality customer service with your purchase.

I have now had the headphones for a full riding season and I am very happy with them."
1138,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing.

I have had several pairs of other headphones in the past from beats and Klipsch. I really enjoyed my Klipsch s4i, s4i-rugged, and a5is however I kept having a problem with the cables going bad after several years. I set out to purchase a new pair of headphones after my s4i-rugged cables went bad way outside of the warranty. I wanted a pair that I could replace the cable once it wears out, and I found these. I am very, very pleased with these. The sound quality is great, very crisp highs and clean mids. The bass is responsive, however not overwhelming. If you like ALOT of bass these headphones are not for you.

The Sound-Isolation is amazing, and the whole world becomes engulfed in the music when I wear these. If you work somewhere that is noisy, these are great to block out the background noise. I can not wait to use these on my next flight!

I want to get into more high-res audio, and I feel like personally these were a great baby step in the right direction!"
1139,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are better than I expected! I have used several different pair of earbuds in the past playing on stage. These are the best I've ever used! The sound is clear and unbelievably loud. In one band that I play in we have sennheiser wireless in ear monitors and the earbuds that came with them are terrible. It took these earbuds to make me realize what I had not been hearing. I used to have to crank my personal monitor pack all the way to the max to hear anything thru the old earbuds....now I keep it a little below half way on the volume and it is blasting my ears! In another band that I play in we have Shure in ear monitors but I know the stock earbuds that came with them don't work this well. Thank you to Shure for making an affordable earbud that works great! I am also impressed with the feel of the product. They seem to be built very well. The cables are all heavier and I think they will last a long time! I would recommend these to anybody wanting a good quality earbud at a reasonable price..at least for on stage use where hearing what you are playing is crucial.
1140,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. I have had them for 3 weeks, the sound is just excellent. Great earbuds for the money (90 bucks)"

1143,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have headphones on about 80% of my day, every day. I needed some earbuds that could hold up a quality standard set by the headphones I use with my PC, these have met fit my bill perfectly, & for under $100. I couldn't have asked for more."
1144,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound about as good as $20 Soundpeat QY7's. My audio source was Spotify set to extreme quality being played on a Droid Turbo 2 for what it's worth. Maybe an extreme audiophile listening to CD or lossless digital audio through an amplifier would disagree with me but using my setup there was almost no difference in audio quality. The QY7's have a little more bass which audiophiles tend to feel is over the top, but I actually like it better for all genres of music. The cord is really cool, the design of the buds are great. They're very comfortable and light. They disappear almost entirely into your ear when worn so you can lay your head sideways on a pillow and still listen comfortably. I just don't think they're worth the price tag or having a cord when compared to competitors."
1145,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yah, these in-earphones are pricey. I run 6 days a week and they are amazing for running. no need adjusting your earphones because the sweat keeps making them slip out. the sound quality is amazing. and they are completely sound-isolating. Great investment!"
1146,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading all the positive reviews, I thought these would be great! I was very disappointed in the overall fit. They didn't work for me; couldn't wear them for long, they hurt! Had to send them back."
1147,1.0 out of 5 stars,Garbage. Headphones are fine but this Bluetooth cable is trash. Not only is it $100 of the total price but it has worse range and dropouts than $10 MMCX cables on aliexpress and doesn't even support aptx. Buy the se215 headphones wired edition with a $10 MMCX Bluetooth cable anywhere else and you'll be better off.

1165,1.0 out of 5 stars,"THE SELLER:
Bought these in early February. First pair was purchased from a company that ended up sending me weight-loss pills instead of these headphones. I returned them and got a refund. Second company was DailyDealzLA. I noticed as soon as I opened them that something was not right with these ""new"" headphones. The normal manufacturer wrapping and cable management was not present at all or appeared disheveled. The foam earbuds were also not as ""clean"" as I would have expected. I left seller feedback about how the product did not appear to be ""new"" as indicated and was informed that these may have been opened by a customer and returned to Amazon, intermingling them with new stock.

I accepted that they might be fine as the foam earbuds did not appear to have earwax or clear signs that they were used contiguously. I noticed they worked fine at the time and accepted them as they were. I opted to up my feedback, as I was quite frustrated having tried to get these twice, and felt that my concerns were abated as the headphones did look alright aside from packaging and slight ""wear"" on the foam.

It'll become apparent, soon enough, why I mention this.

THE LACK OF USE:
I proposed to my, now, wife back in October of last year and have spent the last 6+ months planning a wedding, participating in said wedding, going on a honeymoon, and almost immediately looking for and finding a new house. I have put much of my music playing on hiatus and when I was practicing with my band I was using a pair of old Shure in-ear headphones as I kept forgetting these. While I was not using them, they remained, untouched and secure, in the carrying pouch that comes with them. The cable was coiled in the same diameter as that pouch.

THE BREAK:
Tonight I participated in band practice for the first time in a while and actually remembered to bring these. I plug them in and to my annoyance the left earbud is cutting out and crackling. After confirming the issue was not with the audio extension cable I was using and trying it with alternative audio sources I determined it was an issue with the left earbud, only. Having never tried to remove the cable from the earbuds, something that is possible but never seemed to be easy to accomplish, I followed instructions online and pulled the cable out of the earbud. The only problem is that the part that SHOULD remain in the earbud come with the cable. It broke several of the tiny wires required for operation (see pictures) and now that earbud won't work at all.

Now, I'm not clumsy, foolish, brash, or violent when dealing with electronics. The last Shure headphones my band purchased have lasted 10-years or more, now. However, these couldn't even last 5-10 uses over the last 6-months without breaking.

This leads me back to the seller...

THE THEORY:
I suspect that the first customer who bought these, for whatever reason, attempted to remove the cable from the buds without reading the instructions or watching videos about doing so. They removed the buds incorrectly, noticed that they damaged the product, and returned it to Amazon saying they were not to their liking or were broken. Amazon added them back to their stock, maybe sent them to DailyDealzLA (I have no idea how all that works), and they were sold to me as ""new"". I believe that the issue was not readily evident, if it was experienced at the start, because when used with both headphones, loud-ish rock music, and doing other tasks such as playing music, you couldn't tell with both in. It only became easily noticeable when only having the left earbud in.

It seems like people on Amazon are EXTREMELY quick to review items. I blame Amazon for this as they tend to send e-mails about purchases within a week of the delivery date. Check online for people with similar headphones and you find the same issues I have with my SE215's. It seems the force required to separate the earbuds from the cable is higher than the strength of the substance used to hold the twistable part in place.

THE OUTCOME:
I decided to write this review before contacting Shure about the problem. I will update this review depending on the outcome of that contact. I'm extremely frustrated with my experience with DailyDealzLA, Amazon, and Shure and I sincerely hope that my review of this product, coupled with multiple online experiences that echo my own, will help consumers in their purchase choice."
1166,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. Great sound and noise cancelation. When traveling last week, enjoyed my music during all announcements and never heard a word."
1167,4.0 out of 5 stars,"SOUND
I bought these ear-buds along with one of the Dr. Dre Beats headsets to compare the sound. They were both exactly the same price but the Shure earbuds busted a righteous cap in Dr. Dre's pretentious creation.
The rich, creamy sound coming out of these Shure puppies is amazing. It allows for the correct balance between the bass, the mids, and the highs without any distortion at various volume levels. I couldn't believe it! The Beats earbuds had an ounce of more bass to them but the mids and high's had that cheap tin-can sound. People's voices came off flat and isolated in relation to the other sounds and it didn't take long for the off-pitch ringing to hurt my ears. Even when I tested the prescribed bass-heavy Hip-Hop/Rap songs on both earbuds, the Shure's stomped-stomped-stomped the Beats out of the competition. Shure's bass, which is a fraction less than the Beats, was still excellent and provided for the sound that felt truly SURROUND.

After I found that Shure's were the one for me, I submitted the Shure earbuds to other tests.

NOISE-CANCELLATION
Technically, these are ""sound isolating"" earphones and I don't know how that's different from ""noise cancellation"" but the one thing is true: these earbuds keep the outside noise out and music in. I drove over to my half-deaf grandmother's house just to test this. She likes to get up close and shout all holy-hell about if you'd like to eat. Cue Shure earbuds and stand in shock as grandmother is transformed into David Bowie singing ""Ziggy Stardust"" and holding a spatula. Crazy. I could only hear the music. But it needed more rigorous testing.
I then went to a friends house who keeps a mini-zoo, including guinea pigs. If you've ever heard a guinea pig squeal, you'll remember it forever. ""Wheee! Whee! Wheeeee!"" I looked those noisy suckers right in the face, holding a carrot and daring them to defy the Shures. A tiny bit of the squeal came though - not even enough to notice unless you were, as I was, looking at them. But that might not be Shure's fault; guinea pigs are hyper-sonic furballs from another planet.

FIT-DESIGN
Yes, the design is initially awkward. Yes, there was a moment when I felt like a lab-monkey, given triangle pegs to put in round holes. Yes, I initiated a contest in my family for who could figure it out the quickest. The current record is 2.75 minutes and one person still can't figure it out; it goes to show there's variation as far as personal adjustment to the design. I was right at 4 minutes the first time I put them in, but after 2 days of use, I can whip these puppies in and out of my ears single-handed and almost as fast as any conventional earbud set. It just takes some getting use to, but if you get frustrated, remember: THE SOUND IS WORTH IT.
They do very well at staying put. After my 4 minutes of wrangling, I immediately started bouncing around and trying to dislodge them. In sum: running and jumping will not dislodge them; however, vigorous head-banging and a solid head-blow by a pillow, will.

FEATURES
No features except extra-ordinary sound. There is no control function on the earbuds. This was a little off-putting for me. I like being able to answer calls, adjust the volume, skip tracks, etc., directly from the earbuds. Such features are very convenient if you listen to your smartphone. If you listen to a single-function device like a MP3 player, then it might not be a big deal for you. Still, its not that bad. I mean, heaven-on-earth, I have to actually push the buttons on my iphone!

YES, GOOD-LOOKS COUNT BUT...
The Beats won the Beauty Contest. The Shure's didn't even get an honorable mention. The Shure's are not as clear as they appear in the picture. While the actual ear-piece is clear, the rest is like dull-silver. And the cable is thick; not thick enough to connect you directly to the energy grid, but thick enough to notice. I showed the thing to a person who knows way more about these things and he was knocked off his chair (in a good way). He said, ""Look at these. It's clear plastic over BRAIDED STEEL. Look! Look how much steal there is!"" and he went on how the steal made some sort of difference in the quality of the sound, limiting frequencies or some such thing (I'm pretty sure I got it all wrong). I looked at them and sure enough, I could see the braided steel. It certainly makes the earbuds durable. And while I'm not sure if walking around with these things makes you more susceptible to lightning-strikes, it certainly will not break when it does. Imagine: crispy critter with intact earbuds and a smile on face because he/she never heard the lightning storm in the first place.

I'm just kidding. I'm sure these are perfectly safe.

SUMMARY: In the end, I didn't hesitate to keep the Shure's, even in the face of lack-of-features and beauty-contest-rejection. For me, the sound outweighs everything and I will dwell is musical BLISS even as I push actual buttons on my Iphone and defend my Cool on the street. Sound is everything."

1179,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm rating it 1 not because of the sound but because of the product quality. The earpiece is uncomfortable to wear for long duration, it's takes long to just just wear it properly. Because of the design of the ear piece left and right ear pieces get entangled and again, takes longer just to wear it. Worst part is the wire attached to the ear pieces, it's too thick and hard for an earphone. Plastic cover of the wires starts to break after a few months. I tried taping it but that doesn't work, now I have around 5 breaks in it.
Honestly I don't know how can it be so difficult to design a proper earphone that you would make all the mistakes imaginable. Now I'm going to hunt for another one, not from Shure for sure."

This also means that you cannot wear these while you are driving or playing sports since you will have no idea what's going on in your surroundings. The way that you wear them was a bit peculiar at first, but eventually I got used to wearing them and found that they are comfortable. These honestly sound better than my full sized headset, which is impressive, but it has errors with my computer only playing out the right side. I honestly think this is an error in my program and not with the headphones since they work correctly on every other device."
1191,3.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality gets 10/10. The design to wrap around your ear is very bad and takes quite a while to get used to.
1192,5.0 out of 5 stars,"the SE215 is a slight improvement to the already fantastic previous generation of the same earphones. I had the last pair for four years until my cat chewed it up.
These earphones are durable, and sound amazing.They satisfy all my classical music needs.

Buy them!"
1193,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound but not great.

Worth every penny!!
I think transparent does look better than translucent black."
1195,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had probably a hundred sets of headphones in my life and these are hands down the most comfortable and best sounding ones I've heard. Better bass than my Bose triport over-ear, and more comfortable than anything i've ever worn."
1196,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The positives are they are amazing headphones for the price and they SURVIVED A TRIP IN MY LAUNDRY MACHINE.

the negative is that inevitably you will send them to Shure to get fixed because the left earphone goes dead due to s***ty cables or connectivity which is a recurring flaw due to the design of removable and replaceable earphones. Since returning the IEMS and getting them back most people have no issues but its an issue you will have to deal with.

Yeah it was still worth it. They are my go to IEM."
1197,1.0 out of 5 stars,"after using it for over a month i have 1 huge issue with my earphone
my left earpiece makes annoying metal.clicking sound whenever i move the wire.. i am going to contact shure to see if i can have it fixed or replaced

-edit
i figured out the issue, the left earpiece's socket is loose, so it vibrates whenever i move or tap it (causing the metal clicking and *ting ting* sound
i am very disappointed, i am still waiting for customer support to answer me back

-1year update

the stiff cable thing for going around your ear broke off
the plastic casing for the earpiece is coming apart

i am trying to see if i can get another replacement before the warranty ends
This IEM only lasted 1 year of daily usage, pretty pathetic for 100dollar earphone"
1198,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had Shure before and TRIED to endure these on long flights...my ears were sore for hours afterward. The flanges were ok, and they come with different ear buds, but the plastic on the outside of the ear canal were just so uncomfortable. Good sound blocking when you finally get them situated. Wish I had my money back."
1199,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm still adjusting to the buds being in my ear, as I've never been an ear bud kinda guy, so there's a very minimal amount of discomfort, which I attribute only to a growing pain that I will grow out of. The sound quality is remarkable, but I have to remind myself of volume levels because of that reason. I bought them as a possible permanent replacement to can headphones while dj'ing, but I doubt I'll ever chose one over another for good. Though I am looking forward to seeing how much more movement I will be given by using these over the Allen and Heath cans I still own."

1201,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used the Bose in ear headphones and liked these better. The fit is a little different and takes getting used to, but overall a great set of headphones."

1206,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very satisfied!
1207,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: These headphones sound great. They are crisp and extremely detailed while still maintaining power.

Cons: I can not get comfortable in this headphones. I have tried all of the tips, and none of them are comfortable for me. Furthermore, the wire that folds over the ear only stays in place if I am still. Obviously comfort is a personally preference, and I am sure a lot of people love the comfort of these, but they are not for everyone.

I took two stars off for lack of comfort for me, and another star off because the right side has already failed. I have barely used these headphones because of the lack of comfort, and they have been taken care of well, and yet the right side still failed. They are still under warranty, so it likely won't be an issue getting a replacement, but overall durability is a concern."
1208,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using Shure products for a few years now and they never fail me. Great product!
1209,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are amazing. I will admit that it is difficult at first getting used to putting the buds in your ears.
1210,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually do NOT like the heavy 'memory' wire cord. It's a little too stiff. I have the SE425's too, which are twice the price and have 3 drivers and sound 3x better. They also have the crappier cord which makes them harder to insert. Since they aren't easy in and easy out, I don't wear these as much as I'd like because of that.

The Sure equivalent w/o the memory wire gets much more use."
1211,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These particular earbuds are very good for commuting or jogging or whatever vigorous activity you may be engaged in because of the way they fit in and over your ears. They also provide very good sound as far as bass,highs,lows and midrange. Would definitely recommend them."
1212,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is incredible. Good bass, all other levels are very clear. Took practice to get comfortable in my ear and fit is snug."

1215,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound... The feature that I enjoy having is the replaceable cable.
1216,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing clarity despite being a little bulky and having a thick cord. As sound is the most important aspect in buying headphones to me, as well as noise cancellation for drumming, these are really top notch."
1217,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use them on BART and they are perfect for my commute. I can still hear some outside noises, which is okay, but the sound quality is better than any headphones I have ever had."
1218,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great IEM earbud for the price. I'm a worship pastor and all of my background singer use these and are great.

1223,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215 worked great for the first two days, then the right speaker started to cut in and out."
1224,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simply, they sound AMAZING."
1225,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing quality
1226,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything I thought it was. It fits and doesn't move at all. Sounds pretty good too
1227,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this ear monitors, great sound"
1228,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good sound quality.....and they stay in my ears better than most everything else I've tried. Stout wires and good build quality.
1229,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off by saying, these headphones have pretty much the BEST sound quality you will get from ear buds. They sound just as good, if not better than every pair of over-ear studio headphones I've ever owned. Unlike most ear buds, they are really comfortable. The foam pieces that go in your ear are very soft and didn't cause me any irritation like ear buds normally do. They also have GREAT noise cancellation. These things must be made out of the same stuff they make ear plugs for shooting guns with.

NOW...
I used these headphones for 3 months and the right ear piece has loose wiring already. I can't get any sound out of it. I used them to listen to music off my iPhone while I walked to class, so it's not like I even needed them to be that durable. These would totally be worth the price if they had lasted me a decent amount of time, but 3 months is pretty bad."
1230,2.0 out of 5 stars,I like shure products but the cord is shorting and this happen in the first week with 3 gentle. I have not contacted the seller yet.
1231,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing headphones, just a little awkward getting into your ear."
1232,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!!! arrived on time and in good condition. They block out almost all sound and gave great sound quality. They work the best for rock. Using them as i write this.
1233,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product.
1234,5.0 out of 5 stars,For less then a hundred dollars you cannot go wrong with these.The fit takes a little practice but once u get them on They won't fall off.
1235,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality is pretty good but the price is a little too high. There's a lot of high ends in the earphones and it lacks the low ends. But over all I'm satisfied.
1236,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed, hardly any bass, would of returned item but lost the product information that came in the box."
1237,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these!!
1238,1.0 out of 5 stars,The ítem arrived and I was able to use it just once. The left earpiece is not working properly. Very dissapointed.
1239,5.0 out of 5 stars,"10x better than those crappy Bose MIE2 and for less.

Feels durable and extremely comfortable in your ear. Sound is fantastic, clear, and full of bass!"
1240,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought around 20 sets for our church. They sound great, included six different sets of tips, any user can figure out how to use them. The only downside, if you consider it a downside, is that parts are a little more expensive than I'd wish them to be. On the other hand, I probably should just change my expectation.

I've actually slept all night with these in, and they were surprisingly comfortable. If that's your thing, these will work. This makes me think that they will work very well under a helmet, but I couldn't say for sure, I haven't tried that."
1241,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. The mic is useless if there is any white noise. Don’t plan to use this as anything other than a normal pair of headphones.
1242,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update about 6 months in, regular use on air travel about twice a week for 3-5 hour sessions... LOVE THEM. I'm returning the 5th Star.
....
Recommended by /r/headphones Reddit for travel size and noise isolating (for air travel).

Best headphones I have ever used. Would prefer if they had volume control or a mic but in sound isolation and clarity, these are the great.

Only reason I am holding back a star is because I have seen quality issues in the reviews and the first pair I got was defective (cutting in and out on one ear). My second has been working great, just make sure you test them fully before you let the return period expire."
1243,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Connection distance is short. One has to be creative enough to figure out a comfortable way to wear this. The reason I didn't give one start is because the build quality is relatively okay.

But the sound quality is bad, just bad. Shure can't justify the performance out of this price. I don't recommend this."
1244,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These have generally decent sound quality without distortion, but there is a quite audible hiss. They're able to drive the SE846 earphones with more than enough power. Like most Bluetooth audio devices, they go into a power saving mode and take some audio to ""wake up"", so they're useless for things like notification sounds. They're okay for when you need to listen to music while traveling and what not."
1245,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm no audiophile, but I can still tell this makes a huge difference to music quality. For one Shure has mastered the fit so due a perfect fit and great noise isolation the music already sounds great. Second the drivers are actually better and even though the earbud is not bass heavy I could actually hear the lows much better than the others I've used in a similar budget. Can't comment on durability yet, but the cables look great. Of course, the area of questionable durability will be the nozzle on the bud (made of plastic).

If you're not under a tight budget get the bundle that comes with the Fiio A1 amp and the sd card for ~$115. That was my only regret."
1246,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So for number of years I have tried to find some of the best headphones whether it's been in ear or over the ear, and I had my doubts about these in-ear headphones at first. I did not realize that they need a ""Burn-in"" time frame which may vary from what I have researched. The biggest thing with these headphones will be the getting used to the in-ear placement of the headphone itself. I will stress this, you will need time getting used to these being in your ear's for a long period of time, but once you make it past that point you will be go to go. Now as far as performance, I would have to say they are stellar and are a cut above the rest.

The high's are crisp and tight.
The mid's are are not all over the place like cheaper headphones.
The lows are the closest thing to being in the studio.
The cord is very durable.

Now for the bad.

The cord is not long enough since you do have to where the cord behind you since they are sound monitors not regular headphones.
The different headphone sizes are great but are a pain when trying to remove them or switch them out.
The ""Burn-in"" time may be a little too long for some users.

All in all, if you are looking to upgrade your in-ear headphones for better quality sound and performance these are the ones for you."
1247,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned several headphones and earbuds over the last decade and have owned the Shure SE425, Shure SE315 and Shure SE215. I have also owned Sennheiser and Klipsch to name a few.
Sadly, my SE425 ( a gift from my family) was stepped on and crushed accidently (bad day there) and I can't afford to replace that. I play the bass guitar and upright and use my SE315 when I sometimes asked to sit in at church (far cry from college band days in 80's)
I would say I am probably like most everyone - I want a great set of earbuds that give me the best listening experience AND I don't want spend $100 and wonder if I paid too much or could have spent less.
The SE215s are, in my opinion, the best cost to quality ratio of any earbud I have owned. FULL range of sound, mids are good and low end is great! The SE215 is versatile and will accommodate any music style or genre you enjoy.
YOU MUST BURN THEM IN by just playing 20 hours or more of music (I just turn them up to 60% on my IPhone/Ipod and stick earbuds under a pillow). They sound great out of the box, but IF you do buy a really good set of earbuds they get better with use.
IMPROVEMENTS: Shure has improved the one issue I did have with the earlier model SE115 which was the wire connection to the buds themselves. That thick cone shaped connector at the earbud itself is an actual connector allowing you to replace the wire OR ADD the MICROPHONE/CONTROL cable. I bought my daughter these earbuds and the jack got bent and just replaced the wire.

Bottom line is the Shure SE215 is designed, professional audio equipment at a bargain price and If you can go a few extra bucks and want a set of earbuds that sound like $300 earbuds then the SE215 is a worthy investment."
1248,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really nice quality, I'm not used to the crispness. I can hear things in the same songs i have been listening to for a while. Super noise isolating, its like having ear protection in. I cant hear anything but the music and its super clean and crisp. Came with foam replacement tips as well as rubber ones, the carrying case and cleaner tool. Lots of instructions but all i bothered to read was how to wear them. Stays in my ears very well and i have had issues with that before. Nice investment for anyone who uses earphones. Not too bassy though."
1249,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I struggled for a long time between purchasing noise isolating buds or noise cancelling buds. Ultimately I decided in these because they were so much cheaper than the Bose QC buds. I was glad that I did. I wore these on multiple flights while travelling from the Midwest to London, and they successfully blocked out plenty of noise and sounds of crying babies and talking, especially with music playing at a low volume. And speaking of music, the sound on these buds is fantastic. Clear, true bass tones and well balanced mids and highs. They create a good seal in your ear without effort once you get used to taking them out and putting them in.

The build quality of these is also great. Every piece of these feels sturdy and built to last."
1250,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the comfortable fit, however the limited volume output was a little disappointing."

Also nice that if the cord gets stiff from sweat you can simply replace the cord and keep your drivers. I like the ones without the iphone controller / mic because the cord wont bounce around."
1270,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better then expected. Bass kinda lacks. But overall one of the best I've owned.

1274,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these about a month ago, and so far, I love it. The sound quality is really good, the bass hits the right spot, it's very well balanced.
Only problem is that the left earphone SOMETIMES cuts off, so I hope this doesn't evolve to a complete cut off anytime soon."

I'm sticking with Shure"
1283,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great for studying in noisy environments. Comfortable, convenient, and feel very sturdy due to the fact that the wires are covered in kevlar."
1284,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great ear buds with a very professional sound. They are detachable so you can install different cable with a Mic if you want.

These naturally conform around your ear and fit pretty comfortably. The construction is also very nice. The cables feel very sturdy and the 'buds' themselves are very rigid.

The only con that I can think of is that they do not have high quality bass. The treble and mids definitely stand out though."
1285,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for three days now and the longest continued listening time so far is almost 5 hours. I did a full recharge out of the box and managed to squeeze 3 hours out of them. Being that they were sitting on a shelve somewhere; I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I gave them another full charge, the voice prompt said I had more than six hours of battery life remaining, which should be 8 hours as that’s what’s listed. I listened to them for my 30 minute workout, turned them off and an hour later powered them on and the voice prompt now said I only had 4 hours of battery life remaining. I used them until it was time for another full recharge. Again when I powered them on the same voice prompt said I had more than 6 hours of battery life remaining. I put on my favorite playlist and let them play at a moderate volume; I was able to get 4hours 50 mins, before it was time to recharge. I like the fit, the sound is nice, but the battery life is terrible, I was not expecting this from Shure. I would definitely not recommend these to friends or family."
1286,3.0 out of 5 stars,"To my disappointment, I discovered the right earpiece of these phones did not transmit sound straight from the box. In fact, when I opened the packaging, I found the wire and the earpiece were disconnected already. If the detachable connection is supposed to be snug, why was it already loose and detached? The only way I could hear anything through the right side was squeezing the connection between the wire and earpiece. My brother—an audio engineer—also confirmed this problem.

Very disappointing, to say the least. Didn't even get to experience the amazing sound that I've been reading about. The fit (with a small foam attachment) was nice, though.

I will try again to purchase my own Shure SE215—but I'm taking my earphone business to Sweetwater.com."
1287,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Painful to wear longer than 30min at a time, otherwise sound wonderful."
1288,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for less than a year. Initially I was quite happy with them. The audio quality is good, a definite step up from the earbuds included with your phone. However after a few months of daily usage I encountered glitches and dropouts in one year. Detaching the cable from the earphone and re-attaching it temporarily solved the problem. However the next time it occurred the connector broke as I was trying to detach it. So now I have a broken $100 earphone."
1289,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good
1290,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fits just right in the ears. Great sound quality for highs and lows. Highly recommend to anyone that wants to get away from the world.
1291,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I grew up around production my whole life (My dad has a production company). Shure was a brand I saw around a lot from a child because there microphones are top notch. There headphones sound great to but I really don't think these are convenient for lets say.... If you live in downtown, or on the move you probably wouldn't like these. I should feel comfortable taking my headphones off if I see someone on the street to say hi and not spend literally 5 mins standing there trying to figure out my headphones to put them back in. My ears are also particularly small so the whole wrap around function doesn't work for me because of the degree of the looping mechanism. They eventually swing around and it doesn't feel or look nice and hey... I gotta look nice while I jam. Not confused and always grabbing for my ears to fix the product. I think Ill pass on these earbuds but SHURE definitely has my respect he has been using you guys for sound for over 16+ years."

Update: 6/1/16
I've had this since 3/26/16 and by then the smell was gone and i've gotten used to putting it on. However, the right ear bud cuts off the music sometimes. I've owned numerous earbuds/earphones/headphones and this is a sign that they will one day cut off completely in the time to come. Honestly, I would expect the earbuds to last longer due to ""Kevlar"" that these earbuds are made with. The sound quality is still amazing, and if you want to buy these, I would recommend them if you use them sparingly."

1297,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite many other reviews praising these IEMs' comfort, I just couldn't get a good fit. Their odd shape makes them difficult to put in, and rather uncomfortable for longer listening periods. I absolutely could not get a good seal, as the plastic casing prevented me from inserting them deep enough. While the sound was still pleasant, I did find it somewhat unremarkable, and think you can probably do better considering the not-so-low price."

I should feel comfortable taking my headphones off if I see someone on the street to say hi and not spend literally 5 mins standing there trying to figure out my headphones to put them back in. My ears are also particularly small so the whole wrap around function doesn't work for me because of the degree of the looping mechanism. They eventually swing around and it doesn't feel or look nice and hey... I gotta look nice while I jam. Not confused and always grabbing for my ears to fix the product. I think Ill pass on these earbuds but SHURE definitely has my respect he has been using you guys for sound for over 16+ years."
1302,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent performance, features and accessories for the price point."

1304,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells bad and annoying to put on. Sound quality is superb. A lot more durable than your average earbuds.

Update: 6/1/16
I've had this since 3/26/16 and by then the smell was gone and i've gotten used to putting it on. However, the right ear bud cuts off the music sometimes. I've owned numerous earbuds/earphones/headphones and this is a sign that they will one day cut off completely in the time to come. Honestly, I would expect the earbuds to last longer due to ""Kevlar"" that these earbuds are made with. The sound quality is still amazing, and if you want to buy these, I would recommend them if you use them sparingly."

1306,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are the best headphones in this price range since the klipsh s4
1307,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite many other reviews praising these IEMs' comfort, I just couldn't get a good fit. Their odd shape makes them difficult to put in, and rather uncomfortable for longer listening periods. I absolutely could not get a good seal, as the plastic casing prevented me from inserting them deep enough. While the sound was still pleasant, I did find it somewhat unremarkable, and think you can probably do better considering the not-so-low price."
1308,2.0 out of 5 stars,For the price they sound like crap but they fit okayish in my ears.
1309,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the sound in them. It's amazing! It would be better if they stayed better in the ear, but I'm not complaining. They are really good!"

1320,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are by far the best headphones I've used. The only minor negative is that they are a chore to put into my ears. But the sound is more that worth it.

1325,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound when the correct tips are used. It's a must to have them sealed completely off in your ear otherwise they will sound weak. Great product for the price, the tangle free cord is a great feature!"
1326,1.0 out of 5 stars,"While I have no complaints about the audio quality, the build and durability of the included cable turned out to be very poor. While detaching the earbuds for storage, one of the earbuds failed to detach from the wire, pulling out the entire connector which broke along two weak solder points. For such an expensive piece of equipment, I certainly expected better build quality. I recommend purchasing KZ ZS3 detachable earbuds instead.

1332,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought three or four sets of headphones in this series (they do wear out, or I break or lose them) and have always been satisfied. The phones on the new model - SE215 - are very comfortable and easy to insert and remove. The new feature of having the plug-in cords is helpful and smart; if the cord or earphone should break, you can replace just that part. That said, the whole set is fairly rugged. Sound isolation is superb. The sound has good balance with neither highs nor lows predominating (I do have a high-frequency hearing losss so I might be off here). For the price point, it's hard to imagine a better buy."
1333,5.0 out of 5 stars,Although these only have 1 driver. They are terrificly balanced and ready to use on the get go. I also recommend the yellow foam sleeves in addition when you buy.

1337,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are great sounding headphones, but if you are wanting to use them at a gym setting the time it takes to put them in properly can be a pain. Just stick to great sounding ear buds in that setting."
1338,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are alone in their class for the price. They compete with earphones that cost $300-$400. BUY THEM! Could not be more satisfied
1339,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm expecting high quality earphones for the premium price. I owned one set of e2c and it lasted for over a year but this one failed on the third month. Though it is still under warranty, I will probably opt for another brand in the future to avoid the hassle. My brother-in-law also bought SE215 and had a problem with the connector of the detachable cable. Looks like there are a lot of problems with SE215.

So Shure replaced my failing earphone and I'm very happy to get the replacement but my happiness is short-lived. The right earbud failed this time. I'm not buying Shure ever again."
1340,4.0 out of 5 stars,good effort
1341,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not bothering with a review of how these sound other than to say that I like the sound of these slightly more than my Klipsch S4 II earbuds. The foam tips cut external sound out very well...surprisingly well for headphones. Whereas the S4 headphones have a tendency to push out of my ears, requiring that I put them back in place periodically while using them, the Shures stay in place perfectly. Always.

These should include a microphone and call buttons for the price. Yet, they have quickly become my favorites without having to spend $400 on a set."
1342,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome product, great sound and outside noise blocking, took few days to get used to the over ear design but now I love it! Great buy!"
1343,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great but I'm not impressed with the comfort, style, or convenience of them. However, they're better than my old E2Cs in every way. Great for at-home listening."

1345,3.0 out of 5 stars,I've had these for almost a year now. The bass quality isn't what I thought it would be and now the adjustable part that goes behind my left ear broke and scratched the crap out of my ear.
1346,3.0 out of 5 stars,These SE215 K Live are okay. For the sound quality I think they're a little over priced. If you stick any earbud deep enough in your ear they'll sound decent.
1347,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
1348,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exelent. Arrived on time
1349,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for a set of in-ears. Have had a few weeks. We'll see what lifespan is...
1350,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these on stage with as a bass guitar player. They work great. They block out almost all sound around you. I have to take them out to hear anyone talking. The bass thumps in my ear quite loudly, so I have to have the volume turned down from my previous earphones. I have friends who have been using this model for a long time with no problems."
1351,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Shure SE215-CL earphones are an outstanding entry-level IEM (In Ear Monitor) for musicians. These single driver earphones deliver a reasonable frequency response at a more than adequate level. If you are looking for a very flat 20-20kHz response the SE535 triple driver is a better choice. I own both models and have gone through the process of having custom Avery Sound ear pieces made for these; which delivers the full on-stage experience with great monitoring and amazing isolation.
1352,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these due to the super low price Amazon had. I own a few pairs of other earbuds/headphones and my previous favorites were my Klipsch S4. I assumed there is a plateau for all earbuds and any increase in quality would be negligible. I was wrong in my assumptions. The Klipsch S4 fit comfortably in my ear, but the bass was low. Even putting my iPhone on ""Bass Boost"", it isn't what you would want it to be. To obtain more bass, I assumed (again) that I would have to purchase a larger earbud that would be uncomfortable or transition to over the ear headphones. These were not good options since I use my earbuds to workout. I purchased the Shure SE215-CL and I was blown away. It is amazing how clear these are! More bass and the highs were more crisp. The style was awkward at first, but now I like it more than the in the ear earbuds. Even my Klipsch would slip when I would sweat a lot. No environmental noise is allowed in my ear, just crisp, clean music. I actually gave my Klipsch earbuds away! These are that good."
1353,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these for less than a day. But I can say that these are the best set of earbuds I have ever owned. I was looking for a change from the earbuds that came with my phone. But I didn't want to shell out for the audiophile quality ones. So I was deciding between the sennheiser in ears and these and I picked these. And I think overall I think I picked the right ones. The noise isolation of these are amazing. I do a fair amount of bike riding around town to get errands done. And with these in I don't hear the noise of the traffic. That is how good the noise isolation is with these. And the sound quality of these are amazing. I am sure once I really start breaking them in they will sound even better.

The only really two nit picky things with these that I have found. The fact that the cord is a little bit longer than the old pair that was using. And the fact that these go over the ear to fit them in. Both not huge issues for me at all. As far as them going over the ear. It is just gonna take time for me to get use to putting them in not a big deal. And as for the extra length of the cord goes. If I am using these with my phone I just put the extra length of cord in my pocket with my phone.

If you are looking for new earbuds or a upgrade form the cheap $10 earbuds. These would be the perfect ones to go with and I can't recommend these enough."
1354,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a musician who enjoys recording, playing live, and listening to my favorite artists in a way that does their music justice. For in-ear headphones I use these! I can't wear these headphones for a very long time (all day), but the sound quality is very crisp and clear. I also like traveling with these. It blocks out a lot of noise and sit flush against my ears so that it doesn't hurt to lay my head down. I've seen some reviews where people have trouble hearing out of their headphones, and I would suggest doing what the company suggests...use the cleaning tool they provide and make sure the passage way is clear of dirt. For over the ear headphones I suggest Bose SoundTru over the ear headphones. They are incredibly comfortable and I can wear them all day if I wanted to."
1355,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned a few pairs of these over the years. Easily my favorite headphones at this price range. Recently I have been listening to more and more Bluetooth headphones due to the convenience of not being ""tied"" to the device that I was listening to, which is usually my phone.
A few weeks ago I came across a Bluetooth transmitter that I can plug my shure se215 into and make them bluetooth. The brand is Anker, about $25. Very small and alters the sound very little, if any.
Great headphones that are now bluetooth. I'm set."
1356,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start of by saying this is a great pair of IEMs for $100. These were my first pair of IEMs and I bought them because I didn't want to lug around some big headphones whenever I might needed to listen to some music or use normal ear buds(the non in-ear kind) because of the bad sound isolation. These ones solve both those problems extremely well. The build quality is solid, the wires are top notch and you get 3 sizes of Shure's in-house made comply foam tips and 3 sizes of normal rubber tips. You also get a nice nylon pouch with a hook thing to clip onto stuff, like holes in bags etc. Also a cleaning tool for earwax build-up. Putting them on the first time will be challenging but you will get the hang of it after a while.

So this product is great if you're looking for something like that. However the reason its not 5 stars is probably because of a personal circumstance. I already own a pair of high-end headphones. Coming from those, the sound quality is almost the same but not as comfortable, probably because these are my first IEMs and I'm not used to shoving things into my ear. However there is a slight bit of micro-phonics(cable rubbing noise) that comes with every IEM in the world, you can't escape it, and the fact that the noise isolation is so good, if you're not listening to music, congratulations you get to experience the awkward feeling of being deaf for the first time in your life. That may or may not be a praise. I think I just prefer the comfort of headphones, but if you're used to IEMs, then this $100 baby is as good as $300 headphones, well almost, but pretty dam close. The headphones have better clarity and a more spacious sound stage. Great value for your money I might say.

Also there was a problem where the audio jack was too thick and may cause fit problems if you had a narrow opening on your phone due to a case, this problem has been eliavated by a improved design. The thick wrapping around the pin now has been shortened, allowing you to get into smaller spaces on phone cases.

So for the sound quality. The bass is loud and thumping, also depends on the eartip you use. Rubber tips gives more pronounced bass where as comply gives clearer mids. The highs and mids are decent, not that I can tell properly because I'm not a professional Audio connaisseur.
Pros
+ Great audio quality
+ Great Build quality
+ 3 Tip sizes of rubber AND Comply foam
+ Pouch
+ Improved Audio jack

Cons
+ Not top of the line audio
+ Will not be worth it if you have expensive headphones

Tl;Dr Very good IEMs for $100, for this price range to be competitive to more expensive headphones is very impressive. Probably one of the best choices you can get in this price range. If you have spoilt yourself with expensive audio, then this isn't for you."
1357,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is fantastic and they are very comfortable for me.

Noise isolation is okay, but for me nowhere near as good as some other reviewers have experienced. If someone is talking while I have these earbuds in I can still hear them, though attenuation is moderately better than other earbuds. I've tried all 3 sizes of foam tips and, for me, small and medium are about the same in terms of noise isolation and the large are bad. I suppose my ears are just not the right size for these to be as effective as they could be.

When I compare them to my Sennheiser HD280 headphones (not earbuds), they block about the same amount of sound and quality is about on par. When I put the Sennheisers on over the these SE215s I get real noise isolation. It's amazing, totally immersive, and really what I was hoping to get from the earbuds alone.

These are very good earbuds but I would not have bought them if I'd have known that they wouldn't really be sound isolating for me."
1358,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to love these earphones/monitors because the sound is AMAZING. Great bass, clear sound, and excellent isolation. However, I think they may have been made for the slightly larger (male?) ear. The foam tips, themselves, are comfortable when you find a good combination, but because these earphones require being wedged into the concha of the ear to stay in, it feels like the tips of the earbuds are being pushed too far into the ear canal, which is slightly painful. Tried them with different sizes of tips, but they were uncomfortable every time. If your ears are slightly larger, though, you should have no problem. I'm going back to my trusty Shure SE-115s, which seem to be a bit friendlier for the smaller ear."
1359,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Other then a handful of songs that are incredibly intricate with loads of diffrent instruments at the full range of frequencies, these head phones are the best I have herd. They are super comfterable and can be worn while laying on your side which is kind of impressive.
I feel like the bass doesn't go as low as it should and the highs do at times over power other ranges. By this I mean that the the deepest of lows do not register at all and anything at the low end of its rated range is weak. However the mid lows are beautiful (bass drums, most techno lows and r&b lows are usualy the mid lows while the low end of bass guitars and some techno that uses realy low frequencis are the super lows). The mids are great and super clear while the highs are crisp. It's only when you are trying something that uses lots of stuff on the low end and lots in the high end that things start to crackle at high volume. Such times could be during a realy hard rock song (and I mean they have to be going nuts in this song) with something like double bass drum peddles and the guitarist going nuts, vocalist doing his thing with constant simble crashing for anything to sound anything other then imaculant"

1364,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the way these sound. They are awesome. So why only 3 stars? They are Pain In The Backside to put on. They also require making sure you have the right earplug (trial and error) to get them to sound the way they can. If they didn't sound so damn good I'd have returned them, but they have amazing sound, so they are worth the trouble."

1367,3.0 out of 5 stars,This isn't really a review of the SE215's as a whole but more so the pair I received because I've had several of these and this is the first that has given me any issues. Of course these in ears are great for the money. I'm an all around musician and started using these as a drummer playing various venues and shows. Always used in conjunction with the Shure PSM200 system and it's always worked great. This latest pair though is a little weird. First thing I noticed was the highs weren't there for some reason. Played many different songs on a few different devices and it was the same over and over...highs were sort of missing. And secondly the right ear ear phone seems to pop every time I insert it...when I push it in and it goes back to resting position it pops again. Really weird. All in all the shore se215's are great and I'm not sure I want to go through the trouble of returning these and going through that process. We'll see.
1368,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because they were reviewed on CNet as very durable. Well the cable is durable, I will say that. However, the ear plug itself has snapped off after only two months of use. Not happy. Even if they hadn't broken, would not have been very satisfied with this product. They go on over your ear, but it is not a stable fit in your ear and too much movement (like jogging) will pop them out. The only good thing I will say about these is that the sound quality was decent."
1369,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly worth every penny, sound canceling is amazing, the in ear security is flawless and the part of that is the most susceptible to damage(the cord) is replaceable."
1370,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for working out (run/weight train/crossfit). It took a while to get used to them fitting in my ears, I've always worn the conventional ear buds(under the ear) and this was my first experience with ""over the ear"" type buds and I'll never do that again. Please don't get me wrong, these sound fantastic, however it's a pain in the butt to get them in your ears and once you finally do.. You can notice you're wearing them, and subconsciously it began to annoy me. When I workout I want to focus on my workouts, not my earbuds. It was more of a neussance to have them on more than anything.

PROS: Sound great, sound isolation is phenomenal.

CONS: Would take too long to put them in, difficult to fit in ears, took time getting used to the ""memory wire"" that wraps around ear, headphones cord too long (would catch everything), once in ear they felt heavy, I also felt like they had too many working parts and would eventually fail within the workout environment."
1371,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I expected better because of the good reviews. Overall it's a great pair of earphones with excellent build quality, would definitely recommend."
1372,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality of these headphones is excellent--however, the quality of construction leaves A LOT to be desired. After only two months of cautious, mild use and no incidents of physical damage, one of the headphones literally cracked in half while I placing it in my ear. This is unacceptable, and it is the first time I've dealt with a device within this price range breaking so quickly. Hopefully I received a pair of defective headphones and my experience is out of the norm; whatever the case may be, I am unsatisfied by the results of my purchase. Be warned."

1379,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got these so far only a few hours but they sound good for the money. I also find them comfortable and they will likely not fall out of my ear.

1393,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really want to give these 5 stars, but I just don't think they are worth the money. I use these on a daily basis but am not blown away. Even with the smallest foam ear inserts, these are two large for my ears. Maybe these are intended for only men or something? Also I am just not that impressed with the sound quality. It's good sound, but I've heard better in less expensive earphones."

The sound quality was not nearly was I was expecting. Although I could see how a musician would love these, a 13 year old would feel they did not have enough bass. I would recommend these, but not to a child. I will take some time to get used to putting them in your ear."
1396,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sounding! Other reviewers thought that they were hard to get used to at first but I found that they fit my ears perfectly.

1411,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received the earphones in April, by May the left earbud cuts out. I have to move the cord in order to get sound to come out and that is when I'm sitting down. I imagine it's pointless if I were on the move. The right earbud is fine.

In addition, the shape of the earbud hurts my ear. I've used other Shure earbuds that were round instead of this longer design and they were great, but this design feels like it rubs on the inside of my ears and becomes painful after longer use.

Would not recommend these."

1415,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited to make this purchase, despite the pricepoint even for those who already own the Drivers. After I made the purchase, they arrived on time, with a fair amount of packaging for one small cable. The end of the cable which attaches to the driver started to lose the gold rings (contact points) and this seemed to indicate a very cheap and low quality build. if i'm very careful, I won't lose this little piece (which I think may be essential) but something brand new like this 6 inches long shouldn't be falling apart after 3 days of use. Additionally, I had difficulty charging the device unless plugged into a wall outlet with the correct sort of adapter. I travel quite often and found it annoying to not be able to charge the device as often as i'd like. decent purchase but I think the generic alternative would just as good of a product, if not a better value. we'll see how long this thing lasts. . . ."

1418,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are probably the most expensive pair of IEM's that I've ever purchased, but I can honestly say that for $100 dollars the quality is superb. It's like i'm actually listening to my favorite songs for the first time, high's and lows are very crisp and balanced. They are so high quality that I feel they are almost worth twice the price, and I would almost be willing to pay it. After finding the right foam tips and a good hour break-in these really shine, no regrets here and I highly recommend them for anyone on a budget! I'm so impressed that Shure has just earned a customer for life!"

1425,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very happy with older Shure E2c. These did not fit my ears. They do not go into the ear canal far enough to properly isolate. I also wanted them to fit inside my motorcycle helmet, they do not, and get ripped out of my ears every time i tried to pull the helmet on. I tried most of the tips, but none fit well, and the 215s wanted to come out of the ears...i had to keep pushing them back in. I also did not like the stiff wire coming out of the buds...It was uncomfortable and did not work well with my helmet."

These block out 95% of wind noise and I can still comfortably hear my engine which was important to me. The sound quality is above average with a decent bass. One downside with the clear ones at least is the wire gets very dirty. The cord is no longer a ""white-ish clear"" but more of a brown-ish white, which cleaning the wire has not resolved. Not an issue for me, but just a heads up."

Great customer service.

Prefer RHA product overall."

I purchased these headphones for working out. When they work... they're great. The problem is that the bluetooth cable is unreliable. In the past four months, I've had two units fail me. It's extremely frustrating when you show up at the gym and suddenly the bluetooth unit completely unresponsive. You shouldn't have to bring backup headphones with you because your wireless headphones are unreliable - but that's what I've come to do. Although Shure has good customer service/warranties on their products, there should be more reliability for a cable that costs $99."

1446,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good sound quality
1447,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are great (really good sound and isolation), but they weren't made to last, that's for sure. Mine came with a minor problem, that I noticed the first time I put it on (right earphone was failing). As I live in Brazil, I had to live with the problem since a RMA would take a huge time. Now exactly 4 months since I bought it, the right side is completely dead. No sound at all... Too bad for a product that costs US$ 99,00. Next time I will stay with Bose (the ones I had before SE215-K, unfortunately I lost them on a plane).

Now all I can do is wait a hell of a time for the RMA !!!

1450,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is amazing and sounds very clean. However, it seems to have not that great of a connection once it's out of your hands, seeing as though it skips every once and a while which can be kinda annoying/distracting.

The length of the cable is also kinda weird. I kinda just wear it with the cable running down the front of me and tuck the end into my shirt."

1460,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for a few hours now and I'm absolutely loving these. I've never invested 100 dollars for earbuds before. I have however just bought 100 dollar gaming headset for the xbox and these are definitely superior in sound ""quality"", that said the headset is wireless, so. These earbuds are the best I've ever owned for sure. I do wish there was more POWER.. I don't know how else to describe it, the sound is incredible but it'd be nicer to have more of a BOOM if that makes sense and It's not bass I'm referencing.. (don't let that deter you though, it's probably just me needing to get use to the different tones) I'll say this, for the price, absolutely satisfied and I'll go with this brand if I ever decide to get a more expensive earbud. Also, a few side notes: someone mentioned the sound of the chord is annoying..(when you have earbuds in and tap the chord the noise sometimes makes a loud thud in your ear) I know what he's talking about because I had this issue with my last earbuds and these I don't really notice a significance in noise from moving the wires. Also, I have these things BLASTING and it's absolutely silent from the outside, you can't hear a thing going out or coming in."
1461,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wanted these for a long time and finally made the leap. They are among the highest regarded In Ear Monitors by the audiophiles on reddit where the SE215's were first suggested to me. They fit flush with my ears; so much so that I can comfortably lie with my ear against a pillow and not feel like there is much pressure. Depending on the shape of your ears (mine are average size), your experience may vary. I have had difficulty with previous ear buds staying snug under my motorcycle helmet, and these with the flush fit and the over ear wire will stay put nicely.

My test music was Mozart, Shpongle, The Who's Tommy, NOFX, Nellie McKay and Royksopp. Was concerned they would be too bass heavy from what reddit folks said, but they seem to be just right. Not the best for classical but the electronic and rock sounds pretty fantastic. The highs were bright enough and Nellie McKai sounded like she was whispering right into my ears.

These are new and I have yet to find any flaws but will update if anything comes up."
1462,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The earbuds alone aren't design for sport since they were design originally for musicians and/or more valued music listeners. The earbuds are very nice and allow different earbuds for different ear sizes. The earbud may not look nice when wearing in the eyes of many people, but the quality is beautiful for this price. It has managed to overtake the most distorted guitar screeches, to the most deep bass drops and tempos from my playist and sound like if I was there helping produce it. My first pair got damaged since it used for working out, (NOTE NOT INTENDED FOR SPORTS AT ALL. Earbuds not designed for that.) but Shure has a amazing customer service alone I would give 5/5. SInce they gave me a new replacement no problem. I highly recommend these as they are durable and sleek in design with the most beautiful sound quality 100$ could get you for these. You won't regret it. (FINAL NOTE: THIS DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN JUST STUFF THEM IN YOUR POCKET AND EXPECT THEM TO BE OKAY. THEY INCLUDE A CARRYING CASE FOR A REASON WHICH FITS NICELY IN YOUR POCKETS. THIS WILL BE A HUGE WAY TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR EARPHONES. LET ALONE THE EARWAX REMOVER FOR THE EARBUDS AND TUBE FOR THE MONITORS.)

Tldr: BUY IT BUT NOT INTENDED FOR SPORTS AT ALL. QUALITY IS BEAUTIFUL, AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE ALONE IS 5/5. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND"
1463,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose IE2i and Bose AE2
I had a pair of Bose IE2i to listen to music when in my office, studying, running, gym, etc. I also had a pair of Bose AE2 that I used to play my electric drum set. I got tired of the IE2i and stopped using them altogether because those do not isolate any noises whatsoever. Like the new Bose SoundSport the earphone tips/buds are extremely comfortable, but you can hear every single noise from outside. I tried to use the IE2i in several 5-hr flights and they are useless. The AE2 sounded very good and isolated some noise. Enough to enjoy using them with my drumkit, but not enough to use on a plane ride.

SE425
Fantastic mid-range, poor bass and low-end; low impedance; long and strong cord; ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. Given their lack of low-range these could not satisfy my needs. Expensive.

Bose SoundTrue Ultra in-ear STIE
Great balanced sound; strong bass; short and thin/flimsy cord; includes iPhone controls. Very comfortable silicone tips that provide great noise isolation, but you can hear the cord touching against any surface. Easy and fast to take on/off. The earphones wiggle a bit when running, though not enough to break the sound seal. Relatively expensive.

SE215
Great balanced sound; strong bass; low impedance; long and strong cord, ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. I can hear comfortably with 2/16 volume bars from the iPhone. Used 5/16 volume bars on the iPhone when running with 15 mph winds and was amazing. After a learning curve, you get used to quickly putting them on/off. Inexpensive.

Overall

I got the SE425 first and discarded them for their lack of bass. I couldn't notice much of a sound difference between the STIE and the SE215. The SE215 have a lower impedance and thus sound louder but the quality is, to me, quite comparable (My suggestion: get a tight seal, don't go too deep into your ear). The benefits of the SE215 suit my overall needs better and ended up choosing these.

Notes

1. I will post this same review in all three products hoping others will find it useful.

2. I am traveling in a couple of days and if I find a good store in an airport that will let me try the SE535 I will make an update to this post. The SE535 are supposed to be as good as the SE425 with the bass that the latter so deeply lack.

******UPDATE******

A store at the Chicage O'Hare airport let me try the SE535. Here is my short review:

SE535
Fantastic balanced sound; great bass and low-end; low-enough impedance; long and strong cord, ability to replace only the cord if broken. Very comfortable behind-the-ear cord and position on the ear with great noise isolation. Many eartips to try for different occassions (e.g. biking, office, airplane). I can hear comfortably with 2/16 volume bars from the iPhone. With 3/16 volume bars on iPhone 5S the sound is astonishing, lead guitar doesn't sound over rythm guitar, bass and drums sound great and all sounds are complimenting one another as opposed to fighting over which is the primary sounding one. I use them for running, biking, skating, working out, in the office, at the library, coffee shop, in the car (passenger), on airplanes, and with my Roland TD30-KV electric drumkit. I never need more than 4/16 volume bars on my iPhone 5S. I specially like the versatility of these IEMs and quality of their sound. Expensive.

I sincerely hope you find this review helpful!"
1464,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first set of IEMs I've owned. I've always been using earbuds from Sony and other random brands. I was apprehensive at dropping $99 on a pair of earphones, since my previous ones would always die within a few months of having them. However, I found that my fears were unfounded after receiving these. The sound quality is phenomenal, I haven't owned anything like this before. I listen to electronic music mostly (trance), and the highs and lows are pretty balanced on these. The bass response is pretty good, it's not too heavy, but I think it's definitely enough for my own enjoyment. I've lost track of how many hours I've listened with these, but they are really comfortable and don't hurt after wearing them for hours and hours.

I enjoy using the Comply foam tips that come with mine, the sound isolation is excellent. It isolates so well that I cannot wear both pieces in my ears while I'm at work, since I cannot hear what my coworkers say to me even if I have the volume pretty low. I can use both the medium and small Comply tips; if I use the mediums, I have to compress the foam and then insert them into my ears, but with the smalls I can just slip them in and I still get the same seal.

The only complaint I have with these is that the stock cable that comes with the earphones are a little awkward to use for the first time. I had trouble trying to get the memory wire fitted around my ears properly. Once they were on properly, they were pretty comfortable. I don't really recommend wearing these in combination with glasses though, they might feel weird. I like that the cables are thick and Kevlar-reinforced; I have no worries about the durability of the cable, and it can easily replaced if it tears. I also bought the CBL-M+-K-EFS so I could use it with my iPod and iPhone. I like the fitting of this cable more, since there's no memory wire, so it's more comfortable to use while wearing glasses.

I think that if these ever break down, I might try out the se215-LTD. I might even try out some of Shure's higher offerings."
1465,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been in search of the perfect pair of earbuds for what feels like an eternity, I've gone through dozens & dozens of sets. I'm a cyclist; mountain biker & motorcycle rider (disclaimer: using earbuds while riding is prohibited by law), finding a set of earbuds that can meet all my needs and not cost me my first born was not an easy task. I've never found a pair of buds that stay in my ears and offer pristine sound at any volume level until now, and the best part is the noise canceling feature; while cruising at 60mph on the open highway the wind sounds has been diminished so greatly that I can actually clearly hear my music even at a very low volume level. These earbuds are worth every penny I spent on them!"

1467,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first pair of these earbuds died within three weeks of purchase. However, I am cursed when it comes to my first pair of earbuds dying. My replacement pair has lasted over a year and a half now, and sound amazing. Ive used them when walking around campus, and while typing papers and I find them really comfortable. The fit is a little odd, but once you get used to it you will like it. The fit is secure and even if you were glasses (like me) you won't find the over ear cord annoying or uncomfortable. Also worth mentioning is that the foam tips are amazing at blocking out sound. I have worn these earbuds on 8 hour plane rids and they block out most if not all of the sound. The low profile design makes these great for wearing under a helmet/hat or while laying in bed listing to music. As with most things I am sure you could find a better sounding pair of earbuds, but I can't imagine finding a better sounding pair in the same price range. Highly recommend these to anyone looking for a higher end pair of earbuds. You won't be disappointed."
1468,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good and they fit well, so on the major stuff, these are very good headphones. Good balance of bass and clarity, good isolation. My only gripe is that the cable is too long and prone to twisting. I wear these to work out and I have to run the cable under my shirt to prevent the cable from catching on equipment because there is so much of it. That by itself is not a big problem, but it somehow it manages to pull on my ears and on the iPod on my arm after every set. Somehow there is nearly 4 feet of slack cable inside my shirt on my back, but it pulls tight everywhere else. No cable has managed this. I've looked into a shorter replacement cable, but alas, Shure does not make one."
1469,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds quality is just OK. It does not seem to deliver bass very well, but on most songs it seem to be just OK, not great and not terrible. This didn't bother me too much since sound quality was not my primary motivation for buying these, I was looking for the noise isolation properties.

The noise isolation features are a mix. The earbuds themselves actually work fairly well in isolating noise, as advertised, but the cables are awful. This seems to be due to the cables being more rigid and heavier than usual earphone cables. Unless I stand (not sit) absolutely still, all I hear are the cables rubbing against my clothes or my table or whatever object is nearby. The only remedy seem to be to detach the cables completely, turning these into an expensive pair of earplugs.

If your intent is to replace the environmental noise with cable noise, these earphones will do the trick. If your intent is to drown out environmental noise with music, these earphones perform poorly relative to other earphones."

1485,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
1486,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the Bose IE headphones before these, and there is no comparison, these have such clearer mids and highs, and you can really feel the bass in these earbuds. They also sound better than my qc2s, which is pretty surprising considering the price difference, although I cannot speak to comparing them to the newer qc15s. It takes a little while to figure out just how to get the earbuds fitting comfortably, and in the right position. If they don't sound incredible right from the start, you're probably not wearing them right. If the silicone or foam tip is not in the right position to give you a nice noise isolating seal and get the sound directly into your ear, they sound like completely mediocre headphones. With a little adjustment, you should be able to feel a good seal, preventing most outside noise, and then they will sound amazing. I take a train into a city everyday, and they cancel out almost all outside noise, making for a great morning commute. They handle everything beautifully and most of my music sounds like I'm listening to it for the first time. Jazz (Miles Davis, Ella and Louis) sounds richer and more dynamic than I've ever heard. One of the most interesting things about the Shures is that in areas of songs where extreme highs used to be grating on my ears using other headphones, on these they sound more balanced, much less harsh, and more like the notes were probably intended. Rock, classical, pop and bluegrass all sound amazing, but the Shure 215s are most impressive when you throw bass-heavy music at them. Daft Punk sounds like you're at a live concert, and the bass rocks like you would not believe. All in all, these are incredible earbuds that deserve all the praise they're getting. Highly recommended."
1487,5.0 out of 5 stars,GOOD
1488,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the worst experience with these headphones. the way they want you to put them in is very awkward. I had to look in a mirror every time to get them in upside down properly Once you get them in they are not at all comfortable and after a half hour your ears start hurting. The cord feels very stiff and they impede your movement, so couldn't imagine working out with them or anything. the sound is adequate but hardly blew me away. I sent them back as I don't see how you could possibly justify these being $100. Maybe you get used to some of those things, but I don't think they would ever be worth the price tag."
1489,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these earphones and hope to use them for a long time. I use them as IEM's when I play the drums and they muffle the sound of my drums very nicely. The sound is well balanced and easy on my ears. The one complaint that I have is that the part of the cable that is adjustable is not as sturdy as it was made out to be. The way you are able to mold them to your ear shape is through a wire that runs along with the cable. The wire deteriorates and snapped after only about 6 months of use. I would recommend being prepared to buy an extra cable or a third-party braided cable which would offer more support. Otherwise, these are a great pair of IEM's at an amazing price."

I hear more detail, more treble and a better sound stage. The bass is also very tight. I found that using the foam sleeves it was difficult to get a perfect seal, and so the bass was lacking. But after changing to the silicone sleeve solved the problem and it blocked more outside noise and I was able to feel more bass. Detachable cables are a plus, and Shure's 2 year warranty is one of the best in the business. I have previously returned my Se110 for distortion problems and Shure send me new pair without any questions asked. I totally stand behind this company and love their earphones. I hear instruments that i never knew were present before. These earphones are a great bang for your buck. For $100 you are getting a great product, 2 year warranty, detachable cables and one of the best build quality that I have seen."

1512,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you've been using the E2C's and looking for a replacement, this is not it!

Don't get me wrong, these earphones are built with exceptional physical quality and the cord seems pretty robust. Sound is another issue entirely! I'm aware there is only one driver but the sound quality is absolutely terrible. Huge amount of muddy bass and frizzled clarity as I tested these phones from everything to Bjork / George Winston / Clara Ponty / Bon Iver / Feist / Fleet Foxes / Memphis May Fire / White Chapel / Between the Buried and Me / Beloved / Thelonious Monk / BB King. They sound much better as the phones are turned up louder but I shouldn't have to make that compromise to have a minimal par sound from a pair of $90 headphones.

I really wanted to love these but unfortunately Shure didn't do these phones justice on the sound level. Looks like I'll be switching to Etymotic for now."
1513,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice
1514,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They were a good buy, they sounded very good and so far nothing seems wrong with them."
1515,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always loved Shure earphones, but this model is beyond annoying. The jack has been changed such that it won't fit through my iphone case (Speck, a quite popular case). But more importantly, as others have noted, the cord is stiffened and bendable near the ear supposedly so you can mould the cord over the top of your ear, but it's difficult to manipulate, requiring 2 hands (and even in the mirror I had a hard time putting these in).
The older models just easily slipped into the ear, and over the ear. There was no need to ""improve"" on them.
I've returned mine."
1516,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the sound quality expected.
1517,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The earbuds are great. They have some serious bass. That said, the sound is incredibly well balanced. The only flaw I can point out is that the highs are slightly weak. Still, 5-star earbuds."
1518,4.0 out of 5 stars,sound fantastic but one of the sides where the cable and earphone connect stated to cut in and out was really frustrating and i had no way to take them apart it was like it was glued in there

My wife

1520,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great for what you're paying, actually these should cost more with the audio quality they deliver. Unfortunately I had to return these for two reasons:
1) I could not get over how uncomfortable these were. I have pretty sensitive ears and the wrap around cord was a constant nusance and just felt uncomfortable.
2) this next reason is my fault, but I wasn't looking for earphones which block out all noise, which is something these earphones do well. I couldn't hear any outside noise, this making me feel uncomfortable when walking in public."
1521,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
1522,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are terrible earphones. The right ear bud failed after about ten hours of use, so I ordered a second pair, assuming my defective first pair was a fluke. It wasn't. The right ear bud of my second pair failed after about the same amount of brief use. Do not purchase this product."
1523,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality - use them under my helmet - should have bought them years ago!!!!
1524,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great. Good sound quality and the ear pieces provide good ambient sound insulation.
1525,1.0 out of 5 stars,The behind ear design is ridiculous. The mic version cable is very thin and flimsy and was clearly not designed to go behind the ear. Therefore the cable does not stay behind the ear and starts flopping around. This is as good as trash. I miss my SE115.

1532,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll just keep it short.
As others mentioned, the sound quality just blows other products, with similar price tag, off the water.
However, the design flaw of the product constantly cuts off the sound.
For instance, if you turn your head certain way, the sound gets cut off.

Even putting the design flaw into consideration, the amazing sound quality just tops that negative aspect of the earphone.
Overall satisfactory product."

1536,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the worst earphones I've ever bought. One side started to stop working after only a few hours of having them and the sound isn't any better than the cheap $10 earphones I had before I bought these. The chord is really bulky and unnecessarily long, so it's always getting tangled and caught on things. The earbuds are uncomfortable and I couldn't get a good seal with any of the earpieces that were provided, so there's barely any sound isolation. I'll make sure to never bother to buy a Shure product again if they are all this bad of quality."
1537,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic
1538,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality, battery life, and comfort factors all work well for me and I've had no Bluetooth connection issues. I can't discern any difference between Bluetooth wireless and cabled audio using my SE215s, but then again I might have a tin ear. I have had good success the the microphone despite the somewhat awkward placement when the cable is worn behind the head. The included clip allows it to be secured to the back of a shirt to keep the cable from swaying around while you are moving. Overall I am happy with the purchase. One star lost because of the lack of aptX support but this isn't enough to make me unhappy with the product on a day to day basis."
1539,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Using with an audio technica monitor and after changing frequency channels, moving receiver closer, and adjusting the squelch, the sound drops in volume after five minutes and static increases after 10 min usage. No different than the in ears that came with monitor"

1544,2.0 out of 5 stars,Used one day and returned for a refund (Amazon is great about this). The buds were a pain to get in my ear and stay put. They are heavy and are uncomfortable after a while.

1549,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had got these headphones about a month ago and these sound unlike anything I've ever heard! The review these have gotten are true to their word. I've owend many headphones throughout the years and I can honestly say theses are my best buys so far. I like the detachable cables so if the cable has a short just replace the cable and not the whole thing. One thing I would recommend is buy a set of triple flang ear tips as they make a perfect pair!

what more could you look for? and at a price of 100 bucks.. (I'd snapped them when they were 90 bucks tho ;))
All I could say is this is money well-spent.

anyone looking for wonderful earphones all around should seriosly consider these. I'd reccommend it to anyone with no hesisation. in fact, one of my friends has bougth one after my reccommendation and he's loving it!"
1557,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll keep this review short and to the point. I received these headphones yesterday and had trouble with them from the start. The foam tip is EXTREMELY hard to pull off, which is ridiculous. I felt like a bodybuilder after I removed them. I even caught myself flexing in the mirror. The sound quality is good, but not good enough to justify it's price. The highs are a bit harsh and the bass and drive are lacking. The headphones become rather uncomfortable after 30 minutes or so. The only positive is the sound isolation, which does a good job at blocking out sound. I'll give these another chance and will continue to use them for the next few days. If I have a change of heart, an updated review will surely follow."

1559,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They're amazing, They do there job"
1560,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is good but fit is awful
1561,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these headphones for about 2 months. While the sound is one of the best I've ever gotten from these types of headphones, one of the earbuds died on me. This probably happened due to having them coiled in my pocket, stretching possibly etc. If you do consider buying this; make sure you treat them with care, just because they're expensive doesn't mean they're invincible, and I would strongly recommend buying from the website so you can get insurance (if that's a thing for these)."
1562,5.0 out of 5 stars,I would classify my self as an audiophile. I have a Mcintosh amp and B&W 803D Speakers as my main listening environment. I would say these are a little light in the bass department for my liking the highs were crisp bu not over powering. I would say these are very good for the money. I have there predisesors and have used them for years. the E2c. I can not report any issues with this headset. I would like more clear highs and some more deep bass but given the drive configuration of these they are very good. I would buy them again
1563,2.0 out of 5 stars,"REVIEW UPDATE:
Shortly after posting this review, I ran into some serious, and constant issues with the Bluetooth connectivity. It's advertised that this unit would receive a 30 foot connection radius. however, they would lose connection even when sitting less than a foot away from the connected device. This occurred with two phones (iOS and Android), my watch, and my laptop. I have contacted Amazon, and a replacement unit is being shipped. I'll update this with the outcome when I have it. But until this issue is resolved, I have to lower my rating. While the sound quality is great, the main selling point of these earphones is their Bluetooth connectivity, and if they can't do that critical task, I can't see why you'd not just purchase the wired version for $50 cheaper,

If you’ve ever used the wired 215’s, you’ll know exactly how these fit and perform. The only addition is he new Bluetooth cord, which provides much more versatility. Connecting the earphones to my phone and watch proved effortless. I’ve used the wired 215’s, and there is no difference in the sound quality; crisp and full-bodied.

An all-around winner for its price range. And the great thing is is can use the same Bluetooth cable for my 535’s if I so desire."

Because I did not buy them directly from Shure I don't get to return it to them. $100 headphones that lasted me barely 2 months, and if you consider that I only use them on Sundays and Wednesdays (and not every week) I didn't even use them 30 days very disappointed"
1567,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound

1569,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!!
1570,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I play drums in a regularly gigging band and have been wanting to move away from an active on stage monitor to an in ear system. I purchased these earphones and together with an inexpensive headphone amp I have achieved that goal.

I now am able to hear the other musicians, as well as myself without the having my ears blasted by my drums along with a loud on stage monitor. I have used this setup a few times now and I really do like it. The sound produced by the Shure SE215's is very adequate for my monitoring needs. I am sure that had I spent many hundreds of dollars more on custom fitted ear phones I would have a even better result but this is fine for me and it was definitely an affordable solution.

The cable on these is very heavy duty and I can see it being very durable.The wire near the ear pieces, bends nicely around the back of your ear and with the various types and sizes of rubber and foam inserts I think most people will be able to achieve a comfortable fit.

I have recommended this product to friends and will do so in the future."
1571,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned these for four years, and I can honestly say that these stand the test of time. I probably use these about an hour and a half every single day. The cords last me about two years. Cat chewed one cord, and the other cord had a snap in the flexible metal rod near the earpiece (for shaping the cord over your ear). I went with a cheaper off-brand cord for a few months, but ended up just buying the cord from Shure each time because it is much better quality. $30ish every two years is not that bad as a ""maintenance"" cost, in my opinion. If you are more careful with the cord than me, it will probably last much longer."
1572,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile, but I do appreciate a good set of headphones. I think these are priced for those who know they don't want the cheap stock headphones that come with most phones and tablets but aren't discerning enough to notice the extra stuff in the headphones that are in the 200+ range. Overall I think where my other headphones struggled was when I listened to jazz because I would get those crackling distortions. In these I don't get that at all and I can really hear a lot more detail. The insertion into the ear can be confusing at first but works well after a couple tries. As far as comfort I think I would have chosen the Bose sound sports but in reviews they said the Shures had better noise isolation which was a bigger concern of mine."
1573,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned several sets of on-ear noise cancelling headphones from Sennheiser over the last several years, but decided to try these in-ear Shure SE215s at the recommendation from an online review site. Wow. Wow!

The sound isolation from these headphones is simply incredible. Noises from planes, office environments, mowing grass, etc. are almost completely blocked out. The incredible thing about this isolation is that I now hear musical passages and sounds that I would never have heard in these noisy environments from a portable set of headphones. As an added benefit, there is no active circuitry, so batteries are a thing of the past!

The sound quality of these are amazing as well. I've paid more than twice as much for over-the-ear cans and honestly have a hard time finding much difference in the sound from these portables. There is a slight over-emphasis in the mid bass that I sometimes have to tame with the free Denon EQ/Audio app that I typically use, but the rest of the spectrum is top notch, especially for the price. If I wanted to spend more, I've no doubt that the sound quality would only get better the SE315s or 415s.

I am pleased with the comfort of these as well. It took a little time to adjust to the feel of a set of in-ear headphones since I was coming from years of on-ear portables. I tried all of the supplied pads and settled on the medium foam set. I can wear these continuosly for 5-6 hours if needed, so transcontinental flights are a breeze. Sleeping in these is much easier than before as well. They are much less obtrusive than on-ear phones and the sound volume can be very low because of the high isolation.

Construction seems to be good as well. I have seen other reviews regarding one or the other cable giving problems, but I haven't had these problems and I have used them outside, exposing them to sweat and numerous cable snags. Having the ability to replace the entire cable assembly for roughly $30 is a nice plus too.

In short I'm very happy with these headphones. The fact that these sound so good, yet are so small and portable is amazing to me. If you have a discerning ear and might find the need for occasional EQ on some recordings to be a nusiance, you might want to spend more and go for the SE315s. If you are like me and don't want to spend more than $100 on a set of portable headphones that might get lost, stolen, or otherwise damaged, then look no further.

Pros:
-Noise isolation is amazing
-Sound quality is impressive for price
-Comfort is very good, 5+ hours is easy, and sleep is also possible.

Cons:
-Mid-bass might be too heavy for some, can be tamed with a little EQ."
1574,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sure, these are Shure, but what does that mean to you, and why should you buy these? These are of the quality you would expect from Shure. This is a newer design by the manufacture that allows you to change out the cord with different models. The highs are crisp, the mids are fantastic, and the bass is powerful. These come with several in ear pads that allow a custom fit for you. You've tried the cheap in ear monitors, so now may be the best time to upgrade to these in ear monitors. You won't be disappointed with this model."
1575,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using Bose in ear headphones for so long I didn't think there was anything that could be better other than studio headphones. I was wrong way wrong, a friend of mine bought these things and I just so happened to borrow them one day (couldn't find my Bose) and these blew me away. In fact the next day when I returned these to my friend, I told him I bought some on Amazon last night.

I simply love them, along with great sound they basically cut you off from the outside world with its sound isolation technology. I thought my Bose were good at that and after using these I realized that Bose didn't do anything but let outside sounds be heard. I also like how the actual speakers separate from the cable so after extensive use they can be replaced.

The only downside I have had with these is the over ear part of using them, seems to be hard for them to keep their shape once in your ear. Shure could have done better in my opinion by just keeping it simple with a cable hanging from them.

Overall, these are well worth the $100 you will spend to get them, they are far superior to Bose in-ear headphones. If the money isn't a problem to you then these will serve you well."
1576,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones. But first I have to say, I got sent a defective set. Needless to say I was pretty disappointed but I sent them back to Shure for a warranty claim. Within 2 weeks I received a brand new set, no questions asked. The new set was amazing. I've used mostly cheap headphones. The best I've had was a set of Skull Candy Titans earbuds. These blew those Titans out of the water. Great sound, high highs and low lows. The sound isolation is great and I really like the over the ear style. I've fallen asleep with these in my ears and didn't wake up with sore ears. Just a good product all around....with the exception of getting defective ones of course."
1577,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was disappointed for a while that this product wasn't available on Amazon Global but recently a friend came back from the US so I asked him to bring it back for me.

I must say it was worth the wait. These earphones are really solidly built - the cables are thick, heavy and long enough for the rowing machine (putting the phone on the floor). The sound is rich and natural sounding. I use them over a mix of audiobooks, pop, rock, hip hop - it handles everything well. Of course, the sound would assumably be even better with the higher end Shures but you'd have to pay several multiples of this (you can see from all my reviews that I have a strong value bias). For this price, I'd say this beats the Ultimate Ears 600s and are now the ones I like to reach for to enjoy my music.

I think one thing that really helps are the foam tips - it forms a very good seal, making the music even more immersive. I wonder why not more manufacturers ship their earphones with foam tips?"
1578,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for use in my church praise team in-ear monitors after a recommendation from our worship associate minister. As a bass player, I need good bass response without losing the highs from the other instruments and vocals and these fit the bill! With other earbuds, I had to crank the bass so much to overpower the drums that my ears would be ringing by the end of the day. The noise isolation of these earbuds allow me to turn down the volume but hear more, and save my hearing!

My only gripe is that the foam tips are a bit difficult to remove, but that also ensures that they don't come off in your ears!"
1579,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I work as a scopist (a person who edits legal transcripts for court reporters) and use buds daily. I was looking for a comfortable set to replace the ones I had worn out. Sound is VERY important since I need to hear exactly what's going on in depositions and trials, and these fit that bill perfectly in that regard. The sound IS great. However, they drove me nuts! I hated the over-the-ear wire. I was very awkward. I wear glasses and it was frustrating to get that wire to stay put. The buds kept falling out (and I tried several sizes) and the wire annoyed me. I couldn't just pop 'em in and go. I had to adjust them each time. No thanks. I don't have time for that. I got the Bose IE2 instead and LOVE them. The sound is amazing and I don't even feel them in my ears. Easy in, easy out. Good luck to you all in your search."
1580,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty decent music.
1581,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best workout earphones out there. The over-the-ear design limits that pounding noise you hear when you tap on your wire when having earphones in. If you are not buying them for working out, then I seriously do not recommend buying earphones at all. Get a pair of decent headphones with a bigger soundscape."
1582,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise cancelation on these iems is shockingly effective. The cable isn't particularly comfortable but is extremely durable and keeps theme from falling out. The overall sound stage is fairly narrow but not quite cramped and not at all muddy. The basses are rich and strong but certainly not overpowering, the mids are clear and the trebles are articulate. They performed just a little better than I wouldo expect from a relatively quite cheap pair of IEMs. Would recommend would buy again."
1583,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The earphone doesn't live up its hype/amazing reviews on Amazon, PC Mag, and many other expert consumer electronic reviewers. As a person who has been quite active in the earphone market for the past 5-6 years, the earphone doesn't project the sound of a $99.00 worth of a machine. I would recommend getting something else with a similar price like Beats - urBeats (sigh, here goes the hate) or Klipsch X5/X10 rather than this earphone. But I really appreciate their customer service for letting me return this thing, thanks.

1584,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product x
1585,2.0 out of 5 stars,I am surprised that this earphone didn't eork for me. I aas counting so much on its brand name. The sound is very thin and broken. My husband used it for his game but he wasn't also happy for another reason that it don't hold up well. I wished I had the time to return it.
1586,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these to have quality sounding ear buds. I had eventually hoped to find a pair of ear buds I can skate with. Generally I struggle w/ ear buds falling out as I look left / right in traffic and sweat being an issue.

I got these Shure SE215-CL just to try them out. I wasn't so much concerned about the sound as Shure is generally decent quality (bit over priced in my opinion compared to what you get just like Bose).

After wearing them at my office desk in Orlando, FL, I realized the sound quality was fairly decent w/ a nice bass quality and noise canceling. Sadly I could not wear them for more than 15 minutes. After 15 minutes sitting in front of my MacBook, I realized I was in great discomfort. No matter how I position the anchors over my ears, they sank down and pulled my tops of the ears down along with the discomfort of having the buds in my ear which I assume you grow used to...

Point is these were extremely uncomfortable in my ears as a personal opinion. Your mileage may vary but after 30 minutes, it was clear this was a return for me."
1587,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for durability and decent sound quality. I wasn't expecting the best sound from them but wanted something on par with Klipsch Image S4's. After trying multiple different ear piece sizes and listining to them for 5 days I finally gave up. They don't sound as good as the $37 Sony MDR-EX210's I've been using for the past month... let alone the image S4's. They lack any mid range sound performance and have no bass except for extreme low notes (rare in most music even rap). The main reason I bought these was the durability. Aparently Shure failed here too as the left side intermittently cuts out a few times a day and has since day one.

I was hoping to have a decent sounding pair of earbuds that would survive the abuse of being used 8 hours a day for over 6 months.My past 4 pairs of $70-100 headphones have all failed near the cord connection to earbud, the cable, or from liquid. At least those earbuds sounded good for almost a year before they broke. These were a failure from the begining."
1588,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own these earbuds and i need to say that these are the best earbuds i have ever heard.
About the isolation-
The earbuds are so isolating when you first use them you cannot hear anything or anyone when you put your ipod at 25% power. If you think that you could go on a jog with these be careful cause you will not hear a thing. After a while I need to take out the earbuds because it can get uncomfortable hearing nothing from the outside world.
Also when you play the music it will feel like the music is coming strait from your brain.
Sound Quality-
The treble is nicely represented, not to harsh and not to rolled off. The mids are brilliant but when i first used them i thought that the vocals sounded a little quiet on these but i find that after a month or two these earbuds break in and everything sounds beautiful. Now my favorite part, the bass. I love the bass on these. I have the ATH-M50 and those sound great but sometimes id like a little more boom to my bass, and these earbuds do a fantastic job of delivering bass (Its not annoyingly bassy, but I find it to be just right).
Another note-
When I was looking for earbuds i had to choose between these the soul by luda, and the beats. These earbuds are made for ADULTS and not some fancy pantsy rapper. Dont get the cool looking pieces of plastic because they look cool, save your money and get something that will sound better- PLEASE!

Anyways if your looking for a sub 150$ headphone than look no further because i cannot recommend this headphone enough."

1595,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these and used for about 4 months on and off. I was pleased with their performance. Then the right ear piece seemed to lose one of it's drivers and became very quiet so I sent it in for repair. Shure sent it back saying it was a counterfeit and they couldn't service or warranty it. I haven't been able to get any service from Amazon either so now I'm out my money and a pair of in ears.

spend the money get something you can really use. Shure makes great products but these are NOT useable IEMs for a three pc rock band."

1602,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones
1603,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot comment on the audio quality of these earbuds because they were defective on arrival. They were needed for a concert on 9/12/15 and now we have to go out and get another pair someplace local where we can evaluate them directly. The earpiece was too large so one of the smaller ones was needed. The earpiece was either forced on or an adhesive was used. I pulled and twisted on the earbud with all my strength and it finally came off a millimeter at a time. Was far too difficult. To make matters worse, the other side earpiece completely broke off from the device before the earpiece would come off, thus ruining the entire se215."
1604,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Here's a quick review of these Shure SE215-K earphones The sound quality is wonderful. Good bass and even mid's and high's. It took a little while to get adjusted to the fit of the earpiece but after a few runs you don't even notice it. But I must say, because of how the earpiece goes over the ear sweat tends to run into your eardrum. Not good. Also the connection at the earpiece needs to be eliminated. Does not hold up and may cause interruption in the sound. Very frustrating. But if your a casual listener these are great and I would recommend. Hopefully Shure will come out with a sports version."
1605,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Short and sweet. Sound quality is good, not 100 bucks good, but good. Incredibly annoying design, constantly slips out when Im running. Very annoying to put back in. The whole loop over the ear thing is ridiculous. I would not buy this design again, but if they had a more straight forward in the ear design Id consider it."
1606,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelent
1607,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Brand new. Un-boxed. Plugged in. Noticed the left side cutting out after only 10 minutes. Pitiful, PITIFUL quality assurance by Shure! These should have NEVER passed inspection (if they even inspect in the first place). Other than that, they sound ""okay""."
1608,5.0 out of 5 stars,i really love it
1609,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay - nothing is meant to last forever...but these earphones are top notch. Recently my old Shure SE headphones broke. The cable near the headphone cracked due to being dried out. I had them for 7 years and listened to them twice a week, while on a plane and used them in the gym. They cancel out the noise w/out using sound. I tried changing to Klipsch and Etymotic, but didn't like the cords. When I moved, they were extremely loud. I reverted back to Shure and I am glad I did. Shure's repair policy and customer service is garbage, they wanted $90 to repair my old ones, and for a few bucks more I could just buy new...but they last a long time and a have great sound. Food for thought..."
1610,5.0 out of 5 stars,so amazing~~~
1611,3.0 out of 5 stars,I've had these for a couple of months now and can't get them to fit right most of the time - only on occasion am I able to get them to sit tight. Then they're amazing except I dread that anyone will try to talk to me because you can't hear anything and then need to take them out which means struggling to put them back in again.
1612,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good
1613,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounding headphones. Warm, well rounded sound. You'll hear everything more clear than you ever have. Ambient sound isolation is great.

They can be a little tricky to get in your ear at first, especially if you have small ear canals like me."
1614,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolute piece of junk. Broke within two weeks, no hard usage, no exposure to moisture. It's under warranty, but it's not worth the time or money for S&H to replace. Good sound quality, but not very comfortable. I bought these because they were supposed to be durable and reliable, but it was a waste of time and money."
1615,4.0 out of 5 stars,good
1616,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually buy cheap headphones, because they brake all the time. I am brutal with them. I use them in work & the gym, etc. I decided to buy some good one's as the the cd in my local gym was seriously wrecking my head. My friend recommended this set and he was right. The minute I put them in my ears I knew I had been idiot. I heard parts in tracks I hadn't heard before. Sound isolating is the way to go. If I get a year out of them I'll be a very happy camper. Definitely worth the dollars,"
1617,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them Great!!

1619,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good
1620,2.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound quality but the actual ear buds are awkward and it's hard to get them positioned in your ear properly. Bending the wire over your ear is also annoying... I had an older pair of Shure earbuds that was much better. Just put them in and go without having to fiddle with them...
1621,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good
1622,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Right ear failed (quit working) during 12 mi run..grrrrr! :-( The bass and overall sound were excellent though. Besides failing, my only issue was putting them on/around/in my ear quicker. I'm returning these and going back to Bose!"
1623,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great. They have great bass, clarity in the high end, and good definition in the mid range. They come with six different sets of ear pieces and I found a good fit, so almost everyone will be able to find a good fit. I've been working in a sound booth part time for the past five years and have tried many different sets of headphones, including some that cost much more than these and honestly these are the best value for any in-ears under $225."
1624,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved these earphones, great noise cancelling and quality sound at a reasonable price. However, it seems that it was too good to be true, as just after 1.5 months of moderate use, the left earphone died. And it wasn't a cable issue as I switched the cable around and still had no sound coming from the left monitor. Quite a shame, as I'm sure it wasn't something on my part as I'm really careful around my electronics. Can't return as time's up for RMA."
1625,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Good!!!
1626,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've never been an in-ear headphones kind of guy, but these are great. We use this on stage for worship, and I literally only hear what I want to hear."
1627,5.0 out of 5 stars,9-Jun
1628,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from Klipsch S4i, these sound much louder, much bassier and almost everything is better. However using the Klispch I used to love the overall neutrality of those, these are a teeeny bit bass heavy but that's fine by me and m sure with a lot of other people too.
Totally worth the price and infact probably the best you can get within this price range."
1629,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair of Shure SE115s which I liked very much. Unfortunately, I left them behind on an airplane. Since the 115s are no longer available, I ""upgraded"" to the 215s. Compared to the 115s, which had strong bass but a very warm overall sound, the 215s sound very tinny to me, more like some $40 Sony earbuds I had a few years back."
1630,2.0 out of 5 stars,"sorry to said but i have a cheaper headphones and are doing the same work as if it was like this expensive headphones, don't have a lot of volume, i was looking for a headphone so i can hear music in a loud environment,"
1631,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great. I use for playing music in a band at church and my old ones always distorted when all the different instruments were turned up. I used these for the first time and had no distortion. Nice to be able to have adequate bass and drums without the crackle and buzz. Took a little to get used to how they connect in the ear, but after a few tries I had it down."
1632,1.0 out of 5 stars,The listing mentioned nothing about the earbuds designed to be worn LOOPED around your ears. I bought these for my wife for Christmas. Wife hated them. Then had to hassle with the return
1633,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy
1634,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These have great sound quality, but the ear buds are cumbersome to use. I am sorry that I bought these as I don't use them now. They take too much time to put on and then they do not stay in ."
1635,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're used to the old Shure headphones (as I was) you will be disappointed by the size and shape of these. The large plastic diaphragm is very uncomfortable, at least for my ears. I'd recommend trying one of the competitors since now there are many more than there used to be.

Sound quality is as good as ever though."
1636,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are extremely well designed IEMs with an excellent design with the exception of one design flaw.
I'm very hard and headphones and though I liked the Klipsch S4s, I was going through a new pair every 3 months.
The cable connection to the earpieces kept going bad. So the detachable cables on these IEMs sold me.
The cables are extremely durable and thick, and detach through a unique swiveling connection to the earpieces. I got quickly used to over-the-ear style which also takes some the strain off of the cable.

Sound quality: Very very good for $100. These take ~50 hours of breaking in, but after that provide
very solid bass and clear albeit slightly rolled-off highs. Compared to the Klipsch S4s, they are more balanced across the entire range. Overall, not quite as much bass punch as the S4s but more neutral mids and highs.

The one design flaw: The plastic posts that hold the earbuds on are longer than average, which helps hold the inserts on with more force. Unfortunately, the plastic posts will also easily break if you happen to step on the earpieces. After 3 months, both are broken and the IEMs are unusable."
1637,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Now the right earphone is so low I can't hear anything. I unfortunately would have to return these.

Changing my review, the left earphone is no more working properly, the volume on that one goes out intermittently and is always low. I mostly use this earphone when I fly, which is twice a week."
1638,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am, well was, a big fan of Shure. I have used an E2C for a number of years and was really impressed with their quality and performance... these were work horses. As a highly trusted companion they were with me at least a million miles and so many airports... and they just WORE out. So... I purchased the SE215-K... - really impressive sound! I pulled them out of the box and took them on their maiden voyage and for the first few hours they worked like a champ then things went down hill. The sound started fading and coming back and then it went mono with intermittent stereo with a weird phasing sound... I twisted the plug and stereo would come back and once I let the plug go it would go back to mono. I changed Ipods (spares in case of battery failure) but they were the same - even checked my phone. I fidgeted with the cable and realized the failure is in the plug... uh oh...

I guess I could get on a soap box about quality but why...Shure had a great product - typical. I am sure Shure chose to save a hand full of pennies and introduced a sub par supplier... and their quality has plummeted. If I wanted a $20 set of in ear monitors I would have bought them - instead I paid a little more (lot) for QUALITY but that seems didn't come in the box."
1639,1.0 out of 5 stars,They weren't that amazing for the price they give. They say they feel good after long periods of wearing but it's not. After 10 minuets of flat no bass listening they hurt my ears and I just put on my cheap iPad headphones which I prefer over these.
1640,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading a log of reviews both positive and negative, i took the plunge and bought a pair of these. The quality of the earphones is great if you could get them to stay on your ear. Having them stay on my ears was the most challenging part of it. They would keep falling out even if you start chewing gum or something like that. Because of the discomfort i had in having them on my ears i rated it low, for quality i would say its a 4 star product"
1641,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved these buds when they worked. First pair was intermittent out of one ear the first day. I liked them enough to try it again. Got the next pair and they worked for about a week. Just long enough to really be disappointed again. I would pay $200 for a pair of these that would last a year. Buy, getting tired of shipping them back. Moving on to another brand. Based on other reviews it sounds like this is common. I'm surprised there are so many good reviews. Maybe everyone writes them in the first week of owning these things."
1642,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You have to be a pure audiophile to not love them.
3 best things
1. Sound quality
2. Build is sturdy with nice thick wires but not so thick they are unmanageable.
3. Can replace damaged wires without having to buy a while new pair with detachable ear piece"
1643,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered Shure SE210-A-K-EFS earphones 2 years ago (and loved these) and I needed a replacement for them. I figured these new earphones would be as good or better, but Shure has redesigned them and the earphones are now horrible. I could not use the orange foam sleeves that I prefer with these new earphones and none are provided. It took forever to figure out how to put them in my ears. They are a one size fits all and they don't fit my ears. There is a stiff wire that bends around your ear and if you wear sunglasses or glasses they will move the wire and pop the ear piece out of your ear. Once you figure out how to get the earphones in your ears they feel very uncomfortable. They actually hurt my ears. The sound was not as good as my old Shure earphones because the fit was so bad. The did not go into my ear far enough for me to hear full sound. I immediately arranged for a return and refund. I then purchased some Audio Technica over the ear earphones that a friend recommended. I will use them until Shure comes to their senses and designs an earphone that fits and is comfortable. I hope the people from Shure are reading my review. I am so disappointed with Shure's new earphones. I've owned Shure earphones for over 12 years and I will not buy them until they make changes to the fit."
1644,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great while it worked. Dead in less than two months. Seriously disappointing considering the sound and build quality of 535’s...I wish it would translate over to their Bluetooth cord.
1645,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good quality (expected from Shure) works great with my se215 drivers, call quality is superb, battery life is good, very happy! No issues or complaints."
1646,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones have excellent sound quality and the reinforced cable near the earpieces solves a problem I had with my last pair of Shure earbuds - the cable frayed near the earpieces after just a couple of months.

On the other hand, they don't do a very good job keeping out ambient noise. My active noise-cancelling headphones are much better at that."
1647,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst purchase ever. The trouble is with the detachable model of the earphones. Maybe I got a defective cable - or many people are having this issue - I have no idea. The earbuds keep detaching themselves from the main cable. The result is that I lost the left earbud twice. Support was good about replacing it once - the second time around they quoted a price of 78$ for replacing the lost earbud. Save yourself the trouble and buy a pair of the Bose Sport Model. Totally every cent worth the extra 30$.
1648,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off saying that for price on Amazon, the Klipsch headphones are a great buy. I have owned them for about 6 months before they started shorting out. Im not sure if it was the headphones themselves but I tend to run through earbuds rather quickly. That let start the direct comparison.

Comfort:
I would have to give a slight edge to the Klipsch headphones over the Shures here. The Klipsch soft ear sleeves just slide in but there is a pro and con to everything. The Shure's use a foam tip that expands in your ear. It creates a much better seal and therefore has better noise-isolation then the S4's. My ear sometimes feels a little discomfort after wearing them for a while but i may just need to switch the smaller sleeves they provide.

Secure Fit:
The SE215 has the clear advantage hear. The headphones are tricky to learn to get in but once you do the very nature of how the sit in the ear makes them much more secure. The headphone cord comes forward then loops over and behind the ear. Tugging on the cord rarely budges these things. Meanwhile, I have had problems with the S4's coming out, especially if I'm working out.

Ease of use:
The S4's have the edge here. You simply push them in. The SE215's require to roll the foam tips before you put them in to get the best seal and to loop the cord over your ear. that can be annoying if they fall out while running. That said they much less likely to fall out. The S4's have alternate of putting them in that involves looping the cord as well but i found it to be uncomfortable.

Noise-isolation:
Advantage goes the SE215s for the reasons mentioned before, the foam tips.

Construction:
Both seem well constructed. The SE215 feels more substantial and the cord is much thicker. It seems less prone to tangling.

Performance:
As i wrote this I listened to the same song once with each pair with the same EQ and volume settings. The SE215 were louder and sounded cleaner for the same songs and settings. The bass was deep and the highs were clear. The S4's are no slouch either. They outperform most other sub-$100 earbuds out there.

Bottom line:
Both are a great set of the headphones. The SE215's are $100 and the S4's are $60. Do the Shure's justify the extra $40? yes. but its all personal preference. The S4's are a steal for $60. That said I really appreciate the superior performance, fit, and noise-isolation."
1649,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's very convenience when you go wireless, easy to connect, great battery life
When I connected with my SE846s the sound is just acceptable, sound not powerful and not crisp, the sound stage not wide as with the stock cable
Sometime I faced sound lag and sometime its drop

BTW it's good Bluetooth upgrade for your Shure SE series if you think you can accept with a bit lower sound performance from your current SEs with a cable"
1650,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality, but these don't fit my ears that well. I have been turning the over-the-ear part forward since they don't stay in my ears otherwise. They get uncomfortable after a while."
1651,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It's disappointing because these are advertised as providing 37 dB of isolation, assuming a good fit using their foam earplug-like attachment. Here's my thoughts:

1. The shape is odd and clumsy, like sticking a yo yo in your ear.
2. The cord is long enough to skip rope with.
3. You need small hands and a death grip to remove the tips.
4. My over-the-ear, non-isolating Sennheiser's have better sound isolation.
5. Removing these and re-inserting takes time, so using these in the average workplace is out of the question.

As a basic test, take a cheap pair of store-bought earplugs, which typically provide 29-32 dB of isolation, and find a spot with some amount of background noise (low-volume television, etc...). With isolation this good, you should see someone's lips moving when they speak at normal volume, but you shouldn't hear even a whisper. These headphones don't even remotely come close to 37 dB of isolation. I'm assuming they used some sort of test device with inflatable ears to make this claim."
1652,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice product, very good sound! The only problem is that the soft part of the ear bud doesn't quite fit my ear, so the headphones tend to fall out. I tried putting another size on and they won't go on at all. I used the tool and read and reread the instructions and I can't figure out how to get the ear pieces to fit on there. Once I finally figure it out, this product will rock my ears off!"
1653,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed new headphones for my ipod, something practical, yet with good sound quality. Before this I had the Klipsch S4, which provided really good sound quality, but the cable didn't last long... So after doing some research I got this ones, and I'm not totally happy about them. Yes, the sound quality is awesome, but they are really uncomfortable, they even kinda hurt, and just to get them on I need some sort of manual.

The other issue I have with them is the sound isolation feature. Even though it works incredibly, I never thought it would be an issue for when I went out and around. I like to listen music while commuting or just out walking, but adding to the fact that they are uncomfortable and hard to get on/off, it gets me slightly paranoid not to listen to anything around me but my music, just something to keep in mind... And even though I can't listen to anything around me, I can listen to my steps, and that can be really annoying...

So even though they are good at doing their job, we are not a good fit..."
1654,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dont waste your money. I bought them thinking they would at least last a year based on their price. after less than a month of use the input plug doesn't work like any other cheap earphones out there.

1662,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I fell in love with Shure SE-Series over 4 years ago. When I purchased my first pair of Shure SE-115's, great design: the wires were not too long and there was a nice ""break away jack"", so one could switch between sound systems. Very cool,
simple, and durable.
The new SE215-CL's are designed so that the stem insert part that goes into my ear canal, is not offset enough from the speaker. The bulk of the speaker causes an insecure seal with the foam (thats on the stem), causing the device to fall out of my ear. If the stem were longer, that would create better distance between the speaker and stem insert, so the foam could then sit and expand in my ear canal. A minor issue for me is the look of the newShure SE215-CL Sound Isolating Earphones SE215-CL, they remind me of hearing aids.
I'm a lover of simplicity and function, and I'll be the first one to buy the ""old"" style again, if Shure ever decides to bring back the SE115's."

1667,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a huge fan of Klipsch Earphones ~ unbeknownst to me why on a whim, I purchased these for iPod use, but I am so very glad I did! The sound coming from them straight out of the box is incredible - really, just blows Klipsch out of the water (hey, it surprised me, too ;o) ). I could hear tones using these earphones that I never knew existed using the Klipsch. The sound is very well balanced and rich ~ clarity? outstanding!

I LOVE the slightly longer cable.

Watch out - the ear sleeves are really hard to change ... It was much easier to change detaching the cable and I used a toothpick to pry up under the sleeve ~ once I did that - it didn't take me two minutes to change them out (figuring that out of course took longer than that ;o) ) ...

It's taken me a little while to get used to the cord going over the ear style - but take them on and off a few times and it's no problem.

For the person who said the Noise Isolating was a ""con"" ~ to me, it's not - they are, after all, 'sound isolating' earphones right? It's a plus and it definitely works :o) (and there are warnings in teh packaging not to use in any place you *need* to hear surrounding noises)

I love they fit inside the ear, too ~ I can sleep with them in very comfortably."
1668,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor quality, they worked for only one run on the tread mill and the left ear stopped working.

1671,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great audio yet poor manufacturing quality.

1677,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these head phones based on the reviews here at Amazon. I normally use over the ear head phones because I've never been able to find an in the ear model that feels comfortable or delivers the rich sound of over the ear models...and still haven't. These ear phones are a big disappointment. Very uncomfortable and when I could get them positioned the sound was horrible as compared to over the ear models. I would love to find in the ear phones for when exercising because the over the ear models just look dorky...but will have to just give up.

Mids: the mids on these things are decent listing to acoustics the guitar notes came though clean.

Vocals: the vocals of the se215 are not there; not present as the klipsch, it's not warm and clean like the klipsch and listing to fem voices, the vocals are some time a little up tempo un-natural sounding at times

Bass: the bass on the klipsch are a little more controlled and it can really get down into those low octaves it feels like klipsch high end sub-woofer with the deep lows and tight notes not overpowering like the shure they can sometimes get a little muddy on bass boosted tracks.

Mids: the mids on are present when these are broken into or burned in the sound of these sound like there Refrence speakers every thing just sound so right and its not over powering

1680,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I read plenty of reviews on Black Friday and CyberMonday this year and the reviews on this product seemed mostly positive. Now that I own a set I can claim that these are the most comfortable, best fitting earbuds I have ever tried. I started my earbud experience with Etymotics Research legendary 4s and 4p earbud. Etymotics Research is not only the inventors of in-the-ear earbuds, they won awards and top picks 10 years after release. The 4s model was compared to a $10,000 pair of headphones by an audiophile magazine review, convincing me to purchase them for about $350. They lasted 10 years.

I was a little surprised that the upper end of frequency range is 17.5Khz, a little low for human hearing (20 KHz). Bass response is fantastic, as long as you have selected the foam earpiece that fits well. The nice thing about the foam is that it is very soft, so I feel more comfortable with these than the Etymotic model. I feel I can use these all day. I like to listen at concert levels. Not very healthy but I can tell that there's no significant levels of distortion at louder volumes. Mids are full and clear, highs (tested with Chopin's Etude #5 -- a piano solo) are also clear and have great presence.

I'm sure things can only get better as these are broken in and I have spent time with them.

I've also picked up a pair of jvc xtreme xploders (both the higher end $50 metal model and the $20 cheaper model), which I would give a good review to, but for the price of the Shure's, I would recommend saving your money up and spending more -- after all you will be using these for many many hours. The Shure model is better fitting so bass response is going to be better. Of course, a poor fit on any earbud will give you tinny results. The initial earpieces on my xtreme xploders and the Shure SE215 were both too small, and gave that result."
1681,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Had these for 3 years. Left ear just stopped working. Not clogged. I check the right ear on the left side and it works, so i know its not the wire. I checked the resistance of the speaker coils, left and right chanel....left speaker completly open. It just failed. One minute they were working, the next silence....always listen at a casual volume. 3 years it not to bad I guess, thats why i gace it 4 stars, and they do sound very nice.

Same time the left speaker died, the right speaker wire ( metal wire to allow to stay bent around the ear) broke, poked through the casing and stabbed my ear, lol.

So it seems they have a 3 year life give or take before it starts t break down.

100 bucks seems high to me for these, but after 3 years of constant use, its nnot such a bad price tag."
1682,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What you get: One pair of clear colored Shure SE215 in-ear ear buds that have a silver cable with a standard 3.5mm plug, a small carrying case; and interchangeable small, medium, and large ear 'sleeves' in two different styles.
What they're for: Listening to audio with the use of a separate media device.
About the reviewer: I purchased these on Amazon.com and have owned them for about 5 months. I'm a musician and an audiophile enthusiast who uses these ear buds with my phone and computer to listen to metalcore, EDM, pop, and rap.

These ear buds are well made and sound great! They are made with a clear plastic, which is cool because you can see the wires and driver housings on the inside. The clear ear pieces will match anything you're wearing. A layer of flexible Kevlar protects the first couple inches of cable coming from the ear pieces. The cable itself is made of woven silver and bronze material and wrapped again by plastic tubing.

The shape of the ear pieces' bodies contour perfectly to rest snug in your ear, and an assortment of exchangeable sleeves ensures a tailored fit. The orientation of these ear buds are designed to have the cable run up and over your ear, and then back down. Although previous reviews (Amazon.com, 2015) reported that these ear buds can be worn the traditional way, with the cable hanging straight down. There will be no problems using these ear buds while you're active, but keep in mind these ear buds are isolating and you will not be able to hear the outside world while using them.

Their sound is produced from a single speaker in each ear. These ear buds are the least expensive ear buds in a line modeled after Shure's original in-ear stage performance monitors, which were well received by live performing musicians who needed a way to hear themselves in noisy venues. Higher models in this line have more speakers for each ear.

All ear phones, headphones, and speakers are 'colored'; set to specs usually determined by an executive or the companies R&D department. It's color is a natural EQ that stems from the speakers hardware and physical components. These ear buds have exceptionally honest sound reproduction. If you like overstated bass or high end then you might perceive these ear buds to sound flat, because they do. These ear buds can produce sound at nearly the entire range of human hearing.

The only thing these ear buds are missing compared to others in the same price range is an inline microphone for making calls on your mobile device or computer. But the cool thing is that each ear piece is detachable from the cable. So you can replace the cable with an after market one that does have a mic-if you need it. This feature would also be useful if the cable or either ear piece were to break. Since the whole thing is modular you could just replace the broken component instead of the whole thing.

Overall, these ear buds are excellent value. At a $100 price point you are not likely to find a better combination of good looks, durability, and phenomenal sound. These ear buds would be good for any discerning music fan, but they would also work well for audiophiles on a budget."
1683,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't bother spending more for the higher Shure SE models. These sound balanced and accurate and sound isolating is definitely the way to go. I use these while I work (desk job) and on Sundays when performing.

The only caution I can provide is that it's generally not a good idea to wear these anywhere where hearing outside ambient noise is beneficial. (e.g. jogging, driving, etc.) -- as these are extremely good at blocking outside noise.

One really nice improvement (over my black SE215 copy) was that they finally added a plastic grid/mesh slightly inside the foam piece. This prevents earwax from getting into the actual ear piece. Now earwax is confined and far easier to clean/deal with.

Having trouble figuring out which one ear piece belongs in which ear; left or right? I had originally found it annoying that I couldn't see/read the ""L"" and ""R"" on each earpiece like I could on my black pair... but that was only until I discovered that each ear piece has a color coded ""dot"" indicating left and right channel. (red for right, blue for left). It also doubles as the point where you need to line up the ear piece should you wish to replace the cable."
1684,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older pair of Shure earphones, the E2C I think. They were great until the cables got slammed in the door, exposing the wiring, and had to be replaced. I bought some Klipsch ones based on excellent reviews, but I hated them in comparison to my old Shures. The Klipsch ones got stolen (good luck with those awful earphones sucker!) I couldn't find the E2Cs, but these seemed comparable--Shure earphones for around $100. These are great, maybe better than the E2Cs. They are ""noise-cancelling"" in the way that they fill up your ear canal with a tight seal--great for airplanes, etc. without the big-old active noise cancelling devices. Seriously, I've had people talking to me and I can't hear a word until I remove them. Great sound reproduction, especially deep bass. I love them. If I had to pick a downside, they are a bit bulkier than say the stock iPod pieces of trash, but these are fine for running, working out, etc. I wouldn't cycle with them just because you wouldn't be able to hear any upcoming cars or other road hazards. Another good thing about these--if you work out hard and sweat like I do, you build up earwax in the canal of the earphone. These come with a special wire-loop device specifically built for cleaning that out! Keep up the good work Shure."
1685,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Deep and powerful bass, outstanding forward mid range, only bad thing is the highs tend to get rolled off though they seem to get better as you keep listening to them. If the highs are not enough for you, its nothing a little bit of EQ can fix. Like many IEM's, try driving this with an amp or just pump more volume with the device you're listening with. That's where they really shine, especially the bass. Overall, amazing sound, I just feel that the clarity of the highs could have been better.

The over the ear design and may be uncomfortable for some, but soon you'll learn to appreciate the ergonomics the SE215 has to offer. They sit almost perfectly in your ear, and its design helps block outside noise, and it does so VERY well. Just make sure you got the right ear tips (These come with 3 sizes of foam, and 3 sizes of silicone rubber ear tips) to ensure maximum seal and comfort. If none of them work out, there are always alternatives like the Westone True Fit, Westone Star Tips (Which are my favourite as of now) or Comply foam tips."
1686,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't expect that a set of ear buds would be able to replace my over ear noise cancelling Audiotechnica headphones. Boy was I wrong! These things sound amazing and the sound isolation is very effective. They look nice everything about them feels high quality.

My biggest complaint is that I had a very difficult time figuring how to put them on. I never would have thought I would be searching Youtube for videos to find out how to put a set of ear buds in my ears but for the first few days that I had them this is what I was doing. It may take you a few tries to figure out how to get them in and sealed properly. Myself, I squish the black foam sleeves then press them into my ear, not just stick them in, actually use some force and press them in and then make a downward twist motion to settle the body into my ear. After a few seconds the foam has expanded and is blocking outside noise. Once you figure out how to insert them you will be very happy!"
1687,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound great, and their sound isolation is pretty intense. I have to take them out of my ears to hear people talking loudly to me, which is a great way to focus while working. Overall their sound is slightly ""warm"", with maybe a bit more pronounced midrange, but I have found it quite comfortable to listen to music and podcasts for long periods of time while I work.

At first the cable over the ear threw me off, but once I acclimated to the different fit (my previous experience was Apple earbuds) I can never go back."
1688,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the headphones while they lasted. I have had them for less than three months. I was about to use them, turned them on (according to the headphones, the battery had 6 hours left). They connected to my phone and suddenly nothing happens. Button does not seem to work, no audible messages or anything. I have tried charging the headphones, but even that doesnt work.

Very disappointed since I have had them less than a few months and only use them while going on long walks (which is not that often)."
1689,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these things.

I bought these mainly for traveling on airplanes and they work amazingly. The foam tips are great, easy to put in (Just like foam ear plugs) and they block a good bit of noise.

Sound quality is pretty good as well. i am sure the're better sound quality headphones available, but for the price these things are great.

Read other reviews about the poor cable quality. I've only had these for a month or so and don't use them everyday so I can't speak to the quality yet. I do plan on wrapping them to avoid issues just to be on the safe side."
1690,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my oldest son and will now be getting them for my youngest. Very comfortable and COMPLETELY noise cancelling. My son 90% of the time and hear a damn thing.....this can also be a bit frustrating, but they work and sound AMAZING!!"
1691,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These arrived about 30 minutes ago and they're already boxed back up and ready to go back to Amazon for a refund.

They're cumbersome and awkward to get them on. Forget the ability to just push them in your ear. They have to be oriented in a certain direction and then you have to make sure the cords go up over your ears.

Once I finally got them on, a side-by-side test of the same song showed that they had no better sound quality than my JAYS T00075 A-Jays Four (which I also bought here on Amazon for $22).

I've been a big fan of Shure mics for years. This was my first time trying out their headphone products. On one hand, I'm tempted to think that the sound quality might be better if I continue up the ladder and buy one of their more expensive options.....but then I think:

A. Why should I need to spend more money to sound as good as a pair of Jays $22 earbuds?
B. And would buying a higher priced model make them any less cumbersome to put on?

I'll stick with my Jays. These were a waste of time and money. (Return shipping is $12 which will be deducted from my refund.)"

Have to look at the ""r"" and ""l"" signs every time, and even then I'm futzing with them for a couple of minutes before they are in properly... and that stupid stiff wire is always twisting the wrong way so you have to keep pulling it back over your ear.

BIG TIP: realized this late. My foam tips kept breaking before since I just stuffed them in my ear but I learned you HAVE to squeeze them down all around and let them inflate in your ear. That way they do not break as easily. Maybe not obvious to everyone lol"

1708,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't do may reviews, I do it just for products I consider either really good or really bad. These monitors are part of the former group. The sound is amazing. Low, mid and high frequencies are masterfully balanced. I used to have the Shure E2C, and although they sound good, I wasn't thrilled about their bass. I'm not a bass head, but I like to be able to hear the presence of drums and bass in my music. Although the E2Cs did a good job, they were not excellent. The SE215 blow the E2Cs out of the water in every single part of the sound spectrum. I don't think you need a burn-in period with these (although I burned them in for about 14 hrs beforefirst use).

1725,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I think if you have never owned a pair of noise cancelling headphones these might be OK. However, they are no where near as good when it comes to quietness. In addition, you hear the cord movement and they are not that comfortable."

1734,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I give it to stars because it works. I really should take one away though, because it Cuts in and out. I already had a set of the earbuds, SE 215’s, And very much enjoyed those. However the quality of this product is very very poor! I am highly disappointed"
1735,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you very much ! have a good time !
1736,1.0 out of 5 stars,"While the noise cancellation worked well, the low range bass seemed non existent. Even doing bass boost on iPod was not enough. Also the in-ear fit was difficult. Overall very disappointed in the product. Bought Bose ear buds for same price and am very happy."

1738,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've previously owned the E2C which I liked but like many users had experienced, mine broke 3 times within 2 years because of exposed copper wires. Although Shure would replace them for free each time they broke but it was still quite annoying. There're a few things that I really like about the SE215 in comparison to the E2C:

-The packaging is extremely easy to open. I no longer have to slice open a rock with my scissors/cutter just to get the earphones out.

-Comes with a earwax removal tool which is helpful in keeping them clean.

-Stronger bass and better overall sound quality.

-The cord does seem a tad sturdier and is detachable, which allows easier replacement just in case it breaks again. But I hope it won't come down to that.

If I'm not mistaken, these earphones come with a 2-year warranty during which Shure will replace your earphones for free. More info at:

1742,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I am on my 2nd pair because the packaging smooshes the right medium foam ear plug which is my size. It doesn't pop back out and because it is already compressed down it isn't filling my right ear canal. The left one works perfect. The other two included sizes are worthless because they don't fit. I thought the first one was a fluke but just got my second set and it is the same thing. It is pretty annoying. I have a flight coming this week and will try. I see in the reviews they say give a week.... Bad packaging Shure. Someone in your design dept wasn't paying attention."

1758,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lose one star for price. These aren't just fancy earbuds. They provide superior sound. The cords are heavier duty than any I've found and it's snag free. If you need to listen to audio in a noisy environment, such as a motorcycle, airplane, or factory, I cannot stress how well these block out ambient noise. I would never have spent this much on these if they hadn't been recommended by a long distance motorcycle rider. He was correct. These are worth it. Excellent purchase."

1760,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fine product, clear sound, well made and sturdy -- what you'd expect for the price. Unfortunately, not a great fit for my elephantine ears. Also, make sure you're comfortable with cords looping over your ears first."
1761,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are easily the best earbuds I've ever owned, and that's listening to them before I burn them in.

Let's temper that statement - I have only owned apple stock buds, a few different $15~$20 sets of earbuds, monster turbines, and these. The only real competitor here is the turbines, and surprisingly, I'd guess because of Shure's use of a dynamic driver in this model, the Shures blow the monsters away in bass punch and clarity.

I have small canals, and I actually LIKE silicone inserts - the small silicone inserts fit beautifully.

Depending on the shape of your ear you might have a less comfortable fit, but these buds feel like they were crafted to fit perfectly in my outer ear.

The sound is great, full and rich and with a more powerful bass punch than I'd predicted. As an extra plug, SoundEarphones managed to deliver them to my door a full 2 days before the 1st expected arrival date. I'm going to start burning in these headphones tonight and plan to wear them enough to start bumping into people accidentally.

Edit: Thanks to a comment from another user I changed these from 4/5 to 5/5 since I really shouldn't reserve a higher rating for a more expensive pair of earphones. These Shures are most likely the best set for this price point.

1 more thing: Very glad I went with clear instead of black, they look really impressive."
1762,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful sound. Came from a set of Ultimate Ears and these have a stronger low end, but still a very rich sound throughout the range. Still working on the fit to get it where it'll sit naturally and comfortably, but that will come."
1763,2.0 out of 5 stars,The earphone is rough. It seems like be renovated. The sound is same to the iPhone's earphone.
1764,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good
1765,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the most well known iem's in the business. I orderd a pair of 1 more triple driver to begin with but then kept thinking how the shures would do. Shures are a single driver compared to the 3 drivers of the one more, 1 dynamic and 2 armature balancers. I tested them both and can say buy the one more tripple driver. They are the same price but the one more should cost more. The shure are not ergonomic, you can't lay down with them and they have no online Remote as well as having a reputation for falling apart. I won't tell you all the features of the 1 more, go look at them on amazon. All in all the 1more sounds sooooo much better than the shures. The shures offer better lows, but only by a pinch. Everything abounds better with 1 more"

The only problem is getting used to putting it around your ears. Once you get it, you wont complain. i dont anymore!

In short - Love em!"
1775,1.0 out of 5 stars,The sound on these earphone is atrocious. Is it possible that I bought a fake? Can't believe Shure would make such a terrible product. Returning it right away.
1776,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was hoping to score big with this birthday present for my husband. Unfortunately that did not happen. He really tried to act excited and grateful but they were uncomfortable in his ears. I did return them and had no problem with the return of refund. So there was a positive to the experience. May work well for others but not for my hubby
1777,1.0 out of 5 stars,"No sound from one of the earbuds after about a month. Shure's customer service is terrible and their returns policy was clearly designed before the internet was invented. Wouldn't buy from shure again.

Sounded nice for the month they worked though."
1778,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is really good but the cable for the right ear seems to have broken or something. They only sounded good anf at equal levels for about 10 minutes. I've never had a pair of headphones so frail, really bad manufacturing."
1779,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I know I could probably do better with a more expensive set of ear buds like the Shure SE315 or se425 but for the price these things kick ass! I work in a very loud wood mill factory , and these things drowned out all the noes. I hook them up to a Fiio Andes E07K on to my Galaxy Note 2 and it rocks!

They handle the bass extremely well seeing how I got it tweaked out with Poweramp Music player for Android.

cons: they do take a little time to mount onto your head. and get all my gear up and running but it's sooo worth it.

If you mount them properly like they tell you to there is no line nose. the complaints about line nose is BS"
1780,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had other ear buds from Shure that I loved and had great sound, so I trusted the company and bought these as a replacement.

But they're not good! I don't know what the other people reviewing them have been listening to, but there are songs that I know have a low bass, which can't be heard on these at all. They're also surprisingly uncomfortable because the buds themselves are really thick and the hard plastic is actually jamming itself against my ear (no change in the latex piece helps this problem).

But mostly, they have no low bass (I listen to a lot of electronic music-- they're the worst for psytrance!) and are pretty much only acceptable for listening to podcasts. I lent them to a friend who was surprised that Shure made them because they're so bad.

Not worth the money! When I listen to songs I know, I am disappointed with the sound quality."
1781,4.0 out of 5 stars,Coupled with a good equalizer app they are aussume
1782,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for the price, but not too great through a complete, mic ed system."
1783,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Similar to other reviewers I found the sound quality lacking versus the wired version. For wireless the Jaybirds have better sound...

Very disappointing."
1784,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had the earbuds for less than 20 minutes and the left bud started cutting out. I returned it immediately.
1785,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I need noise canceling earphones and already familiar with SHURE products, I opted to buy a pair of Live Sound monitors. I find them awkward to use because they have to be adjusted over the ear each time you use them. The wire is soft and once you take them out, the wire straightens itself out. The purpose of buying this kind of monitor was so that I could place them over my ears, so twisting each one into place each time I used them was annoying. The left one shorted out from turning.The RT. ear is marked in red, the left in blue. You must find this color each time you use them. They are fragile and would not stay in the shape I had placed them. Although the sound effect was good, the product is substandard in my opinion. SHURE is generally a good brand too buy, but not this product."
1786,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took a little getting used to at first, but after a week or so these are the most comfortable pair of headphones I have owned. They fit just right in your ear and don't randomly fall out."
1787,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Shure SE215-CL as a replacement for my Beats earbuds. The sound quality was quite impressive. Solid bass, good mids and highs. Unfortunately, the sound coming out of the left earbud became erratic the next day and any movement caused the sound to drop out. It was probably a defective unit, so I decided to return them. Shipping was excellent as I received them the day after I placed the order. Great Customer Service as vendor offered to replace them."
1788,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these. The sound is amazing and so clear but they are hard to keep in my ears. It is easier if you keep both buds in your ear though.
1789,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned the SE115's and absolutely love them. The ""only"" issue is that I've gone through about 3 pairs in the past 18 months due to damaging the cable, so Kevlar is a must from here on out.

The sound quality between the SE115's and the SE215's is indistinguishable to me, so no issues there. The fit is entirely different though, and I have yet to find a sleeve that creates a perfect seal to get the best base response and not hurt my ears. The other potential issue is that the part of the cable near the headphone has a hard, 3 inch protective plastic cover around it, which is great for protection but means the headphone gets knocked out of place easily when the cable is touched.

To sum up:

Pro's: Sound quality, Kevlar, fits flat against your ears (great for listening to music while in bed)
Con's: Less snug than the SE115's, protective plastic cover makes it easier to knock the headphones out of place."
1790,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Those giant bose in their carrying case take up SO much room in your carry-on, don't they? Well these are your new airplane solution. The foam part that goes in your ear is made of earplug material, so you squish it and it does its part to block noise without being this huge thing on top of your ear. They pack up compact and are my new favorite traveler's secret. When I am playing music or podcasts on my phone with the normal white iphone style headphones (not even on an airplane!) I have to turn my volume all the way up. When I am listening to music on a noisy airplane with these headphones I have my volume one click above silent - that's how noise isolating these are. I love them. I know they're a little pricey but compared to the fancy bose they're a bargain."
1791,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have a great, balanced sound with a surprising amount of detail and clarity considering they only have the one micro driver.

Replaceable cable is sure to add to the lifetime of these. Also the cable itself is of the highest quality I've ever seen. Noticeable micro vibrations are a thing of the past with these. And there going to take a real beating to cause damage to them.

The case is alright but it's not really going to protect the buds if you sit/step on it or anything. It's purpose is mostly to make it more convenient to transport them, witch it performs admirably. You can order a harder case that comes with the more expensive versions if your worried about it (there fairly cheap to) but it's not really an issue for the way I'll be using them.

And now for my one issue with these. Removing the tips. This isn't something you'll do often once you found your size thankfully but when I first got them I obviously wanted to try them all to get the best seal/fit. These suckers are hard to get off, the foam ones in particular because you have to use so much pressure it feels like your going to tear the foam. Fortunately the foam was more resilient then I anticipated and they regained there shape without any noticeable damage. My other concern was that the tip they slide on to is plastic. You can tell its a thicker good quality plastic but with the way it sticks out combined with the pressure needed to swap tips I was sure that it was going to crack.

Maybe I'm just a little to paranoid and I understand they don't want the tips sliding at all but the tightness applied here seems a bit excessive to me.

In closing I'd say Sure just made themselves a new fan and in the future I'll be looking to get some 535's. If they can get this great a sound with one simple micro driver I can only imagine what 3 hi-def drivers with a passive crossover sounds like."
1792,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high because I've been a shure fan for years, but these were so disappointing that I returned them. First, they feel very cheap. I have a pair of Beats X and Bose Soundsport. Shure needs to use a higher quality wire. It is extremely thin. I think that what did me in was the bluetooth connection. I can listen with my BeatsX until the battery dies without missing a beat. The Shure headphones would cut out every few minutes. I just became very annoying and distracting."
1793,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these earphones because I had this collegue at work who would constently talk very loudly, which prevented me from beeing able to concentrate on the tasks I had to perform at work. These earphones are a mix between earplugs and actual earphones. With these I can concentrate on my work without being bothered byambiant noise. The downside is that I don't hear my phone ringing. The sound quality is good but not as good as my koss porta pro earphones Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case. When there is no ambiant noise, I prefere to use the latter."
1794,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds great! The ""noise isolation"" works very well by block out sounds from entering your ear. Not like the ""noise cancellation"" type of earphones at send a signal into your ear to counter outside noise. I use the silicone ear pieces. The set also comes with expanding foam ear pieces that work even better for noise isolation. The foam pieces are like those a construction worker or gardener (with a leaf blower) would use. You squeeze it and stuff it in your ear and it expands to fit the contours of the inside of your ear, forming a nice seal for ""isolation."" They stay in the ear really well. But for me, even the smallest size started to bother me after awhile by putting excess pressure to the inside of my ear, so I'm sticking with the silicone ones. I'm happy the set came with so many options. The stethoscope effect is very minimal. The loop around the ear takes some getting used to and is a little awkward at first, but once you have it molded around your ear, it works well."
1795,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome IEMs. Sometimes the best things come in small packages, and this was no exception. Sound quality is pretty good without an amp, and when driven a bit sound amazing. Don't be fooled into thinking you need a ton of drivers to monitor a single instrument. I play the bass, and these are great for practicing. If you're planning on doing stage monitoring or some other inputs at once maybe look into IEMs with more drivers.
I do notice some pinging reverberations when audio is cut off abruptly, but it might be my old amp.
The removable cable is also great, you can find replacement or upgrade cables elsewhere on amazon. Also the multitude of replaceable eartips are a good inclusion, I'm currently using the small foam ones so I can insert most of the assembly into my ear, but the silicone tips are acceptable as well."
1796,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Based on sound quality and noise reduction these get a solid 5 Stars, but I'm docking them two stars because I'm on my third pair in less than five years. At $100 a pop, I wish they have more than a 1 1/2 year average lifespan. I really do love them, they sound amazing and do a fantastic job of quieting the world during a busy public commute, but I'm deeply annoyed that they implode so quickly, and I do take impeccable care of them, handle them gently, listen at moderate volume on average of 8-10 hours a week, designated case, clean regularly. It's also worth noting that my first two pairs died the same way, an audible pop and loss of the left channel, not a slow degrade of quality, but a sudden short.

If this latest pair follows the same pattern, I'll be looking for a new brand unfortunately."
1797,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great earbuds. The same quality you'd expect from Shure and the regular SE215s, now with BT. Like other 215s, you can change out the wire if it wears out instead of replacing the whole device. I'd recommend going and reading one of the countless other reviews of the regular 215s if you are curious about sound and build quality of the earbuds themselves. I'll cover the BT differences, though.

There are three controls on the device - volume up, down, and the power/answer and end phone call button. The inline microphone is really clear over the two calls I've had today. I asked the person on the other line if they could hear a difference, and they said I sounded great. There's also a LED indicator light, which could honestly be a little larger and in a more convenient spot. I also noticed it was hard to tell what side of the wire was the left and right - I wish there were larger or more visible indicators there. There's also a ladies voice that warns you of your current battery levels when they are getting low and when you turn the device off and on.

Overall, this is a great quality pair of earbuds! Especially at this price point. I've tried the Airpods, and at the same price point, these blow them out of the water."
1798,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For an earbud, the sound is fantastic. I'd actually rate these as sounding slightly BETTER than ATH-M50s. The sound isolation too is really, really good. Basically, if you like music but don't want to drop bank, these are what to get.

That said, they're quite uncomfortable. After 2 hours of listening, the inside of your pinna WILL hurt from the plastic body rubbing it. Also, putting them in takes practice, and is certainly not fast. Compared to my old ""jam them in your ear canal and go"" Sennheiser CX500s, these require a good 30 seconds or more to put in, between positioning the bud, wrapping the hard piece of wire around your ear, etc. And once they're in, they're in. Even if you swap the soft tip for the silicone (which took me 10 minutes and a youtube guide the first time), these are VERY isolating. Expect to not hear anything short of a concert around you.

So there you go. Very quirky and a pain, but they sound outstanding, especially for the price."
1799,5.0 out of 5 stars,"( I listen to different styles, but most of the time - black metal, death, doom, goth and industrial. )

SE215-K are Amazing little earphones!!! After burn-in the sound quality is getting close to my $400 Denon D2000s. A little less bass (but still enough), but SE215-K have more natural (realistic) sound. SE215-K don't need to be amp'ed, I didn't hear any difference. They need to be deep in ears to get sufficient sound isolation (up to -26 db) and great bass. Carrying case is nice and useful! They look very good (in ears and in hands :) ) Big plus that they give me less sound pressure on my ears than D2000s do.

I would recommend these earphones to everyone, unless you have a budget to get 535s, UE reference monitors or sennheiser IE800 :)

I've had Shure headphone in the past and the cords need to be replaced very often. I'm sure these are not that different. Plus the replacement cords are very expensive for this version. For a $100+ cost, you should not have to replace the cords. A better buy is the Panasonic RPHJE120P In-Ear Headphone. It fits well, has good sound quality and only costs $5."
1801,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clear, powerful sound and near total isolation from the world around you. These are by far the best in-ears I've ever purchased."
1802,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure se215 uses a dynamic driver, so does Sennheiser in their ie 800 IEMs. These IEMS are the best by far in this price range, extra awesome earphones. Shure uses dynamic microdrivers with the Shure se215 and the se112 IEMs, which I could not tell the difference in sound, when I compared these to the 1000 dollar Shure se846, I VERY, VERY, MUCH WANTED THE se846 Shure to be far better than my se215s and se112s, I switched back and fourth between these IEMs at least 30 times and could not detect a difference in sound quality, only that I had to turn them up a notch or two. I am very sorry to say that the se846 Shures which uses moving armatures, found in hearing aides are going back. The Shure se846 are a fantasticly great IEMs but so are the se112 and se215, Shure just uses two completely different ways of achieving the same awesome results. Shure was really onto something with their great sounding dynamic microdrivers, they should go back and see what else they can do with the exceptional Shure dynamic microdriver, Sennheiser came up with the ultimate ie 800 IEM using a micro dynamic driver. I think that the Shure se112 and the se215 sound so incredibly fantastic, because they are the gateway to all other Shure earphones, why climb the ladder and continue the journey if these IEMs are average or mediocre? Plus Shure foam tips are not included with the se112 IEMs which make the IEM sound 40% better."

I would only recommend these headphones if you're a single use person. If you're plugging them into one device and one device only and not transporting them around. The sound quality is quite good but other than that everything else about these are very poor. They do have a lot more bass however than the comparable BOSE earbuds.

The style of these are extremely outdated. You can feel it from the cord, see it by the length and the plug is designed to go right into the input. If you have a case on your iPhone or other unit, you won't be able to use the SHURE headphones with it. So again if you're single use like the laptop, then it's probably okay. The earbuds are extremely difficult to take off and change out, while also being awkward to put on.

I had to give these a one-star because after I took my case off of my phone to use them at the gym, sound wouldn't come out of both earbuds only one. If the plug was turned just the right direction it would come out of both, but this is difficult to do. Returning them after one day of use."
1808,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, however, they pop out of your ears quite easily!"
1809,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best pair of $100 IEMs out there. A relatively neutral soundscape with punchy bass (not overwhelming though). Highly recommended for the price range.
1810,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked these when I first got them, like my favorites. I replace my beats with them. Stayed in my ear, sound great, clear highs, full bass (for earbuds). Unfortunately after a 2 months, where the wires connect with the earbud there is a swivel, this seems great at first because they don't tangle. Its the downfall, tons and tons of static noise in your earbuds after little use."
1811,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used Shure earphone for many years and have been pleased with the quality and durability. The SE series, however, uses a connector at the base of the earpiece which creates a poor sound quality when engaging in exercise such as running. Apparently the connector pin used to attach the cord to the earbud rotates within the fitting when the user is engaged in movement. A cutting in and our of the sound results. The review and recommended self-repair at the following link is informative: [...]. Bottom line: Don't use these earphones if you intend to exercise while wearing them."
1812,1.0 out of 5 stars,The audio is fine but the bluetooth implementation is pure garbage. Everyone else seems to have bluetooth figured out. Shure should stick to what they do best and this ain't it!
1813,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
1814,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is amazing but they hurt my ears after a couple hours of usage they also look amazing on ear.
1815,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones will not stay in your ears! Not sure how they could design a headphone that has this fault, but take my warning and don't get them. Too bad, because they sound really good."
1816,3.0 out of 5 stars,"not for the average consumer. im sure it sounds great to audiophiles but it was average to me, not to mention that the fit is unusual"
1817,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Hard to put in your ear, hard to stay there. Not a good design.

Sound quality not as good as previous Shure models."
1818,1.0 out of 5 stars,I returned the product because one of the earbuds was not working properly.
1819,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had them for a little over a month now and love them! Clear, crisp, and great low end."
1820,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very disappointed with the SE215s, they aren't as good as cheaper headphones like the MEE M6 Pro."
1821,1.0 out of 5 stars,"April 4, 2015. Well, I guess I should have listened to folks who cautioned about poor quality. Purchased the Shure SE215 from Amazon on Dec 6, 2014. Now less than 4 months later, the left earbud does not work. I use these VERY LIGHTLY. Only during plane travel, probably twice a month. I listen to classical music a lot and have many full ear phones and ear buds. Last few years I have been very happy with Sennheiser and Klipsch, but wanted to try Shure. Guess I'm sorry now. The SE215 are still under warranty (2 years) , but I have to pay to return ship. Poor quality and now I have to $$ and take the time to send, what a hassle. I'll update this review when I hear back from Shure. But for the moment, four months of very limited use, and they don't work, so one star (one star only because zero star is not an option, they're broke.)"
1822,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This rating would be drastically different (5-stars) except for one extremely annoying “feature” of the Bluetooth functionality:

When the battery gets “low” which is under 10%, every 2 minutes the headphones stop your music playback and announce “battery low”. Every. Two. Minutes. I know the battery is low, let me enjoy the last bit of battery I have left to listen to my music, not to the robotic voice constantly reminding me that the battery is low.

Also to pile on, headphones only report 100%, 70%, 40% and 10% via Bluetooth battery reporting to iPhone. That’s way too big a gap for reporting battery life. 10% steps would be acceptable, 30% steps are near useless.

*While writing this review, the headphones told me “BATTERY LOW” 3 times."
1823,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I got them they didn't work! I had to play a set the next day and didn't have headphones.
Very dissatisfied."
1824,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite trying every ear insert, the ear buds would not seal to form the sound isolating experience I was wanting."
1825,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these to replace an older model after my dog destroyed them.
1826,1.0 out of 5 stars,The design on these however is absolutely terrible and they are not sustainable. The jack was a pretty loose fit on my standard iphone 5s and over time got looser and looser to the point where even a slight motion would dislodge them. These are completely useless if you intend to run or eve walk with them since they fall out of the jack so easily. Additionally putting these headphones in is a pain and cant be done in a cold weather. In warm weather sweat can easily cause these to slide out of your ears. Basically these headphones are now only good for staying completely still listening to music. I guess if you want to do that the sound quality is alright the highs and mids are clear but the bass is a little lacking.
1827,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For extremely expensive headphones, you could get better ones for cheaper. The sound isn't as crisp as others. Not as clear. I gave them away for free. I personally like my Sennheisers better."
1828,2.0 out of 5 stars,Way too expensive. Fit is awful. Sound is not that great.
1829,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to return, not worth a hundred bucks!"
1830,5.0 out of 5 stars,the best earphones that i ever had :D i love it
1831,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
1832,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the earbuds,but the cables are terrible.tryed emailing the shipper but they never responded to my email. i guess i have no choice but to buy another cable at $25 which is terrible considering they may not last any longer than the first ones.i wish they would because they really help kill the noise and they also sound good and are comfortable. For $100 they should last longer than a month!!!!"
1833,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was not impressed with either the comfort (even after purchasing additional earbud tips) or the sound quality. I usually listen to music from my Nexus 6p phone. The SE215-K didn't have a lot of volume ($30 pair of wired earbuds from a truck stop were louder) when connected to my phone, but were decent when connected to my desktop. I found the ear wrap piece to be confusing and irritating when orienting the ear buds to go into your ear canal. I expected more from a $100 pair of earbuds with reviews as high as these are on Amazon."
1834,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic. I have yet to use them as in-ear monitors, but I'm looking forward to doing so."
1835,5.0 out of 5 stars,Used it immediately and fell in love with it. The sound was awesome and the snug fit was great! Great product!
1836,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Are they good? Well yes. They worth the money. But! You're gonna need to spend another $50 to get Shure Phone Cable if you want to listen music on your phone. Why? Because the plug on default cable is so annoyingly bad it will lose connection with the phone on every slightest move. Even if you don't need a mic, you still gonna need to buy the cable. And you cannot get earphones with already installed phone cable.

I miss a pin on the cable. It's slightly heavier than other earphone cables and absolutely needs something that you can pin it to the shirt.

Also Shure support left me unhappy. One of the sleeves came damaged. There is a few spares each of different size, but you get only two medium ones. So I asked them to send me one. They told me to call them and order. Here on Amazon, those spares listed for $20. I explained them that the sleeve came damaged, and just because of one sleeve I don't want to send the whole thing back. They refused to send me a replacement and it seems after all I'm gonna need to spend another 20 and buy them myself.

So in the end these earphones will cost me in total ~ $170+tax. Is there any better options for that price? Sure, there are plenty. Good headphones, but they trick you to spend more.

BTW. It took me almost a month to find a way to properly get them in my ears. Remember, place the earpiece the way that logo would be laying horizontally and would be readable (it should not be upside down), and then turn the cable downwards, so the whole thing will look like G letter and not the way how it looks on the picture. At the point where cable connects to the earpiece, it easily rotates. And don't waste your time bending the cable behind your ears as it says in the manual."
1837,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not a fan of over-ear fit but they sound superb.
1838,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great! Love them!
1839,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bass is heavy, fitting is not really good for my ear. Not recommend.."
1840,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have read about these being poor fitting but never imagined it could be this bad.
Acoustically excellent but frustrating in keeping them on"
1841,1.0 out of 5 stars,The plug is too short to work on any cell phone with a case. I will be returning this product.
1842,2.0 out of 5 stars,I use them for biking and they produce a lot of wind noise. Sound is good when I'm stopped.
1843,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is good. They really fell good in the ear and they stay put after you figure out how to orientate them in your ear.
1844,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When my Bose IE2 broke, I was in doubt of what earphones to buy for my daily walkings. I needed great sound, comfort, durability. So I've bought these: Klipsch S4, a Sony MDRXB60EX and a Shure SE215.

The Shure SE215 has a great, balanced sound. It's among the best that I have had (under $150 budget).
Built quality is great, with detachable cable. It feels nice in the ear, but I didn't like the cord. It is thick and heavy.
It's as thick as a USB cable for example. The cords weigh twice Sony's and three times the Bose and Klipsch ones. (Yes, I actually put them on a scale).

The sound isolation is better than the others. But it also suffers the common problem with all noise isolation phones.
You hear your own body walking, especially when the cord touches you.
Overall I think Sony XB60EX gives you the same level for lower money.

My overall notes for sound quality (SQ) / Comfort (C) / Noise Isolation (NI) / ""body"" noise (BN)
Bose IE2: SQ: 9.2 / C:10 / NI: no / BN: 10 (best)
Shure SE215: 9.1 / C:7 / NI: 8 / BN: 6
Sony XB60EX: 8.9 / C:7 / NI: 7.5 / BN: 4
Klipsh S4: 7.5 / C:8 / NI: 7 / BN: 7"
1845,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Have owned 2 pairs of ec3's in the past and they were phenomenal. First day of use with these 215's and when you twist the headphone jack or move the cord in anyway sound cuts out of left ear. Apparently it's a common problem, so I will return and go with a brand that has better quality control."
1846,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Blocks out the wind noise, great sounding and super comfortable fit."
1847,5.0 out of 5 stars,good as i expect
1848,3.0 out of 5 stars,I only got 1 pair of sleeves there was supposed to be more in the box but there was none. I am very mad that this has happened
1849,5.0 out of 5 stars,It does its justice. However it isnt comfortable when u put the cable around ur neck!
1850,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing hearing
1851,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this headset in January 2013 and the sound is already starting to cut out (as if the wires are pinched). I only use them while sitting at my desk for work (very light use).
1852,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am sorry to say that I am relatively disappointed in these IEM's. I listen almost entirely to heavy/death metal and bought these because I read numerous reviews that they are amazing for this genre, because if you listen to this genre as well you know it is hard to find good headphones for it. Well, these IEM's kind of suck for this genre. In general (for all genres) the bass is weak, if you set an iPod's EQ to hip hop to boost the bass the head phones can't handle it and give that crunchy plastic distorted sound when the bass hits. I compared the same exact songs with the same EQ to the free Apple headphones and those did not distort the bass and sounded much better than the SE-215's. If the EQ was off there was almost no bass presence in any song. The mid's and hi's are pretty good, the hi's don't overkill like most headphones. The build quality is ok, it is very difficult to disconnect the cable from the monitors, which is good, but I'm starting to have the infamous left monitor intermittent connection issue after just a month of owning them. The audio connector is way too huge, you can't use it with about 95% of iPhone cases. The sound isolation really is amazing, I don't use the foam tips included because they are impossible to take off and you pretty much have to destroy them to take them off, but the silicon ones are just as good at sound isolation. The chord is about 3 ft too long, and the memory wire near the monitors is just way too stiff and makes it difficult, even when formed to your ears, to keep the buds from pivoting about the bud and sticking out of your ear. The cable construction is very good, I feel confident they won't break because of frayed wires. But I have also tested these with hip hop, pop, dubstep, techno and rock. And really they don't sound that good, they are pretty much on the same level, if not lower than the free Apple headphones just with a more
Comfortable fit and significantly more inconvenience. I will say that if you listen mainly to acoustic music, with no bass, then these are the headphones for you. I really wish I could return these now. I'll probably sell them and buy the Klipsch S4's or whatever that everyone recommends."
1853,5.0 out of 5 stars,Replaced the first pair I owned. Performs as expected.
1854,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good purchase. They are very hard to place in the ears. I have bought Shure before and will not in the future.
1855,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrific. I usually like Shure products, but for the price, I am not sure what's going on.

First thing is these things are a bit of a hassle to figure out. The short instructions don't explain much. Finally went online and saw a video and figured out that you have to wrap the wire around your ear yourself. Does it cost that much to put an L on the left bud and an R on the right?

Second, once you get past that, the ear buds come with the middle size foam already attached. Now if you don't want the foam or have smaller or bigger ears, then you've got to yank really hard to get the foam off the ear buds, and I mean hard. And as you are doing this, it really feels like the small stem upon which the foam sits is going to break.

And last but not least, once I got the correct foam size on and figured out how to put them on, the sound quality was horrific. And I don't mean just bad. I mean awful, bad radio with a dying battery bad.

For nearly $100, I expected some really top notch ear buds. But what you get is really a mess. Hard to put on, foam pieces hard to take off and put on, and miserable sound quality. Like I said, these are not just bad, but horrific.

I got a pair of wrap around ear buds with a microphone included when I purchased a Rosetta Stone course and that little system is like 10x better than this.

Like I said, I'm not sure what's going on with these, but I absolutely don't recommend them."
1856,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds great for a very basic pair, ver much value for money."
1857,1.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived defective.
1858,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been purchasing shure earbuds for 4+ years. A common problem among the last three I possessed is that around the 1-2 yr mark the wiring right where the chord connects to the earbud would start to fray. I'm a stubborn individual and have been convinced that despite this enraging flaw, the sound quality and design of the earbuds left most others in the dust.

Fast forward to this month. I just bought this model, and was excited by the prospect of the chord plugging into the earbuds, avoiding chord wear and tear. Then the left side goes dead during the 1st test run.

I'm going for a replacement opposed to refund in the hope that this was a lemon. But if anyone has recommendations for reasonably priced earbuds with good sound, nice fit, and DURABILITY, please comment on this rating. I'm open to suggestions if the replacement earbuds crap out on me."
1859,1.0 out of 5 stars,Must have been defective because they have no bottom end.

1868,5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality is good.
1869,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I could not believe these earbuds. From what I heard, they were absolutely fantastic! I don't know if it's just me, but the ear foam heads destroy the sound quality, don't stay in, and are near impossible to take off. The rubber heads have slightly better sound, but will not stay in for a second because of the insane weight of these headphones. The part that should wrap around your ear does not bend enough and is too stiff to use. My cousin also bought these and is having many of the issues I'm having. What gives?"
1870,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is OK, but difficult to keep in. Would not buy again."
1871,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound. Plenty of options for fitment are included.
1872,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are deaf, these are the headphones for you. Look cool, terrible sound. Please be aware that these headphones functioned properly however I am completely dissatisfied with the quality of sound produced by them. They fit well, the foam ear buds are great, but between all genres of music I listen to they sound like trash. House, punk rock, classical, opera, rap, I have tried everything I generally listen to and was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of all of them. The worst was when a Mos Def track came on that I usually enjoy. I was so put off by the attempt of the speaker to get low enough bass I had to unplug the headphones and listen to the song on my phones speaker. Walgreen's has a set of $14.00 headphones that out-perform the E215s. I am not pissed about trying these headphones, I am more pissed about the 5 bucks I am spending to return them. They were not worth $5 for a 1 day trial. In fact, if there were a store I could buy them for $5 right now? I would probably still go for the $14.00 Walgreen's specials. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."
1873,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm using the smallest plug and it still seems too big. This hanging over your ears is a joke. Can't be done. Wires are too long, so it's hard to get a good seal to block out other sounds."
1874,5.0 out of 5 stars,love this cellphone.
1875,2.0 out of 5 stars,Are not what i thought they'd be. Not worth it
1876,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
1877,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE them!
1878,3.0 out of 5 stars,I mainly use earphones at work and in bed before I go to sleep. It's the latter scenario where the problem is. Getting these things in your ear in the dark is a chore. I'm coming from Apple EarPods so anything sounds good to me. I plan on going with either AirPods or Beats X once they drop. That should hopefully solve my nighttime issue.
1879,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing bruh
1880,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these earbuds believing that they were genuine Shure Products but recently discovered that they are knock offs or counterfeit products. I sent these into Shure Repair facility to have them fixed and they sent them back because of counterfeit problems. This issue pertains to fraudulent business from the seller. I spent over $100 on this item and am now noticing degradation and deterioration in the left side earphone. It disconnects and stops working. the cables have also started turning blue and are falling apart. I would not recommend buying this product unless it was from the Shure Manufacturer themselves.
1881,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a lot of positive reviews on this product and saw that even if the cord broke it could be replaced and thought this would actually be a good headphone. Sadly it is not. The sound is very tinny and cheap. Yes they aren't the most expensive headphones, but these sound cheaper than pairs that are $20. I ended up getting a plantronic wireless pair for less money and they sound much much better. Don't bother with these, keep shopping."
1882,2.0 out of 5 stars,very uncomfortable
1883,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent $100 dollars on a nice pair of headphones for the first time in a long time. Not 15 minutes into listening to music does the left earbud completely stop working.

Although I am sure the return policy will be straight forward, I will now have to deal with returning these and not having headphones for a couple of days.

Way to go Shure, you lost another customer!"
1884,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for hard rock bands.
1885,1.0 out of 5 stars,The design of the replaceable cords causes the sound to cut in and out when you turn your head. Why do $100 earbuds have this problem? I ended up returning them because it was so annoying.
1886,4.0 out of 5 stars,good sound isolating
1887,3.0 out of 5 stars,meh
1888,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because I was looking for something different. The design of these headphones gave me a bad headache all the time. The headphones are designed to go into your ear canal for better sound. I started to get used to them would still get mild headaches after listening to them for a long time, like during workouts. Great sounding headphones but if you got sensitive ears, which I guess I do, get something else. These headphones also do not stay in your ear during long workouts where you sweat a lot. Good luck finding some that don't, but for 100 dollars I at least don't want headaches. Five stars for sound, Two stars for comfort only........"

1890,1.0 out of 5 stars,"From a 5 star review to one star in just 10 hours of use.

Well, after using these for about 10 hours I was having the sound cut out while I walked or turn my head in a certain way. I did some research on the issue and, according to a post at head_fi.org this is a common problem with these headphones, or those that use these same detachable cables. I'm returning these. So disappointed and will not be buying another pair of Shure earphones."
1891,1.0 out of 5 stars,this product is defective the left side!!
1892,5.0 out of 5 stars,I regret so much for buying these headphones... Now I have to re-download all my music in FLAC because these headphones give so much detail that they make my 320 bit songs sound like crap...
1893,1.0 out of 5 stars,"What a waste of money. For $100 the sound is lame. The design is awful as they don't fit in a normal ear and should have came with a shoe horn to cram them in your ear. Once in your ear the sound is muffled by the cheap cushions put on the end. In the continuation of poor design. The plug into my iPhone is too wide to get past the bumper. I had another set of Shure headphone that needed to be replaced because of faulty wiring. Poorly designed and contructed products. NEVER AGAIN!

Buy the JBuds J3M Micro Atomic In-Ear Earbuds Style Headphones with Mic (Jet Black) . At $25 these exceeded all my expectations and have a microphone to boot."

1896,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had these for 9 months. Used for a couple hours a week, maximum. Never traveled with them, rolled the cords, etc. Always had them hanging in place for weekly use at church. One side shorted out within six months, the second side shorted out yesterday. When I pay $100 for a set of headphones, use them infrequently, and take extra care with them, I expect them to last longer than 6-9 months. Very disappointed in the durability of this product."
1897,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these headphones for about 3 months now and I am not impressed. While they do stay in my ears when I run, I've recently noticed that they are starting to loose sound. Both ear buds constantly going on and off while I run. I have checked my audio jack with other head phones and they works fine. If you have a $100 to spend on head phones, buy something else, just not these. They are not worth the expensive price."
1898,5.0 out of 5 stars,"not easy to use it , needs to get the hang of it. but its really good at isolating outside noise . eg: metro ride , bus ride.) but that can be dangerous when you drive as u dont hear no s*** at all."
1899,1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BUY THESE IN EAR MONITORS

I am a young drummer and very short on money. I saved up along time for these because I play in a band. The day I got these they worked amazing. 2 weeks after one fell on the ground and broke. It cost me 50$ for a new left side. Recently the right side stopped working. It would cost me 50$ more to replace them. I had might as well buy a new pair. I will never be purchasing anything from this brand any more for as long as I live. Nothing but trouble."
1900,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a pair of Shure SE 425s that broke. While waiting to get them fixed, I need a backup set of IEMs. I saw these 215s and since I love my 425s, I figured these couldn't be too bad and at 99 dollars, seemed worth my time.

Definitely a good purchase. Like the 425s, the cord for these is detachable, which is great because usually I destroy cables pretty quick by snagging them on something or just bending the wires inside too much from use.

The sound is great. Now, I am not a full-bore audiophile. I don't listen to only lossless tracks directly made from the master recordings of artists. But I do listen to a LOT of music and like my music enough to know that ipod earbuds are awful and cause you to lose so much texture of music. The 215s help ensure that does not happen. While they are not as natural-sounding as the 425s, the quality is still great. Sometimes the bass may be a bit heavier than it should be but it definitely not anywhere close to too heavy and, at the price point, quite good.

If you want a decent IEM without breaking the bank and don't care about absolute ""perfect"" sound translation, these are a very good choice.

Tip: The foam tips that come with these make my ears hurt. And the silicone tips never seal right. I know this is not an issue for everyone, but if it is for you, I recommend getting some custom tips made. There are numerous sites you can find online that will make these using either a home impression kit or one make by an audiologist. I have a set for my 425s and they are super comfortable and create a great seal for excellent sound."
1901,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned two previous models of Shure earphones, all of which were similar in desigh to these. However, I always manage to leave them on a plane or at a hotel thanks to heavy busines travel and my general forgetfullness. The sound is always excellent and I prefer this type to other (electronically) noise cancelling designs. After a year of use, these are my least favorite. No real complaints on the sound (and after all that's what's most important) but I found the wire used on the SE215s too inflexible. Despite the articulating design, it is difficult to determine which is the left or right and the cable is not flexible enough to comforatably wear with wire-behind-the-ear which is my preference. The plastic around the connector is too large for most iPhones if you are using a protective phone case. Shure no longer includes ear buds made with the foam material I liked (though it may be available for order). As with all of the Shure earbuds I've owned, correct positioning in the ear is critical so I would have liked more choices included. However, these picky complaints aside, I still think these guys make the best sounding earbuds out there - well worth the additional cost (if you can avoid losing them)."
1902,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Could not make them stay seated in my ears. I tried all of the default ear pieces in every possible position and even tried the 3-vane shooting-style ear-canal plugs for them and even those would not work properly (came out after a few minutes and were painful on the ear canals). Maybe I just have incompatible ear structure for these to work. They sounded OK, not great. I was disappointed in the bass response."
1903,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't have enough great things to say about these little things. All in all, I have tried ME Electronics dual driver earbuds, and the SE 215's beat them. I tried the Sennheiser HD 598, and SE 215s beat those too! And by clear margins, I had my roommates try and test the headphones with me too, just to get a more sound opinion, and not sound like I was crazy. For a little under a hundred dollars, you can transform your sound experience with these little IEMs. They pack a serious PUNCH. If you haven't tried them yet, you are really missing out.

The sound isolation and the way it cups into your ear is very awesome too. They have a set of tips, you should test each of them to see which one keeps most snug in your ear. Once that is done, it really makes a huge difference. The outside world is completely shut out, and it's just you being transported into a different world. You'll hear sounds you never heard before.

Seriously, amazing."
1904,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had a wired set of 215s for well over 1yr. They are amazing compared to other headphones that I've owned. Minus the cables continually having issues, mainly due to the harsh conditions that I put them in on a daily basis. The wireless bt-1 has yet to give me any reason to complain! The battery lasts over 1 full day, zero clarity or connectivity issues, and the price us great!

I mainly use these in conjunction with a Samsung Galaxy and an HP Laptop."
1905,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are extremely high quality, seal out sound well, and sound that would be suitable to use both in a studio or casual listening. However, after 2 or 3 hours, they do begin to wear on the ears a bit unlike some other higher end headphones. It's not horrible, but it is noticeable."
1906,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not an audiophile but I enjoy listening to music, particularly jazz and classical. These earphones are outstanding, particularly at this price point. I can literally hear and focus on different instruments being played in any given selection. This is head filling sound at its best. It did take me a few days to learn how to wear the earphones properly, but the memory wire makes it easy....it was my learning curve and no fault with the product. The product comes with various sizes of ear tips and they are comfortable and isolate sound very well. The included carrying case is high quality and a nice added feature."
1907,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were recommended by a friend as I was looking for earbuds that would reduce noise while I was outside.

This product acts like an earplug with soft, form fitting cushions on the inner ear piece. There were several different sizes included with the package. I had to change from the medium size down to the small size, and removal the ear cushion was a bit difficult as it was very snug on the earbud.

Once I had the earbud seated properly in my ear, then the sound just blossomed! It may take a few tries to find the most comfortable fit for you, but it really does help reduce outside noise and gives you great sound for your podcasts and music.

NOTE: Some persons have recommended the EATFL1-6 Triple Flange Sleeves for SE model earphones product, since many persons have difficulty using the original inner ear cushion on the earbuds."
1908,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got them I the mail today. They arrived SO FAST and loved them from the start. Very well build and very sturdy. I have gone through so many pairs of crappie headphones in my life. Most break after two or three weeks. So I did a lot of research and found these. The price was a bit scary because I was so use to getting new ones that I thought ""wow it's gonna suck if these break"". I took the plunge and bought them after I read tons of reviews all over the net. Well it was worth it! These headphones have no business sounding this good!!!!! The tips that came attracted were a bit hard to get off that came preassembled but I just used my teeth lol. They were to small and memory foam which just feels weird so no harm if I damaged those. I just got the HTC ONE and with the beats these are even better!!! Take the plunge it's worth it!!!!"
1909,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound Quality:
These are the best sounding headphones that I have ever listened to. The bass is tastefully powerful, punchy, and does not cover up any of the mid-range or high frequency sounds. The overall sound is very detailed AND pleasantly smooth. I hear things that I have never heard in my music before. They are so detailed, that you can often times tell when bands have changed equipment or producers from album to album. Truly amazing! The mid-range sounds come through very well. This helps to especially define vocalists', pianists', and guitarists' sound. The highs are slightly cut and if the headphones had any weak spot in their sound, it might be here. This would be due to the fact that the headphones have only one driver, which is made to respond to the mid-lows the best. If this is crucial to you, I would go to something with more than one driver.

Break-in Period:
Make sure to play medium volume music through these headphones for around 80 hours before expecting proper sound!!! When I pulled the headphones out of the box and took a listen, I was disappointed. They sounded very loose. The highs and mids rang in my ears unpleasantly. This break-in period is crucial to complete before you decide if you like the sound of these headphones!
Build Quality:
These headphones' cables are thick! I'm hoping this translates to many years of use. The only spot that concerns me is the cable's connection to the ear buds. I have not unplugged these yet and plan to keep it that way as some other reviewers have mentioned concerns with this. I also noticed that the shafts that hold the foam or rubber ear tips on are quite thin (I do not know the exact terminology for this piece). Overall, these seem to be very tough headphones and I am fairly confident that they will last for several years or more as long as I continue treat them well.
Ergonomics:
These are the most comfortable headphones that I have worn! They take a little while to get used to at first but once you get used to them, you can wear them for hours on end. I have fallen asleep with theses in and woke up eight hours later without any pain or discomfort to my ears. That day, I continued to use them for a good four hours studying. I still had no discomfort, whatsoever. This is very pleasing for in-ear headphones.

Usability:
There aren't any inline controls or a microphone. This makes usage a bit clumsy because you have to use your phone or audio player controls to do anything. For me, this is not a concern as I bought these headphones for their sound quality.

Overall, these are probably the best sounding, strongest pair of headphones that you can buy for $100!"
1910,2.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones sound amazing......when they WORK! I owned them for a month until they broke. I used them when riding my motorcycle and fit nice under my helmet. But very disappointing that now they do not work. I am looking into finding out if they are warrantied.
1911,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So, so. Very heavy on the bass."
1912,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so impressed when I bought these. I loved the clarity and the sound of the bass, perfect for most types of music. I couldn't get enough and thought I'd finally found the ones. Then I started noticing a weird electronic buzzing during parts of songs with no sound, such as intros and endings. Shortly afterwards the left side died. It's been about 2 months."
1913,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This was so expensive that when I opened it I was shocked to see just how terribly it was built. The cord is stiff and unwieldy, yet tangles quite often. The earpiece options are all hard to put into your ear. On top of that, the way this earphone was built makes it so you HAVE to put the stiff unwieldy wires over the top of your ear before you can even put it on. I would recommend this product to absolutely no one because frankly, I can't imagine how anyone would like something so terrible yet so expensive. Its only saving grace is that the sound is at least decent amid all the terrible construction."
1914,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After a few months of using the headphone the music started cutting out in my right and left earphones and after a few weeks it cut out completely in my right earphone unless I physically held the cable near the plug right above the strain relief ribbing and gently moved it into the exact position required to get sound through. I had at this point purchased another cable which had a mic for my phone so I held off addressing the issues with warranty department as I could still listen to my music with the new cable. But then the new cable with the mic started experiencing the same issue. The left earphone would cut out as well, though intermittenly, in conjunction with and sometimes separately from the right earphone. The headphone cable fails right above the plug where the strain relief ribbing is located. When I sent my headphones in with the cable to the warranty deparment to be replaced they would not replace the cable. I go ta message back stating that the cable ""performed as expected"". I plugged the cable into the earphones and had the same exact problem that I sent it back under the warranty period for. This was near th end of my warranty period so I can only assume the following:

1. They knew the warranty would be over soon and did not want to replace it because I would not be able to make another claim as by the time I got it back I would be out of the warranty period.
2. The tester did not read my notes regarding the issue and just put in a standard line on the form.
3. The tester was incompetent.

I purchased these earphones and cables expecting high build quality and a reputable warranty department neither of which has been the case. The cables look like they are high quality but are prone to the same failure as evidenced by the two seperate models of the cable for the same earphones filaing in the same exact manner. This is due to one of the following problems or a combination of them:

1.Poorly designed cables.
2. Poor quality materials.
3. Poor qualitfy control measures.
4. Poor manufacturing practices."

1916,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones but the cable that came with it broke within a couple of weeks of use. I ended up buying a much better cable later.
1917,1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BUY!! I got these and was very excited because the sound is very good. However, after only one month and a week, the left earbud lost sound and would only be audible if i twisted the earbud to one specific angle. As these wrap around your earbud, that one specific angle was impossible to hold. Because of this, these headphones are now useless. Great sound but poorly built. Also, the warranty is only one month, so do not expect any full refund."

1919,1.0 out of 5 stars,"they don't isolate sound as I had expected for $100. Strange design ear buds with ""heavy"" plastic apparatus that sits ""on top"" of the earphones that insert into your ears so it makes it very difficult for them to stay in your ears as the weight pulls the phones out of your ears. Replacement ear phones are shipped with it but you can't remove the existing ones. Or at least you need a PHD to figure it out.."

1922,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received these Sure SE215-K headphones on May 20th. Precisely 7 days after the `return window' expired (30 days) these $100 headphones crapped out on me. I was so pleased to finally find a pair of headphones that sounded great and fit snugly. Then, the first time I put them in after returning from a trip abroad, the sound is horrible. The bass has completely dropped out and everything sounds muddy. What a waste. Totally disappointed. I'll be contacting both the seller Rock-Rock and Amazon and Shure if need be to see if they can find it in their hearts to offer a refund for these faulty headphones. I shall return with an update. UPDATE - Amazon customer service did the right thing and sent along a return label."

1924,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones in no small part because of the 2 year warranty. I was tired of buying new cheap headphones every 6 months and decided to pay a premium for something that would last me a couple years.
After 4 months of casual usage, the right earbud stopped producing any sound at all, after 6 months the volume from the remaining earbud dropped to maybe 10% of the original. ""That's a bummer"" I thought, ""but this event is exactly why I bought these headphones!"" I sent the headphones in for repair and lo and behold, the warranty does not apply because there was earwax damage! These are in-ear headphones, there will be earwax on every pair of these ever used for a decent amount of time! In fact, this pair of headphones came will a specialty tool specifically for the purpose of cleaning earwax out of the buds (a tool that I used regularly by the way). This appears to me, a way for Shure to refuse to cover under warranty a vast majority of the claims that come in. The cost of repairing + shipping is more than the cost of a new pair of the same headphones!

Do NOT buy these headphones, and if the warranty process on these is any indication - don't buy any Shure headphones."
1925,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: GREAT sound, sturdy cables, detachable cable from the ear bud (amazing idea - brilliant)
Cons: cables don't wrap well around ears - or I""m challenged possibly, cables too heave to stay behind ears when working out in any vigorous manner. For example, bend at waist and hang from the hips, buds fall out and cables unwrap. Utterly frustrating!!!!"
1926,2.0 out of 5 stars,Had to return it as it did NOT fit good in ears!
1927,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is of a $30 dollars headphones - there's not other way to put it! They are weird shaped and it takes time to getting used to. I am not a big fan of the loops over ears.It's just too much skin contact to feel like you wearing ear-buds.The wires are felt on your neck and this is the way it was designed too..
The wires are too thick and not flexible enough. The product is made in China- I can tell it affects quality.
Sound isolation is good - that's the only positive, but it blocks all sound. Sometimes on a airplane I want to heart when a food cart is behind me but not the constant engine noise.
I am thinking about returning them as they are just not worth the price."

NOTHING. AND, on top, I can hear tiny details, I can hear some sort of a distorted sound in the low-end spectrum, especially on the second unit."

1940,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair Of E2C's that were given to me as a demo from Shure years ago and I wore them to the point of the rubber around the cable coming off and the wire breaking inside the cord jacketing causing the sound to go in and out... Having a background in the audio business for many years and very particular about performance i was more then apprehensive about a new pair of IEM's living up to my standards. Im one of these guys who always says ""They don't make them like they used to"" But Wow the SE215's are AWESOME. I opened the zipper case and at first glance I immediately noticed Shure has fixed the part of the cord that touches the top of my ear by using a small piece of flexible tubing around the cord and a piece of metal or like substance to hold the form of the top of the ear. Shure also made the ear bud swivel and detach so the cables can be replaced if at some point I manage to wear these out as well. Next on to the Listening, I have to say the sound out of the box was thin and lackluster. Not what you would expect from Shure. After reading some helpful reviews about IEM's having a break in period I decided to give it a shot and run them over night on my Ipod at medium volume. To my surprise the next morning the sound had completely changed. Wow what a difference. Shure didn't let me down after all. These sound better then the old E2C's. Bottom line for only 99$ buy you a set of SE215's, give them a little break in over night and then experience what your music is supposed to sound like. Thanks Shure I am a customer for Life !!!!"
1941,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these earbuds last week. I am a weekend musician and planned on using them for both in-ear monitoring on stage, and mp3 player use on airplanes, etc.

After one use in each application, I am very happy with the sound, and VERY unhappy with the fact that every time the cord moves, sound cuts out to one of the earbuds. Where the removable cord attaches to the earbud, there is a design flaw that permits cutting out. Trust me, nothing is more frustrating than being on stage and having to stand still like a robot in order to be able to hear out of both sides of these earbuds.

I returned them immediately, and am very disappointed in Shure. This should not be happening on the scale that it is. Google search SE215 problems and you will see what I mean. VERY DISAPPOINTING."

Shure SE215 PHOOEY!"
1967,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earphones becauase of the great reviews but it actually sounds no better than the cheap Skullcandy's Ink'd I bought for $15. Comparing the two, I hear just a slight difference in the detail of what I'm hearing than the Skullcandy's (which is in favor of the Shure's). Volume wise it is about the same. I bought a Cowon J3 which has 39 presets and BBE Effect which is supposed to make the music sound better. I know that Cowon players have amazing sound but are horrendous in other areas. Put the setting on Maestro on the Cowon J3 and you will hear incredible sound just out of the Skullcandy's. I used my Android phone with the Shure SE215's, which comparably sounds similar on my Cowon player, but the volume is lower and I heard very little bass. I also bought the Skullcandy Ink'd Mic'd (which is exactly as it says, it has a microphone) and it has excellent sound and bass. It also sounds even better in my phone than these Shure SE215's. The only real problem with the Skullcandy Ink'd is they don't last more then 2 months and the sound goes. But the Skullcandy Ink'd Mic'd I've had for 5 months. You can also get a voucher through their website to replace your earphones. Overall, I'd say save your money, get a good media player or phone and stick with the cheap Skullcandy's."
1968,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a replacement for my LG Tone earphones and thought I would give the Shures a try. Shure in-ear headphones have always been on my radar but the over the ear design (never been my favorite) and price have always kept me away. I decided to take a chance with the SE215-CL-BT1 and have not been disappointed. I decided to go with the 215s over the 112s because of the detachable (and replaceable) cable. My experience with Bluetooth headphones has shown that when Bluetooth headphone go bad it is usually a short in the cable. The SE215 cures that problem. When/if I have an issue with these I can just replace the cable and keep the driver. Shure got the over-the-ear design of the cables just right . I have tried this same design in headphones from Klipsch and Polk and have found them extremely annoying and uncomfortable. The Shures are so comfortable that I forget that they are over the ear. Battery life is good at roughly 8 hours per charge and charging time of 2 hour is fast with a quick charge of 15 minutes that gets you 2 hours of listening time. Another bonus is they come with both silicone and foam ear tips. For me the silicone are a little more comfortable and much easier to insert. The foam tips take a little more practice but if done correctly you get a much tighter seal and much better sound isolation. The clip for your shirt collar is a nice touch and helps keep them secure because you really don't want to lose a $150 set of earphones.

So is there anything that I don't like? I only have a couple of minor gripes. 1) once in a while they get finicky and touching the earbud or cable causes dropouts. This has always been fixed by disconnecting the cable from the earbud and plugging it back in. Something you have to take them off and do and definitely not something you can do while driving. 2) I really wish the cable was just a bit longer. I like being able to clip them to the back of my shirt and letting the earbud hang over my shoulders down on my chest. However when I do this the control pod falls just behind my right ear. Not a big deal for accessing the controls but the microphone for phone calls is also there and callers complain that I sound like I am in a tunnel somewhere. This is easily fixed by clipping them to the front of my shirt collar and the mic falls just where it needs to. It just doesn't feel as secure because if they come unclipped then they easily fall to the ground. Both gripes are minor and easily over looked based on the next part of this review.

Finally, how do they sound? Oh my god the sound. If you get a good seal on the tips (keep trying different tips until you find your own personal ""sweet spot"" which for me it is the large foam tips) the sound is nothing short of amazing. Bass is tight, deep but not boomy. Highs are crisp and clear. Mids stand out just as they should. These are a very balanced sound. Efficiency is so good that I have found myself listening at volumes almost half of my LGs. Sound quality leaves the LGs in the dust. I have almost stopped using my Bose QC35s because the sound of the Shures are so far superior. The only thing the Bose have on them is the active noise cancellation is better than the Shure's passive noise isolation but the sound quality difference makes this a non-issue except in extremely noisy environments. The sound on the SE215-CL-BT1 will give my AKG 701s (my favorite headphones I have ever owned) a run for their money. Something I never expected out of a set of in-ear headphone.

The final verdict: Buy them. You won't be disappointed."
1969,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great, but the design sucks."
1970,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these a few days ago. I bought them to wear at work to block out some noise from computer equipment. It is a tedious task to figure out how to put these in your ear if you have never used this type of listening device before. Once I got them in they were pretty good. Blocked out a decent amount of noise but very hard to take out to answer the phone and then put back in quickly. I actually have to tug on my ear quite a bit and push them in to get these to fit in my ear canal.

I could see myself using these on a 14 hour plane ride with no problem or a very long walk. Otherwise I would probably just grab a pair of ear buds and be on my way. The foam tips that come with it were okay. It took forever for them to go back to their regular shape after being smushed and one was completely irregular to begin with so I couldn't use that one. I might try them again when I have the patience to wait around for them to expand and fit in my ear canal. It is nice that they offer the different sizes.

I do love the fact that the cords are heavy duty and that the ear pieces swivel so the cord doesn't get tangled up."
1971,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds have very good sound quality, but my disappointment with them is the lack of iPhone compatibility. The optional phone cable accessory is way too expensive for a low quality wire. The phone cable isn't designed for ""over the ear"", doesn't have the cable ear reinforcement, and the button assembly looks clunky. The included cable has such a large mini jack connector that it doesn't fit with most phone cases such as the Apple bumper case. There's no excuse for this after 6 years of smartphones. Shure desperately needs to offer these earbuds with the option of a higher quality phone cable instead of the normal cable."
1972,2.0 out of 5 stars,My Apple headphones that came with my iPhone sound so much better then these at a third the cost.
1973,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this last year and lately one of earbud kept splitting open so I decided to send it back to Shure for repair since Shure said it is 2yr warranty. I sent to them for repair but they sent back mine without repair because it is identified as a counterfeit version of Shure. Please be aware of it...
1974,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for use with my 535s.

Sound quality is not great, sounds as if I'm listening through a tunnel, really disappointing. There's also no support for the aptX bluetooth profile, so quality takes a huge hit on devices that support aptX. The difference between this and the Sennheiser Momentum BT is significant.

There's lots of interference walking down busy streets, with passing cars causing stutters or complete dropouts.

Expected a lot more, especially considering the delay in release on this product."
1975,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed!! I purchased this headphone for an ear monitor for our drummer and one side came defective with earpiece covering almost melted looking and NOT working. I was VERY disappointed that 100$ wasted, down the drain!!! DO NOT RISK PURCASING FROM THIS SUPPLIER!!!!!!!!!!"
1976,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Got a pair, it arrived defective with he left earbud not working. Got a replacement pair and after 4 months of light use (listening to music in an office) and excellent care (proper wrapping after every use) the left earbud died. I have had a $6 pair of headphones last two years and yet this pair couldn't last six months. Waste. Of. Money."
1977,2.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone who wears glasses all the time I found myself constantly fighting these headphones for comfort. Once on they sound great, but they get tangled way to easily and fight for space behind my ear with my glasses."
1978,2.0 out of 5 stars,I was very excited when i got this earbuds I tried them on and yea i can say that the sound quality was good but i was disappointed with the bass oh and another thing the left earbud would cut off ill never buy shure headphones ever again
1979,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I sent it back. I actually thought my stock Apple earphones had better quality than these. The fit was better than Apple which was a plus for cycling, but the bass was lacking and overall quality was sub par."
1980,1.0 out of 5 stars,Got these and they shorted out after 2 months. Very disappointed and never went to the seller about it because I knew it was going to be another pain in the butt just by reading other reviews.
1981,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They were okay until they broke on me after 8 months. The sound started to cut out when I was walking after about 6 months. I contacted Shure. They couldn't fix them and opted to not replace them so they refunded me the money. Can't complain about the refund but for headphones of this quality and price, they should have lasted more than 8 months.

The sound quality was pretty good. They did get a bit uncomfortable after wearing them for a while (my commute to work is about an hour and a half).

Also, I put these things in first thing in the morning after showering, so (gross) my ear wax got the buds dirty a lot. Now, I am a very hygenic person. I don't clean my ears every day (you're not supposed to) but I definitely do not let wax build up more than the average person and these got gross quick.

So glad I switched to Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones. Well worth the additional $10."
1982,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these se215 headphones to replace 6 year old E3 where the phono jack was worn from plugging in so much. Got them in April and use them 8-10 hours a week. The left earphone started cutting out and I would have to jiggle the rotating connection on the earphone. That would work for a minute or two then became more frequent and completely cut out. Now it is dead. Tried cleaning the connection and switching connections left-right right-left still no luck. The pivoting connection is horrible and moving connections are destined for failure. I will stick with a fixed connection next time. They do have more bass than the E3's but the E3's have more robust cables and connectors.
1983,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Seller BrandAid - After using these earphones less than a dozen times, the left channel stopped working. I sent it to the manufacturer for warranty repair but I received an email back that the earphones are counterfeit.
Amazon says it's passed their guarantee period and can not do any thing about it.
Buy from the manufacturer. do not buy from BrandAid."
1984,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned them. You can get a lot better sound from much cheaper IEM's. The quality was nice, but they didn't fit well and I was disappointed in the bass extension."
1985,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound fantastic, but the plug is so BIG that you cannot use it with an iPone 4 if you want to use a case on your iPhone.

This was a huge deal breaker for me.

Returned."
1986,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited to buy these headphones a week ago. I'm not an audiophile but received some bose in-ear headphones a few years ago as a gift and loved them...until they stopped working due a problem with the cord/wiring, which seems to be a common issue..

I was sold on the sound quality of the Shure headphones and other customers' reviews. So, I picked these up in anticipation of a big overseas trip. Well the headphones showed up and worked great for two days. Then, the left earbud inexplicably stopped working altogether. I had specifically bought these b/c I liked that the cord was detachable from the earbuds - after the cord issue w/my Bose I thought this was a great product feature. Well - that doesn't mean jack if the earbud stops working...after ~4 hours of light use!!!! Not sure if it was a lemon or what...but bottom-line, Shure needs to do a better job w/quality control. Judging from the few other posts on here, I'm not the only one to have them break after a few days of use.

the sound was good while it lasted...I hate shopping in general and there is nothing worse that doing your research, making an educated product purchasing decision, and then feeling like you got screwed due to cheap manufacturing practices..."
1987,1.0 out of 5 stars,"MY OPINION:

Durability of the spliced ends: I get a new pair of earbuds pretty much every year because the wires (where they attach into the earbuds) eventually get worn and break. I'm a 44 year old woman and wear them for running or while on the elliptical (so general wear and tear). Being that I have professionally done the same type of splices that where done on these ""refurbished"" earbuds, I know that these splices cannot withstand (for very long) the movement that they will be subjected to if one uses them when exercising. I would never recommend that splice with a wire that will be moving around very much.

Cost of this refurbishment: I had already spliced my old pair (at home--for free), with a much more reliable splice job (so I guess I'll keep using my old ones until I order NEW ones). I'm curious as to how the seller feels he/she rates to charge $99 for this repair splice, that takes about 5 mins. I really have to question the ethics of that.

Next issue with these earbuds: I have a pair of the old Shure 215's, which I purchased about a year ago, only mine are better because they have a part that can be used with a cell phone. I may have missed that feature in these refurbished ones, but I would expect the newer version to have, at a minimum, the same features--not less.

My last issue is that now I'm being charged to ship them back because I'm not willing to settle for the quality of this product?? And I also paid to ship them to me.. I feel like I got jacked since the earbuds are junk--in my opinion.

By the way, the replacement ends (when you need to change them out), I think I saw somewhere that they cost $40 by themselves. For that amount, you've spent about half the amount of the original cost of the refurbished ones."
1988,3.0 out of 5 stars,the rating is that because i had them for a short time.. and I notice on one side is loader than the other.. perhaps it is me .. or when other instruments are all hooked up I lost my sound.. I will try them with other devices.
1989,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my third pair of Shure earphones. All three have broken within 6 months. I though that spending a little more on the SE215 would lead to improved durability, but they crapped out even more quickly than the SE115. DO NOT BUY SURE PRODUCTS."
1990,3.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap made in China quality wire and sound quality heavily diminished as oppose to hard wire.
1991,3.0 out of 5 stars,I do NOT like them but to be honest it's my issue because I don't like so much of the outside noise blocked out.
1992,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had read up on these ear buds as a good alternative to the larger over the ear noise canceling headphones and was very surprised to see them show up at my door a day early, however my joy ended there. Right from the start the box showed signs that it had been glued shut (finger print where super glue had removed just a little box paint), clearly previously opened, but I figured I'd see if it was perhaps just cosmetic damage and that everything else inside would be fine; it was not. The cords had been twisted together, appearing to have kinks, and the different sized cups and cleaning tool was missing. Clearly this product had been returned by someone else and the seller simply sent if off to me without even inspecting the outer box for 'tampering'. For a product that goes INSIDE the body (all-be-it a very small amount) I DO NOT WANT a previously used product that didn't even get inspected. I'm sure the ear buds are great but I'm never going to find out because I'm not interested in any product from a seller who doesn't care enough inspect this 'type' of product before trying to send it off to another customer. For the price I was expecting a 'new' product, not one that had already been inside someone else's ears."
1993,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have headphones below 535’s I’m sure these will suffice, but if you’re a true audiophile, don’t waste your time. The cable produces medorcre sound quality with the 535’s. I have exprenced better buletooth sound quality from first generation Beats studios. Additionally, there is a female voice that prompts for any action the device takes, like connecting or low battery. Extremely annoying, considering music will already be playing before I am prompted that the headphones are connected or you’ll be notified 7 times to a low battery before it’s completely exalted."
1994,1.0 out of 5 stars,The left ear piece stopped functioning just like other reviews stated here. The sad part is that it happened right after the 30 day return policy date. Checked with Amazon and the rep informed me that I have to contact manufacturer for replacement. I would avoid this product as this issue seems to be way too common.
1995,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a longtime SE215 wired user and was looking forward to the wireless experience. This is my second pair of SE215 wireless earphones - the cable on the first was literally damaged while removing from the packaging (which Amazon immediately replaced). This pair was great until I ran with them in the rain (day three). I knew that there was a problem when the volume started to involuntarily lower to zero, and the buttons on the remote would not do anything. Once inside, I disconnected the SE215s from my iPhone via the iPhone's Bluetooth menu (SE215 remote buttons continued to be non-functioning). Ten or so minutes later, I attempted to power off/on the SE215s via the power button, only to have the LED go solid red and nothing else functional (cannot connect to iPhone, power off/on, etc.). I called Shure Technical Support and was told that I should not charge the SE215s and wait until the battery dies, then let sit for ""a couple of days"" and see if they work. They also recommended that I place them in a bag of rice. Unacceptable for a product that I will use for workouts; going back to Amazon permanently today."
1996,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After having spend days researching what headphones to buy, I settled on those. Got them this morning and they are going straight back. If you need to read documentation (which is poorly done on top of it) to use in-ear headphones, something is wrong. I couldn't get them to stay in my ears, the cable would disconnect as I tried and I never found a comfortable fit. I have no idea how this product got 4 stars on average. The sound quality is good. Everything else about it is horrible."
1997,1.0 out of 5 stars,"the foam ear piece is a big problem, frankly too much of an effort to wear. I'm sure it gets easier over time.
Sound quality is awesome, ONLY IF IT FITS.
Changing the foam ear pieces is quite difficult too."
1998,1.0 out of 5 stars,i bought them because my old earbuds died on me. i really thought the removable ending was a great feature. which i still thing the idea is great. but simply getting them to fit in your ear is a hassle and the way they wrap around (when you FINALLY do get them in your ear) just feels unnatural. they do what they're supposed to do. but i think this purchase has made it clear that these 'type' of earphones are not for me at all.
1999,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horribly disappointing!
My stock Samsung earbuds sound 10 times better and are worlds more comfortable. The shures are unbearably uncomfortable after about 30 minutes (I tried all of the tips included pluss some others I already had)
These are absolute junk!"
2000,1.0 out of 5 stars,smh wish they were louder i want my money back
2001,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't waste your money on this product. I have used Shure earbuds for a few years and absolutely love them. Except for this pair for two reasons.

First - the earabuds are very difficult to adjust to the ear canal. It took a great deal of twisting and turning each bud for each ear. It never felt secure in the canal or the ear itself. The fit is extremely poor.

Second - the quality of sound was awful, very tinny, male voices nearly sounded like females. I have many movies on my iPod and couldn't get the sound to be anything like the sound tracks.

This Shure product is a great disappointment. It is going in my drawer to never be seen again."
2002,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible sound for its price class and not comfortable to wear. I played with them for 30m and threw them in the trash can.
2003,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the sound. I've had several versions of these headphones over many years, having bought each subsequent model as they've updated the design. This one delivers as expected in many ways - most notably the audio, which is probably the most important aspect. There are a couple of disappointments, however.

One flaw is that they are just not very easy to get around the ears and into the ear canal. They have a stiff sheath along the few inches of cord nearest to the buds which does not mold easily to the shape of the ear. I understand what they were trying to do - presumably they wanted to give that section some sturdiness so that the cord would mold nicely and stay in place - but the execution produced the opposite of the desired effect, actually making it harder to get the cord to hook around the ear and stay put.

Moreover, because of the substantial plastic casing around the electronics, the buds don't fit in my ears very squarely, and the positioning is easily disrupted by any contact. Any pressure on the bulky outside of the buds - such as from a pillow or even a headband when it's cold - can cause the fit to be distorted, the foam to collapse, and the sound to be muted. Not ideal.

I'll continue to use these headphones and I'm not in a hurry to replace them, but they are not as well-designed as previous Shure models, and when it is time to buy again, I will research other options."
2004,1.0 out of 5 stars,xmas gift and blew up in 3 months
2005,1.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is great and the design comfortable. Unfortunately the Left earbud failed after 30 days and its replacement from shure failed after a week. This earbud has a major design flaw. Do not buy until it has been corrected.
2006,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for these earbuds as the ones that came with my iPhone are very uncomfortable. The jack is just way too big to plug them into the phone with a Case-Mate case on it. The hole is the case is smaller than the diameter of the plastic part of the jack, so it won't push down far enough to connect. I had to send them back."
2007,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate it. Ordered Black, received USED clear headphones. Who would wear used headphones? Simply not acceptable."
2008,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would not recommend these ear buds to anyone. I have had Shure earbuds in the past and normally Shure is an excellent product but I would not recommend the SE215-K earbuds to my worst enemy. They do not fit well in the ear, the way the cable fits is atrocious. What on earth where the Shure engineers thinking?"
2009,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad quality
2010,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not an audiophile but I know cheap earbuds. I've tried many - Sony, Phillips,MEE,Etymotic, Sennheiser, Panasonic, Klipsch and a host of others. For just sit-down listening it was clearly the Klipsch s4. But they are not built to stay and not that great at sound block. For my more active phases the MEE(or something) had the best earpiece that was flexible to mold around your ear and the bud itself was not bad. It stayed there, blocked the ambient sound but didn't sound great. Hey, 2 out of 3 ain't bad. But then came pre-Black Friday (once known as Thanksgiving) and Amazon drops the price of these puppies and Wallah! I snap them up. These sound a little better to me than the Klipsch, have the same ear bending wire to mold it around the ear as the MEE and the unique way it fits and the cushion just fill the entire ear canal comfortably with the best earbud sound. That;s 3 out of 3 if you don't count the price. Get these if you're limited to $100 or less or wait until next Black Friday"
2011,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just could not get them to stay in. I guess I am getting old. Left the old shure earbuds at home when we went on a trip. Simple, 90 degree turn, put it in your ear and it stays. So I ordered on amazon and shipped ahead. They arrived before we got there and we continued on ready to use them. The instructions are very unclear how they go in. Kind of shows one way, but they are not as simple as the 90 degree kind. Since then I have found the instructions online as how to fit them in the ear.
When held in, they sounded fine.
I purchased this model because they have the two types of ear forms: the foam and a rubber one. They come with 3 sizes that fit most any ear."
2012,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received the headphones yesterday and tried them out immediately. Well first I got to say these headphones sound great! Awesome sound and deep lows, which should be expected out of a set of good quality monitoring headphones that cost this much. My only complaints are that the earphones don't fit exactly in the inner ear unless you have them just right. So you have to mess with them a little until you find the right position for your ear. If you don't have them positioned correctly, the sound is awful and you won't be impressed at all. The other complaint is the price. There are so many monitoring style earphones out on the market today that are much lower but I'd imagine the sound quality would not be as great. Well, just for the record, this is not exactly true. I also bought a set of MEElectronics M6-BK for around $20. These headphones sound almost as good, for just a 1/4 of the price. If I would have known this before, I might not have purchased the Shure earphones. Although I'm a little remorseful for purchasing these Shure headphones at this price, I'm not dis-satisfied about the sound and quality. The biggest difference you'll see upfront between the Shure and other earphones (in the lower price range) is the quality of the build. The Shure has heavy duty wiring (lined with Kevlar) and gold connections, where the $20 headphones do not. So in short, the Shure earphones are a good buy if money is not a major deal breaker."
2013,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update 7/12/13: I am changing my initial review after about a month of usage. A couple of things happened to change my mind.

First, I realized I hadn't been wearing the earpieces correctly. After inserting the units, I needed to tug on my earlobe and push them flush against my ear for a snug fit. Previously, the piece that rests on the ear kept popping out. I guess doing this directed the sound waves differently in my ear and it greatly improved the sound.

The other thing that changed my mind is that I did a side by side comparison with new Sony MDR-EX33LP I ordered after my initial review. The Shures sound is much richer and balanced and I'm able to clearly hear more subtle components in the music -- even at low volumes -- compared to the Sony, which has improved my listening experience.

So I'm glad I stuck with these. I guess the most important thing to keep in mind is to make sure you're inserting these 100% correctly in your ear for the best sound.

-------------------------
I really tried to like these ear buds but was just not able to do so. I am a big fan of the Sony MDR-EX33LP/SLV EX but one side always stopped working after a few months so I was looking for something sturdier. I chose the Shure headphones based on the reviews they got for durability and sound.

While they certainly seem durable, the sound is disappointing. The best way to describe the sound is flat, lifeless. I tried burning them in as recommended and also different EQ settings but no difference. The Sony's sound, on the other hand, is great -- bright, clear and punchy.

The one thing I do like about the Sure headphones is that they're very comfortable and do provide a good deal of sound insulation. I'm going back to the Sony model and will keep these for wearing when flying."
2014,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones. Sound great. The only problem that I have is when trying to put my helmet on (motorcycle helmet) they are easily pulled outta my ears. They are a little difficult to get the hang on putting them in your ears, but after a couple tries it gets much easier. Would be nice if they had some picture instructions in the box with them. Other than that they have great sound, better than the last two pairs of bose headphones that I had. They give you tons of extra cable, which gets caught on things if you run with or are around stuff and moving. I'd suggest using a zip tie to wrap up a small portion of the wire while in use."
2015,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great, the comfort level isn't the greatest. Just so everyone understands, these are not regular ear buds. They are in-ear monitors. The larger plastic piece fits inside the ""concha"" area of the ear (look it up.. I had to as well). This is where prolonged use may become uncomfortable if that section doesn't fit well. Otherwise, the construction on these are great and once again, the sound quality is great."
2016,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a replacement to my Sony XBA-1iP, which were rather lacking on the lows especially. Not only do the Shure SE215s have beautiful sounding lows, the sound coming out of these is beautiful in general; very well balanced. I found the factory default covers to fit my ears just fine, but there are plenty of alternatively sized covers that come included in a resealable bag that can be left in the carrying case, which is also included. However, for about the first week of use, the fit for these did take getting used to as I've never owned a pair of earphones before in which the cord goes behind the ear. After getting used to it, the fit on these are suburb - you can easily use them for hours on end. In regards to noise isolation, the manual these come with says ""Wear them like you would a pair of earplugs"" and boy, do they make for great earplugs. That said, the noise isolation on these is so great - even at a low volume - that it can pose a hazard if you plan on going for a walk/jog with these on.

Plain and simple, these sound great, they fit great, and they're great for listening over extended periods of time."
2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've now owned 5 pairs of quality, sub-$100 ear buds and this is my favorite pair yet. I first bought a pair of Etymotic ER6i's which had a nice, clean sound although they were a bit thin on the bass. Thin wiring finally gave out on those and one of the ear buds quit working. I also had a pair of Klipsch Custom 2's, a dual driver IEM that had a rich, warm sound that I really liked. A trip through the washing machine damaged the cables which gave out completely soon after. Since then, I bought another pair of Etymotics (MC-5) and a pair of Klipsch S4's. I've been pretty happy with both of those, although both pairs have their weaknesses that have bothered me a bit and I kept thinking I could find something better around the same price point.

After reading positive reviews of Shure's IEM's for years I finally decided to get a pair. I bought these SE215's and I can't praise them enough. First, the build quality on these is unbelievable. The cables are much thicker and heavier than any other pair of ear buds I've owned. Everything about the fit and finish on these feels solid and gives the impression they will stand up to some abuse. Like the Klipsch Custom 2's I owned, where the cables come out of the ear buds, they have a small section of memory wire that you loop over the top of your ear rather than just dangling down like most ear buds. This takes a bit of getting used to (mostly when putting them on), but works well once you get the hang of it.

They sound great. The bass is deep and solid, but doesn't overwhelm the midtones and highs which are crisp and clean. Compared to my Etymotic MC5's the bottom end is much more robust and satisfying. And the mids and highs are cleaner than with my Klipsch S4s. I have a difficult time believing you'll find anything that sounds better without going into the $150-200 price range.

I'm a runner, and I always take in to account how a pair of head phones will perform when running. The Etymotics and the Klipsch pair are both pretty solid for running with only a couple of issues. They both can produce a lot of cable noise which tends to cause you to increase the volume to drown it out. And they both have a tendency to start working their way loose in your ears as you begin to get sweaty. Both of these issues appear to be solved with these Shures. The heavy duty cables and the way you loop them over your ears solves the cable noise problem.

The only complaint I've got is that I wasn't really happy with the included sleeves. I got a good seal with the silicone sleeves, but they have a small ridge going around them (from the molding process I assume) that irritates my ears when I put them in. And I had a difficult time getting a good seal with the memory foam sleeves. I suspect if I experiment with them a bit more I may like them, but they also seem pretty fiddley...something you can't just pop in and out. I ended up using a pair of dual-flange sleeves that came with my Klipsch Custom 2's. They fit on the ear buds easily and are easy to quickly get on and make a good seal.

I've very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for quality, excellent sounding pair of IEM's for under $100."
2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for 2 years and finally it's past the warranty expiration date by a month and this is the third time they've broken and completely lost sound on the same exact side, the left side. I've had it sent to Shure twice but it has broken soon afterwards anyway. It's the third time now and unfortunately I can't send them in again without being charged. The headphones are great when they actually work but break way too often. I do not recommend you buy these headphones."
2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor quality control for such a renowned brand. Right side driver would NOT stay plugged into the cable no matter how carefully I tried to plug them in, it would pop loose at the slightest tug or twist while the left side had no such issue, in fact it came off when I was removing them from the packaging. Left side snapped together with a definite click and took some effort to plug/unplug. Pretty disappointing as I had read tons of reviews about how great these were. Didn't even bother using them after that. I am returning them and will likely not be bothering with Shure products in the future, my time and money are worth more to me than this."
2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,Are these a scam? Bought them to cancel out noise and I can easily hear light noise in another room. tried all the fittings and forcing them into my ear after they wouldnt work otherwise. I can easily hear talking and a small fan in another room with the door shut.
2021,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Its ridiculously difficult to get the ear buds off the piece, the left one broke within 2mins of trying to get it off. Returned it promptly. Would never buy again."
2022,1.0 out of 5 stars,The sound on these are great except for the highs as bass overpowers. Left earphone stopped working within a week :( had to return.
2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As background on me, I've heard or owned almost all the $1,000+ universal IEMs, JH Audio, Shure, Noble, ie800 etc. But I was always curious about the SE215 because of its good reputation, and at $90 I thought, what the heck it's worth a gamble.

Observations below:

1. The bass issue: As many have noted, these put out slightly too much bass if you use the black foam tip and get a good seal. But it's just a little too much. What I mean is that it's not an insufferable amount of bass; just annoying; like, ""that drum could have been toned down just a bit."" The good news is that if you switch from the foam tips to the silicon rubber tips, the bass goes down and it's almost perfect. Also, a little too much bass is both a negative and a positive -- although excess bass takes away from other frequencies, sometimes bass sounds good; if you want to hear the drums in your favorite tracks, this will deliver. Update: After breaking it in, the bass toned down.

2. The mids and highs are underrated. I saw the reviews about the SE215's poor highs, and I was expecting an AM-radio-style muddy mess. But this can deliver the highs. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bright headphone; it's a warm headphone. But its treble is not deficient (and remember that a warm sound signature is safest with iems, because highs are the frequencies that can damage hearing). [EDIT: Update after a month of use: they've gotten brighter and brighter over time and now I would characterize them as neutral or even bright. So make sure you let them break in.]

3. The imaging / sense of 3-D spaciousness is good. That's to be expected from basic headphone science; a pair of dynamic drivers will generally image better than multiple balanced armature drivers (partly the nature of a dynamic driver, and partly because it's hard to perfectly time the sound from multiple drivers.)

4. These will sound noticeably better with a proper dac/amp, as opposed to just plugging them into your phone.

So I know what you're thinking -- how does it compare to the $1,000 IEMs? Basically, the expensive IEMs are just a little better at some elements. Some have better vocals, some better highs, some better detail, some better imaging and so on, and some are worse on some of these dimensions. But this $90 thing is in the ballpark, which was surprising. The best analogy I can give is with cars. You have Ferraris, Bentleys and so on (call these the top of the line IEMs) , and you have garbage like the Smart Car or a Vespa (call these the Apple earbud). The SE215 would be like a BMW 3 or 5 series. To put it another way, if I got stuck somewhere without all of my expensive IEMs, and all I had were these, I would be fine."
2024,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The plug is too large to fit into my Galaxy S5 with a Unicorn Beetle case. So...useless to me. Seems like a poor design with current phones, but maybe most people don't use cases anymore."
2025,2.0 out of 5 stars,I decided to upgrade to a more expensive product when my Apple headphones stopped working and I chose these. I wish that I could go back and just get Apple headphones again. These are not comfortable and the sound is not much better. Not great!
2026,1.0 out of 5 stars,extremely uncomfortable for long period of live singing....I stick to more comfortable buds. I use a pair of Bose e2 which are very very comfortable...

2028,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I spent a solid 15 minutes trying to figure out how to even wear these things, and when I finally were able to get them in, they were very uncomfortable. After that, I plugged them into my iPod and there was just static sound unless I held the cord in a certain way. The package did not come with a receipt or an adhesive return label, causing an even more inconvenience."
2029,1.0 out of 5 stars,I hate these earbuds. They don't stay in my ear at all. Even the $20 iPhone ear buds are better.
2030,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought the mic is included. I need to use it for the phone calls. I have to order another cable with a mic, disappointed. Have not used it yet. so no comments on the quality."
2031,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure makes some incredible IEMs, but it seems like they aren't so good at the cables. Which is why I'm glad they're removable. I picked these up from the airport after losing a competitor's set in a hotel room and they hardly work. It's nice there's a voice there to remind me that i have more than 2 hours of battery, but out of nowhere it loses a connection and then refuses to turn back on until I plug them in and unplug them again.

The cables themselves aren't balanced correctly, the button/mic thing sits below your right ear, and the battery kinda lays across your chest or behind your head, depending on how you wear them. The cables are really long from ear to ear so you end up with a clunky, chunky set of cables in what should be elegant and small, especially for the price.

I'd wait for the next version."

2033,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As stage monitors, these earphones more than do the trick. The ""in ear"" experience is like no monitoring experience you've ever had. It literally changes the way you play and sing. The intricacies of the music come to life inside the Shure 215 earphones. The primary reasons that I am satisfied with these headphones could be summed up by simply saying the following: They should fit pretty much every single ear with ease. Not only will they fit, they will be comfortable. Not only will they be comfortable, they will immerse you in a world that is 37db quieter than what you're used to. I'm not going to lie, it's a bit of an adjustment, but an adjustment well worth the making. They will be stable on your head. While the provided fit kit helps the earphones stay firmly planted in your ear canal, the cabling will help stabilize the earphones even further. The ""moldable"" cable around your ears greatly cuts down extraneous movement and the additional piece that pulls the cabling tight to the base of your skull greatly reduces the pull from the cable hanging down your back. All of this is great bu the key here is the sound. You will hear nuance in your performance that you've never heard before. These earphones have pristine highs and mids that greatly help with vocal and instrumental performance. While it is a little lacking on the bass end for my taste, any good sound system will have some outboard gear which should include an EQ for the stage monitors so the lack of punch in the bass shouldn't be an issue for the live performer as you will be able to correct this in the EQ. These earphones come with a number of ""fit"" options that make finding the right ""fit"" for your ear a snap. The included fit kit comes with a good array of foam and flex materials that made fitting my own ears very quick. The cables that go to each earpiece are detachable. Not sure why I would want this feature but something like this would come in handy for maintenance or replacement. The actual cable has a piece that allows you to draw the earpiece cables tight against the back of your skull. This provides nice stability. The sound isolation is excellent. The cable is not exceptionally long. I'm about six foot and the actual 1/8 inch adapter for the cable hangs just below my waist. So if you're very tall you might consider that this cable might not reach waist level. For most, however, I wouldn't think this feature would be a hindrance...especially if you don't plan to use these earphones in a live music setting (stage monitoring for example) There is FORMABLE cable around the earpieces so that you can mold the wire to the contour of your ear. This greatly improves the stability. There is no kind of EQ control within the headphones so depending on what you're listening to, and what you're listening to it on, you might notice that these earphones are a little treble heavy. But of course, that is what you should expect in something with a single microdriver. So, for a fair price, you actually get an array of nice features that make this product well worth the investment. I think the construction, the fit, and the sound of these earphones are quite good. My primary use for these is in live music settings. These earphones are my stage monitors. Thus far, they have proven to be both durable and reliable. So like I said...good construction. The fit is such that I can wear these earphones for hours on end with little to no discomfort. So, like I said...high quality fit. The sound is the only thing that is a little lacking but I blame the single microdriver moreso than anything else. If you're using these earphones in live settings I would most definitely recommend the use of an EQ to improve the articulation of the bass frequencies. But, having said that, I am in no way disappointed with the overall sound of these earphones. I quite enjoy watching movies with these earphones. By nature of their design these earphones provide a unique audio experience in modern films where the stereo sound field is being highly manipulated. So anyway, good and diverse overall..."
2034,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have high expectations of Shure but the SE215 didn't wow me in any way. Having said that, it's the first earphone I've owned to get the right mix of all the characteristics I look for in an earphone. I'm more demanding of an earphone than a stay-at-home headphone, it has to do more than stay on my head and sound good. Things like durability, isolation and microphonics, among other things, are important and Shure gets that.

Comfort/Design:
They were not as comfortable as they looked. It's a personal thing but they literally rubbed me the wrong way, not so much as to be problematic but it dismissed the notion I had of any IEM of this shape being instantly comfortable, something I will think about for future purchases. Still, they were adequate and I would pick an over-the-ear style cable any day. Due to the cable route and the cable itself, microphonic noise is as low as I could reasonably expect. I was not able to comfortably listen to them while lying on my side but your experience may differ.

The Shure ""Olive"" foam tips are comfortable and I found them easy to fit. I've never had the issues some people have with memory foam eartips or earplugs but I still found them easier to handle than most. Contrary to popular opinion, they can be cleaned without entirely losing their performance.

The cable jack is solid and properly strain relieved but is bigger than with most other earphones. So much so that most iPhone cases (the ones that cover around the jack) that aren't of the super-thin variety will not allow you to plug your earphones in.

Isolation:
It will be hard to beat any Shure for isolation at this price point. I can't fault it at all, any more might be dangerous.

Durability:
With the rave reviews at the time, I had high expectations and my initial impressions were good. It was the best feeling cable of any IEM I've used and it looked rugged enough. It resisted tangling or kinking and felt like it would outlast my other IEMs by far but I was wrong about that last one. My first cable broke at just over half a year and the 2nd cable lasted about that long as well. Both were swiftly repaired under warranty and my final cable lasted an impressive 2 years although at that point, the memory wire had punctured a whole in the heat shrink that at the part of the cable that wraps around your ear.

The cable is still better than most of what I've used at this price point but it wasn't all I was lead to believe it would be. It's great that you can replace them yourself but when the cable costs 40% (it used to be more) of the earphone's original price, it's no longer a big feature. I can imagine SE535 owners shelling out the 40 dollars but I don't feel it's worth it for this one.

I didn't have many issues with the earpieces themselves although I did crack the housing when removing a stubborn eartip with force. It did not affect the sound.

Sound:
Shures generally have an inoffensive sound and the SE215 follows that trend. It is a bassy headphone but the bass is controlled better than many other popular offerings at this price point, the Beats come to mind. The bass ends up being the predominant aspect of the SE215's sound but it stops just short of overwhelming the midrange. The treble is rolled-off which contributes to the inoffensive sound but also kills off any airiness the SE215 might have had. It does tend to have a ""boxed-in"" sound which isn't poor but not impressive. It's not the most energetic earphone but it has enough to keep up with most forms of music. Detail is not the best on this Shure but it has a smooth, warm presentation that I generally find to be quite pleasing.

It won't knock you over with its technical ability but the overall presentation is good. If you can enjoy your music for $99 then you should have no problem doing it with the SE215.

You can easily find better sounding earphones at this price but you will find it a lot harder to find something that can top the SE215 in all the aforementioned areas. Sonically, it's not a hugely impressive earphone but Shure has created a product that does its job very well. The SE215 is probably the best earphone I've used on the go and for this price, you can't go wrong."
2035,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After using a cheap no-brand MMCX BT cable I was pleased to see Shure finally produce an official BT solution — and for it to be retroactively compatible with my SE535s. Albeit for a lot more than I paid for the no-brand variation.

Overall, I’m quite pleased. As others have noted the cable design feels less than ideal and I generally end up wearing it in front of my neck. The battery often makes it uncomfortable to have the wire dangling behind.

The biggest issue I have with the unit is the microphone. This unit is really sub par for phone calls, Siri, etc. This is really disappointing given Shure’s expertise in microphones and the price being paid. I have had a number of Bluetooth headphones over the years and the microphone on these is the worst. I have to switch to the phone to be heard. It’s too bad.

If you don’t care about phone calls or voice dictation, etc, these are a good option. Otherwise, enjoy the music, and hope you don’t receive too many calls!

UPDATE: The call quality issue has worsened. I had to buy a separate dedicated bluetooth headset to handle calls, unfortunately, since I received too many complaints about inaudibility.

I am thinking my cable may be defective. While the unit has a two-year warranty, unfortunately it will take a couple of weeks to process a repair (there's no cross-shipping) and I will have to pay for shipping. Not the friendliest policy, considering I paid $100 for a simple cable and some pretty commonplace electronics these days. On top of what I paid for the original SE535s as well... Oh well."
2036,1.0 out of 5 stars,These ear buds are comparable to two tin cans and some string. The stock ear buds that are provided with the iPhone are better. I would not recommend these to my worst enemy. The sound consistently fades in and out.
2037,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Here's the deal: shure earphones short out where the cable connects to the speaker piece. 4th pair of shures and absolutely my last (2 others have done the same thing). Thought new detachable cable design would make a difference. It doesn't. Too bad because sound quality is great for the price. No longer will I exercise my insanity with this brand. I've used these new se215s 4 times and the left earphone is already cutting out. Same story. I buy earphones to USE them, not to screw with filling out repair reports and shipping services. I GUARANTEE that if you buy these one or both sides WILL short out. Consider yourself warned and avoid these unless you like buying things that don't work. Don't make the same mistake that I did."
2038,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not the first set of Shure earbuds I've owned. I had a set of the E2c's, which were fantastic. After about 5 years of hard labor, they finally gave up the ghost, and suffered the usual death by cable rot to which that series of buds were so prone. So I took to the search for a replacement, and these were my criteria...

1. They must be in-ear style buds, with the option to switch the sleeves (The piece that goes in the ear). Also, they must include those swappable pieces.

2. They must have a good warranty of at least 2 years.

3. They must not cost more than ~100 USD.

4. They must sound great.

(These are in no order of preference, and all considered equal)

So with that in mind, I also need to mention that I was partial to Shure. Mostly, because the E2c's were my first real good set of earphones, and broke down all my stigmas as to ""Why would anyone pay so much for headphones?"" So here is my review.

The Sleeves - There are 2 different types of sleeves bundled with this set; one a flexible rubber, the other a re-expandable foam. Each has three separate sizes, to help you find a good fit. I tried both. The foam sleeves feel nice, so long as you insert them like earplugs. They expand nicely to your ear canal. They offer fantastic sound isolation, and stay inside. The rubber sleeves are comfortable, but they are constantly being pulled out of your ears by the very stiff cord. I will try them again once I get the cord broken in a bit more, but for now, I'm going with the foam sleeves.

The Warranty - 2 years, not bad, but my E2c's had 3. From what I hear, the cable rot issue is still going on, but I will expand on that in a minute.

The cost - If you can get them for 100 USD, then do it. I think they are normally 2X that price.

The Sound - At first, I was a bit worried. I was hearing some odd pops in the earphones. Pops that I shouldn't be hearing from a headset this expensive. But, that turned out to be from the player I had them plugged into. I tried a different source, and no pops. They are at least as good as my E2c's were when I first got them. There is some talk about the lows and highs and all that, and I don't know about all that. I know that I was getting some weird looks at the restaurant I was at when I was headbanging and booth-breaking (sit down dancing at my table) to the music. I listen to a lot of rock, electronica, and trip hop, and it all sounds great.

Other Stuff - I mentioned the cables, and for good reason. Shure has a history of cable rot; the insulation on the wires literally rots off, and results in dead headphones. To combat that, they have added 2 features. One, an additional layer of insulation around where the wire goes over the ear (The most common place of rot). This likely extends the life of the cable, which makes it even thicker than it already is, which makes it VERY stiff. This stiffness leads to the cable not staying in place, and needing some serious breaking in, which in turn could lead to breaking the wire. So be careful, and be patient. If you use the foam sleeves, then it isn't that big of a problem.
The other thing is that they made the cable able to be detached from the earpiece, which means you can replace it if it goes bad. This is nice, except that, it's proprietary. It is unlikely that Shure will still have these cables in a few years available for purchase or otherwise. So while it's a nice feature, you likely won't be able to use it for anything other than changing the color of your wires. (It would likely be a good idea to order a spare once these earbuds are discontinued).

I also want to comment on the case that comes with the set. At first, I didn't like it, becasue my previous Shure's had such a nice case. It was solid, with an insert in the middle that you could wrap the cords around and place the drivers inside of. This case is soft, and has no way to manage the cables or drivers other than jsut stuffing them inside, which is what I didn't like at first. But over time, I have grown to like how much more compact it is. The soft case fits easily into my pocket, and keeps everything pretty contained (the last case bulged a lot). And I've never once had an issue where I felt they were compromised as a result. So I would say the soft case works quite well, and has a sharp looking Shure logo on it.

So that's my experience with the 215's. I recommend them to anyone that knows how important a good set of headphones are, but doesn't have a lot of money to dedicate to them."
2039,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually purchased these off Shure's website with a 3 year warranty 4 years ago. I've had these since then and have not had a single problem out of them! I originally bought them for the purpose of using them as studio monitors on stage at church (I drum in a youth band).

When you purchase them, you're buying the headphones, the cord that they detach from, the small case to carry them, a small cleaning tool that is extremely useful for cleaning debris out of them like wax and whatnot, and 6 different buds to go in your ears; 3 sizes of foam for full and clear bass and long term comfort, and 3 sizes of a rubber-like material for athletic activites (I discovered they were water resistant when I ran a half marathon with them and many 5ks and I sweat ALOT). Even though the foam tips sound amazing and are more comfortable, they are tougher to clean and the rubber tips still sound fantastic. I actually use the rubber tips mostly because they're so much easier to manage.

The cord in my opinion is the perfect length. It's just long enough to where you can stand upright with your device in your pocket and have a fair amount of slack but not enough where it can be cumbersome. THE CABLE FOR THE HEADPHONES IS ALSO HIGHLY TANGLE-FREE. I remember about a month ago I went to work with my headphones wrapped in a circle in my pocket. I pulled them out when I get to work and my friend says, ""you did not just pull those headphones out of your pocket untangled.."" I laughed and held them from the headphone jack and let the rest fall and they unraveled perfectly before I proceeded to roll them back up.

The case is durable and very useful; it has a small D ring clip to attach it to whatever.

As far as maintenance goes, there is a small booklet that comes with the headphones that is very straightforward with everything from cleaning to swapping earbuds.

I'm reviewing these just now because after 4 years of having these and literally not a single problem, I believe I should share the word about how phenomenal these babies are. I'm buying a pair of white ones for my younger sister cause she is always taking mine.

Hope this was helpful!"
2040,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not to be confused with the shute ear buds (which are fantastic). I have owned 2 of the shure Bluetooth components- product I am reviewing. I have broom using these for 6 months and have had the 425 model ear buds for 2 years.

Pros: great Bluetooth range and battery life
Con: the cable connecting to the ear buds is horribly designed. HORRIBLE DESIGN:

With 6 hours of battery life, the battery is sizable and, even with the garment clip, it is too big/ heavy. Further, it’s position on the cable doesn’t allow the small “wire to wire clip” to center when trying to take up slack. Next, factor in the volume/ controls on the right side of the cable... I’m currently on the stair machine and it is hitting my cheek, with each step.

The first product I had would short out when I would move. Exchanged it- no questions asked. Thank you.

The current replacement I am using still shorts on occasion (I’ve cleaned the connectors). And the red and blue indicator lights seem to have a mind of their own- lights are sometimes “on” when the power is turned off. And vice versa.

For exercise, the product is not good. At all. There seriously is no good position to clip the battery and not have the controller hit your face. And if you position it behind your head, the controller still hits your neck when you move.

This would be a great product if the user sat still and held their breath.

For the quality that the shure is known for, this component is aweful."
2041,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Like many of you, I heard of Shure's sound quality and wanted to own a pair of their earphones. After becoming an owner of the SE215s I was very happy with the purchase until I recently ran into a sealing problem with the foam eartips. I tried cleaning them, but the problem was so bad the earphones continued to leak environment sound and fall from my ears. I reached out to the company and I was directed to buy more accessories from Amazon, then hung up on. With Shure's reputation I expected better customer service, so now instead of buying new eartips I'll be buying new earphones from a company that cares for it's customer's satisfaction."
2042,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned these for about a month, having bought them at one of the audio stores at an airport. After replacing the silicone tips with comply foam tips, the quality of sound and true isolation was fantastic. Nice detailed bass, transparent highs and nice balanced miss. Awesome job for buds that can be had for around $100. They rival the UE triple-fi's that I paid almost $400 for a few years back.

Bluetooth connection - don't get too far from the source, and don't have more than one active Bluetooth connection to your phone or you might have dropouts.

Mic/voice quality... Meh. According to people that I've talked with while using this device, it's a bit boxy sounding, focusing on vocal midrange as opposed to having a rich deep sound. I've played with mic positioning as well-not much difference in quality.

So what you're getting with this is well balanced audio, provided the tips provide a good seal. Silicon tips don't work for me - I only use Comply Foam tips - I'm also a pro bass player and struggled until I found the Comply solution.

Bluetooth can work well if within ten or so feet of the source and no other conflicting BT apps are concurrently running.

Mic vocal quality is ""adequate"".

For $100, this is a no-brainer..."
2043,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They produce good audio and are generally fairly comfortable. However, beyond the technical, they are poorly designed. I've had past earbuds at this level from Shure and they consistently have the same problem. Because of the way they fit on the ear, the wire ends up losing a contact somewhere. In the older models, this meant a brand new replacement. On these versions, you can separate the buds from the wire, which tells me the company figured out it was a common problem on the old ones. However, what this now means is that the wire will break every 4-5 months and you'll have to replace that. If you're under warranty, great. However, eventually that ends. I don't want to own a pair of headphones where I have to replace the cable and pay $20 every 4-5 months. I've liked them through ownership but the fact that they can't figure out how to make the wire more resilient is a fatal flaw that the company needs to address. With that, I'm done with Shure products."
2044,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these phones to replace an older pair of Shure sound isolating phones I bought several years ago and loved. This set is probably NOT going to work for most people so I would NOT recommend them (I will be returning them).
First, the plug DOES NOT fit in the jack of an Iphone if you have a case on it - you must REMOVE the Iphone from the case to plug them in which is very annoying.
Second, the plugs themselves are difficult to fit into your ear and the cord section right next to the plugs is very stiff which causes the phones to come out of your ears over and over again. The best way to get them to stay in place is to wrap the cord over the top of your ears after inserting the phones and that isn't practical for many people and thus shortens the overall cord length making it inconvenient.
Lastly, the phones themselves spin at the entry point into the ear ALSO causing them to come out of your ear if you move the cord.
All in all, VERY DISAPPOINTING product. The sounds quality is ok but the other factors - can't plug into Iphone if it has a case, and dont stay in your ears outweigh the usefulness."
2045,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for these but now that I've tried them I'm shocked by all the good reviews. First off the bass is almost non existent, even with my galaxy phone's custom eq bass all the way up its marginal. I was hoping they would stay in place well, I like to use noise isolating headphones while working in my shop using noisy tools, but they fall out easily and don't isolate all that well either. The sound is really sad for this much money. They do look nice, the cord looks heavy duty. I was using Plugfones ear plugs which surprisingly sound better than these but they also keep falling out of my ears. I think these are the worst sounding earphones I have owned."
2046,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound ok, but they are a very poorly designed set of earphones. The cord makes a lot of noise, when it rubs agaisnt my clothing and at the table. They don't feel great inside my ears and it is very uncomfortable to wear then on the go. I also must say that the cord is unnecessarily long. I am 6 feet 3 and there is too much cord hanging when I stand up. I also tried then for a quick run and hated the experience!
I really wantes shure phones, but I am already searching for another brand."
2047,5.0 out of 5 stars,"EDIT:
The headphones sound amazing. Noise isolation is stellar and I think these are great headphones. The headphones came when expected. Packaging was fine and the box was not damaged at all. But when I plugged in the headphones to my iPad, the sound was funny> It was unbalanced, with more sound output from the right side than the left. I thought maybe it was a connection error, so I tried them on my PC at home and they were buggy with that as well. I do like the memory foam ear tips that are given, they do provide a perfect seal with your ear, (just make sure your ears are clean lol). The quality of the items is probably the only reason why I gave it 2 stars. I think I might have just gotten a bad pair since so many people have given this good reviews. I even bought it after it was recommended on a website as a best buy under $100. Hopefully my return goes smoothly. Might go for the Bose Soundtrue headphones, those were recommended too."

2050,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Considering I've had these for roughly 5 years I definitely owe them a solid review. These were my first real audio investment as a kid, which honestly started an addiction. The buds have been everywhere with me and have always been my go to. For reference I own 7 headphones ranging from $100 (these) to $900usd, including a $3000+ klipsch surround setup from their RP lineup. These easily hit above their class and it amazes me now that they go for $100 (bought them for $200). They have a very bright, happy sound and everything is pure, especially in the mids. They don't slap incredibly with bass heavy stuff, but they'll leave you with a smile, especially if you're a beats user. Of course there are negatives. For example the cables. With daily use and abuse you can burn through them within 6-8 months. But it's not so bad, they are replaceable for a reason and it takes 30 seconds to attach the new ones. I haven't had problems with the connections yet and I recently compared my buds to a pair with about 5 hours on them. Couldn't tell which pair was which unless I looked at them! Ohh and the visuals... the Shure branding will rub off with time and give them that ratty type look, but I don't mind it one bit. Honestly the branding on it just screams ""steal me."" It's like seeing a pair of raybands with that iconic name. I intentionally scrapped the branding off it after a year and now just the inner ""SE215"" remains. If you're stuck between earbuds and full headphones I would recommend the buds (these). They're going to be more cost effective and sound better. I can comfortably say they compete with $300 over-ear headphones. Hooking these up to a tube amp makes them very bright also, which is interesting. Comfort is obviously good - light weight and comfy foam eartips."
2051,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently purchased these earbuds, although good, was expecting better !! My go to earbuds are Klipsch Image S4 so I did a few sound and usage comparison tests (I had previously owned a pair of Shure E3's - great treble and midrange, best sound isolation, but no bass and poor durability).

Pros
1. Very good mids and trebles (but not as much as the E3c's)
2. Sound stage was very good and 'up front'
3. Very good sensitivity
4. Lively sounding

Cons:
1. Very clunky to plug in to your ears and for me not the most comforable (not the best for extended sessions)
2. The 3.5mm plug is a bit bulkly
3. Not as good as the Klipsch in terms of expressing sound subtility / timber / musicality
4. Very average in terms of sound isolation (will have to experiment with the different buds)

I've come to the opinion that Shure rellies on their mid/treble capabilities (bass is now better than previously) rather than on ability to bring out subtle parts of the music and general musicality.

[UPDATE]; After trying out different different inserts I ended up switching from medium foam to large foam inserts. This lead to much better sound isolation and sound quality. The delta in sound quality with the Klipsch was significantly reduced but not completely. Comfort also improved a little. (Also tried the large non-foam inserts but were not as good for me)"
2052,2.0 out of 5 stars,way too complicated to put on..wire and ear piece a nuisance
2053,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these because they allow me to use a set of my mid quality IEM's (215's) wirelessly. They generally get the job done, but there are some issues.

When I use these with my Macbook, the audio skips every 3 or so seconds. Very frustrating. I basically can't use them wirelessly with my Macbook which is one of the main reasons I got this device. I'm back to using wired on the computer.

It works flawlessly on my iPhone X which is definitely nice. Walking around without cords is a game changer, especially with better quality sound than most of the wireless buds you'll find at Best Buy or the like.

I don't like the big battery unit in the middle of the cord. I wish the battery and the mic were housed in one single piece of plastic. I can't really find a perfect position or setup to have these exactly where I want them because the battery is in a sort of frustrating location.

I get a lot of complaints about the microphone. When using my OEM Apple earbuds, I've never had anyone complain about not being able to hear me. But if I talk on the phone with these wireless ones, I get a lot of ""I can't hear you very well"" complaints. I'm usually relegated to actually holding the mic up to my mouth while talking through the BT1's mic.

Overall for me this has become the perfect ""listen to music while on the subway through my phone"" device or any situation where I'm just going to be listening to music or a podcast through my phone. Otherwise there are too many frustrations to use these as much as I'd actually like to (talking on the phone, listening through my Macbook)"
2054,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I was expecting
2055,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these through an online music store and not through Amazon. I've had them for two and a half months. I sent them back twice already. Once the blue light stayed on constantly and drained the battery and the second time they would not charge. So now, they will not charge at all again! When they did work, I would get occasional dropouts, usually about after 30 min of listening. It seems when you get static noise.....beware....that's when I would start having problems with them. They do not sound as good as the wired SE215 even though the use the same drivers. So, now I have to send them back for a third time. Now, Shure has been quick in replacing them when I sent them in for repair. But, if I was Shure, I would be ashamed of having my name on these. Don't get these! They will be a nightmare to use....that's when they are actually working."
2056,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It is no doubt that Shure produces the affordable headphone with excellent sound. I am always the big fan of Shure SE215. It provides the excellent output of the base with the detailed quality of the sounds. I was super excited when Shure finally introduces the market with their wireless headphone and I made the purchase without much of the consideration. But my nightmare begins.
Of course, SE215 is still providing its excellent quality of sound. But what makes it is a terrible product cause of the tag design. I guess Shure has no idea how to put the battery to the headphone, so they have to make the tag like design to put the battery. But it is heavy and it swings with body motion. So it is extremely terrible when wearing it in the gym. The tag swings with body motion and attaches to a side of the body after the slide. This makes me want to give up the product and back to Bose family.
One more thing, they do not how to calibrate the connectivity. When you are in a busy public area, the headphone is always get distorted. I never experience any of this with my bose SoundSport wireless.
The connectivity issue and the stupid tag design are totally ruined this excellent headphone!"
2057,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Within the past few weeks, I purchased a pair of Bose QC3 on-ear headphones. Next, I sent an older pair of Shure headphones in for repair and for a fee, they were replaced with the Shure SE-215 model. Finally, I've received a pair of the Panasonic RP-HJX5-R headphones for review purposes. While they're all different in a number of ways, they are all very nice sounding headphones. I thought I'd compare the three models.

The challengers:

Bose QC3:

These headphones were recently discontinued in favor of the Bose QC25 headphones. They feature an on-ear design rather than an over-the-ear design like the QC25s or the in ear design of the Shure or Panasonic headphones. These are powered headphones using a proprietary battery. And with this particular model, if the battery dies, the music stops. Fortunately, newer Bose headphones apparently don't have this issue, that is, you can listen to them even with a dead battery. Fortunately, the batteries last a very long time and extra batteries can be obtained at a nominal cost.

These Bose headphone are pretty comfortable. Their ear pieces are apparently made from memory form and because they sit on your ears, they don't get as warm as the over-the-ear models. They are obviously much larger than in-ear headphones, so they'll take up more space in your carry-on bag.

Despite all of this, I probably enjoyed the sound of the Bose headphones the most. I'm not sure that they're the most natural, but they simply sound really good. Price is an obvious consideration, as Bose headphones can run $300 and up easily. These headphones have an electronic noise-reduction circuitry, and while it's imperfect, it will come in handy in noisy environments.

Shure SE-215:

The Shure SE-215 headphones may be the most neutral of the 3 headphones tested. They have a very pleasant, natural and ""effortless"" sound that is highly appealing. While I probably enjoyed the Bose headphones a bit more, I suspect that the Shure headphones are probably the most accurate.

This is an in-ear design with a somewhat awkward fitment which could require a bit of work to properly seat them in your ears. However, once properly seated, the sound is outstanding. Shure provides a nice and very small carrying case with a cleaning tool and a large assortment of rubber and foam earpieces. Foam is recommended for most listeners, as they seem to the the most comfortable and will expand and mold to the listener's ear canal.

Speaking of comfort, I found the Shure headphones to be less comfortable than the Bose headphones and probably the least comfortable of the 3. It's not that they're uncomfortable, but it's hard to forget that they're there. While I don't think the SE-215's are advertised as noise cancelling or noise reducing headphones, noise reduction is likely the best of the three, simply because the tight foam earpiece's seal tends to block out most outside noise. These are really outstanding headphones at a price that I consider to be very reasonable. However, as mentioned, unusual fitment can create a problem getting these headphones fitted just right.

Panasonic RP-HJX5-R:

These are far and away the least expensive of the 3 headphones reviewed. You could possibly buy 10 of these Panasonics for what one pair of Bose headphones cost. While the sound is impressive and well balanced, I found the mid-range vocals to lack presence and the highs to be slightly exaggerated and shrill.

But before I scare you off, I'm nitpicking because the reality is that they sound quite good. I listed to the same track over and over while switching from one headphone to the next to the next, and all 3 were excellent.

Fitment is simple. 3 rubber earpieces (no foam pieces) are provided, along with a tiny velveteen case. Of the 3 headphones discussed, these are the easiest to carry around. Neither these headphones nor the Shure SE-215s require batteries, so that's a definite convenience.

The Verdict:

As noted, I enjoyed the Bose headphones the most. But they're very expensive, relatively large, and some may consider the fact that it has to be used with a battery as a drawback. I rank these headphones #1 in performance, #2 in sound reduction and #3 in value.

The Shure headphones are also excellent, but the fitment is funky. I rank these #2 in performance, #1 in sound reduction and #2 in value.

Panasonic RP-HJX5-R headphones have outstanding sound and are a steal at the current price. While the sound isn't quite up to that of the Bose or Shure headphones respectively, it's awfully close. I rank these a tight #3 in performance, #3 in sound reduction and #1 in value.

All 3 headphones are outstanding and all 3 carry a 5 star recommendation. As a side note, I purchased the Bose headphones used in ""like new"" condition, so certainly that's an option for anyone who doesn't want to drop hundreds of dollars on the Bose headphones. And for those on a budget, the Panasonic RP-HJX5-R headphones are very close in sonic quality to the others and far easier on the wallet."
2058,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been using Westone UM Pro10s, but they kept failing under warranty. For that reason, I was given special permission to return them to the retailer in exchange for another brand, and I chose the Shure SE215s.

The first thing I noticed is that the default earpads were unusually big. It took some wrangling, but I eventually got them off and replaced them with smaller ones. That helped quite a bit, but the monitors themselves aren't nearly as ergonomic as the Westones. The Westones felt as if they were molded to the curvatures of my ears, and could be popped in and out in a second. The Shures, on the other hand, seem bulkier and don't sit well. I really have to cram them into my ears to get them to stay, and even then they occasionally twist themselves out of a tight seal. I never once had that problem with the Westones.

The wires coming from the Westones are light and flexible, allowing you to quickly rest them behind your ears. But the wires coming from the Shures are rigid, and therefore not friendly to people who wear glasses. Even though they can be bent somewhat like a coat hanger, I can't inconspicuously tuck them behind my ears, and sometimes they'll even swivel themselves away from my ears under their own weight.

I have no complaints as far as the clarity of the audio is concerned, but the Shures sounded significantly brighter than the Westones... almost bordering on unpleasant. But they also put out more low end than the Westones. Personally, I prefer the flatter response of the Westones.

I ended up re-purchasing a pair of Westone UM Pro10s, and now I use the SE215's only as a backup when my Westones are away for warranty repair.

POSITIVES:
* Cost $50 less
* Slightly longer cord (allows drummers to clip their headphone amp to their trap case)
* Brighter and deeper response (if that's what you prefer)
* Two-year warranty & lightning-fast warranty replacement service
* Apparently longer-lasting

NEGATIVES:
* Clunky - don't fit as well
* Wiring is too rigid to make inconspicuous
* Sound is a little too brilliant for my taste

UPDATE: After about 1 1/2 years, one of the ear monitors died on a gig. I sent it in to Shure for warranty repair, and they mailed out a replacement extremely quickly."
2059,3.0 out of 5 stars,"When it comes to earphones I weight comfort, fit, and durability much higher than normal headphones. They're simply far more important because earphones can have a direct impact on the health of your ears. Because of that, the 215s get 3 stars.

Sound:
The sound quality is good for the price. Not amazing, but its better than most headphones at the same price point.

Ergonomics:
They're pretty bad. The wires join too high and too close to your chin, and as a result they pull on the earpieces. The wires also have 2 inch-long reinforced segments that you can mould around your earlobe. The problem is that they're too short and that makes it easier for these segments to be pulled out from behind your earlobe. You have to constantly adjust your phones to make sure they're seated properly behind your lobes.

Shure includes some foam tips that imitate Comply tips but they aren't as comfortable and breathable. The sizing of these tips is poor as there's very little size difference between the small and medium tips but the large tips are almost 40% larger than the medium tips. My ear canals are right smack-dab in that range that is just barely too large for the medium tips and too small for the large tips. As a result, I'm stuck between having to shove the tips in my ear farther than they should be going and dealing with the additional pressure on my concha or i have to use a tip that's too large and deal with the discomfort of the pressure on my ear canal. I thought I could expect better ergonomics from Shure, but I guess at this price, they couldn't care less.

Durability:
I haven't had them for a long time but they seem pretty durable. However, speaking with expertise as a product designer, I predict that the bad ergonomics will wear out the components faster than if Shure had been more generous with the length of the cable. Since the cable itself is modular I'm sure that Shure could offer a better cable but i doubt they'd do it since their consumer earphone line is probably not their most lucrative division."
2060,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Until now, I had given up on Bluetooth as a legitimate audiophile’s wireless headphone. Hiss, echo, crackles, and connectivity failures eliminated the purchase of any Bluetooth headset.

Then a salesman at B & H in NYC alerted me to this Shure Bluetooth connection line. Same price as here. My beloved headphones could be wireless...could that be true?

Phenomenal! Clear, crisp delicious sound. You can still here the bassist’s fingers plucking the bass in an acoustic jazz trio. Definition is intact at all levels.

Highly recommended to owners of high-end in-ear Shure cans, like the 535’s. Don’t hesitate to consider this patch line to give wireless life to your in-ear headphones.

5 stars."
2061,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these back in May 2014 because I had just got a drum set and I didn't like using headphones while I played(made my ears extremely sweaty). Once I found out that drummers praised these I pulled the trigger and bought them at guitar center. I will admit It take awhile to figure out how to wear these earphones due to the design and I will admit I was ready return them, but I was able figure it out. Comfort is typical of IEM's which in my opinion is satisfactory. When I'm out and about with these they do start to feel uncomfortable about an hour into wearing, but thats just my opinion. I mainly use these when play the drums and these are comfortable for that. Now the sound is fairly balanced. The highs are rolled so don't expect a sparkly treble, but the highs are good. The mids are nice and smooth and the bass is nice and tight. The bass is definitely thick, but it doesn't muffle the mids or highs. Now would I recommend these? Yes if you're a drummer, now if you're a regular person I wouldn't because the design is a bit awkward. For on the go listening I would suggest the Bose sound true Ultra, V-Moda ZN, or if you want an earbud design the bose soundsport would be great too. For the fellow drummer these are perfect."
2062,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the SE210's in the past, so I just assumed I'd be getting the same thing with maybe better clarity or frequency isolation or something. I'm not an audiophile, but I am a physicist. So I use the wrong words, but I know it's very difficult to drive 10Hz-20kHz off of one tiny driver. There's always room for improvement.

Shure may have improved things, but they also significantly changed the frequency response. The bass end isn't flat. It goes up significantly. This is basically Shure caving to the Beats phenomenon, where style and loud bass matter more than overall quality.

Granted, the result isn't as terrible as it could be. But I found that the driver couldn't handle mids and highs while the bass had a significant beat. Things get muffled fast.

Not to mention my personal issues with bass. I needed office earphones. The problem is that the bass is too punctuating to me, and I couldn't focus on my work.

So, when the reviews say ""a little bass boost, but not a bassist's earphone,"" that really means there is quite a noticeable bass boost, but at least it's not the only thing you can hear. I don't like significantly altering the sound from how it was mastered, and I don't like the overwhelming bass and mid/high muddiness. Others probably love the boosted bass and focus less on the mids and highs.

Just be aware, and try and check out the frequency response curve to see what I'm talking about."
2063,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Although without a doubt these earphones sound great, they are not however ideal for working out. Sure you can find the best fit so the earbuds stay snug and fixed in your ear, but they are very sensitive to water or sweat. I primarily used mine for running, but these aren't meant for that. Shure customer service claims that they can withstand heavy sweat based on the fact that a lot of musicians used them on stage, but I've gone through 3 pairs because the detachable earbuds get corroded over time. In spite of disconnecting the earbuds from the detachable cables to let the earphones air out, my earphones still became corroded over time. These earphones barely lasted me a 9 months. Never again would I invest money on Shure headphones. I would recommend looking at other brands that would be good for every condition.

If I were looking for workout earbuds, I would concentrate more on the Bose Soundsport or Jaybirds which is what I'm considering now."

2067,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My seven year old Shure EC2s were showing their age...and I bought them back when they were *way* more expensive than they were when they were discontinued. I called Shure, direct, for some replacement tips and asked what is the current replacement for the EC2s and they told me about the SE215s. So, even though my old E2Cs still work fine, I gambled on their advice and purchased the new SE215s. My summary of them follows, in no particular order:

1. Sound. In the end all you judge a set of monitors (headphones, buds, etc.) by. They sound as good as the EC2s and that is a serious compliment. Definitely more punchy bass....very evident first time I fired them up. Soundstage is balanced, highs are good, albeit a little less crisp than I'd prefer, but I'm a serious treble freak anyway. Not in the universe with today's monitors geared towards *extreme* bass, which is a compliment by me. Very, very good...a worthy successor to the EC2s in sound quality and imaging.

2. Build quality. They're slightly smaller than past Shure in-ears, which is good. Come standard with the medium, foam inserts. Monumental pain removing these, initially. TIP: Don't try to twist them...get a fingernail under the bottom of the tip barrel and carefully (and with MUCHO force) work them off the main body sleeve. Genuinely, I thought I was breaking them and sending them back they were on that hard. Be forewarned if you don't like the standards tips...after getting them off, all subsequent changes were slick and easy.

3. Cord. Nicer in a way, pain in another major way. Larger cord than prior models, super, super tough. Replaceable too! How cool is that! You *never* see replaceable cords in sub $200 kit, ever. Course, they're also even tougher to remove than the tips, so, again, that's weird. They couldn't, at this price point, make them screw-in; they're snap-in.

4. Fit. Here's where it gets dicey. If these are your first 'in ear canal' monitors, you have a learning curve. Everyone has different ear geometry, so, at first, it's always a crap shoot inserting 'in ears'. The seal has to be perfect and you have to experiment with the various tips to get it *just right*. In my case, I've used Shure's for years, so I've got it down to a science. Even knowing that, these were a bear getting right the first time. Why? Remember those 'larger' cords? They have a moldable, approximately 3-4 inch section that allows the phone's cord to be molded back around your ear (you do know these are 'behind the ear' cord fit, right?) and, until you get used to it, it's a pain. I had to *unlearn* years of fitting to get these things just right.

That said, when you get them in right and crank on the music source, they're very, very good. Again, as good as prior Shure models and at a price point at least 50% less. There are some compromises made (no screw-in cables), cheaper tips than prior models, lack of a rewind spool in the storage case (prior models had them).

But at this price point, who cares? They work fine and are inexpensive enough that you don't baby them like a set of $500 in ear monitors.

But be warned: You will have to take time to:

a) find the right tip that fits your ear's geometry

b) learn to insert and get the cords just right behind your ear

c) learn how to take off tips occasionally and clean them

Great bargain at this price point."
2068,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the se215!

I recently bought the symphonized nrg 2.0 for the times when I don't want to deal with my full size headphones. I loved how they sounded, and decided I wanted a more upscale in ear monitor, hence the purchase of the se215. I'm so glad I took the plunge with them. as much as I loved the nrg, the 215 is just in a different league in terms of sound quality.

the 215 is built well. I love the detachable cables, that's a very useful feature if you're rough on your headphones. the overall feeling I get from the 215 is one of quality and durability.

sound quality:

overall sound signature - neutral to slightly warm, with good, but not deep bass impact. balanced comes to mind, though it's far overused in regards to sound signatures. but I'm at a loss so that's what you get!

bass - decent. I wouldn't call these bass monsters at all. but they offer an acceptable level of bass impact for my ears. my nrg in ear hit harder, but with less detail and more boom. the 215 has far more bass quality, vs the nrg bass quantity. I don't like thunderous bass so I prefer the 215 bass.

mids - perfectly mixed with the overall sound signature. the mids are neither recessed or forward, blending wonderfully with the rest of the frequencies. I usually like a mid centric sound signature but not for in ears for some reason. the mids are warm and very well detailed. vocals are great on the 215. there is grain, in my opinion, but it sounds good. I really cant complain for the price.

highs - smooth smooth smooth, yet not rolled off or sibilant. some of the best highs I've heard in a headphone, period. there's just something about the highs on the 215 that I love. they're not the most detailed of all my headphones, nor the smoothest. but I just love them nonetheless. the only other headphone that has highs I like ALMOST as much are my top tier mrspeakers alpha prime. I'm not saying the highs on the 215 are literally as good, they're not. but I just prefer them anyways, they just engage me the most.

soundstage - ok. I have yet to hear an in ear that has a big soundstage like you get with full size headphones. and since I listen to full size headphones for 5-8 hours a day, it's tough to adjust to the in ears when I'm using them. I cant offer more here, sorry. I'm just not that used to in ear models as much.

power requirements - low. in my opinion you don't need an amp. I used the 215 with my lg g4, my wife's iphone 6, and with/without a fiio e12 amp and off brand dac dongle. all I can say is the source had far more impact on the sound than the amp/dac. going from the poor sounding lg g4 to the iphone 6 had a much bigger impact (improvement) on sound quality vs adding the dac/amp to the lg g4. and when adding the amp to the iphone 6, all I really noticed was more headroom. so I'd say an amp is not needed.

comfort - excellent. I have zero issues getting a good seal with the supplied ear tips. no complaints here.

overall I'm really loving my se215. it's a clear step up in sound quality and refinement over the nrg 2.0. I find myself grabbing the 215 far more than my nrg, to the point I might gift the nrg to my cousin. maybe..."
2069,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these near the end of 2016. I was between these and Sennheiser's in-ear Momentums. As a budding audiophile, I love these headphones! As far as noise isolation goes, you are completely covered. Whether you are on a loud plane or commute, or simply walking around campus, these puppies got your back. While these headphones aren't conventionally ""pretty,"" the true beauty of these headphones lies in the sound. If you are like me and you listen mostly to Rock, Blues, Jazz, and Folk, then these headphones are what you are looking for. The mids and highs are definitely there, but let me tell you, the lows are out of this world.

My main over-the-ear headphones are the Sennheiser HD 598s and even though I like the over-all sound of those a bit better -- because of the type of music I listen to -- I really enjoy listening with the Shure's because they have their own distinct sound profile. I use a Fiio e10k DAC/AMP while at home and the Sennheiser's dramatically benefit from it, but the low impedance of the Shure SE215-K makes for a great listening experience even without an external DAC or amp. These are perfect for listening to music on-the-go from your favorite Apple or Android device and decent enough that they pair well with my MacBook Pro (late 2013 model). I have the version without the in-line controls, so I can't speak on that matter.

The only negative to buying a pair like this is that, for another $100 you could get something like the RHA T10i IEMs. Not that it detracts anything from the Shure SE215-K, but just something to consider in the long run. I also had to make a similar decision and I personally chose the Shure, because they are the best ""bang for your buck"" as far as pure audio goes. Be warned however, that some people, including myself, experience some ear discomfort after wearing these for a prolonged period of time (after about 3 hours of use), but it is not insufferable.

Overall, these are pretty cool headphones to experience for yourself, even though they might get a bit uncomfortable at times. At this price range, I recommend these IEMs 100%."
2070,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome headphone. I would recommend them to anyone who wants in ear headphones. I have had wireless buds for a while now. While I like Beats Power beats along with the Bose entry in ear buds. I feel the sure SE215 delivers the best all round sound and comfort for the money. The bass is very deep and rich and the highs are good yet could be higher. Noise cancelation can be adjusted by the type of plugs you use with them. I personally enjoy using the Medium foam plugs for the commute on NYC subways. When working out with these headsets it does feel like you are transported into your living room with the stereo blasting. Battery life is fantastic. The 6 plus hours on a charge is a great thing. Power Beats headphones usually last about 3 hours and for how I use that that sometimes does not make it to the days end. I would recommend these to anyone who enjoys their music and want to be free and mobile.
2071,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for just under a week and have to say that these are absolutely amazing. I was travelling and forgot to pack my Bose noise cancelling headphones for the flight - which truthfully are way too bulky anyway. I came across these at the airport of all places and am so glad that the sales rep recommended these above all others (value for price - I didn't want to spend too much considering I already had pricey ones at home). It was actually the fit that sold me on these (I was given a disposable sample to try out first). You would think these are not comfortable but they are, there is a bit of wearing in period (for me my right ear canal only) but after a couple days I was used to them or they had adapted - in fact I fell asleep with them on for an entire night and didn't wake up with any issues. There is a process to wearing them but after figuring it out, it gets incredibly easy and the over the ear wire eventually molds to the shape of your ear (this was something the rep had told me about and I have found this to be the case). I've worn these to work out and they never moved at all unlike every other in ear model I have used in the past (I normally use Beats Tours for workouts). Bottom line, I did not hear a single thing other than my music while flying, so objective accomplished. Says something that I've been using these over my other (much more expensive in the case of the Bose) headphones."
2072,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very happy with these. My SCL2 series cord actually cracked and I sent them in to get serviced. Long story short, I received these pairs from Shure. I am so happy with these. The buds that come with these are much better than the ones with the SCL2. I am using the expanding foam ones. The first time I used them, they expanded and blocked out the noise. What this meant was much better Bass and clarity. I am a drummer, so using these was incredible. The sound is really clear. As I drum, I hear minimal sounds from the kit and more from the monitors.

I recommend these for musicians. One reviewer said that it was a bad thing that they isolated the sound around you. That means they are doing their job. If you want earphones that bleed the outside noise, then, buy cheaper models, or use the buds that don't use the expansion foam.

I would've given these 5 stars, but the only thing I am skeptical with is that the cord close to the ear buds are very stiff and you have to bend them to conform around your ear and back of your head. I just think that eventually, these too will begin to crack, but we'll see. Maybe that is why they designed them to bend is so that it protects it from cracking. But, that will be determined in the future.

I recommend these monitors for musicians and as a drummer, I can tell you, these work very, very well. Recording or live performances. I use them in both scenarios and they work incredible."
2073,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's interesting to read the reviews of this product. While the SE215 perform better acoustically than cheaper ear buds, it's not a very high bar to to surpass to be honest. Simply due to the physical limitations involved in making an acoustic device this size, most modestly priced ear buds sound absolutely horrible. So using ear buds as a benchmark, the SE215 sound better than average, but not better than a cheap pair of full headphones. I have a $20 pair of Philips headphones that completely destroy the SE215 acoustically. They have a more extended and balanced sound stage. And I can pop them on in 2 seconds, not the 30 seconds it takes to fit the Shures.

So, I'm not a huge fan of ear buds for critical listening. I purchased these to use as in-ear monitors in my band - a utilitarian purpose to which they perform reasonably well, but that's where my use of them begins and ends. Compared to modestly priced headphones, they just can't compete sonically. I wonder how many people who gush over the sound quality have ever tried a good budget pair of headphones at a fifth of the price. I guess many who rate these so highly don't know how sonically superior a half-decent set of headphones can sound.

Ultimately, they provide sufficient audio quality for casual listening, and enough isolation to do a pretty good job as IEMs. But they are a long way away from what I would consider high fidelity sound. And as a set of earphones for casual listening, they are a real hassle to fit."
2074,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the perfect headphones. They have ""memory wire"" and so can fit snugly on your ear while you are jogging. They feature a replaceable cord (replacements are a bit expensive at like $30, but still, a very nice feature). They sound great. They are perfect.

I've used a number of earphones over the years. These sound better than the Etymotic MC5's to me. At least they are more tremendous while still giving good detail. And they fit better, have better ergonomics. The other are the Meelectronics M6 sport. Those are significantly more affordable, at around $20, but they don't sound nearly as good.

Don't bother with other headphones, which fall out of your ears, have their cords get frayed, etc. Just buy one pair of these, and be set FOR LIFE."
2075,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my 225's for years. I'm still completely satisfied with them. I've actually owned several SE models, including a pair in the 400 range (my dog ate them and I couldn't afford a new set... So I bought some newer 225's). These are phenomenal headphones. Sound quality is brilliant, I still hear things in songs I've been listening to for years that I never noticed before. Well balanced signature, and crisp clean sound makes any music genre pop in these. The over ear design takes a little getting used to, but once you get it, they feel very natural and secure. I find them very comfortable for long listening sessions.
I use these on long plane rides, and while they are not noise cancelling they do isolate well enough for me to drown out the plane easily. As I said before, I've had them for years. Durability has definitely been a surprise as their previous models had issues with wires shorting. While I would love to be writing a review of the 500 series, these have been making me a happy listener for so long I had to review them."
2076,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an updated review which reflects additional experience and adversity with these headphones. Initially, I was unable to establish a tight seal with my ear canals when placed in the prescribed orientation. This resulted in the base and overall sound quality being compromised substantially. After a few days, I decided to approach the seal issue by replacing the medium-size memory foam pads installed by the manufacturer with the large size included with the unit. I soon discovered that it is not possible to remove the pads by following the instructions provided in the manual. They will not rotate or comply in any manner with attempts to dislodge them. I was certain that if I applied any additional force that the nozzles would snap off. After a great deal of effort, I was finally able to remove them by stretching, pulling and deforming with a surgical hemostat. Of course, the pads were destroyed in the process. I then installed the large set of memory foam ear pads and the problem was solved. The sound is considerably richer, but not a great leap beyond the quality of my less expensive Sennheiser buds. The wires around the tops of the ears are a nuisance and do little to stabilize the earphones. I am definitely not looking forward to the next time that I have to replace the pads."
2077,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In short, these are amazing for under $100.

I'm not really an audiophile, but I did a lot of research on IEMs (earbuds that sit deep in the ear), and I thoroughly tested a few of my finalists. So, in this review I'm going to compare the Shure SE215's ($99), Shure SE425's ($299), and Etymotic Research ER-4PT's ($299). My main selection criteria were comfort, sound quality, and ability to block out outside noise (note that for this reason I first tried the Bose QuietComfort 20i's, but the active noise canceling pressure made my ears hurt).

SHORT SUMMARY: I easily recommend the SE215's in terms of price-performance; but, if you have more to spend then get the SE425's. The ER-4PT's are very crisp, but they have some significant physical downsides.

LONGER REVIEW:

First of all, I hear that it's important to choose headphones based on the kind of music that you listen to. So, for my tests, I used ten songs representing my favorite genres of EDM (house/trance), synthpop, and pop rock. Songs included Instant Crush (Daft Punk), Good Morning Kaia (BT), Crush (Dave Matthews Band), and A Sky Full of Stars (Coldplay).

Overall, the SE215's are excellent, especially for the price. When switching back and forth between them and the 425's, I could notice a clear difference, but not necessarily a $200 difference. If $200 isn't a huge deal to you, definitely get the 425's; but, I think you'd have to be a very discerning listener to really appreciate the increase in quality.

So what's better about them? Everything is clearer. After listening to the 425's, the 215's feel almost like a light blanket was thrown over the speaker -- everything is just a little muddier and the individual instruments are less clear. There's less separation between the layers. But again, this wasn't a dramatic difference, so you'd still be very safe with the 215's (and I understand that $300 is an insane amount of money for most people to spend on earbuds).

What about the ER-4PT's? They were even clearer, but almost clinically so. It felt a bit like I was in a perfectly empty room listening to every little nuance of the sound, but that sound was less warm than that of the Shures. To be honest, though, this difference was minimal -- in most cases, there wasn't a hugely noticeable difference between the ER-4PT's and the SE425's. I most preferred the Etymotics in songs involving crisp cymbals and complex background noises; but again, it wasn't a huge difference, and overall I slightly preferred the warmer bass of the Shures.

More importantly, I found two dealbreakers that meant I couldn't keep the Etymotics: (1) That crisp clarity of sound sadly translated to the wire as well; every time I moved my head I could powerfully feel/hear the wire moving, to the point that it was quite distracting. I believe that this is called microphonics. (2) The plastic piece connecting the wire going to each ear was surprisingly heavy, to the point that its weight very quickly became annoying compared to the other earbuds.

The other nice thing about the Shures is how easily they slip into your ears. Fair warning that it took me a while to figure out how to get them in right -- I was about to return them because it was so confusing at first, but I watched a youtube video and realized you have to actually significantly bend the rubbery part. Once you get the hang of it, it's extremely fast and easy to fit them in compared to the Etymotics that I really had to work in every time while holding my ear open with my other hand.

So, like I said, I recommend either one of the Shures depending on how much money you can spare on headphones. One other tip, by the way: Be very careful about trying all the different types of tips that are included. I noticed a dramatic difference when I finally found the right set that made a truly tight seal in my ear canal -- the bass became significantly stronger and the overall sound became tighter and cleaner.

Overall, I definitely recommend IEMs over regular earbuds (unless you're riding a bike or something that demands attention), but keep in mind that none of these will fully block out nearby voices on their own -- I needed to play white noise or music to achieve the true isolation I was looking for."
2078,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did a ton of research for a good set of IEM's. I own the bose and just felt something had to deliver the level of sound and accuracy I was looking for. I did stage sound for 10 years for some fairly notable bands and have an idea what music should sound like. I considered IEM's from $100 to $500. Of course, like anyone, if I could get what I wanted for the $100 mark then great. So I started with the Shure se215's.
Well I'm done looking. These are the best bargains on Amazon. I am an audophile and have worked in million dollar studios. These IEM's knock it out of the park.
Don't get me wrong.... there are certainly better ones out there , but not for $100. 90% of people out there don't require the level of accuracy you get from a $500 set of IEM's.
If you're not rich or have some sort of particular need stop looking and buy these.
Yes, give them some time to burn in (80 hours) but the rewards are fabulous.
I would have paid $500 if I though the return was worth it. No chance. These ROCK.
I listen to everything from Foo Fighters to Barbra Streisand, Eagles to David Grusin, Radio Head to Yanni. I set my EQ to flat and these perform magnificently."
2079,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After 3 years my first pair was stolen, now 3 years later, my second pair is still going strong. I cannot stress enough how crystal clear and BEAUTIFUL the audio is from these earphones. I've accidentally rolled over the cord with my office chair like 50-100 times and they just keep ticking. What a beautiful piece of hardware.
I've tested the much higher-end earphones and headphones from SHURE, beats, sony, bose .etc (the sales guys all got different brands for testing) and I keep coming back to the 215s... I've also convinced nearly our entire office of 30 staff to switch to these inexpensive monsters of audiophile beauty. I cannot stress enough how perfect these are, and how much they will change your frikkin' life.

Note: USE THE FOAM EARPHONES!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot stress this enough....
The silicon attachments may last longer, but the foam ones provide WAY MORE comfort and sound quality. Just a tip from someone coming from thousands of hours of experience."
2080,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These buds sound very good. Contrary to what some have said, they have good bass response once you get the right seal. They fit well and are easy to put on once you get used to doing it. As far as i can tell, they will never fall out during normal use.

I use them for in-ear monitors for performing and recording. The only fault i can find, and this is likely true of all in ear monitors, is that they seem to amplify the sound of your voice ""in your head"". This is likely due to the sound isolation, as you get the same effect if you simply plug your ears with your fingers. So that takes some getting used to. If you don't think you can deal with it your other option would be headphones. I'd recommend the Sony MDR-V6. They are totally transparent with no bass boost built in.

I would recommend these to musicians and audiophiles who want good sounding ear buds costing less than $100.

Update 5/26/14;
I found that selecting just the ""right"" tips can optimize these buds for different applications. For listening to music recordings, a tight fit maximizes bass response and isolation. For use as an in-ear monitor, it seems a slightly looser fit is desirable, allowing for somewhat less isolation and providing a more neutral sound with slightly less bass. It takes a bit of experimenting to find the right tips for each application..but the results are well worth the effort. For me, the best selection turned out to be the large rubber tips for listening to music and the medium rubber tips when i use them as monitors.

Hope this helps."
2081,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Having owned a pair of Shure's before (e2c, which I bought a while ago), one of the prime concerns I had about purchasing another IEM was the durability. Immediately upon opening the packaging (complete with carrying case) and taking a look at these, I could tell the SE215-K is a different beast from it's historical predecessors These feel miles ahead of the build quality of my e2cs, which have long been dead from wear (they lasted a good 2-3 years under moderate use). One idea I really like is the stiffer, protected plastic around the wire, which makes it a little harder to easily adjust the wires, but definitely makes the wires less able to wear and break, a common problem with thinner headphone wires at the joints.

The sound isolation is what you would expect from an IEM, essentially acting as an earplug. Obviously, people's ear canals are different, and as such these come with the requisite package of different-sized rubber inserts. However, there are now a softer, plushier foam ear inserts which expand, another great idea and something new to me. They feel very comfortable, and I've found I prefer them over the more-traditional rubber bullet-style inserts which are also included. I was able to find several good fits between the sizes included.

As for the sound, I have never been the biggest fan of IEMs for quiet listening (better to throw on a pair of over-the-ear headphones, etc.) but these do an admirable job with music on a train or while travelling. The bass is punchy, and the mids and highs are what I'd come to expect from a Shure IEM. At times, music clarity can be lacking compared to larger headphones, but the ease of driving these, the sound isolation, durability, and comfort

Ultimately, I wasn't blown away by the SE215s, but was impressed by some of the small changes and am happy they have fulfilled my expectations so far."
2082,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for my SE215, works as described .. Do note that it uses SBC codec over bluetooth, it doesnt support apt-x or apt-x hd. Given the fact that Shure got into the game late with BT, figure they would add apt-x hd but guess not. Nonetheless, sound quality is still excellent. Despite not having apt-x, it still sounds better than alot of the cheaper apt-x bluetooth headphones. Battery life is good so far, I mainly use these for the gym and single charge will last me about 4 workout sessions. Love how the shure fits over the head, gives it a nice secure fit while other cheaper BT headsets I got tends to fall out. Another nice feature is when you first turn on the headset, the voice will give you a estimated time remaining on the battery (ie. 2 hours, etc...). Took a star off due to it being a bit overpriced and lack of apt-x support but it makes up for it for still sounding great. Using this with Pixel XL on Oreo."
2083,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had these earbuds for a little under a year now, and the right ear bud went. I sent it back to Shure under warranty (which is 2 years) and they sent back a new piece in less than a week. That’s solid customer service, even though I was a little disappointed that it even happened.
In the week I was without these earbuds, wow did I miss them! They are the best earbuds I own, and all those cheap Skull Candy’s and the like are just not up to snuff of the big dogs like Shure. The sound is amazing, lots of power, a nice mix of treble and bass (at first I thought too bass heavy, but I have gotten over it over time) and most importantly they truly block out background noise. After the learning curve of trying to figure out how to put them in my ears quickly, I am now a pro and recommend these highly."
2084,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Following the death of an older pair of earphones and the purchase of the ""updated"" version (I.E. far worse), I decided it was time to upgrade. I've got a preference for open-ear headphones/earphones because of the improved sound stage they typically offer, but this time around, I was after something with a lot of noise isolation. People instantly suggested noise cancelling headphones and earphones, which made me laugh. Active cancellation is horrible. To the point, though. After two months of looking, I opted to pick up the SE-215s.

Out of the box, the fit wasn't great, but I expected this. Still, I listened to them for an hour with the stock ear-tips, so I can confirm something I've been seeing: without the right fit, these are not going to feel like they're worth $100. The noise isolation doesn't work very well, and the sound quality suffers. Get the right tips on them, and it's a different story.
After throwing on the biggest tips, things started looking up quickly. With very little volume from my tablet (A Nexus 7, which is their primary source), I couldn't hear anything around me at all. At half volume, a loud basketball game may as well have not been going on. Get the right tips, and the isolation WILL follow. In fact, I've seen people mention that you don't want to use these in places where you need to be able to hear some of what's going on around you, and they're right. The isolation is crazy.

Another point of these I've seen discussed is the fit. People keep mentioning the ""Shure fit."" This comes back down to the tips you have on your earphones. If you have the wrong tips, they're not going to be very comfortable. With the right tips, however, they almost vanish into my ears. Unless I pay close attention, I can pretty easily forget that they're there, though I'm very prone to spending long periods of time (upwards of six hours with minimal breaks) with headphones/earphones on/in. As such, I'm used to long-duration wear. Still, with the right tips, these are very comfortable. Not once have I had to take them out because they were bothering me, even after sleeping in them for a full 9 hours. (On that note, if you want a pair of earphones to sleep in, these also work great. They sit deep in the ear with a minimal profile on the outer ear, so it's possible to lay on them and feel no discomfort. May not work well for people with small ears, though.)

What about the sound? Again, this is dependent on the tip you have. Get the right tip, and the trinity (isolation, comfort, and sound) show up at the same time. People complain that these are bass-heavy, and I agree to a point. These earphones are not in any way neutral. The bass does come through strongly enough to make the mids feel thin and the highs muffled. That being said, it's nowhere near as bad as those abominations known as Beats. Music is still very easy to listen to and enjoy, and unless you're a big fan of Grado and Sennheiser, I'm not sure you'd really feel that the bass was overpowered at all. The attribute that takes the biggest hit is vocals, but again, that's coming from Grado and Sennheiser, both of which are very, very good at bringing out all parts in the mix equally.
Continuing to focus on the tips, changing them is a royal pain in the ass the first time. I nearly ruined the default pair trying to get them off. It's going to take a while, so don't rush it. Literally took me 20 minutes to get both sides changed out.
Overall, I strongly suggest these. They do exactly what I wanted them to do with ease, and for $100, I'm not sure how much better it could have been done. The cables are detachable, and if you want, you can get cables to use them with your iPhone or Android phone. Can't comment on the functionality of either, as I despise iPhones and don't have the cash for a decent Android phone right now.

On an unrelated note, I wish these were waterproof. I actually don't like taking them out first thing in the morning to go and nab a shower. It's nothing worth complaining about, though it's the only thing I think they could improve on in this price range. As far as better sound quality goes, I'm not sure what to say other than to jump up to the SE-425s or higher."
2085,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Two years ago, my Shure E2C IEMs finally gave up on me. I really liked those. At the time, they were the best I could find for the price. Since then, I have tried several sets, such as Monster Turbine, Polk 6000, Bose IE2, and a couple others. Of the group, i surprisingly liked the Monsters the best for their audio, although the ear pieces were heavy. That pair finally broke a few months back, and I have been searching for a new set, trying to stay @ or below $100. After trying out a couple models, and reading a lot of reviews, I decided to come back to Shure. As soon as I put these on, my first thought was, ""Why did I ever leave Shure?"".

Shure has a whole line if IEMs, and these are the entry level for them. But entry level for Shure is way better than many others.

PROS:
Full range audio - with natural sound that appeals to all the music I enjoy (which is an eclectic mix of pretty much anything)
The fit...oh the fit - I personally like the foam tips that you squeeze, insert, and let fill your ear canal. They seal perfect, and stay in.
The over the ear design of the cables - These wrap around behind your ears to provide a more secure and comfortable fit. The old E2Cs were this way, and I had missed it. This generation is actually nicer in that you can conform the over ear portion to hold in place better.

CONS:
I wouldn't mind a lower price :)
Um, well, I'll let you know when I find another one."
2086,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought for the captivating sound, kept it because I could never justify buying another pair of ear buds. Through countless hours of daily gym use, drenched in sweat, and countless more sitting in my pockets while I do active things at work. I simply don't worry about these phones no matter what I do because I don't need to. They have always been there for me and will continue to be as long as I don't lose them.

One time I was loading a bar and I literally smashed one of them between two 45 lb plates. It broke off the little stem where the pad goes, so I gorilla glued it back and 6 mos later I'm still using it... It's completely modular so I think if it breaks again I'm just gonna send the one bud in to get fixed for like $25 because Shure rocks.

You can sleep with these without them puncturing your ear drums because the body sits on your ear bone. You also can't hear a damn thing with them on. I bought a new set of the foam pads recently and love these phones all over again. The sound hasn't changed in 3 years of abuse.

I keep oogling at other headphones, but then I remember what I have waiting for me at home and I realise that the grass isn't all that greener than what I got.

I love these phones."
2087,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I work in a fairly noisy environment, so I need a noise-isolating in-ear monitor. I have tried several models, and the Shure SE215-K is the best I have found in the under-$100 price range. There are three categories in which I evaluate in-ear monitors: sound quality, in-ear fit/comfort, and cable quality. The SE215-K excels in all three areas.

The Shures are very good-sounding monitors. They deliver a well-balanced sound across all frequency spectrums. I have found that many in-ear monitors over-emphasize the bass frequencies, resulting in a somewhat ""boomy"" sound. The bass response of the SE-215Ks is very full, but without going over the top and sounding unnatural. Mids are clear and well-defined, and high frequencies are reproduced smoothly without sounding overly sibilant or tinny. This is quite an achievement for a single-driver system, but the Shures do very well.

Fit/comfort is an essential quality of any in-ear monitor. This is, of course, very subjective, as everyone's ears are shaped differently. I have personally had difficulty finding in-ears that fit me well, but the Shures do not have this problem. The Shures come with six sets of ear buds, three sizes each of rubber and memory foam units. Once I found the best-fitting set (the large rubber ones), I found that the sound isolation properties were excellent. One word of caution: these are intended to be used as stage monitors, which means they are designed so that the cable goes up and behind the ears. This is not an optional feature of this product; you won't get a good fit unless you do this. I found that this took a bit of getting used to, but with practice I learned to remove/replace the monitors quickly and easily.

The last category is cable quality. I learned about this category the hard way, as monitors that I have used in the past had terrible cables that would kink or--worse--produce significant microphonic feedback. For those not familiar with this phenomenon, microphonic feedback is when contact with the cables (touching with hands, rubbing against clothing) results in audible artifacts in the monitors themselves. The cable acts as a microphone and transfers the sound to the monitors. The Shure SE215K cable is free of both of these problems. I have had no issues with the cable kinking (if anything, it is a bit too stiff, but I have found this to be manageable), and its microphonic properties are negligible.

Having just described the cable, I want to note that I use the cable that includes the microphone (an actual microphone, not an accidental one)and the three-button controls for my iPhone, not the default cable that comes with the monitors. I have used the controls on this cable and found them to be high-quality. The buttons are easy to access and distinguish by touch, and they provide good tactile feeback. I have had no sound quality issues using the microphone. The only complaint that I have is that Apple does not provide side tone (i.e., the sound of one's own voice) when using monitors to make a phone call. This means the user cannot hear his own voice when talking--and this is made worse by the sound-isolating ear buds. This is disconcerting, and as a result I typically do not make calls in this way. However, it's there in a pinch.

I can recommend the SE215K monitors over the Klipsch S4 and the ME Electronics CC51P units. I have logged significant time with both of these monitors. The sound of the S4s is OK (the bass can be on the ""boomy"" side), but I was never able to achieve a comfortable fit in my ears. I had all sorts of problems with the CC51Ps, but the worst was the microphonic cable. The slightest movement is very audible, which made them all but unusable. My issues with the Klipsch have more to do with my ears than with the overall quality of the product (I happen to think highly of Klipsch products in general), though I cannot say the same for the ME Electronics monitors. All that notwithstanding, the SE 215K beats both of those monitors in all three categories. I would recommend this product to anyone."
2088,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound really good for ear buds. I use them a lot at work. My biggest freaking problem with these is the dumb design of the wire up and over your ear. The wire NEVER stays put for me and always comes off the top of my ear. Perhaps I don't have a huge ear and that is the problem. But I find it super annoying that when I turn my head just a few times the wire should be tucked behind me ear isn't anymore causing it to pull on the ear bud which then dislodges from my ear.

I would have much preferred normal ear buds that just hand straight down. Shure makes nice things and they are super pricey to boot, but this is the last time I'm buying this type of a design. I can't even work out with these because there is NO way in doing any activity that would make the wires stay behind the ears."
2089,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Summary: Fantastic, balanced and clear sound. Tight, comfortable fit. Breakaway cord means you can replace the wire without replacing the whole thing.

Sound: In a nutshell, this are very clear, accurate earbuds that let you hear every detail of your music. They are so clear, you may find yourself upping the bitrate on your music to hear every last detail.
Bass: Clean, natural, accurate reproduction. Not a bass-heavy version, so if you like bumping bass for your hip hop, could be the wrong thing. Still has present bass, just not artificially boosted.
Mids: Very clear and accurate sounding.
Highs: The highs are a little more pronounced on these than some others, giving nice hi hats and upper vocal definition.

To call these perfectly in balance, I would probably turn down the treble by 5% and give it to the 3% to the mids and 2% to the bass, and that's probably what you get when you upgrade to the next level. But overall very very solid.

Fit is tight without hurting your ears. The Shure wraparound design means the cord isn't always trying to pull the earbuds out of your ears, so you can have a tighter fit without being so tight your ears start to hurt after a while.

In past models, this meant that if you jerked on your cord or dropped your phone the wire might get stretched or even break, because they don't come out of the ear easily. I had to replace them twice, and finally gave up and went to something else. I'm pleased to see they addressed that problem with a breakaway cord that disconnects from the more expensive hardware. I assume this means cheap and easy replacement of only the wire.

To Shure's credit, in the last model before they added the breakaway, they shipped me new ones completely free of charge twice! So I trust this company. Plus, I've listened to lots of $100 headphones and these are by far my favorite. Most headphones jack the bass or lack that sonic sound even if they're clear. These are genuine hifi earbuds."
2090,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for something to replace my motorcycle headphones. I had a pair that worked fairly well. They were the type that you form the two-part hardening plastic mold into your ear. However, the cord broke on the second pair. So, time to find something new.

First: I'm a bass player and I'm also an audiophile. I've spent multi-thousands on my home system, so I'm pretty familiar with good sound quality.
Second: I mostly need these for riding motorcycles (Ducati 900 with loud pipes) as well as yard work around loud yard appliances.

These seal out the noise great! I get as much out of the seal as I do wearing my standard foam bullet ear plugs. Note: I did NOT get that kind of seal out of the standard foam plugs that come installed on the plugs. I swapped out the foam for the rubber seals. Rubber seals are where it's at!

Also, bass was not great when I first tried them on with the foam plugs. I played around with my iPhone settings (already on the bass-booster setting) and couldn't get the bass I wanted. I swapped to the rubber seals and bass was there in spades! I've now got the iPhone set on ""Flat"" and it's the most full audio presentation I've ever gotten out of earbuds. I say full, not flat. They are not flat. I don't have a way to measure them, but I'd estimate there is a 3db mid-bass peak (maybe 80 hz?) and they are full enough to produce good bass tones down to the ""B"" string on an electric that has the lower string. Treble is good, maybe a touch grainy, but these aren't $1K earbuds or $10K speakers, right? They actually have a touch of soundstage vs the typically flat-2D soundstage of most earbuds.

They fit under my Arai full-face helmet perfectly. I don't even feel them when I take the helmet on and off. My old ones would catch on the cheek pad and kind of press the buds into my ear canal. These don't. I think these are the kinds of earbuds that I can wear all day on a ride and not get an ear canal ache. Time will tell. We'll see how well they wear and last, too. Hopefully longer than the 12 months my last buds lasted."
2091,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these recently as part of a serious effort to find earbuds that deliver quality sound, secure fit, and affordable enough that I wouldn't be distraught if I lost them.

These fit the bill perfectly. I used to own a pair of the previous-generation Bose in-ear phones. Really great sound, but they never sat very securely in my ears. I see that they have recently modified the ear attach point, but I was skeptical nonetheless.

I tried these because of great reviews and the fact that I was able to purchase them at slight discount. The result is that I am extremely satisfied. So satisfied, that I am seriously considering purchasing on of the dual-driver models to get the sound to the next level. But these are more than adequate for daily use.

Sound is balanced and clean. Not bass-biased like some more popular name brands. The younger me would have chased that bass sound, but the more even balance of these headphones are much better.

Also, crucially, the fit is extremely secure without being uncomfortable. Most other earbuds I've tried are not well suited to normal movement. These can handle a great deal of head movement without requiring readjustment.

These earbuds have made me a believer and I will definitely buy from Shure again."
2092,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are hands down the best audio device I've ever used.
SOUND:
I'm not any crazy picky audiophile or anything but these headphones give the best quality I've heard from anything else, including the 60$ ear buds I was previously using and any headphones I've gotten my hands on. I doubt anyone would have a problem with the sound quality of these, they're better than I could have imagined. The ear buds are as well very good sound isolators. When in they block out most noise and when playing you can't hear anything. If I'm trying to sleep and others are up making noise having these in makes it really easy to fall asleep. I always use these on vacations as well for the same purpose. Plus they work as good earplugs at concerts, especially because you can remove the wire.
LIFESPAN:
The longest I've ever had ear buds last before these was 6 months. Ear buds are notorious for bad lifespan, but even with replaceable wire the first wire outlasted that, going 9 months before one ear bud started flickering. The second wire lasted 6 months and I've just gotten my third. Keep I mind I took no precaution to treat these wires well, I stuff them in my pocket everyday to take with me and over the past year and a half have used them on average at least 9 hours a day. These are definitely workhorses. For about $145 now I've gotten great quality sound for 16 months and continuing, great deal.
COMFORT:
Among everything that is great about these ear buds this is the one big con. After having these ear buds in for more than an hour my ears would get sore. The buds are pretty big so having these in for long can make your ears pretty sore. In the beginning this was a big problem, however after very frequent use of these for 3 months or so, I can now keep these in all day and not have any discomfort. Because I've had them for so long this doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me, it was worth it for how long I've had them. Still something to consider if this is a big concern. You probably wouldn't like these if you have small ears."
2093,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. I have found them to be comfortable, even for long periods of wear. Additionally, I find them to be comfortable to wear even while sleeping. I am a stomach sleeper and my previous headphones were impossible for me to wear while falling asleep because my ear against the pillow created pressure and became uncomfortable after a very short amount of time. The sound quality from these is superb and they block out so much noise. I can barely even hear the lawn mower running when I have these in."
2094,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just want add my 2 cents to this companies product, I know that a lot of people have complained about the newer version and that's fine. the pair I have is I gotta say 10 years old. I did a lot of landscaping and mowing. I went through about 10 sets of headphones till I tried out this companies. at the time they were 125 and that was low end model. I was sitting on 62inch mower and had to reach down and feel the side of seat to know if it was running. The superior outside noise blocking allowed me to turn my ipod down to such a low lvl it wasn't blairing in my ears. Mind you this is for an older model. The clarity alone was worth the money. and the battery life of my ipod was even better. I still have them today and have had no problems with wires or sound problems. I lost a few of the buds and contacted company, they sent me out a new bud package at no charge. When I travel on a train or long bus I bring these and I can crank up whatever I am watching for a movie and people around cannot hear it at all. (some people like to share their music with others) I wish I could give a review about the newer models but havnt had to buy a new pair since others are still going strong."
2095,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall great headphones for the price, amazing isolation.

Isolation:
Superb. They isolate more than the Vic First Drumming headphones, which isolated very well. Instead of muffling the highs like the Vics, These cut out most of the bass. My kick sounds completely flat with no low end while wearing these. This is great, because when you're monitoring or playing with music, you don't get all the muddy noise, but you can still hear the attacks from your kit through the seals. You can always monitor your kit and get the low end back that way.

Sound:
Very bassy, not in the muddy way, but in the deep way. They get really low, powerful frequencies instead of just amplifying most of the low end like a lot of cheaper headphones, which muddies up the sound. Still, these are very bassy.

Weird thing:
The foam ear tip was super hard to take off the earphone to the point where I was worried that I would break them. No damage, but it's tough to get off/on."
2096,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love music, no I really do. If I thought I could've made money at it I would have jumped at the chance. So I need pretty good ear-buds. I'm not rich or anything close to it. So 2, 3 or 4 hundred dollars for ear-buds is more than I want to spend. But I've had a few (last being SIEGE)and they always broke in a shorter time than expected. I'm not hard on them by any means, but I use them everyday to hold off the sounds of the world I live in. I NEED good/great sound. A comfortable fit and ease of use. Outside of that if they looked great it a plus. These SHURE SE215's are all that and more. Afterwards I bought from Amazon the interchangeable IPod cable.

Pros: The sound is like being there (I've heard things I didn't here on my considerable home system.
Price $100.00 I bought them outside of Amazon from a dealer close by (that would honor a return if needed)
They look extra cool to me in my ears and in my hand. They are clear and stand out because of it.
The construction is soo much better than anything I've used, it's incredible.
The cable can be disconnected if damaged or in my case upgraded to one with an IPod controller and on cord Mic.
++ They block 95% of the the external sounds around you.

Cons: Getting them in correctly took some practice. They go in upside down from the way they look (like stage musicians wear them)and the cords go OVER your ears and in back.
Getting the correct bud will take trail and error.
-- They block 95% of the the external sounds around you. Some people will feels really vulnerable when are disconnected from their surroundings.

Verdict- Where have they been all my life. I think I will get this brand of ear-buds from now on. They seem built to last and they sound wonderful. Nuff said."
2097,5.0 out of 5 stars,"(Review copied from previous Amazon account). This is my second pair of Shure in-ear monitors. The first endured five years of heavy use before the cable failed. I purchased these largely because of the replaceable cable.

The quality is outstanding....the cable is thick and supple, the cable connector fits tightly, and the selection and fit of the eartips is great (Shure eartips have always fit me well). The sound is very good, with full bass, warm midrange, and clear treble. However, these do have a somewhat forward sound, not quite the precise timing and spacious soundstage that some in-ear monitors convey (Etymotic comes to mind).

That said, I believe 99% of users (myself included) will prefer the warm, powerful sound of the Shure's. Please note that Shure earphones are designed for the cable to be passed above and behind the ear for a secure fit. This does secure the fit, but can be slightly awkward for glasses wearers.

Update: After several years of steady use the Shure CBL-M+K Accessory Music Cable (separate item) that I purchased along with these began to fray and was replaced by Shure, free of charge under warranty. Recently, the earbuds and cable were inadvertently stepped on, breaking the right earbud and the accessory cable. After sending to Shure, they were both replaced for a VERY fair price. With such reliable customer service, I'm a Shure customer for life."
2098,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE 215's are simply awesome! Especially for the money. I am a drummer and was looking for something that cut out at least 30db from my acoustic drums, but also a pair of in ears that sounded good. Shure claims that the 215's cut of up to 37 db's and I was floored when I put these in for the first time. I can guarantee that I am getting near 37 db less when these in ears are put in properly. Those who claim that they aren't getting any noise reduction are probably not get a proper seal.

These things sound great, very clear mids and highs, and very good lows as well. I was concerned that there might not be a lot of low end from the 215's, but I was pleasantly surprised. The low end is very good! They're also very comfortable and can be worn for hours without fatigue. I prefer the medium foam sleeves that were already on the 215's as they provide great isolation and comfort.

I was debating on getting the 315's and couldn't decide which ones to get but thought that the 215's might actually have more low end. I haven't heard the 315's so I can't speak about them., but I can tell you that the 215's exceeded my expectations. I've had them for a month now and haven't had any problems. I believe some people may be having problems because they are not cleaning them. Check out videos on YouTube regarding how to clean the SE 215's. I highly recommend these in ears, especially for people who area looking for nice sound quality with very good sound isolation. You will be very happy with your purchase."
2099,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third pair of Shure 'over the ear' earbuds. My last pair, which I enjoyed for many years, developed a short in the wiring, so it was time to order a new pair.
I use my earbuds for running and cycling, so a good, solid fit is very important to me. With most earbuds I've tried I seem to be constantly pushing them back into place. No so with my 215s.

Fit: some wearers have mentioned that they had a hard time fitting the 215s in place. I found them very easy to fit and they stay in place throughout my 5 to 10 km runs. I think wearing 'behind the ear' earbuds for many years made fitting and wearing the 215s easier, compared to someone who has never worn this type of earbud.
If you're having trouble getting them to fit properly, don't give up. Once you get accustomed to putting them in place you'll love them.

Sound: Very clear and bright, but I wish they had a bit more bass. These earbuds don't seem to fit as tight as my last set of Shure earbuds. They let in more outside noise, which I don't mind. It lets me hear more of what's going on around me. Note that I use the 'ribbed' rubber ear pieces which usually give a deep fit.

Quality: I like that the wires can be replaced. This is a good news, as the speaker unit seems to last a lot longer than the wires."
2100,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros - Solid build, very comfortable in my ears (in contrast to a couple reviews complaining about discomfort after a long listen), good sound quality

Cons - Like a few other people have said, the bass is there, but it's less felt than it is heard.

Firstly, I should say that I don't have a much experience with IEMs. My only other pair was the Bose ie2 that my friends mistakenly threw away (Yeah, they threw away a $150 pair of headphones... I was more than a little frustrated). I got these as a gift, and, out of the box, I have to say I was a little disappointed. The Bose that I had before had good sound quality and had very good bass for an IEM. And that's where I got hung up on these.

The Shures lack the ""feel"" of the bass that the Bose have. When I first started listening, they sounded shallow. Good mids and uppers, but lacking the bass I was looking for, that is, until I had tried them out for a few days.

After the initial listen, I was left a little disappointed, so I set them off to the side. I started using them more the last few days and have done a soft 180 on my first opinion. The bass isn't what I was hoping for, but the clarity of sound throughout the range of pitches more than makes up for it.

Definitely the best earbuds/IEMs that I've owned as far as clarity goes, but a slight disappointment on the bass end of things. I would recommend them for anybody that isn't a basshead and is looking for a solid set of IEMs."
2101,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these. I am a nervous flier, and flew by myself for the first time in 2011. I was at an airport kiosk and looking for a pair of earplugs in my time to kill. I came across these, and at first balked at the price. ""$100 for a pair of headphones?"" I remember saying. The guy at the counter was quick to point out these are ""In Ear Monitors"", and vastly superior to ""headphones"". I was skeptical, but wanted something to keep the sound of an airplane engine out of my eardrums, and figured I'd treat myself. Boy am I glad I did!

With music playing, I didn't have to hear the stewardesses give their stupid ""put on your seat belt"" speech, wasn't bothered by the babies and children on the flight, didn't really notice the engine except for the vibrations (not at all Shure's fault, I'm the idiot putting my life in the pilot/air company's hands...) and I can honestly say the sound is in a whole other class above what I'd heard before.

I'm by no means an audiophile, but I am a Computer Engineer, and I feel at this point, these babies are no longer the cause of any of my gripes about sound quality. I find myself seeking out lower compression/higher bit-rate music as I'm now listening on something that you can actually hear the difference between the upper-bit-rate mp3's and ""lossless"" audio encodings.

I use them every day in my cubicle at work, and everyone within earshot is so glad I replaced my old, open air Sony wraparounds! No sound gets in or out, so everyone is happy. I've run over 10 miles on a trail with them and they stand up well. I always use the foam tips as opposed to the rubber ones that also come with them, and have ordered a pack of replacement mid sized ones. To me they seem to last about a year before you need new foam tips, which is not bad considering a pack of 6 is about $20 or so.

All in all, can't recommend them enough, and these are the ""entry level"" Shure's. Can't wait till I hit the lottery and can justify getting the $1000 ones! Then again, I'll need to use them in a recording studio or something, because where else are you going to get truly lossless quality sound?"
2102,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a very difficult time finding in-ear headphones that stay in my ears. I had moderate luck with an earlier model of Shure, as well as Klipsch Image S4 and its descendants. But they were not nearly perfect. Bose SoundTrue Ultra sort of works but falls out if I actually walk around. The tips that come preinstalled on these compress easily and rest comfortably in my ears. They don't require any adjustment after being seated well, even if I walk around for quite a while. Sound is as good as its similarly-priced peers on the market, and they do an excellent job of isolating outside noise.

Update: Accidentally put these through the washing machine, and a few minutes in the dryer, in the pocket of a jacket. They still work fine. I am impressed!"
2103,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've borrowed these from a friend numerous times and they are very good. The highs are not that clear. I enjoyed listening to a piano or violin piece on the S2 much more just because of that simple fact. The only thing I think they excel in that the Philips lack is the bass. However I do acknowledge that Philips were going for a more ""natural"" sounding IEM. And I didn't particularly like that you have to take the time to prepare the tips and then insert and get the wire over your ear. I understand it's better for running but I just use my IEMs for the train or walking around. I like the traditional insert in with a silicone tip and not really having to go through the hassle. The reason I took the chance to buy the S2 over these was because my friends shure's starting to break up the sound and it's quite common with them. Though be it the problem only occurred after a year. The replaceable wire design seems to be the cause of this sound breaking up (just forum research)."
2104,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Makes for awkward encounters because you really can't hear anything that is going on in the real world when you are wearing these!
I've been wearing them in cafes while I study and don't want to be distracted and I can't hear what is going on around me.
I've been wearing them in the gym on the rowing machine and stay on better than any other ear phone I've ever tried - these are NOT falling out when you work out.

The sound isolation is probably really good for my ears too: because they do such a great job of blocking the sound around me I can keep the volume of my music really low. Used to be I'd have to crank up my music or language tapes when riding the subway, now I keep it at a normal level and I'm probably doing less damage to my ears.

The nylon carrying case is the perfect size too."
2105,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first IEMs and I couldn't be happier with them even if I don't have anything else to compare them to. I'm a drummer, and whether it's live applications, or practicing to a metronome or music, these things protect my hearing while blocking out enough sound from my kit so I can hear the audio from the earphones clearly, but not so much as to block out my kit altogether. The bass is perfect in live applications, I can hear my bass drum and bass guitar very clearly. If you plan on using these for regular music/movie listening, mids and highs are very clear as well. It took me a few tries when I got them to put the foam tips in my ears but once I got the hang of it, It's been nothing but a great listening experience ever since and I feel better knowing my hearing is protected with these."
2106,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to replace my 8 year old Shure headphones (not sure of model number....it's a predecessor to the SE112). The reason I stuck with Shure is because of quality sound and quality built material. I used my old ones a lot. They got some good banging around as I traveled the world with them, slept with/on them, exercised with them. The EarPods even got small cracks from the abuse...yet, the sound stayed amazing. Never had to change a chord. After 8 years one side finally gave way. Not too sure if it is clogged or just a tired driver (sound is coming through, but barely audible). Decided to upgrade to the 215's. Some say they need some burning-in time....mine came new and great sound was there from the start. Will monitor them and see if burning in makes a difference....but hey...if they sound great from the get-go...how more awesome will they sound if/when they burn-in right?! Reviews I have read complained about these not having enough bass....not true. with the right foam ear-tips they give a good punch! I can also see now, why some people got stares waring them...they really look like a hearing-aid EarPod. If that bothers you, go for the black ones or the Limited edition...Can't go wrong with Shure!"
2107,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Having lived with a pair of EC-2 IEM's for the past couple years, I was expecting the SE215-CL to sound similar. They don't, unfortunately. These have a much darker sound that is just too BASS heavy for my taste. Like most decent IEM's, the Shure's sound their best when driven from a headphone amplifier with sufficiently low output impedance. I'm writing about the sound of these based on listening to them driven from my cell phone (Nexus 6), which while not is ideal, is a known entity for how my EC-2's sound. Perhaps I will adapt to the sound of these or use EQ to reduce the 60Hz output by 8dB or so, or I may send them back for a refund. Will update this review if I ""warm"" up to their sound characteristics."
2108,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for over 2 years now and I felt compelled to write a review now because they just survived a trip through the washing machine and dryer and still work after they came out. I've used them often and they have held up well. They cancel out sound very well. I didn't care for the foam buds myself because when I turn my head the left side comes out a hair and I lose the sound. The same doesn't happen with the other buds. The only thing I've noticed is that after a while the wires near the ear piece have this green discoloration inside. These are absolutely worth the money.

I also had a pair of Shure E2C in ears before this that lasted through several years of constant use. Eventually the plastic around the ears cracked on those which was common with that model. Shure seems to make good products and I wouldn't hesitate to buy their stuff again."
2109,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking at the Shure SE215 to use as an In Ear Monitor, on stage with other musicians. When I first got them I ran them at a moderate volume using tracks with particularly deep bass for about 8 hours. I tried them out and my first impression that from the top to the upper midrange it was all there. Nice detail even at higher volumes (Great for live work). The isolation was very good. They seal into the ear more like fitted In Ears than the usual ""stick it in you ear"" type.
I've used them for about 15 hours so far and while the bass is detailed and well defined it really isn't that deep. My hope is that whithin the 20 to 30 hour range the IEM's will begin to lossen up a bit and allow for better low end response.
I own a pair of Future Sonics 500-030 Atrio X in ears and the overall tone is much warmer while still having very good detail. I think they are great for music playback while the SE215's will do a bit better with live music.
I think my next try will be with the Future Sonic Atrio 010-045 w/MG7 Pro Technology. These have been designed for live sound and I have heard a lot of good things about them from other drummers.
I'll give an additional review after the 30 hour mark. Stay tuned...=)"
2110,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound excellent right out the box, although im not a huge fan of the foam plugs i took these off and put the rubber ones on and perfect. These are very comfortable to wear. When I had read the reviews before buying them alot of people complained about switching out the tips, they are absoulety right, these are very hard to change I was at work when i changed them out for the first time and had access to a microscope, On the directions it reads to twist and pull, this will probaly break the end off them like other reviews had stated, I on the other hand peeled them off. I stuck my finger nail under it and peel back(I dont have much for nails) and was able to get these off faily easy and change them out. Know for the important thing the sound, I have alot of earphones and one of my prized earphones which is some DENON AHC710 which are $200.00 and thats a very modest price. these might actually sound better not quite yet but the shure are not broke in yet. Everything is balanced so perfectly plenty of bass thats not distorted, the highs are no overbarring and the mids are just right. The only thing Im waiting for is the snap on the low end bass like my denons have and these will be right there with them. I like the cord it seems really strong and the fact that you can disconnect them is cool. All in all very happy with my purchase. I bought these at guitar center and the guy said these sound better then the SE315 and on par with a few exceptions as the SE 535. You cant go wrong. By the way these are being powered bt a ZUNE HD and soon a COWON J3."

I usually listen to music or audiobooks with earbuds between 15 and 30 hours a week. I have been through countless Skullcandy, a pair of klipsch s4s, and logitech ue earbuds. Skullcandys earbuds would last me at most 4 months. The logitech and klipsch would last me a little under a year. This is before the earbuds would break, usually because of a cracked housing or broken cord. Please note that i consider myself an average user of earbuds and that i don't abuse or misuse them in anyway. Enter the Shure se215. These earbuds are attractive to me for several reasons. Great sound, much better that any skullcandy or klipsch. Slightly better than logitech. The real standout of these is the detachable cord and the noise isolation. Of course the real reason I am righting this review is because in my opinion these are the most durable earbuds i have ever had. One day i accidentally left these in shirt pocket when i washed a full load of clothes. I DIDNT NOTICE UNTIL THE SHIRT WENT THROUGH THE WASHER AND THE DRYER WITH THE SHURE SE215s INSIDE! Not only did they spend aprox. an hour in the wash but also an equivalent time in the dryer. This is after owning and using them as described earlier for more than two years! Let me tell you i cringed when i plugged them in to give them a listen. To my surprise they worked like a charm, with little to no sound depreciation. By no means would i ever try this again with any pair of headphones. However the shure se215s not only surprised me, but simply amazed me by their build quality and durability. They definitely have earned a returning customer!"
2113,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After 2 weeks of use the left ear constantly cuts out. I have a pair of wired se215 as well, so tried the earpieces from there to confirm it was a problem with the cable. Bluetooth connection is ok, but I've had frequent cut-outs out and about in HK when they worked. Sound is great when they work, but disappointed by the quality given the price and brand."
2114,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So the $500 SE535s are amazing, if you have that kinda cash to burn on headphones get those, if not, then get these! I just got off a flight with 2 crying babies and even with the music turned down LOW it couldn't hear them or the engine noise on my flight. With my old headphones I had to turn the volume up to dangerous levels to drown out the plane and my fellow passengers - now I keep it on one of the lowest settings b/c i just don't need it.

The foam tips expand to fully fill your ear canal blocking out much background sound before you even plug the phones in. Once you do, though the active isolation kicks in and wipes out more noise (including plane engine). The other nice thing is the snug fit against the outer ear. I can put my head on a pillow and do not even notice that these are in -- this is huge, I mean just try and sleep with a pair of over-ear noise-canceling headphones!!

Compare: The Monster beats by dre in-ear headphones stick way out and the foam does not expand nearly enough.

Did i mention these sound great? They do. Nice base for an in-ear and I was blown away by how much better the music on my old ipod sounded out of the new phones. Again though if you can blow 5x more then get the SE535 b/c that just blew me away - sounded like i was in concert but those were not in my price range.

I've only had these for a day, but so far I am ecstatic."
2115,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used 2 pairs of Etymotic ER-6i, and a pair of Etymotic mc5 earbuds in the past.

After using Etymotic earbuds for many years, I've come to expect crystal clear sound from earbuds while at the same time avoiding bass like the plague. The SE215 do provide more bass then I'm used to and less fidelity than the Etymotic.
Are these downsides deal-breakers to me? No. I expected these differences after reading many reviews, especially ones comparing Shure vs. Etymotic. The SE215 sound good enough for what I paid for them.
Unlike the Etymotic models I've used, the construction quality and design of the SE215 seems to be higher. I expect they will work for many years and outlast the Etymotic models I've used.
The silicone eartips do a great job at creating a seal, maybe an even better job than the 3-flanged eartips I used to use with my Etymotics. Unfortunately I believe they have a design flaw, see below.

When I first used the earbuds I thought they sounded like trash, but after a few days of use they sounded good. I'm guessing they need some burn-in time.

I think the silicone ear tips have a design flaw.

If you look at them you should see a line on the surface that would come in contact with your skin/ear. You can see it at this link:
http://tinyurl.com/zhxdzq9
After touching and looking at that line, at first you might think there's no way that line could cause any discomfort. Unfortunately after testing both the medium (this size fits me best) and the large size silicone tips and going through two bouts of ear_pain/skin_infection, I'm certain that line is the cause of my discomfort/pain.
If you use your earbuds on and off and not for long periods of time, I don't think you should experience any discomfort. On the other hand if you wear your earbuds for more than say 6 hours with small breaks (you take them off for less than 10 minutes), that line will have time to cut into your skin/ear and cause it to become tender and/or infected.
I'm guessing that the large silicone tips did not cause me ear pain because while wearing them properly with a seal, the tips are large enough that I don't need to push them deep enough so as to make the line come into contact with my skin/ear.

I'm fairly certain that if the silicone tips were re-engineered to not have that line on their surface, some of those people posting reviews complaining about ear discomfort would change their reviews to be more favorable.

I consider these earbuds to be the best buy for under $100 earbuds category, of course my concern about the silicone eartips stands.
I recommend that if you plan on buying them, to use the foam tips or use 3 flanged ear tips (not included). Use the large 3 flanged tips if the Shure medium silicone tips fit you best.

UPDATE - 8/28/2017

I've been using the large foam tips and haven't had any problems with them. Unfortunately I get cut by the hard plastic that encloses the innards. More specifically the sharp edges found where the two halves meet."
2116,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th or 5th pair of Shure earbuds. I've been a nightclub dj for almost 2 decades, so I've been through a LOT of headphones. I don't use earbuds for gigs, but do wear them daily in the office & doing yardwork, exercise, etc.

I originally purchased the Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones in 2010 & the dealer kept having to replace them, due to the cabling cracking where it fits around the ear, causing the sound to go out. They kept phasing out models & sending me the ""latest & greatest"" models, which is how I ended up with these. In all cases, Shure's customer service has been stellar, swapping the previous versions out quickly with no questions asked. I did have to pay for this set, b/c it had been about 8 months out of warranty finally, but they gave me a reduced price on them.

The SE215-CL's sound great so far! As good as any high quality dj phones I've used. Seems the bass is a little chunkier on these & it appears they attempted to remedy the faulty cable issue on my last 4 pair by putting a little rubber casing around the cord & making it detachable, but I still see a lot of reviews citing similar issues as before... at least their customer service has been stellar to date, so if they go out again... I would imagine they'll swap them out no questions asked.

Fingers crossed these last a while!"
2117,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have used the wired version of this headphone for years because of the combination of great sound and sound isolation. I was looking for wireless headphones for a while and couldn't find anything that had that combination. Then I stumbled about these and it was a no-brainer for me. I have had them for a couple of days and love having the same headphones without the wire.
2118,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones just arrived today and I was so excited to check them out. I opened the package and began investigating them. The first item you see is a little tutorial slip that tells you it is important to have the right fit for full base and it modeled how to ""easily"" remove the sleeve and replace it with the correct size....ummm...yeah, right! It was the most frustrating experience ever. The sleeve would not come off. I was sure I was going to break them while trying to ""twist and pull"" to remove them.

In the midst of my frustration, I gave up and attempted to put them in my ears to see if the sound was even worth the hassle. Welcome to frustration number 2...no ""left"" or ""right"" labeled on either earbud and they popped out of my ear every time I tried to determine just how they fit and which ear they fit into best. Finally, after what appeared to be WAY TOO MUCH TIME invested, I got them to stay in long enough to plug them in and take them for a spin. AM radio much? I am giving away my age, but that's what it sounded like a tinny old AM radio. I thought, ""And I paid over a hundred bucks for these?""

Just to ensure they sounded terrible, I pulled out my equivalent level Bose headphones and wow, the base in those versus these was an overwhelming difference. I was nearly ready to put these back in the box and send them back when I couldn't resist the temptation to figure out how to get the sleeves off and try again.

The earphones come with a weird little gadget. There's no mention of it's function or purpose in any of the paperwork. I finally decide it must be to get the sleeves off, and I was right. Using this little tool, I was able to pluck one earbud off at a time. Once removed, replacing them with the right fit was easy and I was ready to give my new earbuds for a spin...WOW!

Now, I get it! They sound crisp, clear, and most importantly, cancel out sound like a BOSS! I had them cranked at a comfortable level and was able to turn my in-home Denon stereo up loud enough to feel the bass, but couldn't actually hear the sound.

After a frustrating experience, the earphones were spectacular. If Amazon allowed it, I would have rated this product in 3 areas:

Directions on what is in included and how best to use the product: NEGATIVE STARS
Ease of using the product and/or setting it up for best use: NEGATIVE STAR
Quality of sound and noise cancellation 5+ stars

Expect effort to get them ""right"" for you, but then they're awesome."
2119,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been using the previous version of these with the short cord and a Shure microphone extension for about three years. Unfortunately, the right earpiece stopped working, so I ordered this one with the replacement microphone and controller for iPhones. The design whereby the cord attaches directly to the earpiece should mean that one will not need to throw away the entire headset when a wire frays. It uses the same replacement inserts as the previous one (good, since I still have a dozen of them), and inserts in the ear the same way, except that it lies flatter. For me, the medium insert cuts out some ambient sound, but I can still hear enough that it is safe to use while walking outside. The sound quality is more than adequate for mp3's and internet streaming (the only things for which I have used them)."
2120,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of Shure earphones of this stile. My first pair was the older design where the cable was not replaceable, which I tore when I snagged them while doing yard work. These headphones are great for tuning out the world without ruining your hearing. Since they work much like shooting year plugs you do not have to turn the volume up louder than your surrounding noise in order to hear your music, which in the long run will prevent you from doing damage to your hearing. I wear them while mowing or while traveling on trains or subways and it is like creating a privacy bubble around myself so I can tune out the noisy passengers without being a nuisance since no one can hear my earphones. The sound quality is great as well and they sit well with the wire around my ears. The chord is long enough that I can put my iPhone in my back pocket while wearing the headphones. I would definitely recommend these headphones!"
2121,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are great for casual music listening in loud places and especially while running on the treadmill. I think it's important to point out that these really are designed to be live sound in ear monitors. I'm an audio engineer and must say, these earphones are pretty recognizable for their purpose by their distinctly clear low midrange. They really are versatile though. I first started buying these type of earphones for music because they were the only thing that sounded great and stayed in my ear really well while running. I did own a pair of SE115s but lost them and they don't make those anymore, but these are actually a little better. They have perfect sized drivers so the bass is finally ""normal"". Well as normal as these type of earphones will ever get. Cord noise while running is minimal and is hardly noticed after a few minutes. Great earphones, pick them up if you need something exceptional for active listening or live sound."
2122,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SOUND

These IEM's are unbelievable for their price. The sound range is superb with a balanced output of treble, mids, and bass. To those who question whether these have as much bass as ""Beats,"" the short answer is, no. This is not to say they don't have bass though. In fact, they have plenty of it, and to be perfectly honest, more than I was expecting in a single-driver unit.

DESIGN

They look even better in person. I did have to lightly shave down the point where the two halves of the plastic housing meet (as it was scratching the inside of my ear), though this took all of 30 seconds to handle.

FIT/ISOLATION

It may take a little experimenting to find which of the 6 pairs of included tips works best for your ear, but once you do and you create a great seal, holy cow. The outside noise reduction is substantial and you will be able to hear parts of songs that you couldn't before. I wear these roughly 5 hours a day between transit and work and they have become my new favorite pair of earphones to bring with me whenever I'm on the go.

Bottom Line:
Buy them. These should easily be priced in the $150 range (the $200 MSRP is a bit too inflated IMHO, as they encroach upon the next model up's price point). They aren't. So buy them."
2123,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you need Bluetooth for your SE846, there's no better option. Even if other notice a quality drop, it's still better than off-brand Bluetooth cables. Cable is high quality and when you turn it on it will announce an accurate time of how much charge you have left (big plus)."
2124,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for long rides on my motorcycle and they are probably the best motorcycle related purchase I have made to date. Made a thirteen hour ride easy and enjoyable.

Took me a few tries to get them to sit right in my ears and I almost gave up on the. Even the smallest bud is still a little too big for me and I ended up just using the foam plugs as they are easier to mold to the inside of your ear a bit. Once I got them sitting comfortably under my helmet it was well worth it. The cord falls behind your ears and sits out of the way and they do a great job canceling out the wind noise, without the need to turn the volume up terribly high."
2125,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones about a year ago because I had heard from a forum that they were good headphones for anyone who likes a lot of bass in their music. Damn they were right. These were easily the best headphones I have ever bought. Outstanding quality with replacable cord so incase the cord gets damaged it is very easy to replace just the cord and not have to purchase entire new headphones. They always stay in my ear when I am working out, and are very comfortable for long periods of time. They are also very isolating with almost no sound leakage. 10/10 excellent product."
2126,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ride a FZ09, so I catch a lot of wind. I also wear an Arai Defiant, which flows a ton of air. I have tried several earbuds but all were ineffective at highway speeds. Today I wore these for the first time and wow. The wind noise was very minimal and I could hear music and GPS instructions st normal volume levels. GREAT PRODUCT SHURE."
2127,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these headphones a lot. So much so, that I have now purchased two pairs of them (Lost the first pair in a move).

Great sound isolation, great comfort, great sound. I always tended to break the cord in my headphones, as I use them near-constantly. It always made me nervous about buying a more expensive pair. However, since these have a separate replacement cord that you can purchase, I decided to try these.

I have to say, even with hard use, I have not had any issue with the cords being damaged. The construction of the cords seems to be high quality.

I have one complaint, however. The left earphone occasionally has static/cuts out when I move my head certain directions. I have a really hard time isolating what causes it to happen, and I am not sure how to resolve the issue. I did not have this issue with my first pair. It isn't all the time, but it is just often enough to slightly annoy me, without making me deduct a star because of all of the other positives of these headphones."
2128,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earphones based on the rave reviews everyone has written about them. I have always been a Bose man when it came to headphones. The other day, the left ear crapped out on my Bose set (which was only 9 months old). So I decided to find a earphone that would stand the test of time. I am a musician and I have wanted to find a set of earphones that would double as a monitor for my bass guitar. I usually have separate headphones for that but, again, didn't want to spend the money. I've seen artists wear Shure IEMs on stage as an alternative to clunky stage monitors. So I thought I'd give it a shot. Wow. I was absolutely shocked when I first listened to a song on my iPhone. It blew me away. The sound isolation is great and the range is remarkable. I still love my Bose earphones but I may be a Shure man from here on out. The only thing that bothers me is the amount of time it takes to put them in your ears; you can't just pop them in and go...you have to fiddle with it a tad (5 seconds max) to make sure they're in. Then you have to fiddle with the bendable cord behind your hear and make sure it's not hanging out. Also, this does not have a microphone or volume control on the cord...you can buy the cord separately but I don't really mind that much. Also, be careful when changing out the foam/rubber piece, it's a bit tricky to get off."
2129,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are by far the best earbuds ( or in ear monitors) i have ever owned.For starts, i am but a mere high school student. I've used everything from the Skullcandy Heavy Metals to the Beats by Dre. However, i decided that it was time to stop buying swagged up earphones and get a bit more serious about my music. After several weeks of doing my homework, it came down to a couple of choices.

A.) Klipsch s4i
B. Bose ie2
C.) Etymotic hf5
D. Shure se215

Well, i ended up buying every pair here up until they all eventually failed me, leaving me with nothing but the shure se215. I do not regret purchasing these other earphones as they were all amazing in their own way, however, the pair that eventually worked for me was the shure se215. They are a good mix of all these pairs of earphones and then some. They arent quite as elegant as the etymotics, not quite as comfortable as the bose, and lacking just a little bass when compared to the klipsch. But, this pair is like a jack of all trades with a completely removable cable that never tangles. Unfortunately, they also broke. I was like OH NO, are their no earphones that will never fail me. However, despite the fact that i did not buy them directly from the website, shure gladly replaced my broken buds, free of charge. It seems that perhaps it wasnt the perfect headphones i was searching for, but the perfect company."
2130,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earhones, the clear model, about two months ago and within two weeks, the earphone separated from the cable. I was very disappointed because the sound quality is amazing. Every time I wear them, I lament when one will be dislodged without finding a way to prevent recurrence. Another gripe, the cable does not clearly indicate left or right side. Eventually, I will replace them because I know a day will come when the earphone falls off and it is lost. But the sound quality keeps me a fan."
2131,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an audiophile to the point where I have spent thousands on amps and headphones, but I do have an ear for music. These Shure earphones are not only an upgrade in physical quality but sound and quality as well. Comparing these to the previous generation, the bass has been much improved. As I've read in other reviews the highs do somewhat lack but for $100 high end earphones, you can't expect the very best. I mainly use these as a personal monitor when I play the drums and immediately noticed the improvement in sound quality than my previous set. I was able to hear my bass very clearly and my drums simply sounded much better just by listening to them through my earphones. They fit so naturally and comfortably in my ear they truly are no bother at all. The malleable first couple of inches is great for preventing the cable moving around too much. The removable cable has not caused any sort of issues and I just hope it stays that way. Shure has always made great quality products so I doubt it will be an issue.

If you truly care about the music you listen to, dump those silly Skull Candy earphones and pick up a pair of a real earphones."
2132,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of these at Guitar Center in anticipation for needing in-ear monitors for singing on stage, but then that never happened, so I pretty much wasn't using them. I hate for my ears to be completely plugged up just to listen to music.
I figured out a much better use for these and they have become my ear protection for the range. I pop these in, put on some music and get to shooting. I don't understand why anyone would buy these strictly for music listening, but to each their own preference, I guess. These don't sound as good as my Bose in ears and those do not plug up my ear."
2133,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these from another website because I had a gift card with them. However, I did want to contribute to the conversation because there aren't many reviews out yet. I had a great experience with the sound quality but the cable stops working after 30 or so minutes of use or randomly. I have to plug it back to USB power source, even for 1 second, to get it to come alive again. Hopefully this is a very limited problem/defect on my device. But just something to look out for. I agree with some of the sound quality comments on other reviews here and won't be repeating that. Not many mention the quality though, I have Jaybird X and cable and construction feels very solid, I can't say that about these. The cable, control box, and even the usb charging cable, all feel very cheap. Because of the issue I have with it dying and the somewhat cheap feel, I will probably just return them and get the wired version."
2134,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 4th pair of SE sound canceling earphones. I have loved them all. My last was the 310. The ability to block outside noise has always been amazing, especially at a loud sporting event. I got the 215Ks a few days ago. I have never had a problem putting the earbuds in my ears, but, this was difficult. I had to watch a YouTube video over and over to try to get it right. I think I have it down now, and, the sound is great. They fit snugly once you figure it out. My biggest concern is that they don't block outside noise like all of the previous ones. The real test will be in a couple of weeks when I go to a sold out College football game with 96,000 screaming fans. If I can still block that out and listen to the radio at the same time, I might go up to 5 stars."
2135,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great, but that's what you expect from a company like Shure, so i'm going to skip that part of the review.

The tough thing to get used to is how to put them in. They come with the medium foam ear inserts which were a bit too big for my ears so I switched to the small ones. I LOVE the foam inserts. I squeeze them down to as small as I can get them, put them in my ears, and they expand to fill my ear canal over the next 10-15 seconds. During that time you can feel the rest of the world melt away. It's really incredible how much outside noise these block even when music isn't playing. With music on, the outside world is absolutely gone. I can't hear anyting except the music even on an airplane with someone speaking over the PA. I also use them at the gym and I don't hear anything of the outside world.

They are a little funky to put in, especially the first few times. I've had them for about 3 weeks now and just put them in very quickly and easily.

In short, give them a week to grow on you - you'll be happy."
2136,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am by no means an audiophile - but these really don't score well in any category. They arrived damaged (tips were crunched beyond repair), and even after replacing them it does not compare to the competition.

Comfort- The eartips (foam and otherwise) are a nice inclusion, and they fit well and form a near-perfect seal. However, doing so takes about 15-30s. Each pod is way too large to fit snugly in the ear, and they are way too heavy to wear while walking/jogging really anything else (my headphones did better in this category). In order to support the earpods, a moldable wire is attached to each, however I found the wire to be too moldable to really provide any support, while the constant adjustment between each use was a drag. Removing each tip was near impossible, and a definite design flaw.

Sound- These are not overwhelming in the sound department. Bass is flat (not ""balanced"") and creates awkward ""resonant noises"" even at low volumes. Noise isolation is solid with the foam tips, and mediocre with the silicone ones, (although that is to be expected).

Style- These are pretty much the ugliest things you can get. You will look like you have a hearing aid (with the wire running over your ear).

Design- While the ""detachable"" earpods are supposedly a bonus, the weak connection left them falling out all the time. The overall device is made from a cheap plastic, that seemed neither sturdy or durable. The included case was also a downer, as it had no rigid structure to protect the $100 investment. These are by no means ""life proof""... at least not for a person expecting ""ear buds"".

Overall-
These are not great IEMs for real life. Go buy yourself a pair of X10s"
2137,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first, after using these for extended periods I would be left with unbearable pain in my ears especially the smaller canal. I reduced the size of the inserts to the small to no avail and I eventually accepted that this would be a natural downside of using non-custom IEMs. BUT!… The pain thankfully resolved naturally after about 1.5 months which is certainly a long time… but these duds are worth the wait."
2138,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are some durable headphones. I used them 2+ hours every day commuting to a from work, walking biking and running. They were yanked on (hard) many times. Had well over 1200 hours of use before they started to flake because the cord was getting frayed. I went to buy a new pair to discover that I could actually just buy a new cord (much cheaper) rather than all new headphones. Now they work again perfectly. Kudos to Shure for the foresight (and environmental friendliness) to make the headphone cord replaceable. I'll never by headphones from another company again. Well done Shure!"
2139,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these IEM's for about 4 years now, and use them all the time, to this day. Here's my thoughts over the past years of usage:

ACCESSORIES: the SE215's come with a good amount of things in the package. There's small, medium, and large foam (similar to ComPly) tips, as well as small, medium, and large Shure ""olive"" silicone tips. There's an ear cleaning tool, and a rather nice zip-up carrying pouch.

LOOKS: Prepare to explain to people how any why these IEM's are shaped this way, have a cable that disconnects, etc. - people intrigued by how different these are. They're definitely a change of the status quo. I do think the semi-clear casing looks really cool.

BUILD: For being in my backpack or in my ears all day, these have held up great. There's no visible damage, and nothing has broken. One thing I am scared of, though, is the cables breaking. The connection between the earphone and male socket on the cable has become loose over time, and although it is not broken, it feels like it could break at some point. Otherwise the cable is great. None of the logos or lettering have come off. The silicone ear tips have been great, however the ComPly foam tips started breaking down after about a year. That's nothing out of the ordinary, though. The carrying case has not had any issues and it's still my primary form of storage and travel for the IEM's.

COMFORT: Aside from custom-molded IEM's, these easily are the most comfortable I have owned. I've never gotten a headache or any kind of discomfort from wearing these. When the ComPly tips are used, absolutely everything around you is completely blocked out, and the earphones stay put in your ears, no matter how much you shake your head. I generally use the silicone tips, as I like hearing a bit of ambient noise while working out, biking, etc. Make sure to carefully select the right tip size for you, as the wrong size can completely change the sound and can hinder the comfort. I normally run the cable through the back of my shirt and into my pocket so the cable isn't flying around everywhere.

SOUND: I'm no audiophile, but I have had a decent selection of mid-range headphones over the years. For the money, I believe these are some of the better sounding IEM's you can buy. The high range is a bit more prominent than I would like it, but it rolls off before it starts to get ""shrill"". Cymbals and higher notes (like in some electronic music) are decent, but high vocals sound great and flow smoothly. I feel the major lacking area for these earphones is the midrange. The detail is okay, but it is not defined as much as I think it should be. Deeper (male) vocals and string instruments take a backseat to the other sounds, like the bass. Speaking of the bass; it is not overpowering, but the bass dominates the midrange and doesn't have much clarity. For an IEM, it hits well and definitely has power, but I think it can be toned back a bit and made more detailed. I listen to lots of hip-hop and electronics music, and that's definitely where these earphones shine. If you're listening to lots of rock, woodwind instruments, or genres of that nature, you'll probably notice the lack of midrange. It's not terrible, but it's there.

CONCLUSION: If you're looking for a good pair of IEM's that fit well and are very durable, these are definitely for you. If you're solely looking for audio quality, these may not deliver to your expectations, and you'll want to look elsewhere. However, from the standpoint of a complete package, the SE215's are extremely hard to beat. I think they're the best ""all-arounders"" you can get for $100 or less."
2140,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off let me say ""audiophiles"" are pretentious idiots. I'm a producer/audio engineer and I read these audiophile reviews and I start laughing. I love the fact that they are engage listeners but really their reviews are more of ego stroking then anything else. Anytime someone tells you they are an audiophile, take their review with a grain of salt because they are really no more knowledgeable then you are. It takes a LOT of training and experience (as in a college degree in psychoacoustics & 20 years of experience)to be able to be able to pick apart sound the way they try to. Personally I've only met a handful of people who were brilliant enough to be able to do that.

All the equipment in the audio chain is going to color the sound and what sounds muddy or distorted on one persons setup might sound crystal clear on another. Everyone's ears are different, no one has perfect hearing. Most people over a certain age lose the ability to hear certain high frequencies, so you have no idea if they will interpret the sound the same way you will. Keep in mind that it's all subjective and you really need to listen for yourself.

That said these are the best in ear monitors (IEM) that I have ever used and I've used some very expensive IEMs. Yes they color the sound just like anything else but they nailed exactly what I like. I love the bass response and on my setup they have a very well defined sound. I'm actually blown away by how much they sound like my Mackie and Genelec studio monitors (which have a more pronounced bass) and I think I can actually work using them (I have never felt that way before). I listened to a couple of my tracks on them and they sounded EXACTLY how they sounded when I made them, this is so crazy to me that it's almost absurd. These $99 IEMs somehow manage to sound as good as my professional studio equipment which cost me thousands of dollars. I'm blown away to say the least.

I would absolutely recommend checking them out and I'd advise you to listen to a variety of music from different sources (CD, MP3, home stereo, iPod, etc) before you make a decision. Don't be surprised if some songs sound terrible on them while others sound better then ever. The reason is the flaws in the production can be way more pronounced because the original artist/engineer might not have been able to hear what you can hear with these. The lesson here is quality doesn't always make for a better listening experience, sometimes the lack of fidelity and a bit of distortion can actually make the music more enjoyable. Which is why its so laughable when audiophiles go on and on about clarity, fidelity and frequency response.

As for the build quality & wire, etc.. it's all top notch.. The ability to replace damaged wires is just excellent and I really think that I'll get my money's worth out of them (even if they die in a year)..

N-Joy"
2141,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first saw these shure earphones, I loved the design of them specially the clear ones, but when I started reading the reviews here on Amazon I was disappointed and didn't buy them right away, instead I bought the se215's special edition which come in a nice blue had better reviews and four days after I got them I started experiencing a problem that many reviews have stated which is the left earphone cutting out and I ended up returning them. I was even more disappointed since they didn't work properly, but I decided to buy the regular se215's despite the many bad reviews mainly because I really like the design of them, but instead of buying on Amazon I went to my local guitar center store, they had them for the price and I also bought their pro coverage for 2 years, which covers pretty much anything from physical damage to hardware damage, I ended up paying $120.00 I've had them for a month now and I haven't experienced any problems at all, and I rest assured that if anything happens I can just take them back and get a new pair or get credit for them."
2142,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I bought this last January and here are my thoughts:
*The packaging is good. It may look like it's not durable and it is fragile but actually it is.
*Design is satisfying. The Clear veraion looks more premium. The wire is too long but reasonable that's why I bought an extra cable. The memory wire looks worrying when bended too much. Foam and soft flex tips plus pouch/case are great!
*Sound quality: Very detailed indeed and the bass is really prominent with the thumps but balanced with mids and highs. It sounds very clean and refreshing. I listen to any genre and so far, they satisfy mebeyond expectations. I owned a Shure SeE210 before and I find it to be similar with the sound. It felt like a refinement from the previous product with enhanced bass. It's pleasant to my ears.
*Overall, it's worth the investment."
2143,1.0 out of 5 stars,"One side works, then doesn't work, then works, doesn't work. Been 3 months. Should have returned earlier. Actually, should have not bought them. Beware. Sound isolation good. Sound quality no better than $20 earphones."
2144,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like headphones. More than that i like sound. I'm not an audiophile by any means. I can drop a couple of key words, which i will shamelessly do below. If you're looking for a pair of headphones that sound incredible, albeit for the slight inconvenience of familiarizing yourself with the bendable ear wire, then you should consider these seriously.

Construction:
Strong cords, which are exchangeable in case of damage.
The cord is the most vulnerable part of any headset. Usually people will look after the drivers, but bend the cord in all sorts of interesting positions. Not only are the cords in this item unbelievably strong and comparatively resistant to tangling, they are reinforced at each end where bending would have the most pronounced consequences. They are also long, and exchangeable. In my experience, this is incredibly unusual at this price bracket. It becomes more common with higher end headsets.

The drivers are sturdy and look like they will stand a bit of abuse. If you're feeling like being careful Shure provides a rugged partially soft case composed of what looks and feels like ballistic nylon.

I backpacked for 3 months using these as my only headset and they are still going strong 8 months later without any new parts.

Sound:
incredible. akin to something that would cost at least 3 times as much.
Balanced sound, lacking slightly in the sub bass range. Excellent separation, while still sounding warm. The soundstage is warm and wide, with limits as expected for anything short of <$3-400.
If you like bass enhancement, consider using an EQ. But the composition is pretty good as it is. Can handle a wide of variety of styles with ease - jazz, blues, acapella, and especially tech/min house. If you mainly listen to hip hop and dubstep etc etc that really thrives on the lower bass ranges, these may not suit your style. However, listening to Danny Brown and RTJ right now, and im feeling just fine.

Comfort:
You can wear these for days. Ive fallen asleep in them many times without issue. Shure provides foam and plastic earpieces, with the foam being more comfortable and isolating outside noises so you can enjoy the music undisturbed. Ideal for exercising considering the stability added y the flexible wire. As mentioned previously, not ideal for riding a bike. However, it might be bad idea to wear wearing earbuds while riding a bike anyway.

Style:
Look solid in black. Although they arent the most svelte, and may not suit some peoples preferences. You will, however, garner the respect of anyone that knows what youre wearing and may even be asked out for drink by fellow appreciators.

Overall:
I think these are the best earbuds i have ever owned. If you like the bass attenuation of Beats etc, then please go ahead and buy those. However, if you appreciate nuances of sound and would like to hear songs in a more accurate representation of what the artist intended, then these might serve you better. Horses for courses. I will happily buy another set if mine ever need replacing, or i might take the leap and buy the next model up. For all the getting used to it takes to actually put them on, this minor factor is, for me at least, blown out of the water by absolutely everything else the headphones have to offer.

Disclaimer: Admittedly, i end up using my Sol Airtracks Wireless a bit more, because their bluetooth capability is pretty convenient. The Shure still sounds better though, and i would use them more often if they could keep that quality while providing a bluetooth option. Probably hard with the current Bluetooth protocols though, despite APTx. Good luck with your decision!"
2145,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you just need a killer pair of earbuds this is a good buy. Unfortunately I didn’t find out until too late that the microphone (or perhaps it’s the microphone placement) is just no good. Everyone I spoken to on the phone has complained about how poor I sound. Again, as for earbuds - they are by far the best I own."
2146,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good feeling and sound is amazing. Very smooth with no harsh additions to the original sound source. Very well balanced.
For the first time could really detect the difference between a lossy MP3 recording compared to a FLAC recording of the same music stream. They are very quiet when inserted correctly. The process of putting them on will take some learning to get optimum sound blocking and still be comfortable. If the bass seems light then they are not in correctly. With a good seal to the ear canal the bass is smooth as butter and the high end amazingly clear. The over the ear cords are quite nice. Wish I had these many years ago."
2147,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I asked for these for Christmas and Santa was very good to me. I wanted them specifically to use when falling asleep. (My wife likes to fall asleep to the TV - I prefer music.) They are extremely comfortable, especially with the foam pads, and because they fit nicely flush in your ear, they're perfect for my needs. Very good sound quality and noise isolation. Almost too good on the N.I, I.e. if you need to hear the things that go bump in the night, these may not be the best for you.
The cables are very durable and tangle free (so far). The cables are also somewhat rigid as the wrap around your ear which makes them somewhat form-fitting. They do take some practice putting on because the cables rotate freely at the base of the earphone itself. I've found that if you loop the cables over your ears first, it doesn't take much to get them into your ears."
2148,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To start off, I own both pair of iem ear phones M6 pro and Shure SE 215. However, I bought m6 pro first. Whoever said M6 pro is better than this Se215 are wrong. SE 215 got much much Bass and overall sound stage. I did not burn Se 215 yet but it still sound really good. In the another hand, M6 pro is showing off with the price tag. I bought it at 60$(Now is 40$). In that price, it one of the best iem out there. Why I get another one? It didn't impress me much. I also own beat studio and audio technica m50x . This Shure SE215 is definitely sound better than Beat. Only Beat win in Bass sound. Last of all, if you are on the budget go for M6 pro, it will give you Beat sound without Bass. I would highly recommend Shure SE215."
2149,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These were a gift. They are the best ear buds I've ever owned. Klipsch is the only brand even close. I've tried Beats, Monster, GaGa, Bose, Skull Candy, Harmon Kardon, these sound better than any of those. One thing you truly need a pair of double or triple flanged earbud tips to mitigate the fit. They will be extremely more comfortable with the double or triple flanged tips. Other than that they are sturdy, come with a case, extra tips (single flange), and a removable, replaceable cord like many other high end earbuds. They are AWESOME, and at this price a steal."
2150,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the sound while it lasted. I had read reviews about how one of the earpods goes bad. It worked fine for a little over a year until one fine day it just stopped working. One ear went blank. I interchanged the cord to see if it was a cable issue but no, it was the earpod that had just died. I tried numerous revival tricks suggested on the internet but nothing worked. Its very disappointing to purchase something, which isn't cheap, only to find it doesn't last. While many people have had a good experience with these, there are quite a few who have had similar issues. While it lasted, i liked it. Took good care of it and used it as recommended. But i won't recommend something that isn't designed to be more durable, which is a shame really."
2151,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The budget SE115 phones utilize a better dynamic driver, in my opinion at least, than the newer SE215. Shure cheaped out on their new models, and made a worse driver in their SE215 (replacement of the SE115) to save money. Moreover, a lot of people, not just me, on headphone forums agree that the SE115 (and the previous generation of shures, e.g. SE420, SE530) have a much more comfortable fit and seals better, which translates into better sound quality.

The SE215 gets 2 stars for looking cool, but the sound quality is nothing without a good fit. Go with the previous generation shures instead (SE115, SE210, SE310, SE420, and my favorite, the SE530/SE530-PTH/E500-PTH)."
2152,3.0 out of 5 stars,"On my second pair of these in maybe 2 years or so. First pair lasted me pretty damn good. I did kind of mess them up while biking across campus one day, but they still worked really well till I lost them. Enter second pair. Have had them for maybe 4 months at most, pretty much just using them when I’m at the gym, and keeping them in their case. A couple dates ago, the right side started bugging out and loosing sound. It would come back on, but now to the point where it doesn’t work really at all. There is still a little sound through it but nowhere near the other one. Don’t know if I can really recommend these anymore. On to research a new pair."
2153,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got my NEW 215 clear at a retail store, and after reading so many reviews and comments about this inear phone... I thought I should also give my comments too.

I had 2 SHURE inear phones few years ago, ""E"" series mostly the lower-end ones... those with cables that cannot be detact. They all lasted about 1.5years all with the same problem...damaged cables...resulting in failing on one side of the earphone. I did not get a replacement since it was after the warranty period, but the SHURE customer service was kind enough to explain to me that the damage was due to wear and tear + humidity & constant shifting of the cables at the end of the jacks.

I felt it was a pity that the cable were damaged but the speakers and components on the earphones were still good. But I was not able to afford the highend series of SHURE with detactable cables...years ago; those were expensive.

Now when I saw 215 with detactable cables I was very pleased. An entry level earphones with detactable cables is some thing not seen. This is a cool feature that cannot be found in entry levels. I could change the cables if damage....making it last much more.

The one draw-back I found after I got the 215 is that it really took me a while to wear them. Another issue that I had not thought of....my prescription glasses. The E series had softer cables & without any metal wire in the cable that loop over my ear...so it did not get in the way of my glasses, but the 215 cable (the cable to loop over my ear) have thicker and are wired with a thin piece of bandable metal....this WILL GET IN THE WAY with prescription glasses. So beware!

But I still think that the pros of the 215 out weight the cons. Too bad that I have not realized that about the cables getting in the way of and my glasses, but I have to live with it as I want a inear phone with detactable cable."
2154,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just over a year ago I was getting very frustrated with having to buy a new pair of earbuds every few month, as my Skullcandy and other familiar brand ones lasted only a little while. Whether the wire broke, one earbud was quieter than the other, or the cable could barely hold a connection, something always happened with each pair I owned, so I decided it was time for some ""luxury"" ones. I did my research and narrowed it down to these SE215 Shures and the Bose IE2s, both the same price (at the time, now the IE2s are $10 cheaper). What initially enticed me to the Shures was the unique design of the transparent casing, and also the fact that I had never heard of them before. Both seemed like good options, so I began reading reviews. The reviews for the Bose earbuds were generally positive, but for the Shure ones, I noticed extreme opposite opinions. Many claimed they had top quality sound, were comfortable, and were durable; on the other side, there were complaints about how one earbud got quieter or stopped working, and it seemed like a probable issue with buying these. Luckily, the Shures do have a 2 year warranty, and that removed my fear in the breaking headphone issue I have had. Because I was leaving for a long car trip the next week, I really wanted to buy a pair in time for them to arrive before I left, so I went with the SE215s. I could not have been happier with my choice, as they are so comfy, never do they hurt, I have not had one problem with the speakers, and the sound quality is superb (so good that I wouldn't even spend extra on the 315s, 425s, or 535s, although I'm SHURE they are fantastic!) And I still have this whole year to send them back for new ones if they do happen to break. With the 6 different fits and styles of bud inserts, there's bound to be a perfect fit for anyone. I highly recommend these earbuds, and definitely am buying from Shure when/if mine do break! And if you're wondering how they compare to the IE2s, the 215s keep the sound out way better, however both have similar sound quality. Lastly, you can take the earbud off of the wire for whatever reason, but I suggest not doing this as that might be the problem for why many people's Shures are not working. Sorry this is so long but I really want everyone to know how great these SE215s are!"
2155,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I will begin this review by stating that I am by no means an audiophile nor am I a demanding consumer when it comes to audio equipment. I don't know all of the technical aspects of headphones and I rely greatly on what people are recommending v. me comprehending all of the technical specs of a product. When I was in the market for a pair of headphones I had a few wants:

1) I wanted an in ear anal ear bud form
2) I didn't want full on noise canceling headphones, but I wanted most of the outside noise to be controlled for
3) I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg
4) I wanted them to last

When I received these headphones I was pleased on all fronts with their performance. They sounded great and appeared to be everything I was looking for. However after about 7 months the left ear bud began to crackle and slowly fade in volume. Eventually the left ear bud stopped working altogether. This was extremely disappointing to me as I had enjoyed their performance to date. I ended up receiving another pair as a gift and the results were almost identical. The performance started out great, but until about 6 months into the use of them, the volume in the same left ear bud began to crackle and fade away until it eventually stopped working completely.

I am not sure if I am just unlucky enough to get two bunk pairs or if perhaps I am just losing hearing in my left ear.

Because of the performance (or lack thereof) this non technical audiophile would not recommend this particular pair."
2156,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these both on-stage as in-ear monitors, and as my day-to-day earbuds.
The sound is pristine, the bass is great. As monitors, they allow me to hear my voice clearly through a dense mix.
But most importantly... I've used these nearly every day for *five years*, and only had my first problem with them today - the cord has worn out in one spot. Thinking I had to buy a new pair, I came here and realized that the cable itself is replaceable.

I'll probably end up spending the $30 to get the clear cable (makes it mostly invisible on stage), but I could replace them for $15 with a more generic version on Amazon. So that's a $100 product that I use every day, and requires $15 in maintenance every 5 years.

It seems like every piece of electronic gear I have is disposable / dies after a few years. The 215s seem like they'll be working fine after I've died of old age. Can't recommend them highly enough - you're making a purchase that could last a decade, instead of a slightly cheaper pair of earbuds that will fall apart after a year or so."
2157,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OVERVIEW:
I've had my clear 215s for almost two years now and they are perfect. I use them twice a week, every week, and they've never failed me. When I'm not using them I keep them in the case and try to take general, ""common sense"" care not to abuse them. (I don't just shove them in my pocket or throw them in a gig bag and then get mad when they break.) I've also used them for music on long, overnight road trips or on an airplane and they're fantastic. I don't do that often, and I'll explain later, but these earbuds are fantastic, especially at this price point.

FREQUENCY RESPONSE:
As a drummer I need clear, honest bass response, and that's exactly what they give me. Kick drums, low toms, and bass guitars all come through clearly and have the proper sonic definition and differentiation. Cymbals and electric guitars cut through cleanly without being harsh or tinny. Your EQ (or lack thereof) sent to your 215s is exactly what you'll hear.

NOISE CANCELLATION:
Noise cancellation is insane on these. Some may say it's too much cancellation, but as a musician I love it and I think it's completely necessary. I've been playing on stage with someone right next to me shouting in my ear and I couldn't hear a word of it. If my eyes were closed I wouldn't have known they were even there. If you're worried about not hearing the ""ambience"" of the room or feeling too isolated because of the high noise cancellation, have the sound guy patch a room mic into you monitor mix or IEM unit (Avioms, Behringer P16, etc.). You should have a room or crowd mic in your IEMs anyway, but that's another discussion for another day.

EASE OF USE:
Like all good ear buds, these should fit snugly and fully into your ears. The Shure label should face away from your head, and the cable runs out towards the front of your face and over your ear. I use the adjustable slider to keep the excess cable behind my head tight to my skull and out of the way. It will take a couple minutes to figure them out, but once you do you'll be set for the life of the earbuds.I always wear my 215s when I play live and I run the cable UNDER my shirt, against my skin, down my back. It looks cleaner and more professional, and you don't risk somehow snagging the cable on a mic stand or hand rail and ripping them out of your ears unexpectedly. The foam ""bud"" has held up to two straight years of use and an embarrassing amount of ear wax. I'm sure you can order replacement foam but I'm just gross and haven't looked into it.

IEM MONITORING VS. PERSONAL MUSIC USAGE:
I use these on stage as a performer (drummer, singer, guitarist). After 30 minutes or 4 hours of continuous wear they never become uncomfortable. I always keep both ear buds in accept for very infrequent, short amounts of time. Wearing one ear in and one out for an entire song or longer is unhealthy for your ears. (Your brain thinks it can't hear as well, so you'll want to pump more sound into the ""in"" ear. Higher sound levels damage your ears more quickly, even if you're not perceiving them as louder. Again, another discussion for another time.) As a performer who relies on clear IEMs, the 215s are fantastic. If you need dual, triple, or quad driver IEMs, you're gonna need to buy higher level Shures, Westones or 1964 Ears, and also spend 4-8 times as much. For Top 40, rock, jazz, blues, musical theatre, EDM, or anything really, the 215s deliver everything I need, even when I need particularly good bass presence.

If you're primarily looking for earbuds for listening to your phone or MP3 player, be aware that the 215s are designed with performers in mind. There is a lot of noise cancellation going on. If you're going for a run or driving a car, you don't want to block out the entire world. You could be putting yourself in danger by not hearing your surroundings. If you're in the passenger seat and want to ignore everyone else, these are a perfect choice. If you're driving and need to be aware of other cars honking, inclement weather, or that noise you've never had fixed and you've still got 540 miles to go, you may just want to use a cheaper pair of earbuds that don't block out the world around you. (You'll feel better about shoving $20 cheap-os in your pocket than the 215s anyway.)

DURABILITY:
Like I said, I've had mine for nearly two years and they've never let me down in the slightest. When not in use, keep them in the case and not in the bottom of a gig bag under 40 pounds of metal direct boxes. And please, for the love of everything sacred in this world, don't wad them up and shove them in your back pocket and sit on them all day long. That's just the worst thing. Just exercise general care for them and they'll be just fine.

TL;DR:
Even frequency response with good, clear bass. Noise cancellation is excellent for performers, so know that if you primarily need these for personal music listening while needing to be aware of your surroundings. If you take decent care of these, they'll last for a long time. Kind of funny to wear if you're not used to ear buds like this, but after 5 minutes you'll start getting used to it. Perfectly comfortable for extended usage time in one sitting."
2158,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me preface this review by saying I am a headphone/earbud fiend. I've bought almost every brand of personal earphones from Monster, Sennheiser, Apple, JVC, the like. I use my earphones for my iPhone/iPad/Mac and using in-ear-monitor systems while drumming. When trying to find a pair of earphones, I want to be able to hear a good bass and the mids to not fade into the background. Also, I want some noise isolation. The sound quality is fantastic right out of the box, because usually earphones have a ""breaking in"" time. These little earphones block out almost all outside noise. Usually when I have them in, when people talk to me, I have to take one out to hear them! The earphones' cord is based on a cord used for in-ear-monitors that makes these super comfortable to wear. The earphones are able to come apart from the cord to allow use of a cord made for iPhone (it's got buttons for phone calls) and if the cord breaks, you're not stuck replacing the whole set. Finally, Shure has a great support system if anything goes wrong. Get these earbuds. They're fantastic."
2159,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these headphones for something like four years now and I couldn't be happier.

The sound is incredible, it handles the bass when i crank it up and the treble always sounds incredibly sharp.

I love the form factor, very unique design and incredibly comfortable. They are the only earbuds I have ever found that I can wear while sleeping. The tips are easily replaceable and the foam ones (my preferred) are incredibly comfortable for extended use and don't get uncomfortable, like many other ones I've used before that hurt after an hour of listening or so.

Also incredibly durable, I have accidentally washed them on more than one occasion and they didn't skip a beat to this day, I'd love to upgrade to the nicer Shure headphones in their line when these give out, but who knows if they ever will!"
2160,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've now had these earbuds for about a year and a half. I think they sound great and the wrap-around-the-ear design is great for stability (although annoying at first). One of the main features of these is the replaceable cable. Here's been my experience:
Original earbuds: lasted 145 days
1st replacement cable: 248 days
2nd replacement cable: 253 days
So about 5 months for the original earbuds (a bit crap), followed by over 8 months per cable (fairly good).
I think this is a cost savings mechanism in the long run. Pay for $100 earbuds the first time, then $30 from then on but retain the $100 sound and quality. I'm sticking with them -- great earbuds."
2161,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great! Product. I'm loving it.
2162,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to most other in-ear headphones, the Shure SE215K has a significant amount of plastic which rests on the outside of the ear canal. In my experience, these ""appendages"" prevent the silicone rubber component from being positioned deeply enough into the ear canal to manifest much of the bass. As a result, while the clarity is quite good, overall, the sound consistently lacks depth and richness. If I press against them and force them to seat more completely, the sound quality improves significantly. Overall, I am somewhat disappointed and can achieve superior sound with other, less expensive in-ear headphones that I own."
2163,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First impression of unboxing these was the great sound isolation on these, which I wasn't expecting. Sound isolation wasn't even a criteria I was looking for when purchasing a new pair of IEMs. I'll go over a few aspects that made me really like these:

Comfort and Fit: I usually have a hard time with IEMs staying in my ears. A lot of models come with the interchangeable pads, but a lot of times they're just three different sizes. I like that these come with three different sizes in two different materials. I found the harder rubber inserts to fit better without slipping and once you get the right fit and seal, it really does make a difference in sound quality.

Lows: The bass really shine with these headphones. I tried several genres of music and each one had great response. Picked up the rich tones in classical, sufficed great with hard rock and, personally, I think sounded best with folk and R&B with a nice laid back sound. Bass wasn't overpowering though and added to the sound rather than created the sound.

Mids: I found this the weakest part of these headphones with some music. Male vocals sound a bit recessed and guitar a little muddled, but I expect this might open up with some burn in. Compared to my Senn HD600 and AKG K240M, these sounded weak, but that's an unfair comparison. For IEMs these still outperformed a lot of other models and I'm still hoping they'll develop a fuller sound. Having my music on shuffle I got Brighteyes Middleman, which started to change my mind on the mids. Strings and vocals sounded great on these, with vocals taking more of frontstage.

Highs: Not too much to comment on the highs yet. Out of the box they sound pretty good. I find the highs to typically be the most fatiguing for my eyes, but I didn't have a problem with this set.

Soundstage: The sound isolation really helps develop a soundstage for these, which is impressive for a set of IEMs. I expected more of an ""in your head"" feel to these but found with classical instruments were well placed. For this I listened to Grieg's Piano Concerto in A Minor and really enjoyed it.

Couple other pluses for these were the thicker gauge cable, which make these feel much sturdier than comparable models and the unassuming look which blend in, which is positive if you're not trying to draw attention to your valuables.

Overall these seem great and I hope that they get even better with some burn in time."

2165,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you love great sound then these headphones are for you. I have the Bose IE2 to compare these to. I thought they would seem awkward due to the way they go behind your ears but theyre not. They are very comfortable. The clarity of the sound is amazing. I had a short in the wire after a couple months. Shure replaces the whole set and had them back to me in less than a week. Great customer service.
2166,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never been a fan of running with headphones for two reasons: They always fall out of my ears, and running on the streets without full use of hearing seems dangerous. I am always on the look out for headphones that will stay in my ears while running for use on the treadmill or on trails.

I came across this article recommending the Shure SE215 for great sound quality and security in ear. I have always used cheap earphones that you can buy at the gym or Target so I was not familiar with the more high end products like Shure, Etymotic and Klipsch. My friend Lauren owns an audio supply company and gave me some Shure SE215 earphones to try out.

Immediately out of the box you can see and appreciate the quality of these earphones. They have 3 basic parts. 1. Ear foam acts like an earplug and blocks out almost all noise. 2. The driver produces the sound
3. The cord that attaches the driver to your music of choice.

After a 5 mile run the earphones are solidly in place. I never had to adjust them at all. I have found that the key to success with these ear phones is the fit of the earplug part. They come with 6 different sizes to fit any ear canal, so fitting should not be a problem for most people.

3 sizes foam and 3 sizes rubber and 1 tool for cleaning out the driver canal.

The noise isolation is really great with these earphones as well. I have used a pair of Beats Studio headphones and these earphones block an equal amount of ambient noise for 1/3 the price. The SE215 would be great to use on an airplane or anywhere you don't want people to bother you.

With the good sound isolation comes one drawback. They act like earplugs, so you can hear everything in your head. It is impossible to use these earphones while eating, the sound of your own chewing is immense. While running there is also a constant boom boom boom with every footfall, this may be distracting for some, it was easy for me to ignore.

Overall these are some really great earphones and I would recommend them to anyone who wants great sound and good sound isolation. Buy them here:[...]

2168,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these headphones for several months now, and I am so pleased. My friend has the top of the line shure ear phones ($500), and I spent a weekend listening to them, and decided that my collection of $5-30 dollar headphones just weren't enough. The shure se215 had just come out and had gotten some glowing reviews, so I took a couple extra tutoring jobs and bought these amazing headphones. You can tell the difference between the se535s and the 215s, but they are surprisingly close in quality, and way better than the bose headphones that a lot of my friends have. The audio is so clear, the sound isolation is fantastic, they are light and comfortable, and with the right music, they are magic. I did have to replace my first set because of a funky wire in the left earphone, but shure was great about getting them to me quickly and for free, they even covered the cost that I had to pay to ship the faulty ones back! Great product. Great service. I am hooked!"
2169,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are awesome. The sound quality is so clear and crisp, with strong, but not overwhelming bass. These headphones come with a lot of ear bud options in different sizes. The foam tipped ones are like memory foam for your ears and they conform perfectly to you once they are being worn. The soft cable that drapes over your ear can be formed to your ear as well, making these the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn (in ear or over head style). You cannot hear a thing when these are in, as they block all normal sound. I haven't been able to try them out in a louder setting yet, but I bet they would perform very well.

I can't speak to their durability yet as I just got them, but I think these are well worth the money for the quality of sound and comfort alone. If they last a long time and are durable, then they would be priceless. They could easily cost twice as much and be worth the money."
2170,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the older Shure SE115s a couple years ago. I loved them, even though the neck slide broke only a few weeks after getting them. Recently, the left bud stopped working, so I replaced them with these. Compared to the 115s, these are a pain to put on and actually hurt my ears--the ears themselves, not the eardrums--to wear, especially because of my glasses. The old design on the 115s was simpler and more streamlined; the 215s are more twisty and complicated, take longer to put and take off, are uncomfortable for long periods of monitoring, hover at times within your ear (creating poorer sound quality), and cannot be used without running the wire up and behind your ear, whereas the 115s could be used this way. You could just stick them in your ears and go, like traditional earbuds. And the sound was always impeccable.
All that said, when the 215s are in well and snug, and not hurting my ear cartilage, they work well. Also, using them while drumming works well because they are very secure in your ear. Lastly, if the wire was to break, the buds are removable so the wire can be replaced.
I should have done more research. I'm sending the 115s to Shure for repair. You should buy from that older line instead; these newfangled deals are too needlessly complicated."
2171,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a Shure customer for nearly 6 years or so starting with a pair of E3cs. They were astounding and showed me what I was missing using cheaper headphones. After some time, when the warranty ended, I thought it was time to upgrade to the SE 310s. These were also amazing with even more crispness and clarity in sound. The 310s, however, we're not very durable...the rubber casing around the buds eventually came off. Shure sent a replacement and I had the same problem within a year. So, then I saw what Shure did with their new models. The concept of trading out wires instead of replacing the whole pair was amazing to me and became the obvious economical choice.

I honestly was afraid that these would be a downgrade in the sound department compared to what I previously owned, but was I wrong. In a back to back comparison between these and my 310s, I feel that these have an overall better soundscape. The 310s were incredibly crisp on both the mids and highs, but a bit lacking in the bass, not too bad as I primarily is ten to classical music. These, even though a bit less crisp, had a touch more oomph in the bass which results in a much better balanced and rich sound across all genres. These buds particularly excel with electronic music with Royksopp, Animaal Kingdom, and Foster the People as examples.

Overall, these headphones are exactly what I wanted: something a bit more durable than my last two pairs, is a little better suited to make every genre sound great, and has wires that stay put behind my ears. My only beef has to do with the plug unit. My 310s were clearly designed with mobile devices in mind, fitting every case with ease. Why they went back to a traditional, pre-mobile device plug is beyond me and a major headache when it comes to looking for a case for my devices. I had to file away some of my ipad mini case so the plug would fit. This is why I rated it 4-stars. If Shure can fix this with new wires, I'll be a happy man.

Finally, Shure is my go to because of the great experience I've had with warranty claims. Anytime I've had a pair start to deteriorate, Shure has replaced my headphones at no charge and without question. I simply ship my worn out pair with proof of purchase and warranty forms to them and within a couple weeks have a new pair in the mail. The couple times I've called to make a claim, they've been friendly and helpful."
2172,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these for over a year and a half and the sound is fantastic, unequally by any other earbud in this price range that I've tried (and I've tried a few). However, they do suffer a design flaw. Basically they allow sweat to corrode the gold or otherwise break contact if one uses them in the gym for very long. This WILL happen unless you just happen to not sweat at all, so I wanted to post how I fixed the problem. To fix them, you need to clean and protect the contacts from additional corrosion (yes, Gold DOES develop oxidation under the salty acidic conditions of sweat). Buy a tube of DeoxIT® Liquid contact cleaner and, if you would rather not have to keep cleaning it every year or two, DeoxIT® GOLD Liquid protector. They are sold here for under $10 each for 2ml tubes. Just pull the ear buds off the wires, squeeze or spray the cleaner on both the female socket and male push pin, let it sit for a minute or so, wipe it off, then squeeze or spray on the gold protector on both too, wiping the extra off. Finally snap them back together! Viola! If you used the gold protector, now they won't cut out ever again, but even if you just use the cleaner, they probably won't cut out for many months or even a year.

11/6/2014 UPDATE - I've not had mine cut out now for over a year and a half from a single DeoxIT treatment and I work out with these all the time. Again, just spend the tiny bit of money and get the DeoxIT tubes (or at least just the cleaner). If you do, you'll not have a problem for a very long time."
2173,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not bother to write too many reviews, but this product is outstanding. I am an audiophile and enjoy great sound with headphones, speakers and an awesome JL stereo in my car. I am not an expert in earphones. I have purchased many earphones, especially for my 16 hour flights to Seoul, I am amazed at these Sure Earphones, they are amazing. I hear details I have heard in no other format. I do not know how they compare to other brands at this price, but I can tell you they are worth every penny. I am going to save up for some of the higher end Shure earphones just to see what else I am missing."
2174,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is decent and they do a great job keeping out noise but considering that the design of these lodges the tips in your ear canal I would expect them to accomplish that. Because of this design I experienced a mild discomfort only 10 minutes in. I even used the smallest tips given. The ear buds are on a swivel which makes popping these in your ears a little difficult. The wire is stiff and extremely long causing these to snag on objects as I walked by. Then only 3 days in the left bud started to give out. Overall a failed experience with these. Will probably go back to using the Bose ie2 or give the senheiser momentums a shot. I can confidently say these aren't for me but may be the ones for you
2175,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried many mmcx bluetooth cables including Shure, OKCSC, NICEHCK HB1, and MEE audio BTX1. So far I like Shure's cable best. I have an Iphone that doesn't support APTX which might of limit me from using the cable from the competitors to its fullest potential. So if you use your cable mainly with iOS devices, this is your stop. The sound quality of NICEHCK sounded best but the Shure didn't fall far behind. MEE cable sounded off to me. I'm no audiophile but I did notice that the whole frequency spectrum was not produced accurately to what my earphone should of sounded like when it is connected via wired cable.

I admit that I was going to returned the Shure's cable at first because the design seems horrible and because there was so much microphonic feedback coming from the wire form cable. One thing I cannot stand is microphonic reminding me that I am moving too much or even breathing for that matters. Fortunately, I have dealt with the se215's wired form cable before. It is not a surgical process but I've successfully removed it from the wired cable a couple years back so this cable was no different. Just a higher risk of screwing up since this wireless cable cost $80 more lol. As expected, the microphonic minimized and non-existent when using the chin slider.

As for the design, I find myself using the chin slider with the battery hiding behind my shirt most of the time. However, when I'm more active and doesn't want it swinging around, I tuck the cable from the left and right ear together behind my neck and use the chin slider to connect them together behind my neck. Now, the battery is hanging close to my neck right around the collar bone. The design of the MEE is the winner in this category because it is more convenient to throw it around the neck or under the chin with minimal effort. The NICEHCK is good but I wouldn't recommend it for active people who move around a lot because the magnetic clasp is fairly weak.

The range on the Shure's cable is as good MEE and NICEHCK. However, the Shure cable managed to one up the rest because of the multipoint connection. The battery is also better than the competitor. I don't listen to music very loud so I was able to get a good 9 to 10 hours before it spams me with the low battery notification. One thing I notice is that sometimes the signal will drop and stutter repeatedly if it is 100% charge or closed to that. I can be resolved by repairing it my Iphone or when the battery discharged to a certain level.

I am currently using Shure's wireless cable with my Pinnacle P1 NOT my se215. The reason for that is because the volume of the se215 is way too loud even when setting it to the lowest volume. Pairing the Shure's wireless cable to the P1 is more tolerable (still too loud) because it has a higher impedance. Specifically 50 ohms compared to 20 ohms of the se215. The hissing background noise is also not noticeable on the P1 but the definitely noticeable on the se215. This is proof that Shure's wireless cable was not made by Shure but it wear Shure's logo and name simply because of $$$. Since most people will pair the Shure's wireless cable to your beloved se215, expect the lowest volume of the wireless cable to be around 3/10 of the volume of the se215 when connected via regular wired cable with the additional background hiss.

There is a lot to love about this cable but I just cannot recommend this cable unless you don't mind the microphonic feedbacks coming from wire form cable around the ear. I hope Shure will give consumers more options as far as design go so that we can choose which design we want instead of a one size fit all as it is never to case in the real world."
2176,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my stars! Suddenly I'm hearing sounds I've never heard before, even on songs I've enjoyed for years. I can only compare these to cheaper models. I am not a musician and would not spend $200 on earbuds. I did need to replace the foam tips that came on them (I ruined them taking them off) but the buds come with an assortment of tip sizes. The buds are curved to fit inside your ear and the cord goes up and behind your ear. After a few times wearing, the cord sort of molds to the shape of your ear and the buds are easier to place. The ""up and over the ear"" may take a bit of getting used to, but hey, it's all what you're used to and these are worth getting used to!"
2177,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Rarely write reviews but I had a recent experience with Shure customer service that warrants mention here. I had a 10 year old pair of Shure ear buds. I loved them. after 10 years one side went out, no sound at all. I decided to send them in to repair in hopes they could be fixed because I loved them so much. I fully expected to pay to repair them. Shure just sent me a brand new pair of SE 215s no charge. I know this is probably a small thing to them but they earned a customer for life. Thanks Shure."
2178,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been on the search for high quality IEM's for a while now. I have tried: Skullcandy Titans and FMJ's, Monster Turbines, Sennheiser CX 880 and CX 400-II and now the Shure SE 215's. Monster definitely were the best up until these. My normal over ears are my Sennheiser HD 439's. They are not collapsable, so i needed some new buds to match the really great sounds my cans reproduce. Alrighty on to the review :~)

Sound: The clarity of these IEM's are incredible. Each layer is vivid and distinct while perfectly complimenting each other. I like a more ""warm"" sound, thats why I use Sennheisers for over ears. These buds have that same feeling. Very warm without being muddied and sacrifices the Highs. Lows are well defined between mid and sub bass levels. Bass heads will love these buds. Sound signature overall is VERY similar to the Monster Turbines (which are lightyears ahead of the Beats line).

Fit: This is where these IEM's outshine the turbines. Now it takes a little while getting used to the around the ear fit for IEM's (they were my first). You cannot feel them whatsoever once they are in your ears. They run flush in your ear so you can actually sleep in them without feeling pain in the side in my head. You really need to try out all the different tips to get the seal you need to have a great sound from this product. I personally use the large memory foam tips (I have big ears). Once all the above is met, these are by far the most comfortable IEM's I have ever used.

Build: Solid build quality. By far the best feature of this set is detachable cables. IEM's are famous for cord strain failure. I believe its only $15 to replace the cables from Shure's website.

Bottom Line: Get them. AT $100, i dare you to find a better set of IEM's"
2179,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I bought these, I was looking for sound quality above all else; these have certainly delivered. What amazes me the most is the midrange. Both the base and the highs are absolutely wonderful, but the midrange sounds like nothing I'd ever heard before.

When it comes to the fit, I found that they can be a little difficult. However, as long as you actually take the time to try the different eartips and find the best match, everything works out excellently. The foam tips will get the best seal (and hence the best sound), but I found that I couldn't always get a reliable seal; I would often have to fiddle around a bit before they were well settled. That said, the rubber tips (or maybe they're silicone, I'm not sure) will create a seal that is excellent, if just a little under the standard of the foam tips. I use the rubber ones because they're much less of a hassle to get a good seal with. Just pop them in, and you have a reliable, easy seal. During the first few weeks, I found that the rubber created a slightly unpleasant pressure (sometimes almost like the pressure changes one experiences while flying). However, the rubber tips slowly moulded themselves the shape of my ears, and they now fit without any unpleasant pressure. A good friend of mine who uses the foam has told me that they, also, have started to mould to his ears.

I've never really had any problems with the wire stiffness around my ears, after a week or so, they were quite firmly in the best position, and didn't unbend unless forced.

So a few months into my ownership of the Shure SE215-CL, I can honestly say that I have no regrets buying these earphones."
2180,3.0 out of 5 stars,"FIRST IMPRESSIONS: The sound quality may be great, but I am having a tough time getting these things into my ears. I have had two pairs of Shure in-ear-monitors in the past and they were both designed to go up and over the ear but they do not have to be worn that way. I have long hair and I wear them without going up and over the back. I can't really do that with these, so I'm at a loss. And I cannot judge the sound against the previous models either. But I will say that I am smitten by the sound my previous Shure IEMs offer in general, and the sound isolation they provide. I will give these some more chances to wow me."
2181,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First earbuds that I've ever purchased that sounded way above and beyond better than anything else that I've ever listened to presently! They sound like a smaller version of an on ear in your ear! Really amazing,just blown away by the sound for the price! I saw these rated in the vast majority of the sites for best earbuds under $100! I said to myself let's buy these and give them a shot,and I'm really glad I did!"
2182,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215 ($85 shipped from authorized dealer) represents a good value in my mind. These iems have bass, and I think the sound is a little warm overall. The music is cohesive and somewhat natural. It's not the last word on clarity or naturalness or neutrality, but it is very good at this price. Even the bass, which is very good for this price in an inner ear monitor (iem), is not as distinct, fast, proper decay, volume, and frequency as the best headphones - and probably won't satisfy a bass head. Still, sacrifices are made at this price, and the sonic signature suits me. Shure did not fail in any category with the SE215. The SE215 has enough bass to establish rhythm in noisy environments (better than many iems), and vocals are convincing, even if not great. The treble is rolled off too much. The soundstage is mediocre for an iem, bad compared to good open back headphones, and awful compared to great stereo speakers. :-) But I'm very particular. I think this iem is among the leaders of the pack at this price. I think the SE215 provides adequate sound quality for a trip on the commuter train and bus, even though I may want a little better. It certainly is possible that some other iem offers better sound in the apx. $100 category; however, I have heard relatively few iems. Still, my reference headphone system is more than adequate for me to judge the quality of iems.

The SE215 has something else going for it - the ruggedness you expect from Shure. For instance, I tried VSonic GR07 MKii Pro, which were clearly superior sonically - for a month. And then something happened to the Chinese iems and their sound quality dropped clearly below that of the Shure.

The Shure comes with a canvas bag, which I consider useless as I strongly prefer hard cases that resist crushing. The Shure also comes with a small selection of ear tips. None of the provided ear tips really felt very comfortable to me, but I am extremely sensitive to things stuck in my ears. I think I eventually settled for medium-sized black olive foam tips. The housing of the iem is rather large in my ear and if not positioned exactly right will press uncomfortably on the ridge of my outer ear. The cord is not microphonic and has a stiffness near the iems (memory wire), which allow it to form ear hooks behind your ear. They work fine, but I personally prefer separate ear hooks like those provided by VSonic. The memory wire just doesn't seem to fit behind my ear as well and maintain its hook shape.

It offers very good isolation, but not as good as Etymotic Research.

Although there are minuses - lack of quality accessories (ear hooks, comfortable tips for me, hard case), iem housing that's a little big, good sound quality (but not great) - for $85 I'd like to give it 4.5 stars. As I must choose 4 or 5, I'll be generous and give it a 5. Do note that my rating applies to value and is not on an absolute quality scale.

A couple of examples of other headphones that have been well reviewed in this price category include the Meleec CC51 ($80) and HiFiMAN RE400 ($100)."
2183,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because my old sennheisers PX200 died on me, and couldn't be happier with the purchase.
Sound quality: probably less detailed than the sennheisers I had. Bass wise these are definitely better, but perhaps too bassy if you like a really flat presentation from your headphones. However, even the top audiophile open headphones couldn't compete with these little guys in a noisy environment.
Isolation: this is the main reason I bought these earphones. I travel by plane quite often and was tired of not being able to listen to many types of music due to the ambient noise. Even the sennheisers I had were not enough for this type of use (though they were great for street use, something I wouldn't recommend the shures for).These cans really shine in this department! I could listen to Ravel's bolero, since the first drum snares! No music will be out of your reach anymore. Also, as the music doesn't have to compete with outside noise, you can keep the volume at very low levels, hence preserving your ears from damage...
Comfort: weird to use at first, and it's frustrating to put these on and then having someone to speak to you so you have to take them out again. Besides that, they sit comfortably in your ears. I've used them non-stop for 4 hours, and could still keep on (on ear headphones tend to put too much pressure over your ears, so they end up hurting). Also, as you can listen to music at lower levels, your ears don't get tired so easily. Also, the fact they are so small and lightweight means you can even drop them in your pocket (try that with the Monsters that are so popular nowadays, or with the noise cancelling phones and their batteries). These come with 6 different types of tips, so you shouldn't have any problem finding the one that best fits your ears.
Construction: seems great, with a kevlar reinforced, removable chord.
Beware: as the noise isolation is so good, I wouldn't recommend these headphones for any situation where you shouldn't completely isolate from the outside world. While you are wearing these little cans, you are, to all effects, completely deaf for the rest of the world.
Overall: great travel headphones. Good sound quality, great construction quality, incredible isolation. Reasonable price for what you get. Highly recommended."
2184,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought mine at a local Guitar Center store 4 weeks ago, and the first time I tried it on an Amon Amarth song (Valhalla Awaits Me), I was blown away. The sound quality is quite warm, highs are not stellar but they are great, mids are quite good, bass is deep and isn't muddy. Overall, these are perfect for heavy metal. Other genres? It's still does a decent job.
Tip:
The foam tips will give you emphasized midrange and highs, rubber tips give you deeper and warmer bass."
2185,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these for use with my motorcycle helmet. They didn't sound as good as a pair of $40 earbuds I got from Sony, but they didn't sound bad. About 4 months in, the cable broke internally at the point at which it connected to my phone. So I had to shell out another $30 for another cable from Shure. They continued to work for about a month, then the right earbud just flat out stopped working for no discernible reason.

These are garbage. They will not last. And while they do work, they're overpriced for the sound quality you get. Never buying from Shure again."
2186,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I see lots of reviews calling these headphones or something similar. People saying how they don't work while jogging and such. Evidently these folks don't understand the purpose of these buds.

These are made by Shure. In case you're not familiar, this company makes musical equipment like studio headphones and microphones. They produce the industry standard dynamic mic, the SM58. As a professional musician I own many of their products from microphones to these earbuds. These are intended to be used as personal monitors onstage. They work with a wireless system so a musician can hear his/her voice and instrument in their ears while performing. They are not meant to be used while jogging, driving, working, etc.

Shure is known throughout the world for reliability of their products. I have seen the SM58 run over by a bus and still function flawlessly (I have pictures!). These buds perform well if used as intended. They will take a measure of abuse but anything will fail if misused. It's not the fault of the product but the user.

Just setting the record straight."
2187,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to agree that these are far superior to the Dre earbuds being sold by Apple. I want earbuds that will stay comfortably in my ear for long airplane flights. These will. The Dre earbuds start to cause tenderness and irritation after an hour or two.

When I'm on the treadmill these will stay in place and cancel out most of the external noise. The Dre earbuds will start to slip out after awhile and I have to repush them back in every 15 seconds or so. Wish I could get my money back from the Apple store."
2188,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound to these headphones are great. The noise reduction is very good as well. The downside is I get a lot of noise on my phones and computers. It seems that it picks up the static noise if you don't have a good or isolated sound card.

Comfort: The housing to the speaker is a little bulky for my ear and it puts a lot of pressure on the external cartilage. It hurts after a while and when I remove them, my ears are very happy to be free of the pain.

I just replaced Bose IE headphones with these shure se215. The sound is worth it, but the comfort and noise are giving me some buyers regret. Bose were the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned, although quality and durability were middle of the road. SE215's heavy and detachable cord make this better for me durability wise because I will use them everyday (unless they are just too uncomfortable to do so). We will see......."
2189,1.0 out of 5 stars,No
2190,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing headphones (I bought 'em twice!) but with the one (kinda serious) caveat that the cables are garbage and inevitably fail after a year or so if they aren't already trash when you get them. I've probably ordered 5 or 6 of just the cables to replace ones that fell apart or came faulty. Thankfully they're replaceable but not cheap enough ($20+) where it's a negligible cost when it happens.

I also highly recommend the blue bass-edition from japan. Super bassy, amazingly clear."
2191,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the 100% best earbuds for the money. They are high quality, high performance and well worth it. The first pair I bought, I was like ""What kind of idiot pays $100 For earbuds?"" Well, they are worth it. If you love your music and full bass? Make the investment. I almost bought the SE315s. But, I figured close to $200 when the $100 pair blew my mind was a bit extravagant. One day I may splurge for the 315s. But, Shure SURE knows what the hell they're doing with earbuds."
2192,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I compared these headphones to the Shure SE535 headphones ($500) just to see what I was missing by buying the $100 single driver version.
There are two major difference that jumped out at me.
First the $100 SE215s have a much fuller/thumpier bass. I happen to like it, but it does sound less accurate than the $500 SE535. (I should say that I am not doing critical mixing or stage monitoring with these, just casual listening, so for that a little extra bass is nice).
Number two, there is a definite scoop on the SE215 in what I would call the mid-mids (maybe leaking slightly into the mid-highs). In this range the SE215s loose some definition and feel a little thin. I noticed this before doing my comparison and it was proven out when I listened to the SE535s.

While these are noticeable traits and less than perfect, I don't think I'll ever feel bad about spending $100 for the SE215s. They have great isolation, great fit for me, and very enjoyable sound."
2193,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a heavy user of my IEM's. After going through 2 pairs of Klipsch S4's I decided to try out an IEM which came with a detachable cable. I'm happy to say that after over 2 years of using these earphones daily (and treating them quite roughly) they're still my daily driver. Although I've had to go through 3 pairs of cables (2 stock, 1 third party), the drivers themselves are doing just fine with no sign of wear other than the Shure text fading off.

I won't comment too much on the sound, since there are more qualified reviewers to do so. I will say that they do deliver as expected at this price range, and the noise-isolation and bass quality is great. Don't hesitate to buy!"
2194,5.0 out of 5 stars,I received these as a gift from my late uncle who was a complete audiophile at the time circa 2012. The lows and mids these are able to produce is astounding and I used these daily for years until they were stolen. I'm looking forward to purchasing another pair now that I see the price has come down quit a bit over the past years.
2195,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the nicest earphones in terms of sound quality, durability, and for blocking outside noise. These are perfect for any situation where you don't want or need to hear anything outside your music. Great for airplanes, long car rides, loud public places, studying, etc. I'll even use them to fall asleep when my roommates are still partying or being loud when I'm going to bed. When exercising, you can wear them pointed up and have the cord wrap over and around the backside of the ear for a more secure fit. I like to use the foam tips: they're like the earplugs that you squeeze and put in your ears, and then they expand to the shape of your ear canal and block outside noise.

As a company, Shure supply's almost every big name musician and performer at large large venue shows with both their high quality earphones and microphone equipment. They far exceed every other brand in terms of sound quality produced. For noise blocking earphones on a $100 budget, there's no reason to get anything other than the SE215's. They'll even replace them for free if you keep a receipt, and they've done this for me and other people I know with their earphones that have broken long after a 2-year period. I had the first generation model for a while and the cord malfunctioned and they upgraded me to the newer model at no cost.

With this current model they've deigned the earphones so that the cord detaches from the buds at the base of your ear, so that if and when the cord breaks, you don't need to go buy a whole new pair, just replace the cord. This is also great for if and when you want to upgrade to their higher end models like the SE315, SE425, and SE535 (each higher number is about $100 more than the previous) because the cord works for all of the current SE series earphones. Just swap out the buds on the same cord. Once you try any model of Shure's earphones, you will never want to buy another company's earphones. They come with a few styles of different tips, each in small, medium, and large, and their carrying case is quite nice. Ask anyone you know with Shure earphones and they will gladly tell how how awesome the earphones are. 10/10"

2197,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned several models of Shure in ear monitors for over 5 years. They've been used on-stage ,on the job, yard work, out in the garage, long drives to engagements and every other space where I need to block out the noise. They are an introvert's best friend. They are so reliable, I've replaced the cables multiple times for the same drivers. Right now, I'm wearing an inferior set of UEs I was forced to dig out of the junk drawer. Seems we were an hour late feeding our cat Jasper the other night. When we arrived home, dismembered pieces of my last pair of SE215s were scattered all over the kitchen carpet. Jasper knows all too well what must be done to ensure that the sacred hour of supper is never again forgotten. Absolutely nothing was salvagable even biting the nips off the drivers... he is thorough. No worries, Jasper is fine and loved, but from the distance, I suspect he realizes he went a bit too far. Seriously, highly recommended, only the most discerning audiophile will be able to differntiate the single from multiple drivers. At this price point, the build and sound quality is hard to beat. Given the foam inserts are going to absorb your best funk, keep them away from pets."
2198,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used Seinheiser CX300 (around $70) for 3 years and then one channel stopped working I bought this entry level Shure.

Sound is good for $100 earphones but it gives inconvenient feeling in the ear channel, over the ear cable wear makes the phones hard to install. (it is not really hard, bur require additional effort comparing to CX300 where installation was done in one single move with one hand)
Wires are extremely non flexible and thick.
The 3.5 jack is extremely thick and will not fit to iphone 4 bumper phones hole

I use it for 2 weeks already and trying to get used to it, but still feel pain in the ear channel after long wear (i tried several soft and rubber cushions already).

> UPDATE
after 2 years i love it - tried to replace - no chance for ie2 or westone1... and i'm changing its to 5 star."
2199,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these earbuds approximately one month now, and I couldn't be more satisfied. When looking to purchase earbuds, I did a ton of research and ended up choosing these. I am not an audiophile, but I do care a great deal about sound quality. I wanted a headphone with realistic sound, a head phone that allowed me to pick up on every detail of the music. To me, these do just that.

The musical versatility is great as well. I can go from listening to jazz or Western art music, where the sound is very clear and each instrument is easily heard, to dropping a ton of bass with some dubstep. I really like how these earbuds do not over-exaggerate the bass. Have you tried listening to Beethoven with Beats headphones? It's awful. Their desire to blow your skull up with bass only make listening to certain genres of music enjoyable. The bass the Shure SE215 earbuds make is true to the music; if the music has a lot of bass, these headphones will provide some head thumping lows. If the music doesn't have a lot of bass, these headphones will make the music sound lively with great mid and high tones.

I would not recommend getting these earbuds for use with activities, such as weight lifting, running or sports. They block out so much noise that you only hear the music playing. This can make these activities dangerous. It is impossible to have a conversation with someone while these are in.

TL;DR Version...

THE GOOD:
-Great, realistic sound
-Deep, head bumping bass when appropriate
-Noise isolating
-Quality feel
-Thick cable that is replaceable
-Traveling case included

THE BAD:
-Headphones are inconvenient for short use (they have to set, you can't just stick them strait in your ear like normal earbuds)
-The cable is hard for a few inches below the earbud connection, making the cable get caught easily while moving with these
-Headphones are not suitable for physical activities due to noise isolation

I would highly recommend these earbuds. They are a great way to escape the noisy world and enjoy your music on a whole other level."
2200,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just want to start with saying that while these In-ear-monitors (IEM) will function as regular headphones with phenomenal sound, be aware of what you are buying...these are not IEMs designed for runners, bikers, or for anyone really where noise cancellation is dangerous, they are designed to be used as IEMs for performers where external noise can be distracting or cause you to lose important information that you need to be hearing...

I myself am a bass player and I need IEMs that will stay in my ear, provide great low-end, and have extreme clarity, and these are absolutely perfect for me. These things sound phenomenal, are rugged enough to withstand a fair bit of abuse that comes with playing live music (I myself am a fairly animated musician), and they stay in your ear. The sound isolating is fantastic...the mix stays in my ears without all of the distraction and muddiness of the live audio blasting and reverberating throughout the room dirtying up the sound.

For any musician who is running IEMs and doesn't want to spend a fortune of higher end IEMs from companies like Alien Ears, Westone, etc., the Shure SE215 does a stellar job for a great price. I would never recommend trying to get by with standard headphones, while they get the job done they don't do the job near as well as these IEMs. Again, just be aware that these are not designed to function like your standard earbuds and may not the best option for runners, bikers etc."
2201,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was in love with my prior SE535 which developed cable issues. The SE535 had a good fit, fantastic sound, but couldn't justifiably shell out $400 for another pair, so was pretty chuffed to see the similarly-shaped SE215 come along at $100 and with a detachable cable. The sound was good (not SE535 quality of course) however the swivel on the cable makes them slightly more difficult to get the memory of the cable right making the fit more difficult. This possibly lead to the cable breaking earlier -- it's broken in two places within a year. The detachment mechanism has become bent so won't be able to replace the cable after all.

If you truly want to get rid of cable issues, I believe wireless is the way to go."
2202,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are awesome IEMs. I can't speak of them highly enough. Other reviewers have already written about its qualities, so I won't go over that. I'd just to add that I bought these and Shure's SE315 to decide which ones I'd like most. To my ears, there is no comparison. The SE315 has a much more flat, boring, cold, sound... So ""analytical"" that it makes the songs sound weird, really different from their original mix. The SE215 on the other hand have plenty of bass, slightly recessed mids (not to the point of shadowing vocals, actually rock vocals sound great on these), and present, perfect, controlled highs, not fatiguing at all. I have tried like 15 IMEs to date, some cheaper, some more expensive, but these are hands down my favorites (followed close by JVC’s HA-FX T90). Once you get used to the over-the-ear cable thing of these, I must say they are really comfortable. And be sure (pardon my quibble) to use Shure's olives ear tips, they are absolutely the best, better even than Comply's."
2203,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the absolute best generic in-ear headphones you can buy for less than $1,000.

I'm a touring professional monitor engineer (which means I wear these for my job, mixing in-ear monitors for musicians on stage), and my primary set of in-ear monitors are custom molded JH Audio JH13's. They have 6 drivers in each ear (2 for lows, 2 for mids, 2 for highs)...12 drivers total. They sound great and they cost $1,100. I can honestly say that in a blind listening test, I think the Shure SE215's could beat my JH in-ears. I always keep a pair of these with me and sometimes I prefer using them over my custom JH13 in-ears.

The other major companies that make professional in-ear monitors are Ultimate Ears, Westone, Sensaphonics, and Sennheiser...There are a ton of other companies that make in-ears, but are mostly aimed at the consumer market and not the professional audio market. I can tell you that the pro audio products are way better quality and value than the consumer brands. You may have tried Beats and Bose and every other colorful trendy brand, but those are nowhere CLOSE (Beats is the worst) the the sound quality of a true pair of professional in-ear headphones. Read the other positive reviews to hear how people describe the sound of these. I mainly wanted to write a review from a professional sound engineer's perspective to validate some of the claims other people are making.

There was a ""shootout"" at NAMM within the last couple years with all the top in-ear companies and these won 2nd place in a blind listening test. That's competing with ALL models up to the $2000 range. These are $100. That's just unbelievable.

There's a review here by Steve Oz that mentions you've got to use these for a few weeks before they really get broken in, and he may have a point. I've only used pairs that have already been broken in, so I don't think I've heard a pair right out of the box. Makes sense though.

One note about the (few) bad reviews. It seems all the people giving these 1 star have said that they *keep* breaking even when they are replaced. I would attribute that to user error. Either overdriving the headphones (listening to loudly) for extended periods of time, getting them wet with too much sweat, not coiling the cable properly when storing, or generally being too rough with them. These will last a long time if you use them properly and you don't blast your eardrums. I have artists that use these exact in-ears every night (while sweating and dancing around) for 2-3 hours at a time and they last for 1-2 years without issues (which is longer than a lot of other more expensive brands). The only artists that end up ""breaking"" these and having to send them in for repairs are the guys that crank their in-ear packs up way too loud :)

If these do not blow you away, there is something wrong with the pair you got or something is wrong with your head. First try another pair. If that doesn't work, try another head.

Happy listening :)"
2204,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't have enough experience with audio equipment to properly rate these, but coming from the 115s, I find these to be pretty similar - can't hear too much difference even when compared side by side. The different earpiece design however takes a bit of getting used to, though the over-the-ear tubing helps keep them in place (increases tangling though). I do miss the two part cable that the S115s had - made it easier to untangle the cable at times and easier to put on while wearing a shoulder bag. Finding the S115s on sale for $60 is worth waiting for when these are more than 2x that for hardly noticeable increase in quality."
2205,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Use these almost every weekend. Great isolation on noisy stages. There's a little bit lacking on the bass frequency response, but good clarity. Detachable/replaceable cable is a huge bonus as I often get opens/shorts in almost all of my headphones. I would probably want different inserts for everyday listening, but the foam ones are great for performances."
2206,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones to replace 8 year-old Shure E2c's, and I've now had them for about a year. Despite sounding amazing, I'm ultimately not able to use them as often as I'd like due to two major flaws. Without these flaws they would be 5 stars like my E2c's. With them they're only 3 stars.

Here's a list of the pros and cons from my experience.

Pros
-As with the E2c's, the SE215's produce beautiful, balanced sound (if you're looking for unnatural bass look elsewhere).
-The silicone sleeves work just as well as the foam ones, but don't require that you hurriedly squish the foam and jam them in your ears in order to get a good fit.
-They stay in place even when moving vigorously.
-The cord is the perfect length for me.
-The sound isolation is exceptional.

Cons
-The plug is very large (1cm diameter), and I have to take the bumper off of my phone in order to use these headphones.
*The right headphone went dead at about 9 months which Sure replaced under warranty. The replacement process took 3 weeks.
*The killer for me, though, is the deafening ""booming"" I hear whenever I take a step with these in. Going for a walk as I try to listen to a podcast is basically the podcast competing with the ""BOOM-BOOM-BOOM"" as my feet strike the ground, and that's with foam-soled running shoes on! To get an idea of what this is like, stick your fingers in your ears and go for a walk. It's nearly that bad.

The bottom line: if you're looking for a set of headphones that you can wear at your desk, then these are great. Just don't exercise in them, and make sure you have a backup pair for when you need to have warranty work done!"
2207,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones rock!. I have had them about 3 years and the sound is incredible. I have about 10 acres I have to mow every week in the hot Florida sun and use these on my riding mower. They are above average in sound and durability. The earphone drivers can even be removed to replace the heavy duty kevlar cord (I have never had to replace it) which can be purchased separately. One bit of advice: When I first purchased these I used them a few times and then set them aside because I could not figure out how to make them comfortably fit in my ear. I read a review about a year later that had the same issue but encouraged the user not to give up but to persist until you figured out how to put them in your ears just right. I dug them out and gave them another shot and he was right. Once you figure out the angle and the side (they are side specific) to put in they do great and fit well. They will not fall out. The over the ear stiffer part of the cord allows you to mold it over the top of your ear to help hold the earphone perfectly in place. (Hint: Focus on getting the earphone at the right angle in your ear before you pay any attention to the over the ear wire. That part actually swivels on the earphone so it can be adjusted where needed after the earphone is place in the ear at the perfect angle for your ear.) I recently misplaced my SE215's and have been using an assortment of different earphones. From bluetooth to over the ear phones. They all sound cheap and tinny compared to my SE215's. I am biting the bullet and ordering another pair today. Do the work until you figure out how to get them in your ear just right and you will fall in love with them.
2208,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easily the best headphones $100 can buy. I've had many different higher end ear buds over the years (Klipsch, Monster) and in my opinion these rival competitor headphones that cost twice as much. They're comfortable, extremely sound isolating, sound fantastic, and due to their over the ear wire design stay put even while running. I honestly have heard parts of songs that I've listening to for years that I've never heard before.

Top all this off with the ability to replace the cord which always seems to be the failure point of all headphones? No one else offers that.

To my ear they do seem to have a break-in period, so give them a week or so of regular use before you make any knee-jerk decisions."
2209,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good, I bought these at guitar center a few days ago for 108 because I needed a nice pair of headphones that could I guess just make me go into a ""happy place"". The sound is amazing and I love the foam tips, I primarily listen to rap/ hip-hop and these headphones are perfect for bass while still keeping vocals clear. The noise cancellation is also amazing, I used these on half volume while mowing my lawn and I couldn't even hear the mower which came as a big surprise to me. So far these headphones are amazing in every aspect, but keep in mind I have only had these for a few days so if anything happens I will edit my review."
2210,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I read the comments it made me a bit skeptical of getting them but some comments made me want them. I've been looking for good earphones because personally I prefer headphones. But let me tell you personally, these earphones are one of a kind, they may be a little difficult to get in your ear at first but once you do you'll know the feeling of accomplishment. So if your feeling like backing out and not getting these don't, they are worth the money. (blocks all sound and when turned all the way up no one can hear your music so they won't be annoyed, trust me their pretty loud with good bass)"
2211,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I used these as in-ears at church, and they were great when they worked. Unfortunately after a few months the left ear started having some kind of connectivity issue and constantly cuts out. This really messes with my overall mix, especially being in a drumcage where I count on having the front of house sound in my ears to dial in a mix"
2212,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Got them as a gift from my wife. In less than eight months, they stopped working, unless you count being able to hear only through one side, which I do not. When they were working, the sound was good, but the one star is for the horrible value. To spend that kind of money for such a brief lifespan is a really bad idea. These are remarkably fragile."
2213,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not fully compatible with SE846. This cable is actually a downgrade for them, it does not provide the same quality sound as the cable does. Unfortunately shure has to improve this cable.

Also it will be a nice warning in the box or in the specs to say that it is not fully compatible with SE846"
2214,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first got these, I used the memory-foam-type ear tips and was really disappointed with the results. Extremely bass-y and muffled (to my taste), making Pink Floyd's The Wall almost unlistenable. But when I used the included soft-rubber flange-y ear tips, it was 100% better. Generally well-balanced; perhaps a little less high-end shimmer than my previous Etymotics ER6s, but better bass, more solid construction, and better fit.

Regarding the latter, I am one of those who likes to listen to music as I'm going to sleep, and fortunately, these work pretty well in that regard - they're comfortable enough and low-profile enough that you can lie on your side on a pillow with them in and they are comfortable enough to fall asleep with. Not perfect- still just a _little_ too stick-y out-y, but better than any of the many other earbuds I've tried, including ones that I had Ultimate-Ears-style ear molds made for.

For working out, they're a little fussy to get in, but once in, they stay in very well. As others have noted, the wires go up, around and behind your ears; doesn't bother me, but I suppose YMMV.

Anyway, four stars, since I think the sound (especially the high end) could be a little cleaner (but then, that's why Shure makes higher-end earbuds, right?), but solid, comfortable and durable. I'm pleased."
2215,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's amazing how they sound !
It's a bit difficult to put then right on your ear on in a first time, but it a few times of using, you get the way.
Without listening nothing, they already isolate sound. But man .. when you start to listen to some music, it's amazing ! I'm a very eclectic man, so when i listen to jazz or blues, you can hear every detail on the music, you'll fell the difference, if you like these kinds of music. But when you are listen to music who has a lot of bass, they do the work verily well !
I cannot wait to get money to try the other version, like the SE315 and SE425. You'll not regret the acquisition!"
2216,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Cable failed after three months, so the left channel cuts out intermittently, and Shure isn’t willing to mail a replacement cable so a friend can bring it to me overseas. That’s after TWO WEEKS of them dragging their feet on making contact with a local repair center in Europe. DO NOT BUY these if you’re planning on traveling with them or even moving around. They look well built, and they sound great, but they’re delicate and apparently can’t handle use while walking around. Not to mention Shure’s bad rep for customer service (hopefully if you purchase through Amazon, they’ll take care of you better than Shure does for customers who bought elsewhere.)"
2217,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased a set of Shure se215 from a local shop because of all the great reviews and was a bit disappointed. They're comfortable to wear then around 30min of wear they begin to hurt my antitrigus because thats where the earphones sit. They do block out alot of ambient noise which helps the sonics of the music. They have a warm sound signature with an emphises in the lower rigesters.
The cable can be problematic because of it's design. The cable swivels at the earphones connection and this will occasionally cut out the sound when the earphones are not anchored into the ear properly or from continuous movement.
A better buy for less money would be NarMoo's B2M set which eclipses Shures sound in almost every respect."
2218,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty mediocre - cord is too long , ends up taking space in the pocket and tangles sometimes. Sound is nothing special , better than generic $25 apple headphones but nothing to rave about. Lack of microphone and mute button is inconvenient. They do stay in place while running - that's a plus. Noise isolation is ok."
2219,2.0 out of 5 stars,These have good sound quality but I don't like how it hurts my ears. After an hour the plastic at the top where it wraps around the ear would start making the back of my ear feel sore. I have to take off the earbuds for a bit to relieve the pain. Clearly these are not meant for listening to music for a long period of time.
2220,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A few years ago I really started listening to music and then a ton. (Prob 3-5 hrs a week now). I started off with crappy standard iPod earbuds. Then I jumped around the low-end cheap skullcandy ink'd several times where they would break usually a month or so. Getting really frustrated, I got the motivation to actually spend some money. Researched for a while and waited a week cause these earbuds were back ordered. Now having them for a month, I love them. Great fit(it comes with a good package of different sizes and materials of parts that will fit anyone's ear), they also don't protrude out of you ear so you can sleep comfortably on your side, the bass is nice, sound cancel very well, the music is clear even when the volume is loud and quiet, the cord is thick, dependable, and doesn't tangle easy, the jack is nice and everything on the SHURE SE-215 is sturdy and well designed. The around the ear chord style though a little difficult to figure out at first is great so the earbuds don't fall out easy. Great price for these earbuds and I'd happily pay a lot more than $100."
2221,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clear highs, steady mids, deep lows. Wearing them was the biggest issue I had initially however once you get the idea of how they are supposed to go in your ear it is cake. Just look at a picture online if you're having issues. I also go by the logo on the side of the monitor it should always be readable to someone looking at it. Comes with a wide variety of tips however the memory foam ones that are preinstalled are far superior to the others so I put them back on. 5 stars will buy again if i happen to smash these in my day to day. Only reason I wouldn't get these is if I had some extra cash and decided get an upgrade to something custom molded to my ear canal."
2222,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome! They sound good, clarity is good, bass is ok, if you want more bass buy the better SE earbuds...but for $90-100, it cant be beat. It does deaden a lot of outside noise as well. I let my singer try them when I got em, he popped them in and sang 2 words, immediately stopped, said ""Wow, holy $***"", jumped to amazon.com and asked ""What ones are those? Im getting them now!""
We run them thru a Behringer 4ch headphone amp and run 1/8"" ext cords along with guitar cables...wtf, your tethered anyway...and they work perfect!
So for those of you on the fence about IEMs vs monitors, quit being a wuss and climb over, the grass IS greener on the other side!!"

Sound isolation is superb. (so don't use these while jogging)
I had the klipsch s4, which were pure garbage in every way (reliability, sound) compared to the se215.
Shure has gotten it right. If you have $99 in your budget for in-ears, get these, you won't regret it."
2224,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned many different sets of headphones. I have a soft spot for Shures. I've owned a couple pairs of the 100 series buds and a set of the 300 series. These are my favorite.

I got em at an Inmotion at the airport for $81 so not a bad price. For less than $100 there is really not a better option for quality."
2225,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned these earphones for almost a year now and they sound just as good as the day I got them. The quality that Shure puts into these earphones is amazing, the material that they used on the wire feels almost like a braided cable. The cable has not shown any wear and tear over the time that I have owned them. The sound quality is very good, if you like a clean studio-like sound quality with just the right amount of warmth to them, these earphones are the best buy for your money."
2226,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The plastic around the jack is too fat for use with a Nexus 4 that has a bumper on it. I'm really disappointed about that because I loved my Shure SE110 headset, and I was looking forward to this replacement. I'm returning these because they are useless with my current phone."
2227,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I play drums in a completely enclosed drum booth. Needless to say, I needed a product that would not let on any sound. These are a great set of phones that do not allow any of the exterior drum and cymbal noise to cut into my monitor mix.

It's a little odd to wear this style of headphones ( over the ear style) at first. I find that if I run the cord down my back, this makes the cord run in a more natural style (as opposed to running the cord down your chest).

All in all, it's a great product. The one minor complaint is that over time (about 2-3 years) there seems to be an issue with one of the ears cutting in and out. This only happens when the phones are in a very specific position and the cut out is very short.

Great product and I will defiantly buy this brand again."
2228,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second pair of these headphones that I am purchasing as my first pair is starting to cut in and out but they lasted 4 years of heavy use in the gym, deployments, and many plane flights. I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!!!! The sound quality is well worth the difficulty of adjusting them to your personal comfort as they are a little tricky to get fitted properly, took me a few days of use to get them fitting perfectly but its well worth it. I am excited for the next 4 years of sound bliss."
2229,4.0 out of 5 stars,"EDIT: I ended up returning them because the inferior wireless tech just doesn't sound good enough to justify the price of the cable.

I will update this review if any problems come up, but so far these work beautifully. They do not support aptX, but most people won't notice the difference. I pulled off the se215 IEMs and am currently listening to my se846s through the Bluetooth cable. It has good range. I have not used them long enough to confirm the battery life, but at least they did come mostly charged."
2230,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have great sound quality for the price. The bass response is very good. I was looking for headphones that are warm but these might be a little too warm for me. I would like a little more high end but that is my only complaint.

They also have very good sound isolation when you use the foam tips. Listening to good quality sound without outside sounds interfering is awesome. You can get very immersed in the music with these. However these tips need to be squished, like you would ear plugs, prior to being put in the ear which requires two hands and is irritating if you tend to take your earphones in and out all day.

I find these uncomfortable to wear. The few inches of the wire from where they plug into the ear buds is supposed to have ""memory"" so that you can shape it around the ear. I find that it doesn't have enough memory and I'm constantly fighting to keep the wires around my ear. They tend to loose shape, pop up and fall from my ear. Having the wires just hang directly is not an option because they are too heavy and will pull the buds out of my ear. The design would be greatly improved with a more solid rubber or plastic piece to go behind the ears.

My first impression was that they are very durable. The wires are thick and seem much more robust than your average headphone wires. The plastic of the buds also feels very solid and well constructed. I have a feeling you could step on these and they wouldn't break. I assumed they would last me for years. Six months after buying them, sound started to crackle and cut with movement. The insulation around the part of the wire just before the jack completely cracked and caused this issue with the sound and rendered the headphones unusable unless I plan not to move while listening. Because the wires unplug from the buds, I might be able to buy replacement wires but I haven't looked into it because they were so inconvenient to use I'm not interested in using them anyway.

For me, earbuds are for mobile, on the go use and should be durable. I thought these would fit the bill but they let me down. They are also inconvenient and uncomfortable, especially if you need to take them out and put them in frequently. Because of these factors, I will never purchase another pair again, despite the great sound quality."
2231,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll just start this off by saying that these are my favorite listening device I've ever owned. This includes more expensive headphones like the audio technica ath m50x's.

First the sound quality. It was the first time I was NOT somewhat disappointed with the sound signature of any headphones I've ever used. The sound signature is very pleasant to listen to. It has a slight emphasis on the low end and an absolutely amazing mid range. The only downside to the sound signature of these earphones to me was the rolled off high ends. Otherwise it's perfect.

Now the build quality. When I first got them, I found it was nearly impossible for me to take off the eartips. It's a very tight fit and you have to make sure to push the off using the plastic and not the foam. I tore off the foam from the plastic and ruined my large sized eartips. Just be VERY careful. (also I did wash these once and dried them and worked perfectly afterwards if that's important to anyone lol)

I've had these for over a year and a half and used them almost every single day for several hours a day. Not until around a month ago I started having issues with sound cutting out and sounding muffled in my right ear piece. Fortunately, it has detachable cables but they are fairly expensive to replace.

Other than that, I haven't had any issues with these and are still to this day my favorite, go-to earphones. I can definitely tell you that you won't find a better pair for under 100 dollars. I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for some great sounding earphones."
2232,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the things that stood out to me after listening to a lot of familiar music with these is that for IEMs, these have incredible soundstage; music doesn't sound ""in your head"", it seems as if the music is surrounding you (I believe this effect is more apparent when you've selected the best tips to fit inside your ears). I don't use any of the included tips and own several IEMs (some costing double what these cost) and like the Comply tips. The ones I use are in between the Large and Medium tips that Shure includes with these.

Pro Tip: The tighter the fit of the foam tips, the more bass these will deliver (but that also affects the middle and high frequencies). Using tips that aren't so tight lessens the bass response a bit and that's where you start to notice a more lush middle and upper frequency response, and the soundstage improves (and you can also hear your surroundings a bit more).

I wanted a decent pair of IEMs to go on walks and work out and didn't want to use my (more expensive) Klipsh and Etymotic IEMs and I honestly am liking these more and more. I love that the cable can be replaced should something happen.

Cons? They can be uncomfortable to wear as the drivers have to go inside your ear. I'm noticing this more on my right ear than my left after about an hour of use. Everyone's ears are different so it will depend on your sensitivity. For the price and quality these reproduce, I strongly suggest checking these out and wearing them for at least an hour to see if these would be comfortable for your ears."
2233,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are awesome.. I have some SE425s that I can use but the 215s are great for the gym and I've had no complaints from people when I'm on the phone. Love the fact I can switch back and forth between the different buds and the blue tooth was solid.
2234,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned these for a couple months now and I'm not as thrilled as most people. My main issues are fit and quality of noise isolation (not quality of sound). If you wear glasses with semi thick or thick frames, good luck to you! I almost returned these because trying to comfortably wear them with either pair of my glasses is a total nightmare. I would strongly suggest looking at another pair unless you are a 100% contact wearer or have very thin wire glass frames. Thankfully i wear contacts more than half the time.
Regarding the noise isolation, its good but I dont buy that its 100$ good. I have cheaper headphones that dont involve the uncomfortable fit with noise isolation that approaches this. And I tried every size option in the kit so I don't think this is user error. All in all, I'm a bit disappointmented."
2235,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am now on my second pair of these headphones. the previous ones having broken after extensive and rather rough usage.

Personally I consider these headphones the absolute best money can buy at this price-pont. there are definitely better ones if you are willing to spend 200-300 dollars, but personally I tend to be a bit tough on earbuds (Normally if I am using earbuds rather than full headphones it is because I don't want to have to carry extra stuff around, which results in them being roughly shoved into my pocked) so I normally prefer a decent pair of headphones at a lower mid-range price point so that I don't need to worry if I break or misplace them (as happened with the last few pairs).

As a result of this habit I have been through quite a few headphones at this price-point, normally I decide to try something new after the old one is lost or broken, these are the first pair of headphones that made me unable to do that. from their sound quality to their beautiful and comfortable design, when I go to look at another pair of headphones I can't help but think of everything that it will lack compared to these.

The over-the ear design is non-standard at this price-point, and it might feel a little weird for the first week or two if you have never used it before, but the shure design makes shure (heh) that it feels like the most natural thing in the world after that point. I can and often do forget that I have them in. they remain stable and comfortable regardless of my level of activity or motion.

The sound isolation is also fantastic. if I am listening to music on these I feel completely isolated from the outside world, and they are also extremely quite from an outside perspective (which is important to me, as I often end up using them in my quiet office). You can play your music at full volume for you, and from an outside perspective it will be almost completely silent until you take them off.

The design is modular to a degree, enabling you to easily switch the actual buds for comfort (It comes with both Silicon and Foam buds. personally I used to use Silicon more but I have now been fully converted to foam. it is just more comfortable and provides a better sound. they also provide a few different sizes of each so you can find which one fits your ears best. (and of course, you can always buy third party ones if you want. though it is less neccisary than with other headphones, since they are very-firmly secured and unlikely to fall off, even if you roughly shove them in pocket constantly like me)) as well as enabling you to remove and replace the cable should it become damaged (this has not been a problem for me, but it is still comforting to know, since it is much cheaper to replace a cable than it is to replace headphones). it also makes cleaning out ear-wax and other detritus easier.

All of these factors make for a fantastic overall product. I can say with confidence that these are the best headphones I have ever owned at this price point, (My favorite headphones overall for sure) and probably the best you are going to be able to get without moving up the price-scale significantly. I would definitely recommend them."
2236,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, having the flexibility to upgrade existing headphones to Bluetooth is extraordinary. So what’s good and what could be improved...

The good?
- Battery life notification when you first turn it on, and it’s pretty accurate. Definitely got over 6 hours of use.

- Responsive controls, such as turning up/down volume

- Fair microphone, haven’t had a complaint when using it on calls yet

If I’m being critical...
- The lowest volume is actually too loud to me. (I’m a teenager) It really irks me that the notification voice, where she goes power on battery at X percent, is too loud for me and seems to be at a static volume.

- There are some minor blips when playing music, and these are amplified if you try to have it paired with more than one device (such as an iPhone and watch)

- There is occasionally this weird bug where it won’t let an iPhone play music, but restarting them fixes it.

Doesn’t really bother me...
- The battery pack. Yea it’s a little interesting having to clip it to your shirt, but it’s ok given that it’s a fairly long lasting battery. If it wrapped around the back of your neck, to me, it would get irritating if your jogging or exercising with them."
2237,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I'm listening to music with these, the sound cuts out which is really annoying and really frustrating. I want to enjoy listening to my music without having the sound cut out. These worked great for about 10 months before the sound started cutting out. They have a 2 year warranty, so I will contact Shure and get a replacement. But I expect the replacement to have the exact same problem unless Shure has changed the design. I think this is what's causing the sound to cut out: The detachable cable design, and corrosion on the metal connectors. Over time a very small amount of corrosion develops on the metal connectors, and this corrosion causes the sound to cut out. If I disconnect the cable from the headphones and wipe the corrosion off of the metal connectors, the sound cutting out problem stops for a while but then it comes back. And corrosion doesn't seem to be the only thing that is causing the sound to cut out, because other reviewers have reported the sound cutting out much sooner than 10 months. I think the nature of this detachable cable design results in the sound cutting out, even when no corrosion is present. In 2008 I bought Shure in-ear headphones that didn't have a detachable cable and the sound never cut out on those. They got stolen 4 years later. So, this is my message to Shure: ""Dear Shure, if you make all the components of these headphones out of high quality materials that are very durable, I think having a detachable cable is unnecessary. So, please change the design. No more detachable cable, please. Sincerely. And with respect. And with love. Your customer who has spent about $300 on 3 pairs of Shure headphones.""

2238,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sounding earphones. I use them for running and working out. The part of the plastic that goes around the ear is a little stiff but if you angle them correctly, they stay put fine.
I got these as a replacement to my seinheisser CX-500 that broke (but I had since 2009 so got excellent use from them).

Pro's:
-Excellent sound
-Good sound isolation, can't hear anything outside so you don't have to turn the volume up very loud at all.
-No feedback from the cord rubbing against your clothes messing up the music

Con's:
- The cord is a bit thick and heavy, much heavier than the CX-500's (which were REALLY light and thin). I could be biased since I've been using the CX cord exclusively for the past 6 years, lol. Maybe it's why there's no feedback from cord movement, in which case it's a plus
- The changeable tips are REALLY hard to take off. It's good once you have a size you like, no fear of them slipping off. But in the beginning while your'e trying to experiment to find the perfect size so you're changing to different ones, it's hard to do. Also not much of a major con.

All in all, I'd HIGHLY recommend them if you want good sound and to NOT hear the outside world while listening.

P.s., with the sound isolating cushions, you have to install them the same way you do ear plugs. Squeeze it up as thin as possible and then slip into your ear canal. Then the important part. You have to HOLD them there for a bit and wait for the foam to expand again so it'll stay in place and seal, just about 10 seconds or so and you're good, you'll have a nice soundproof fit, won't have to constantly readjust the earphones while you're running, they'll stay locked in."
2239,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great.
Sound isolation is good enough, though no better than foam earplugs.
The bluetooth reception is fair. If I have the phone in my left pocket the connection drops out.
When turned on a female voice LOUDLY announces the battery life and, even though I'm already listening to my media ""CONNECTED"". duh.
I haven't tried good noise-canceling earphones, so I can't compare."
2240,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Most people would've heard from forums or friends that the Shure SE215 is a great pair of earphones. This statement is true.
I'm no hardcore audiophile, but I really love this pair of earphones. It delivers bass really well, like, a really 'round' and punchy bass.
I don't think its treble and clarity stands out from the crowd, but it still does a decent job delivering vocals and instrumental chords.
I've paired it with a Hippo Cricri portable amp, and gosh does it sound great. The earphones have a lot of potential, as in, equalizing and bass boosting on your music player can be handled really well by the SE215.

The only real problem I have with it is that the cables get entangled with itself real easily and it's slightly challenging to put on. Looking past these problems, the earphones are perfect for mostly anyone.

For its price tag, it's a great buy, seriously! Anybody who falls into the ""I just want something great without spending too much but I don't know what to buy"" category, this is the earphone for you."
2241,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my review of the Shure SE215 in ear monitors. I've had these headphones for a decent amount of time, just over a year now. I've used these in all sorts of different scenarios, from studying, to sleeping, and even intense golf course maintenance. My review will be divided into 3 different sections: durability, design, and sound quality. Enjoy!

## A quick note on the ear tips

A lot of people really like the ear tips that come with these headphones. I used them for quite some time and was very happy with them. After a while, the memory foam started to get really gross and firm, so I decided to research some new tips. Much to my surprise, I discovered that the beloved Klipsch oval eartips fit these buds perfectly! I quickly bought them and couldn't be happier. I can confidently say, at least for my ears, the Klipsch oval tips blow any of the stock tips out of the water. The seal is fantastic, and they're easy to put on. They dont get uncomfortable over long periods of time, and they dont try to push themselves out of your ear like the memory foam tips. They're literally perfect for me. I **highly, highly** recommend you give them a shot instead of the stock eartips.

## Durability

These headphones are made out of plastic, and doesn't contain a single piece of metal in the enclosure. Don't let this fool you, however, these headphones are amongst the most durable in-ear buds I've ever owned (far surpassing the Klipsch Image X10 and S4, as well as the Monster Turbines, which have an *all metal* enclosure and Monster Beats Tour). I don't treat these headphones kindly either. I never put them in their carrying case and I frequently wear them in rugged environments, such as mowing the grass (in 95º heat) and, as stated earlier, golf course maintenance. I have the clear model, which has a kevlar and mesh lined cable. Once again, this cable is by far the most durable I've ever seen. The cable that came with these headphones when I purchased them wore out very quickly, I think it was a lemon. In less than a month of daily use, I found the sound would short out momentarily at random times. Thankfully, these headphones feature removable cables (a feature which really shouldn't be overlooked), so I bought another one and it's been working perfectly ever since. Overall, if you're looking to buy a pair of headphones that will last for *years* on end, these headphones are definitely the right call.

## Design

I love the design of these headphones. I dont really have any complaints, so I apologize in advance if I sound overwhelmingly positive. A huge advantage of having earbuds that sit flush with your ears (and dont stick out like typical earbuds) is that you can sleep with them! It's so great being able to lay my head on a pillow and not feel any pressure in my ear canals. If you use earbuds in the house, this is really a feature that should not be overlooked. Furthermore, since these headphones sit flush with your ears, you can wear them in the rain with minimal risk of water touching the driver enclosures (let alone actually seeping inside). Lastly, the way the cable wraps above your ear makes it very difficult for cable tension alone to pull them out. This means that the buds can literally stay in for days without the usual cable sways slowly wiggling them out of your ears. It also means that if the cable catches something (like a door handle), the earbuds aren't likely to get yanked out (which is usually a pretty jarring experience). The only problem I have with the clear model in particular is that the right angle headphone jack doesn't fit cases very well. I dont have a high-profile case, just a thin TPU shell around my iPhone 6. Despite the fact that my case is thin, it was still too thick to plug these headphones in. The black cable seems to be designed for mobile devices, because it doesn't have these issues fitting my case.

If you plan on using these with a phone, I recommend you buy the black variant.

## Sound quality

Sound quality is highly subjective. What I think sounds good, others might think sounds like garbage. This is why I try to reduce the weight of sound quality in my reviews, and instead, focus on the factual, measurable parts of these headphones. Lets get this out of the way, these headphones are **not** balanced. They have a significant bias towards the lower frequencies: bass, but it can also turn some people off. Unlike some other bass-boosted headphones on the market, these headphones aren't a complete mess when you get to the higher end of the spectrum. Trebles are very clear, sharp, and precise. The trebles are very independent of the lower frequencies (high mids in particular), which is a great characteristic to see at this price point. I wish they were just a brighter (trebles should be louder), but its not a deal breaker, especially if you aren't a huge audio snob like I am. Shure always does a great job with their mids, and these headphones are no exception. They're very clear, controlled, and accurate. Sometimes, in very complex songs, the bass will run into the mids, causing things to sound muddier than they should, but its not a deal breaker by any stretch of the imagination. These scenarios are generally few and far between.

Overall, I think a lot of people will be happy with the sound of these headphones. They have the bass-boosted emphasis of most modern headphones, however, it isn't overdone, and it doesn't come at the expense of the mids (in most scenarios) or the trebles. For $100, you're not going to get a perfect pair of headphones, but you can get one thats pretty damn good for most people. Unless you're a *serious* audio snob, or you listen *strictly* to spoken word audio, I highly recommend the Shure SE215 (in black). Seriously though, pick up a set of the Klipsch eartips while you're at it. You **will not** regret it."
2242,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a stellar set of headphones. I use these as monitors when I play drums for my church and in my band. They can get LOUD with no loss of sound quality at all. The sound isolation is great thanks to the foam tips and the quality and clarity from the drivers is phenomenal. Please note that if you are into the bigg booming bass and ""loudness"" feel to your music, these are not the headphones for you. These are for accurately portraying the sound that an artist is meaning to show you. Every high and low is there but not overpowering like what you get from the BEATS by Dre headphones (which are total garbage). If you do want to have a heavier bass response then I would suggest a set of SOL headphones. They are excellent quality and relatively inexpensive as far as higher-end headphones go."
2243,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first in ear headphones, and I am still impressed even 6 months of purchasing. There is quite a bit of noise cancelling with just inserting them into my ears. I have to take out atleast ear bud so I can hear people talking to me. I wear these at Church using our P16 Monitors from Behringer. The bring out all the frequencies I need and have quite good bass. If they got messed up, I would probably purchase these again or another shure IEM."
2244,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hesitated to splurge on these since I have the Shure SE 115 m+ for my iphone, which I was already very happy with. However, it was worth it!

These are much more comfortable, although more difficult to put in your ears right (maybe taking 10 seconds instead of 2). Over time, they are more comfortable to wear than the Shure SE 115m+ and they sound better to me too. They also isolate better, whereas with the SE115, I have to put them really deeply in my ears to get good isolation. With these SE215, it's not the case, thus they're very comfortable to me.

Cons:
- the cord is a little bit too long
- how about offering the SE215 m+ style, with integrated mike and remote? You would think there are enough iphone/ipad users who would be interested! Paying another $50 for their mobile remote is not a good solution. It adds more cord (which is already too long) and the mike is far away from your mouth and sounds too loud to people."
2245,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are easily the best ear buds I've owned. That being said, the only other high end ear buds I've used were Etymotics or Klipsh. Those were great as well, but this nails fit and sound isolation with a low profile. My only complaint would be that the cable, while high quality, has a fairly stiff section near the buds which is probably intended to keep them in place by wrapping around the back of your ear, but instead make fitment needlessly tricky, IMO. That's a very minor quibble. Otherwise, I'd recommend these to anyone who needs sound isolating IEMs, or for motorcyclists who need something to wear that clears their helmet. It works great for that latter application."
2246,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quick Review:
Background: First $25+ Earbuds. Used to enjoy my iFrogz Nylon Cord earbuds prior to this purchase but right side stopped producing any sound so had to make a new purchase.
Compared: Klipsche 6i, Bose True Sound, Shure SE215. Klipsche was similarly priced as the Shure and Bose was close to $200. Shure had positive reviews on Amazon, SoundGuys and other websites.
Review:
Pros: Sound is awesome. The earplugs fit comfortably. Tried M size and S size earplugs which were provided and settled on the M. The sound is well balanced and very clear.
Cons: It is difficult to get the cord to bend over the ear, but I am assuming that this is because it is new and that eventually it will become easier.

Closing: A fantastic purchase and am absolutely satisfied by this purchase. The sound quality makes me want to listen to much more music than I usually do."
2247,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With my job I am in front of a computer all day so I wear headphones 5 days a week 8hrs a day. I had tried out several low cost earbuds but struggled with finding a comfortable pair that would stay in my ear all day with ease. Today was the first day I used these at work and I am really impressed. Comfort is 5 stars as well as the sound quality and sound isolation. Some one can be right next to me talking and all I hear is the music. The over ear style cord wrap worried me since I wear glasses but I had no problems with that. I only had one issue with these headphones - they are a little awkward to put in to your ears so if you needed to take them out a lot during use, it's a little bit of a hassle but I'm confident that will change after more use. The biggest thing that stood out was the rich quality of songs with guitars like Nirvana, Sublime and Red Hot Chili Peppers. I listen to a lot of hip-hop too and the bass sounds excellent."
2248,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are in a class well above their price point. To say these buds are the best and clearest sound from ANY headphone/earbuds I have used would be doing these a disservice. The first purchase anyone who has these should make is the triple flange earbud replacements. Not only do they provide passive noise cancellation, but the sound is also pushed further into your ear. The highs are crisp and with no distortion at all. The lows still can hit with the strength of any Beats branded buds, but with a smooth and clean hit. The mids are clear and are best found in classical music or specific genres that rely on midrange. Very comfortable to wear for up to six or seven hours at a time and do not pull out of the ear without serious tugging."
2249,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of Shure headphones about EIGHT years ago. They were great quality but broke after 3ish years. They were sitting in a drawer at my parents and my dad found them a couple weeks ago. He called Shure and asked about a warranty. They sent a FREE pair of these headphones. Incredible customer service and I'll only by Shure in the future.

In regards to these particular headphones: they sound great. I love the fact that the drivers detach so that the cable can be replaced (which is where headphones usually break first).

Buy these headphones and you won't regret the sound or warranty."
2250,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've never tried serious IEMs before. These ones are nice. Sit comfortable, cable noise is rarely heard. I wear them with cables around the ears, as the instruction suggests--probably it's *the* way to wear IEMs, not sure. A few different molds are included, and I think I've found ones fitting. The construction seems to be solid, I don't think I'll accidentally break the cable (as it happened before with cheaper in-ear phones).

Some time is required to put the phones on or off, but I think I'll get used to it. However, it would be better if the part of cable that goes around the ear bent a bit more.

I like the sound, bass is not too much but enough. Probably a bit lacking in high frequencies, but of course that's just me after Beyerdynamic cans that maybe have an excess of those. Also, I don't know how IEMs should or can sound like, so my opinion isn't really relevant here. I like that I can listen to music on pretty low levels even in a street noise, but it's dangerous in that you may not hear a car driving right behind you."
2251,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so happy to be back in Shures! This is my 2nd (replacement) pair of Shure earphones for an older set I lost. Upgrading to this price point makes all the difference. My interest in music varies from classical, R&B, rock, pop, electronica, and country. These work with all genres. Make sure the sleeves fit your ear perfectly; this is how music should sound."
2252,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought 3 of them, one after one, died becuse of sweat, real disappointment, shure should stop selling it till they will make a better quality one. It's making very bad reputation for the company."
2253,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are a lot of reviews here that talk about technical specifics about the SE 215's. I'd like to take a different approach to offer my praise (for the record, I'm a music composer/producer and sound quality means worlds to me). When my wife found out these were $100 she was none too pleased...""$100 for earbuds?!? Seems excessive to me,"" she said. I tried to explain the quality and durability of the SE 215's but she wasn't hearing it. When they arrived and I had her listen to a few songs through these, she was grinning like the Cheshire Cat. It was the ""crap I know I'm wrong about these so how do I hide it?"" grin. When I asked her if she thought they were worth the money, she began to comment how effective the sound-isolating was (all of a sudden she couldn't hear me).

Agree with a lot of folks here. Impeccable clarity, profound bass, ridiculous sound. Stop thinking about buying these and buy them. Worth every penny."
2254,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the ways these sounds. Nice flat response and accurate earphones. No exaggerated bass or any artificial sound. Within the first hour of using with each session tho, the inside of my ear gets irritated. I used all 6 pairs of ear plugs and no luck. I think it may be a design flaw or maybe I have odd ears lol. I also wouldnt recommend these for any activities. You need to stay in place to ensure best sound."
2255,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Only earbuds I've owned that have lasted longer than 2 months. Sound is crisp and clear. If you want good quality earbuds these are the best around $100.

EDIT: The wire that wraps around my ear broke after a few months of use and the Shure warranty took longer than a week to replace it. If only their warranty was faster this would be 5 stars."
2256,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The stiff plastic that is supposed to bend over the top of your ear to hold them in place makes these awkward in the extreme to put on. If you wear glasses, forget it. In addition, it is difficult to distinguish right from left on these. The documentation doesn't tell you how and you find that you have to hunt for a tiny, tiny red dot on one of them, presumably the right channel, something that's going to be nigh impossible on, say, a darkened stage. There is no reason, none whatsoever, that they couldn't stamp a much more visible ""L"" on the left and ""R"" on the right. To make matters worse, the stiff plastic cable on these conducts a tremendous amount of contact noise to the earbuds. The result is a most annoying scraping sound with every little movement. They should have used a softer, more flexible cable.

See the other reviews for accounts of how these fall apart or stop working after a short period of use.

This is one of Shure's poorer designs to be ""shure"" and the sound quality isn't good enough to compensate for it. I would look for something else."
2257,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Received these about two years ago as a Christmas gift. Have always enjoyed the sound quality, noise isolation, and comfort. However, the flexible wiring near the earphones came a little twisted. I was fine with this until recently when I started experiencing one ear's sound going out. To get the sound working again, I usually just twist the cable and adjust near the earpieces. A minor annoyance, but an annoyance nonetheless. Also makes me worried about the durability of these earphones. Hope they work for a long time because I love them! Just don't want to say goodbye because of a lack in build quality."
2258,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these to death! These are the best IEM's for $100 hands down. The sound is clear as can be for this price oint. I use these for about 3 hours a day between school, walking my dog, and going for runs. They are also the most comfortable IEM's I have ever worn. The wire wrapping around your ear doesn't take getting used to at all but does take a few days to learn how to put on. I wouldn't recommend another pair of IEM's over these for $100."
2259,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Mid bass bloat colors this rather hard presentation. Treble is OK and can be airy, but they lack low bass and there are better phones out there at this price point."
2260,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds sound great, but after a few months the plastic shell split in two. I sent it in (as it is covered under warranty), and had the same earbuds returned un-fixed. I'd otherwise give these a high rating, but the shotty assembly and failure to hold up their warranty, I have to give Sure a 2/5 on this one."
2261,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Today I received my SE215's from Amazon. Sadly, I am disappointed. The first issue is one of quality control on Shure's part. Many reviewers have mentioned issues with the left earbud cutting out and this was the case with the pair that I received. I really like the idea of being able to replace the cable on a set of headphones, however I think this design is what ultimately leads to so many issues with loss of signal.

The issue is definitely in the cable and not the earbuds themselves. I tried to isolate the issue by removing and reconnecting the cable, I also tried swapping the left/right connections. The issue was intermittent and there were times when I thought I had solved the issue, but it always returned.

These earbuds do sound good, but not enough to justify the price. Many reviewers have commented on the bass response. Proper fit is essential for bass response in any earbud. Overall, I felt that the sound was very balanced and clean. The thing that impressed me most was the stereo separation which in my opinion is the closest to over-the-ear headphones that I have experienced with an in-ear monitor.

I'm going to return the Shure SE215 for a refund and just keep enjoying my pair of Panasonic RPHJE120K ($7.18 from Amazon) that I received for Christmas!

Bottom Line:
1) Great balanced sound and stereo separation.
2) Proper fit is the key to good sound and bass response.
2) Concerns about Shure quality control.
3) The replaceable cable is a gimmick that is going to lead to problems down the road.

I would not recommend this product."
2262,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the worst in-ears I've ever purchased. Right at the end of the 2 year warranty period, the right side went out. Would not recommend this to anyone."
2263,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easily the best pair of headphones I've ever owned. I've been through Bose IEM's and SkullKandy's and these are by far extraordinarily superior and are only $99 right now.The bass is incredibly rich sounding and not overbearing as well as the treble having a perfect balance that's not crunchy sounding. I was hesitant about the cable being placed over the ears however they feel great and the cords do not brush against your cheeks like other head phones.
2264,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these at an airport kiosk to replace my stock apple ear buds. I primarily bought these for the isolation qualities -- crying babies, jet noise.

I don't know what impressed me more, the sound isolation or the sound quality, both are excellent.
Another nice feature is that with the sound quality and isolation, you hardly need to turn the volume up.
Shure's fitting system is a little hard to adjust to at first, but after a while the cord molds to your ear shape and with practice, the monitors insert in easily.

Shure also deserves credit for recognizing the two most likely damaged components of in-the-ear monitors: the ear tips and the cords, can be replaced, thus leaving
your investment in the electronics safe."
2265,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these from a different account to explain why I'm not verified. They sounds the way they should, when they work. My cable stopped responding to the buttons and I have to plug them into a power source to ""jump start"" them. And the moment the music stops they disconnect. Rinse repeat."
2266,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel a little bit more sane after reading the negative reviews of the SE215s that mention the flaw regarding the left ear piece. Of course, most of those reviews were written just after I purchased them and also after the small window I had to return them. At least I'm not the only one...and at least I don't feel like I'm literally cursed when it comes to ear buds.

Yes, the left ear piece also inexplicably died after about a month and a half of actual use. Right now, I can either listen to them and have the left ear drop out every time I move my head (which causes a new level of Rage)...or I can send them back for replacements and expect the same thing to happen.

Guess I'll send them back as they're still under warranty, though it's way past the time by which I could return them.

I dished out good money because of the Shure name, so to say this is disappointing is a major understatement. This is extremely annoying/enraging. I like the sound on the SE215s, I like the fact that there's no wire noise, and they drowned out sound pretty well, so much so that (if they worked) I could well by run over by a bus as I was trying to adjust the left ear piece in the street.

The design and fit on these is strange, so please take note (aside from the fact that they, you know, BREAK after a couple of months). These are like in-ear monitors...the piece goes all the way into your ear (so you can feel like Bono or someone on stage), and annoyingly, the wire goes up and around and back of your ear...which I suspected was why they may have given out since I was constantly adjusting them. No, only the left one.

The design is odd and definitely not for everyone (unless, again, you love adjusting wires and sticking them behind your ears/hair). The other thing, oh yeah, THEY BREAK EASILY. Forget about ""burning them in""---what's the point? The 50 hours that will take is a fraction of the time the things will actually work in your ear.

Thanks, Shure. I think by the time I'm done buying ear buds I'll have paid enough money to get the iPod installed in my cranium, where I can never turn it off.

NOT recommended."
2267,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stunning clarity. Balanced low end. Won't artificially boost the low end like cheap headphones. Great deal for the price.
2268,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things shure are amazing (hey ooo!) Not a bad deal! I thought the low end would lack. They dont. Im not an audiophile, but I know a great sound when I hear it."
2269,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have the best fit of any headphones I have ever tried. The foam tips block sound out, and help you have great sound at lower volume (protect your hearing!) those reviews that say it's a complicated fit or hard to get in your ears... Yes it takes a few seconds more to secure the fit because they have a memory cord. That's a GOOD thing! It helps keep the headphones secure in your ear by taking the weight if the headphones off the cord. Just takes a few times to get used to it. Best $100 headphone I've tried out of Bose, Beats, Sennheiser, and many others."
2270,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I entered a contest to win a couple of concert tickets and won these as a consolation prize. These were the best earphones I ever owned. The sound quality was superb and I could run in them without ever worrying about them falling off. They were comfortable enough for me to just put them on and forget about them. Unfortunately, I was being clumsy and careless with them and one of the buds broke beyond repair. When I came online to see about getting another pair I saw how expensive they were. These were more expensive than six of those tickets I was trying to win, so it was a heck of a prize while it lasted."
2271,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Sennheiser earphones for about 6 years, they worked great (I lost them), sound and build quality were great, but.. That was until I've got these earphones, and in one word - SUPERB!"
2272,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are fantastic! I have had great Bluetooth connectivity with fantastic range and battery life. Terrific sound quality. Additional ear inserts included with a nice clip to attach cable to clothing. I don't travel anywhere without them.
2273,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great
2274,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I frequently use these earphones, as I'm out and about every day. They're great for having on the subway and they cancel noise out way better than the Bose. I often miss my stop on the train, because I can't hear the voice announcing the stop, and I don't listen that loud. The inserts mold perfectly to my ear and are more comfortable than the Bose.

Also, I had a previous pair of Bose break due to my cat biting them. She bit right through the speaker on her first try. She's also gotten a hold of these, but the speak is protected by a hard plastic barrier due to the construction on the ear bud, so she can't bit through it, unless she has it for awhile perhaps."
2275,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are phenomenal. The sound is crisp and neutral/honest. if you have a heavy bass sound in the source, you will hear it. These headphones will not add bass where it was not intended. For all the people complaining about them.. You must understand you can't just buy these and plug them into any device and expect them to sound amazing.
First, you need to provide high quality source content. MP3's will not cut it. Even high the ""Extreme"" option on Spotify will not do these headphones justice. You need to find high bit-rate lossless audio from a proper source. Beatport, Tidal or a CD ripped in the right format and bit-rate will work.
Secondly, you need the right hardware. You can't expect to plug these into any new android, idevice or laptop and get a good sound. There are some exceptions. One of the last android devices with a good DAC (Google it) was the European version of the Samsung Galaxy S2. The Galaxy Note 4 International or newer MacBook Pro do have a good quality DAC. Wolfson or Yamaha make great DACs. This component is essential for a good listening experience, as well as proper settings.
Using an under powered device, like an iphone can actually damage the drivers (speaker core) inside the headphones. For those who don't want to bother would probably be better off with lower quality consumer grade headphones like Bose or Beats."
2276,5.0 out of 5 stars,This things are amazing.... have a tight fit and sound crystal clear... they are the only headphones this size that compete vs. my Bose QC25... and mobile 100%. They are amazing.
2277,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for about a month and have listened to at least 25 hours of audio using them. To be blunt, I'm in love with them. I'm hearing sounds in music that just weren't being reproduced by the other audio systems I have (cheap ones, admittedly). The full range of sounds are clear and faithfully rendered, though the bass may be a little low for some depending on musical taste. I'm also happy to say that the foam buds keep these things firmly in place through just about any situation I've had them in so far, whether it be walking, running, or even snowboarding. Money well spent, and highly recommended."
2278,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to write a review after reading all these morons using these for walking,biking etc. THESE ARE FOR MUSICIANS AND PERFORMERS FOR LIVE SETTINGS!!!! THESE ARE MEANT TO BLOCK OUT LOUD SOUNDS AND ISOLATE WHAT YOURE HEARING IN YOUR EARS!!! Duh! And if you cry babies have a problem they come with different size ear buds for a reason! Okay now thats off my chest, I am a touring/studio drummer and I always used the Shure E2's...they don't make them anymore, I was worried about the price of these, I believe you get what you pay for. I am BEYOND AMAZED by these and I will buy these again!!! I play to a click track live and wanted something THAT BLOCKED OUT NOISE AROUND ME AND THATS WHAT THESE ARE FOR. To you people who jog,walk,bike or whatever with any kind of earbuds or headphones you're a moron and deserve to get ran over by a bus. Use common sense!!! I HIGHLY recommend these AS A MUSICIAN AND PERFORMER ...after all thats what they are made for!!!"
2279,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first purchase from Shure. The first pair was defective and returned and replaced. Just bad luck? Probably, Shure is noted for being better than this and stuff happens. These come with a nice zippered kit, a wax cleaner for those who never heard of Q-tips and an assortment of silicon and foam tips (affectionately called ""olives"" the name that just stuck with owners). I really didn't need these as I have an assortment of other buds but I just couldn't resist them based on all the positive feedback being posted. Initial impressions, a well built plastic bud with detachable cable...miles and miles of cable. Designed to be used with the cable over the ear and draped either behind or in front of the wearer, there is memory wire to bend around the top of your ears. Don't be shy, bend away and you will eventually get the hang of it but it takes a bit of trial and error before I got the hang of it. These fit in the ear canal at a natural angle and are very secure and comfortable. Sound isolation from external noise is moderately successful in all but loud environs and microphonics (the sound transmitted to your ears from rubbing the cable) is better than most others. The deal with replaceable cables is to be able to get long life from your investment in the case of failure as parts are interchangeable. It also can be and I'm just guessing here, be the weak link. Both buds and cable are plenty sturdy and expected to last and last. The slider is smooth operating and stays put. Did I mention how long the cable is? Long.
OK so ya ya ya ... how do these sound? Not as good as my $400 buds but 97% as good, and for $100 bucks that's saying it all. The drivers are dynamic (think itty bitty speakers) and the bass is contained, tight accurate and enough for my tastes. If you like sitting in traffic next to a ramped up sub-woofer in the car next to you on a hot day than these aren't for you. The bass is as it should be at least to my ears. The mids are crystal clear, vocals in particular are sweet and a bit warm with good resonance and timbre and the highs have a bit of sparkle that's quite appealing. Overall the entire frequency response is well balanced and blended. Now I'm listening to MP3's which are quite compressed and somewhat lacking but these make a a silk purse out of a sows ear. Perfect..and for $100 bucks...they rock! You don't get it all but what isn't there most listeners won't notice and even if you do you won't care, these are that good. I'll stop here but I want to add a discovery that's an option that I found and use. Klipsch(the other guys) made a discovery that's akin to the world being round, not flat. Ear canals are oval not round, Duh! They make oval tips. Really really nice comfortable oval tips. I use them on my 215's and the buds disappear and all that's left is sound. Just a suggestion."
2280,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these because I needed headphone at the gym that did not fall out easily. I was super impressed by the sound. The sound quality was nearly identical to my $350 Bose QC3 headphones. The only gripe was the breaking in the wire so that it looped around my ear easily. There is definitely a learning curve when putting these headphones on, but after about a week, it becomes second nature."
2281,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These IEMs are fantastic. You feel as if you are in the room where the musicians are playing and singing. I had a problem with the audio cutting out on the left earbud after about six months of use. Sent them into Shure for warranty service, got a NEW PAIR of both earbuds in TWO DAYS. Before I knew it, I had a brand new pair of SE535's. Shure's service is the best I have ever encountered. They stand behind their products, and care about their customers. Would not hesitate to do business with them again in the future. I am now a loyal Shure buyer."

2283,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great IEMs, probably the best for your money at this price point. Would definitely recommend!
Just realize that these are not your typical earphones, probably don't want to use them for running or crossing streets (because they do a great job of noise isolating). They can also be a bit tricky to put on, but once you get the hang of it they become easier to put and feel very comfortable."
2284,5.0 out of 5 stars,"By far the best cabled earbuds I've ever heard, quality of construction is fantastic. the plastic pieces feel solid and very well cast, the cable is thick and strong, a cat might have a good deal of trouble chewing through these like they always do."
2285,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't ever write reviews but i had to when my wife put my jeans in the washer with my SE215s in the pocket. These headphones survived a full wash and dry cycle. I plugged them in right out of the machine thinking they were dead. To my surprise they came on. I am somewhat picky when it comes to sound, but i could not detect any loss of quality. Really happy with these indestructible bastards."
2286,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I assume the earphone is designed for professionals, who need to wear them for a long time. The design is not user-friendly at all if you want to take it off every now and then, because putting it on will take you a minute! You have to pull the string behind your ear EVERY SINGLE TIME. If you already have something hang up on your ear, your glasses, sun glasses or like me, simply like to put hair behind ear, it becomes very embarrassing, and I have to do all kinds of awkward action to put it on.

I have an only one problem, yet not solved: If you want to keep stable in/on your ears and well sounding the 215 Ks you have to fit your ears to the earphones insead of the opposite¡
I have carefully and slowly inserted the phones into my ears, have twisted the phones, even have twisted my ears (and a little bit of my brain ...)once and again, ... So finaly I got some possitions that go right. Well, so let's enjoy the music. Eventually, you can recieve a phone call or you realize someone is talkin to you. Then you pull off one ot the two earplugs in orther to answer or mantain a conversation. Bad. Later, you'll have to begin to look for, to find the apropiate way to fix again the earphone ...
But i'll nor surrender 'cause i believe that sooner or later I will get it with naturally. So cheer up, you'll also can do it.

2288,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, great material quality! I found them a little too big for my ears (part of the hard plastic pushes a bit on my skin and after a long period of time, it leaves a small mark), but I don't really notice it until I take them off. Its a little complicated getting used to putting them on correctly, but once they're on, they stay on great. Considering the price, I would buy these again. Best earphones I've owned for around 100 dollars."
2289,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know why everybody is raving about THESE earphones. To me, they're JUST AVERAGE - but certainly acceptable. As for bass boost, I sure can't detect any - can somebody comment on this! HOWEVER they are ergonomically far superior to other earphones I've worn and are extremely comfortable once you figure out how to insert them. However this superior ergonomic design unfortunately creates an extremely inferior acoustic sound-delivery design for ALL versions of Shure earphones! Am I the only one who realizes this? If you look at the exploded diagram for ALL versions, you will see there is a plastic nozzle that funnels the sound from the micro-driver at an angle (through the foam earpiece) into your ear through a bore/diameter of a few mm! Thus, the offset micro-driver is in NO WAY in the most optimal position to deliver music to your ear! Exactly how are you delivering quality undistorted music - especially decent bass - through a plastic nozzle? I certainly don't see how this could work, and it certainly doesn't work for me! To continue with ergonomics the earphones are very sturdy with a nice sized jack that is not going to break easily that's for sure - having handled one too many ultra flimsy subminiature stereo jacks. The earphone wires detach from the drivers separately so you can replace those. Summary: Average sound with undetectable bass boost. Very sturdy in construction but the sound delivery design that is is badly compromised! Guess it's back to my flimsy Sennheiser CX 300 II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds that sounded way better than these at half the price because the drivers are directly opposite your eardrums. I'll take those earphones or any earphones where the drivers are unobstructed and directly opposite your drums. So that's my take and please, any comments off of this posting are most welcome."

Beautiful EQ with just a tad bit of low end so that it doesn't sound tinny. I would recommend these to anyone.

2296,2.0 out of 5 stars,The sound on these are awesome one of the best. My dad bought these for me for Christmas and the sound amazing but it only lasted a day or so when the left ear did not work anymore :(.
2297,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll start with the CONCUSIION: Perhaps the best sound available for the money, with one caveat.

BUILD: Over the Top. This is professional gear suitable as on-stage in-ear monitors. I've been through 2 sets of Sony headphones whose cables tangle incessantly and short out too quickly. While stiff, these cables appear bullet proof and are replaceable if not. That's great ""cable insurance"". Note: I believe a burn-in is necessary as well as the right tip for your ear. I am happy with the foam that came installed.

WEAR: Comfortable and will not dislodge, Period.

SOUND: (Disclaimer: A true Audiophile avoids the use of a graphic equalization, so I'm disqualified. To my ear, all phones / speakers can be improved by shaping the sound. I'm a semi-pro performing rock/pop drummer. I want some kick in my sound. My Reference Sound: Sony MDR-EX300, Bose QC15, BMW Premium Sound. Main source material for this review: Seal (1994), a very well produced album.

With a single driver Sure had to sacrifice some upper and lower end sound, but far less than you might expect. There is a natural ""open"" sound that is fun to listen to and never harsh. Separation, soundstage and overall articulation are very good. Way better than MDR-EX300 and even the QC15 in most arias.

Highs: The super transient highs are rolled off, yes, but only by spending twice the money would I expect improvement. Meanwhile what is there is effortless and pleasing.

Mids: Here is where they really shine. Seal's vocals have never sounded better. Usually I need to reduce the mid's with EQ. Not here. No closed or ""boxy"" sound. Great instrumental sound in this range.

Base: Clean, articulate, if lacking what the QC15 offers in the very low end. I have a long low reference base note in Seal's ""Bring it On"". It's right at the words ""So what lies undone is your Kingdom Come"". The Sure's handled it well enough, though not ground moving. The QC15s are better here. But what more do you expect for the price and seize considering the very good Mids and Highs? I'd say nothing.

What is pleasing is the natural mix of all 3, High/Mid/Base. This allowed me to hear new things in songs I've loved for years. That's impressive.

THE ONE CON: These baby's need to be ""installed"" in your ears, not popped in like your standard ear bud. It takes two hands for each ear. This is a lot of fuss just to listen to one song. It takes time and effort compared to anything you've had before. Not a deal breaker, just know this going in.

VERDICT: Don't waste your time looking for better sound at this price. Better to waste it instead on the effort ""installing"" them in your ears. I'm perfectly willing to."

2299,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the earbuds drummers would wear to hear the drum-kit and the rest of the instruments. They muffle sound as you put them in and when your music plays you can barely hear anything. Therefore you and your music. Only complaint is that you have to burn them in a little to get some bass in (my music).. But totally worth it.. Really reliable and comes with wax pick..
2300,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these the other day an I was a little skeptical because I like good bass and also being able to hear good highs. Typically you either get one or the other. Shure NAILED this product! These are amazing! I can play my acoustic and sing and the highs will come out great or play bass on them and get the lows! I LOVE THESE! If you are hesitant like I was, Just pull the trigger and buy them! You will not be disappointed!"
2301,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded from my 8yr old Shure pair and was getting sick of the pairs that came with my phones. Definitely an improvement over their old model, my ears fit into either the medium or large gel inserts, which leads me to believe that as long as u relatively have no trouble with other in-ear buds these WILL fit snug. Deifnitely the build and sound quality I'd expect from Shure.

2302,2.0 out of 5 stars,"shure se215 sounds poor in high frequencies it's a bad point for this product. it has a not real sound. not recommended for listen real audios, monitoring mixes, not good for live sound, not good for mixing, only good for audio reference, no more.

i wpuld like try another in ears.I am a sound engineer and I do not recommend this product"
2303,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this earphones for 4 years and it is still perfect. My friend bought same pair but she replaced the cable twice within 4 years (she is not good at keeping things) If you use it with a bit of carefulness, it will last really long. I think of upgrade to new earphones but don't know when mine will be broken"
2304,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these over 4 years ago and have used them almost everyday since. Sound just as great as the day I got them and I've had no problems with them. Highly highly Recommend
2305,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these as in-ear monitors on stage and they are fantastic. Low end comes through solidly and everything else is nice and crisp. I really like how they ""disappear"" in my ear and is not really visible on stage. The short section of wire just past the driver really helps keep it tucked away and secure. I also used these during studio recording, and they did just fine. At this price range, I couldn't be happier. Booya!"
2306,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7 months old, treat them like crud, and they sound as good as the day i bought them.

I think i bought a lucky pair as many people had them short out. Lucky me.

I recommend them to bass lovers and people who find treble irritating (very smooth sounding headphones)

Decent sound stage and great bass response. The noise is also locked in so you can listen without bothering others.

Highly recommended."
2307,1.0 out of 5 stars,I owned the clear set. It isolated sound wonderfully and sounded great. After about 2.5 years they degraded quite fast. It was disappointing as I used these infrequently and didn't wind them up tightly either. Overall if I am spending $100 on headphones they should last longer. I have a pair of Bose that are just as old and they work flawlessly still.
2308,3.0 out of 5 stars,They say that you will notice a huge difference between headphone sound quality once you spend that first $100. These headphones fit nicely as I like the wrap around style and the sound quality was nice but compared to a cheap pair of $30 skull candies I had I heard no difference. This is because there is still only one driver. If you want a pair of headphones with night and day difference in sound quality compared to regular headphones then get a pair with at least two drivers. This of course means you'll be dropping at least $200.
2309,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Left ear stopped working after three months, Amazon will not accept a return on this item after two months. I am screwed."
2310,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These buds are excellent. I use them predominantly on plane flights both to listen to audio and as ear plugs. They are very comfortable and can easily be left in without fatigue pain for the duration of a long haul flight. Now for the sound. These things are superb, rich sound with excellent bass response. Mid and high range have a calrity that needs not equalization tweaks with your mp3 player."
2311,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are a good choice if you prefer:
1) good sounding dynamics;
2) detachable cable;
3) iPhone compatibility (for that you'd need to buy a cable with remote/mic).

I like the sound and build quality of this model. If you buy it together with an iPhone-compatible cable it will be cheaper than Monster Turbine with ControlTalk (140 USD vs. 169).

Highly recommended."
2312,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: very good sound isolation. Actually considering using when I go trap shooting. Equally as good as the earplugs I usually use.

Was looking forward to using them on my next long flight if they hadn't stopped working.

Cons:
- A bit awkward to put on. Takes a bit getting used to.
- Right bud stopped working after very light use (only at my desk at work) for 3 months. I know it's the bud not the wire because I swapped the buds and the left one worked on the right wire.

They should still be under warranty but I got them as part of a prize package at work so I don't have the purchase receipt required to get warranty service. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay all the $$ for these. I would be TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED.

If you buy these KEEP YOUR RECEIPT. You WILL need it WHEN (not if) you have to send it in for repair."
2313,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pro's:
- Earbuds sounded good when they were in.

Con's:
- Difficult to put in ears.
- Once in ears they were uncomfortable.
- Earbuds are heavy and the cord is heavy.
- Cord was way to long for walking around and having come out of pocket.
- Sound cuts in and out on iphone 4 when the connector rotates the plug.
- Fit kit sleeves were extremely difficult to remove when trying to find a good fit. Internet forums said to freeze the earbuds to help.
- The cord nearest the earbuds is made to wrap around the ear. Made it more difficult to put on and with the combined weight of the cord bothered my ears.

All in all these were not for me. I have had a few great over the ear monitors in my life and was not prepared for the hassle they would be. They hurt my ears, cut in and out and needed to be frozen to adjust. I like the idea of earplugs with great sound but not with all this hassle. According to the reviews many people love them, but I STRONGLY suggest you give these or earbuds very similar a try before you buy. I returned them. You might love them. Who knows."
2314,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The SE215 are great. Forward, reasonably lush mids, great bass with a little midbass hump but nothing like Westone 3; it's right in line with the subbass except when more impact is called for. Never drowns out the mids. Highs are unimpressive but also inoffensive, slightly rolled off, not very sparkly but fairly clear.

Great buy at $100. Still my favorites after trying multiple higher end armature setups. I've been searching for something that delivers the same great balance of mids and bass and I have yet to find it."
2315,2.0 out of 5 stars,I got these headphones in June and by September the right ear started jumping in and out. After the last few months of dealing with it (because the Shure website had a very convoluted warranty system) the left ear finally died as well. I'm really frustrated because I know Shure has the ability to make great and near indestructible pieces of equipment ie the sm 57. This is the second pair of headphones that I've bought from Shure that has died within 6 months of purchase the last one being the SRH 840's. I hate saying this but I'd urge others to avoid Shure's headphones because they are overall pretty hit or miss on the quality front.
2316,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start off by saying these are the BEST earphones I have ever tried. The sound quality rivals headphones such as the M-50 and porta pros and surpasses beats and bose. The only thing holding it back is its disgusting durability. I have had these for less than a month and the left ear is already breaking. I put down $120 on these earphones and I am EXTREMELY disappointed at this. The sound quality was great and I was considering replacing my over ear headphones with these, however, given that these broke, I can't. DO NOT BUY THESE EARPHONES. When I read that the left earphone breaks from other review I unfortunately didn't believe it. Believe every review that says the left earphone breaks. This is absolutely unacceptable. The fact that IPOD headphones last longer than this says something.

UPDATE

1 Star. I owned it for a year and my fourth pair broke. I paid nearly 50 dollars for returns. Stay away."
2317,3.0 out of 5 stars,They sound great but are hard to take and put on.
2318,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decided to pick these up at Guitar Center because I was looking for portable and good sounding IEMs. Sound is mediocre, I got just as good sound and way better bass response from my Sennheiser cx150's which cost a fraction of the price at $40 and I got FAR superior sound from my Sennheiser IE80's. Be aware that there are better options out there."
2319,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality on this is first rate but forget about simply tossing them in at the gym. These are the most difficult headphones I've ever used. The fit is complicated with a bendable material around the wires closest to the in ear portion. This part is made to loop up and over the ear. The section of the zip cable from where it splits to the phones is on the short side making the cable somewhat tight when worn. I'm not certain, perhaps this is the only way to get this level sound from a tiny in ear phone. However I'm not sure the trade off in ease of use and comfort is worth the trade off."
2320,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I used them for about 3 years and the seemed to do the trick. I play guitar and was forced to use In-Ear monitors sand the did the trick until both drivers went out. No ptoblem you can replace the drivers, they are detachable. And cost $70 each.
So buying a new set but will go with a different brand that several musician freinds are using and that cost 1/2 as much and the company gives a 50% replaceent cost no matter what happens to them."
2321,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones so that I could wear them while riding my motorcycle. They do a great job of fitting in your ear so the helmet still fits comfortably and the sound truly is far superior and more isolated than with any other headphone I tried so far. The only reason I did not give this item a 5 star is because they aren't very practicle in any situation where you might want to take them out and put them back in more often. An example of this would be at the gym. They are just too much of a hassle to put in your ear properly for that and the cord is too rigid.
2322,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound, noise isolation (with the right foam) and comfort. They're almost comparable to their 5x more expensive cousins -the SE530s - which I've been using for about 3 years now. I've used other sound isolating earphones over the years in the $50-500 range and for $100 these are very impressive - I will be getting a couple more to give as presents!! Highly recommended."
2323,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I truly love these earphones! Sound quality is great. I previously owned some Nergy earphones and no comparison. However, the over-the-ear thing does take some time to get used to, but not a huge problem"
2324,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered a new pair to replace my old black SE215 that I thought I lost. After about a week I noticed that the sound with slightly cutting out; I just thought it was my old iPhone. I tried then on my computer, iPad, and old CD player etc and noticed the sound problems. In the mean time I found my old SE215 so I switched out the cords and that solved the problem. I wanted a replacement cord since I paid for a new set of SE215.

I emailed Shure explaining the problem with my included invoice when I purchased them. I get an email to call the service department so I did. Then I get a rude individual named Anthony that says I have go BACK to their website for a form. Then send in the cord AT MY OWN Expense that will not be covered for a defective product. And the cord my not even be covered.

I would not recommend any Shure products because their horrible customer service."
2325,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would just like to say that when it comes to music sound quality, I'm spoiled. I have a sound system in my car that cost me a few K's, and as unfair as it may be, I compare all sound sources to it.

Of course, one cannot expect in-ear headphones to sound exactly like a car's sound system, but one can expect for them sound a little like it. At the $150 and below price range, these are the ones!

I've tried many, many in-ear headphones. Klipsch S4's, Monster Turbines, Audio Technica ATH-CKS70's and the Sony MDR-EX300's just to name a few. Let me say that each of the in-ear's just mentioned perform admirably, but, the SE215's do what all the others do well, in one package. The high's of the S4's? Check. The bass of the Turbine's and CKS70's? Check. The balanced sound of the EX300's? Check. Add to these features the replaceable cable, the perfect seal foam tips, durable construction, great looking transparent enclosure and what can I say? Ladies and gentlemen, I think I have found a keeper.

Buy these. It will be the best $100 you will ever spend. For those of you still using the stock earbuds that come with portable music players, listen to the SE215's and you will never go back!"
2326,5.0 out of 5 stars,isolating earphones that really bring out the best in your music. I am really really pumped up each time I hear my music through this.
2327,5.0 out of 5 stars,"clear sound, headphones stellar quality for this price. you hear all the lows, songs you listened to thousands of times some how sound even better with more clarity. you just have to find the correct tips for your ears simce no two ears are alike."
2328,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned 4 pairs of SHURE headphones. All of them were the 215 variety. Every pair has had one of the speakers stop working. This occurs gradually, first the splitter become shorted and you have to press it to get it to work, next the whole side is dead. I do not recommend this product. I usually got about 9 months from them, 100.00 for 9 months of life is not acceptable. If you have looked on their website to send these in costs about as much as a new set."
2329,5.0 out of 5 stars,He likes the dynamic range of the ear buds and the way they have some noise canceling abilities. The ear buds work with his ear good too. For the money you would be hard pressed to get a better sound.
2330,3.0 out of 5 stars,"the earphones do not sound as good as i have expected, but i am comparing them with se535. it is suitable for entry level but if you got enough cash, go for a higher model from shure directly"
2331,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good at isolating sound passively, take a few days to get used to but I don't even notice the they wrap over my ears anymore. Sound quality is top class and I use these for audio recording work"
2332,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i switched to the SE215s after years of V-Moda buds.

what stands out: sound isolation and bass response (both are incredible)
what doesn't stand out: mids and highs (par for the course)
what disappointed: just about nothing

bottom line: very good IEMs for their price, I highly recommend them over any V-moda buds."
2333,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good but hard to put it on it took me almost an hour to put it on but not bad
2334,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is exceptional I had to replace an old pair so I thought I would upgrade to the new model.

Two cons that I've found in this model:
1) while the cabling looks like a it's better quality than my old pair, there is a slight texture on the wire that when walking rubs against my clothes and carries the sound (via vibration on the outer wire) straight to my ear. It's bizarre, but annoying!

2) the old pair had a black mark, about the size of a dime, on the inside to designate the right ear; this was very useful when putting the headphone on as you can quickly and easily identify which one goes in the right ear. This also allowed you to see it in low light. The SE215 pair has a more elegant, yet small (about the size of a pin head), dot in either blue or red. When I first saw this I thought it was an elegant upgrade, but I constantly find myself fumbling in low light or when boarding a train to figure out which earpiece I'm holding. Also a small issue, but annoying."
2335,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered them for others and they said the earbuds were very uncomfortable, so they were returned."
2336,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are familiar with Shure products, you are probably comfortable with the fit and plastic / foam ear tips. These work as on any other Shure product.

I got these after my beloved E2c earphones finally started dying. So sad to end up with the 215s. The bottom end is very muddled and there's too much of the lower end in the mix. This set lacks the pristine quality of the E2c. The mids and highs are very clear, but the bass distracts quite a bit."
2337,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really rich and clear tones come through these headphones. Worked really well for me!
2338,5.0 out of 5 stars,Husband was very pleased with this gift
2339,2.0 out of 5 stars,no bass at all.
2340,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good, but it is not any better than my $30 ear pods. Gave to my wife for Christmas. She said the things that go around your ears was to much trouble But that is a personal thing.I do not think they are worth the money."
2341,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fit was awkward at first but once you get a good seal the sound is great!
2342,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for a gift and it was great. The only thing was that I had requested that they write a message with it and the message was never put on there.
2343,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe these are a good pair of headphones Amazon says the price list is $199.00
False... if you go to the SHURE web page you'll see that the regular price for these are $99.00 which is the ""special price in Amazon"" where you save 52%
Bad!"
2344,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best earbuds i've ever owned. May be a little uncomfortable at first but you get used to them quick.
2345,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound, but the cable went down after 6 months of almost constant yet gentle use."
2346,5.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for
2347,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product. I've used them for about 2months with no issues. I like that I can purchase a phone cord and replace the cord it came with so I can make/receive calls and play/stop music. Awesome product!!!
2348,3.0 out of 5 stars,"When the earphones work, they sound amazing. Unfortunately for me this is the 2nd pair ive recieved that has a defective left earphone. Sound will hiss, cut in and out when i move around. Sometimes i can move my head slightly and find the sweet spot that will completely cut sound out.

This must be a design flaw because ive read up on other shure models, and similar problems happen to others left earbud."
2349,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own a pair of Shure 835s earbuds. While expensive, they make for wonderful isolation when I fly. the only thing that kept them from being THE perfect headphones was the wire connection to my iPhone. With this bluetooth widget, I have perfection. There is no degradation of the excellent sound quality, they are easy to connect to the earbuds, and no more wires! Ahhh, the bliss of only hearing your favorite music, without getting entangled in the wiring. Perfection!"
2350,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Product defect, the control voice is too loud, for my SE535."
2351,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Everyone seems to praise the sound quality and maybe it is just that i haven't listened to too many earbuds lately but the highs seem to be too sharp and tinny for me like a vocal with knife edges they seem to lose the ambience kind of like CD players when they first came out before they started oversampling the music Anyway either they are just not for me or they need to burn in like speakers or I am doing something wrong. They seem to have a good fit. Unless anyone has any ideas i might just return them

So after listening to them a little longer and trying out the different buds and positioning I started to warm up to them some. Not the sound of my Logitech 6000 over the ear which I guess is to be expected but good enough to add a star to my review

Well now they are my choice for music. The Logitech 6000 right speaker went out after 3 days and I returned them"
2352,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After going through many sets of ear buds because of build quality issues, it was great to find a set that has had no durability problems 18 months after purchase. The sound isolation is good too.

The sound itself is the only real problem here--while it's decent, it's not thrilling. My Aurvanas had the best sound--clear, balanced, nuanced--out of all my many earbud sets but they suffered the same fate as all the rest. They just didn't last very long. These Shure buds, which replaced the Aurvana set, have been a solid replacement. I just wish they sounded a little more vibrant & alive."
2353,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sure, these things sound great plugged into my phone. Extremely flat response, which makes my musician ears oh so happy. Good sounds stage, clear vocals, a violin sounds like a violin. But... Plug these critters into a real amp or a mixer, and wow! Stunning. Almost as good as a really good pair of over-the-ear ... Without the fatigue. Very happy. Definitely a good value."
2354,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these ear buds to use with auto racing. They contour to your ear flush and fit comfortably inside a helmet. Sound is spectacular, as is the noise cancellation (using foam ear inserts, haven't tried the rubber ones yet). If you are riding/driving anything with a helmet and need to hear/communicate with others, or just want to listen to your music/audiobooks in peace without soda cans on your ears, buy these. Buy them. Buy them. Buy them!"
2355,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Prior to purchasing these I owned the Klipsch S4i's. They lasted me about 2.5 years until the left speaker gave out because the wiring near the plug started break from bending in my pocket.

I purchased these due to the stellar reviews. They sound great, with a little less bass than I'm used to with the Klipsch. I will however be returning these. Reason being that I find the cable thicker than I am used to and the over the ear design does not suit my lifestyle. I use these for commuting on BART and on the computer. I like to take one out at times to be able to hear what's being said over the intercom's and when people are talking to me. If I felt I could afford to have more than one pair of ""nice"" earbuds I would keep these - but for my lifestyle I will be buying a different product."
2356,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Awkward design: The wire connecting the two earpieces is very long. When running or working out, you'll find that it flops around. It should have been much shorter. There's enough slack to tuck it into the back of your shirt, but it can still flop out for certain exercises.

The wire has two heavy pieces attached to it. This aggravates the wire length issue, as when it flops out of the back of your shirt, it tends to smack you in the side of the face.

Battery issues: The device does not turn off automatically if there's no sound piping to that. You'll have to manually turn it off by pressing and holding on the switch to conserve battery. If you forget to turn it off, you'll find yourself with a low battery. Furthermore, the device seems to take a long time to charge.

Worst of all, when the battery is running low, a voice will interrupt the music or podcast with ""Battery low."" This message repeats over and over again every couple of minutes. The phone has a battery life indicator on it; a persistent warning is not needed. It effectively reduces the battery life of the earphones to be much shorter than it otherwise would be, as you won't be able to stand to listen to the thing when it's constantly interrupting your podcast.

The sound isolation is fine. The sound quality is fine. It would be nice to see a firmware update to fix the low battery warning spam.

Edit 1/5: The battery has completely died. Will not charge. Do not waste your money on this device."
2357,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This pair of earphones is pretty expensive, but if you can afford it, I recommend it 100 percent. As others have said, this pair of earphones, silence the world around you, and I mean completely silence it. This is truly something you need to experience yourself, to fully understand. The music sounds absolutely beautiful, full of detail and exceptional notes, ones you probably have never before. Putting these earphones on, will give the music life, and you new melodies that would be possible with the earphones that came with your phone, and others alike. It is completely worth the price that I paid for it. The earphones are plastic, which is a downside, but it's great that Shure has a reliable warranty. I did break one of the driver's nozzles, and after sending it in (with a form), they replaced it with no questions. Shure just has great service. Again, I recommend this product to anyone, and you really have to use these to appreciate them.

Unfortunately I did end up losing these, (On a flight, as I'd like to believe) but I recommend this nonetheless. It comes with a small bag, nothing special, some extra ear tips, half silicone and the other half foam. I recommend the foam ones, which is the ones I chose to go with.

Once again I highly recommend these earphones."
2358,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After 10 years of using the same in ear isolation monitors for drumming (M-Audio $150 comparable in ear monitors), they finally died. So, I bought the Shure SE215-K's, and I have to say that they isolate way better then the M-Audios. They are very bassy, almost too much, but if you roll off the bottom end a little, they sound great.

4 stars (and not 5) because of the bass issue. Plus the flexible portion of the wire coming directly off the ear piece that you wrap around the top of your ear isn't quite long enough, they would be more comfortable if they were a little longer. And lastly, the little rubber sheath that you can move/cinch up on the L/R wires is very hard to move, almost to the point of risking causing damage to the wire fittings."
2359,5.0 out of 5 stars,I just got these and put them on with the medium foam ear pieces and they are amazing. All I can hear on my kit is my snare. They block tons of noise and sound AMAZING! I recommended these to everyone I know. Preston - drummer.

2361,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really want to like these headphones. Especially after spending an extra$50.00 for the iphone control cord. I've had them a couple of months, and listened with different ear buds with the same results. Muddled sound. No treble and not good base. The head phones that came with my I phone blow these away. I'm ready to throw them in the trash, but I'll use them now and then hoping they will sound better. No luck so far."
2362,5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW.
2363,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor fit, weak bass and vocals. Can't understand the hype. I've use $5 earphones that have sounded better. For reference I like a neutral sound.

2364,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure headphones seemed to be good quality but getting them to fit correctly was impossible, we tried all of the different ends that came with the headphones and none were comfortable and the wire that goes over your ear is a real pain."

2372,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't say enough about these earphones. I am a drummer that made the switch to in-ear monitoring about six months ago and have never looked back. Starting with cheap earbuds and then moving up to a pair of Klipsch S4 earbuds, I have been looking at these for awhile and finally decided to try them out because of the list of nice features they offer for the price. I wish I would have started out with these.
My Klipsch's sounded very good but these blow them away! The bass is unbelievable and the clarity and mix of highs, mids, and lows is perfect IMO. These Shures are so comfortable that I actually forget that I have them in. The way they sit in your ear and the cord comes out the front and goes over the top of the ear makes them look very professional. The replaceable cord is also a huge plus. These are simply great earbuds for either general music listening or an entry level IEM system. I am currently using these with a Behringer 802 mixer, for monitor feeds, and I couldn't be happier. Stop looking and buy these now if you've been thinking about it!"
2373,2.0 out of 5 stars,"My apple earphones are better than these. Worth $100? No way. Difficult to put on and stay in my ear. I can still hear outside noises as well. Sound quality? Not what I expect from $100 earphones.

Bottom line: Waste of money."
2374,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a terrible experience with Shure and their customer service. I enjoyed the headphones but they were of a very low quality, failing within 12 months of buying them. They had a 2 year warranty so I sent them in and had them fixed/replaced. I used the replacement set for another 12 months and they failed again. I attempted to return the headphones for a second time but was informed my warranty expired 2-3 weeks before contacting the company. They were used for very light use and as an engineer in charge of quality at a manufacturing company I'd have to say these have a failed design.

Stick to the headphones that come with your iPod or try another manufacturer."
2375,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work
2376,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these Shure SE 215 a few months ago,and I was looking forward to using these highly rated (by their advertising) earphones.

First of all, the over the ear wiring is cumbersome to use, particularly if you like to just put them on and start listening to music. They take a certain amount of playing with to get them just right, and then they take a fair amount of getting used to. This is not a plus.
Secondly, I thought the music quality was a little tinny and vague, almost like listening in a tunnel, with the music way in the background. I thought it must be me, so recently I did a comparison with all of my earphones, and guess what, these earphones are definitely inferior to many of the earphones out there, which cost less than half as much.

I compared five different sets, with many different music types, and compared the same tracks for each earphone set, to try and be objective. The SE215 performed poorly. I compared a $ 29.00 set of iLuvs, a set of original equipment iPod earphones, a $ 12.00 set of iLuvs, a set of Sharper Image ( about $15.00) and the Shures. The SE 215 were last in the comparison for the reasons I mentioned above, but primarily the sound was far inferior to the others, although the Sharper Image versions were only a little better. By far the two best were the $ 29.00 iLuvs and the original equipment earphones that came with the iPod.

I would definitely say, save your money do not get these SE 215s. I feel that the iLuvs are the best value for the money (of these compared). I also have a pair of Sony noise cancelling earphones, which I did not use for this comparison as I thought that might be an unfair comparison, and those sound really good too.

I understand all of us hear differently, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt, you may hear something I didn't.

Hope someone finds this helpful."

2378,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I find them impossible to fit properly so they sound like crap and fall out. You are supposed to wrap the cord around your ear and it is just a huge PITA. I've had them for 2 years, tried everything off and on, always end up frustrated and sorry I wasted money."

2380,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound when they worked! This is my second pair of Sure headphones, and the audio drivers are better than ever, but... the connector piece to the ear-bud is junk. After one month the sound would cut in and out from the slightest movement. Now no sound at all. This problem is wide spread with this design. Just read the other reviews for sure headphones with this same design. It's as if they never field tested these."

2383,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had these headphones for about 2 months before i broke them on accident (it was my fault not the headphones) but while i had the sound for rock,jazz,classical and country were good but for electronic songs like skrillex,tiesto,etc they sounded really bad, i wouldn't recommend this if you want to listen to electronic songs or rap"
2384,2.0 out of 5 stars,they break too easily
2385,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after 6 months of light use. Now the left ear will stop playing music intermittently but come back on if I jiggle the headphones around a little. Annoying for such an expensive product.
2386,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a dedicated SHURE listener for several years. My most recent pair was the SE210. Unfortunately they finally fell apart so I decided to upgrade to the 215s. Sadly, almost everything I love about the 210s has been changed for the worse with the 215s.

The biggest reason I fell in love with SHURE at first listen many years ago was the clear articulation of every instrument and voice in my music. Every strum of the guitar, every vocal overtone, every snap of the snare drum was perfectly and crisply rendered. WOW! Now that's a sound worth paying some money for! It was easy to fall in love with that perfection.

But with the 215s, all of a sudden, that crispness is gone... the individual articulation is muddied - the tones, once separate and distinctly recognizable, now bleed into and over each other... this is what I bought SHURE to get away from!

Turns out that in the 210s, Shure used a Balanced Armature design for the micro-speaker. In the 215s they decided to go with a Dynamic Microdriver design. I don't know anything more about those two designs than this: one produces beautiful, articulate sound, and the other is sloppy, indiscriminate, and uninspiring. This is a HUGE step down in quality.

Another reason I loved Shure on first listen is that they didn't blast me with extra bass. Their bass was solid, deep, and expressive, but never over-amped nor overbearing. This too has changed with the 215s; the bass is just overblown now and I had no other choice but to choose the ""Bass Reducer"" profile in my ipod EQ.

I found that getting a secure fit with the earbuds was much more difficult with the 215s as well. Sadly, that was the least of my worries.

After a few days I just couldn't stand it. I wanted to love the 215s, but I had to return them. What a HUGE disappointment."
2387,1.0 out of 5 stars,Beware. Shure has the worst customer service and warranty on earbuds. just dealt with them on an issue. I will never buy Shure again.
2388,1.0 out of 5 stars,no bass! for a bass player you are in big trouble!
2389,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I use earbuds pretty much only when I cut my lawn. I've been using a pair of jvc in ear buds I bought from wal-mart $20 for years. My wife gave me these shure se-215 noise cancelling earbuds for christmas and I was excited until I used them. The sound was inferior to my cheap jvc earbuds. The highs were way less clear and defined and the bass was non-existant even with the largest foam earbuds they provided with the unit. On top of if all, the plug didn't fit it my phone with any of the 4 cases I have and they are minimalist cases. So every time I used these earbuds with my phone I would have to take the case off. I kept trying to like these because my wife paid so much for them but I just kept going back to my old faithful jvc cheapies. The final straw was when I left my jvc earbuds at work and I had to use these. I dropped my phone from maybe 2 feet while using these, no case because of the stupid plug design, and cracked my screen. I've dropp3d my phone several times before with no issue with the case. I threw them in the garbage because I was tired of trying to like trash because my wife paid waaaayyy to much for this junk."
2390,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor bass response, not at all worth the price. Was major disappointment vs equivalent Klipsch models. Mos tother reviewers commented on the lack of bass response as well, but understate how bad it is."
2391,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is written by a non-audiophile so a bit of a caveat first of all. I use my headphones primarily with my iphone 4. My old headphones was a Shure SE110 which I used with the MPA-3C music adaptor.

The SE215 was ultimately disappointing. They do sound great. Compared to the SE110 the bass was deeper and the overall sound just seemed more clear, distinct, and richer. However there were several problems that does not make it user friendly:

1)The first problem was evident immediately - the huge plug does not fit in the iphone 4 jack with the Apple Bumper on. I use the my iphone for the gym and on the subway to work so this was a huge problem right away. I had to take off the bumper to even try the headphones. Even without the bumper, the fit was awkward as the plug was L shaped so it juts out from the iphone a little making it hard to put in and out of your pocket.

2) The ear piece is much more angled. I found it much harder to put in your ear and get a proper fit as you have to put it in jussst right. You have to worry about both depth and Lateral placement to get the right fit. The Shure SE110 was much easier as the total shape was similar to an ear plug and inserting the earpiece was exactly like putting in an earplug. Since the SE110 earpiece was shaped more like a pickle, you only had to worry about depth placement.

3) I had ear fatigue from the SE215 after about only 15 minutes. Never had that with the SE110. I think this is because the SE215, due to its angle, is actually touching a lot more of the ear. I did find it easier to rest my head sideways on the couch with them on though as the SE110 jutted out of the ear too much

4) The cord is really long. I mean for years Shure bragged how their cable lengths were modular so you can get the length how you want it. For some reason they turned away from this with the SE215. That makes my perfectly good MPA-3C adaptor completely unusable as a) I then have like 9 feet of cord and b) the microphone and controls are impossibly too far away to be of any use. So if you want to control the iphone from your headphones, you have to spend another $50 for yet another music accessory, the Shure CBL-M+K Music Phone Accessory. (Even if you don't, you have to get it anyway or something similar if you want to use the SE215 with the iphone 4 and bumper)

So very high marks for sound, durability (I've had them for 1 week now but they seem very high quality construction) but I wish I stuck with the SE110 or went with the SE115s instead or maybe tried a different brand entirely for use with my iphone 4.

BTW, I would shop around and do your research before buying headphones as this retailer along with others charge a 15% restocking fee, plus you have to pay for the original ""free"" shipping as well as shipping back to the retailer. So these $99 headphones would have cost me $30+ to return. Instead I opted to get the mobile accessory so I ended up paying $150."
2392,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great with few minor complaints.

I just got my Shure SE215 Clear earphones. I immediately tried them and road-tested them. Overall they are awesome except few complaints. I hope this doesn't damper your dream of owning one.

Good: Sound Quality and noise reduction:

Excellent and Awesome. I could hear even the weakest background note clear. Sound is well balanced. The Bass is perfect, not artificially amp'd to give you headache.
These earphones block most of the outside noise. I swear. On the LIRR train ride between my place and Penn station in NYC, I couldn't hear a decibel of outside noise. I couldn't hear the loud station announcement, not the loud chatter of girls sitting next to you, not the train sound. Nada. This was not possible with my old earphones. These are perfect for outdoor listening but watch where you use it (read on)

Bad: Noise reduction:
It blocks way too much noise to be used where you shouldn't be using an earphone - like biking, walking on the street or crossing roads.
Your ears tend to get heavy after an hour of listening. Probably because this earphone blocks most of the noise and all you listen is just music. It just isn't healthy for ears. Take breaks every half an hour to relieve your ear pressure.

Bad: Style & looks:

It takes a little effort to get used to wearing these but they fit perfectly firm. I bought the clear model as I was attracted by the shiny new silver like finsh in the photo. I thought they are a perfect show off but I'm disappointed. The SE215-CL looks much dull than in real-life than in picture. You can't see it unless you open the package. Since these fit in a certain weird way - like around your ear, I have people staring at me in public. Not sure if it is good or bad.

If style and look matters to you, checkout a real life picture of CLEAR and BLACK before purchasing.
Note: B&H photo store in NYC has SE215-CL for $89 ($10 less than black). Don't know why.

Good: Cord:
Cord quality is awesome. It has kevlar coating and unlike rubber I don't think it will break or tear. It is one of the reasons I chose this over Etymotic or Klipsch. And the most convenient thing is that the cord is behind your ears when you wear them and they don't fall in front of your face when you bend down.

Bad: Cord:
It just won't bend as much as the rubber cord does. A really really minor concern.

Overall: Sound quality matters to me more than looks. I just wish they had made the CLEAR ones like shown in the picture. Just saying."

2397,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this item from Guitar center and decided to take the risk of buying it because the sales person said it's not returnable. It was $99 and I like the thought of it being sound isolation. Got home and tried to put this together and it was complicated and does not stay in the ear!! On top of that, the sound quality is SO BAD!! I ordered an $8 earphone from Amazon months ago (forgot the name brand) and it sounds WAY better than this $99 product! I so regret buying this item and I can't return it or even exchange it. So not satisfied. I originally bought a different SHURE earphones and didn't like it because the sound quality was really bad. So, i exchanged it for this piece. Worst shopping ever for me. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER BUY ANY PRODUCTS BY SHURE!!!!!!! BE WARE!"
2398,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Forget Dr Dre,forget klipsch,and definitely forget BOSE this is the earphone to get. This is by far one of the best $99 I ever spent on a pair of earphones. The fit is outstanding,the build quality of the SE215 is identical to Shure's $499 triple driver SE535. For $99 I challenge any one to do better than that. I highly recommend this earphones"
2399,1.0 out of 5 stars,http://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones-headphones/se-earphones they sell these on the actual wesite for 100. 50% off my ass! Oh yeah and BTW WTF is SE215-K is that a way of saying if the product is not working correctly Shure is not responsible for it?
2400,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 5th pair of earbuds and my second pair of Shures. With the foam ear plugs, they do a great job of noise isolation. And the sound they produce is the best of any I've ever tried though I've never paid more than about $150 for buds. Clear highs, and full (enough) bass, with no discernible overemphasis on any range. Took me nearly an hour to figure out how to get them to fit well, and after a few times, they still take some wiggling to get them in right. I won't use them at the gym where I just want to pop in the buds. There, I'll continue to use my Shure e2c's. But I will use them on a plane or at home, where there's time to fiddle. And I can't let this review go by without mentioning how much better these are than the crappy Klipsch S4i buds. Really, like night and day."
2401,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You, the review reader, probably need to be reminded that headphones are very subjective.

To start off, if the over ear wire design bothers you, if you care about looking cool with your headphones in, or have really weird shaped ears, I do not recommend these. In fact, I'd even go as far as to say if you are looking purely for sound quality you could probably find some headphones of the same quality for a slightly cheaper price (and that aren't annoying to put on and take off), but these Shures have 2 things really going for them:

1. Durability: The cable is THICK. The part where the wire splits, and the 90 degree jack are both reinforced with an almost dramatic amount of heavy duty plastic, but if you ever somehow damage the wire you can remove the buds and replace the cable (but replacements are expensive so you should still try not to). The only part of them I'm slightly concerned about breaking are the parts where the the rubber tips attach to the plastic tube on the buds. The plastic tubes that are cast as part of the buds aren't too reassuring, but after falling asleep lying on top of them a few times I haven't broken them off yet.

2. Isolation: I'm just a poor high school student whose only source of income is mowing lawns for my neighbors. I wanted some nice headphones, and I justified spending $100 on a pair if I could wear them while mowing. These headphones are perfect for using in loud environments. My lawnmower is very loud. I couldn't tell you how many decibels it is, but it's probably louder than your average lawnmower and with no music they work just as well as those foam earplugs for blocking out noise. At 50% volume I can hear my music very clearly, and at 75% I almost stop noticing the awful noise of the old lawnmower engine and worn out bearings. I don't know why I hadn't thought of this sooner!

As for sound quality, if I'm totally honest, I was a little disappointed with the sound quality of my ""expensive"" headphones on the first day, but after maybe a week or so the range of sound became more broad. I've had them for a few months, but I was waiting to test them while mowing before typing up this review. The quality is very good, in my opinion. They are meant to be used as monitors so the sound is fairly neutral, meaning that they have a good range of sound with no ""boosted bass"" or distortion in the highs that I can detect (again headphones are subjective). But despite not having exaggerated bass, my Beats loving friends were impressed with them listening to their mainstream pop and hip-hop. Also,this may seem like a weird description, but it feels like the sound from the speakers is only in your thoughts,as opposed to filling the air around you. It's not bad in my opinion, but it is different."
2402,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These replaced my previous Shure ear buds. I really like the sound these deliver. It took a lot of getting used to the strange way these 215K fit in the ear. Once you get used to the fit, it's actually easier to use these earbuds while lying down on a pillow or something. My only complaints are the fit took awhile to get used to and they get tangled really easily. The left earbud quit working yesterday. There must be a short in the wire. Moderate use, always keep them in their case. The one upside to this is the wires disconnect from the earbuds themselves so I plan on purchasing a replacement if warranty will not cover this."
2403,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these as a birthday present about a year ago and just love them. Also currentlyown Beats sports earbuds (the red ones) and the sound on the Shure blows away the Beats. I love the design, the snug fit and the quality of the sound. I hear things I never knew existed in the song! The reason I came on line was to look at upgrading - and am considering the higher end Shure.

I understand the negatives people write about but put it this way - the negatives on these are mere inconveniences - personally, I can't think of a negative. Just buy them and you'll understand. I run an hour at good speed 4 days a week - work up a sweat and have no problems with these (as compared to almost every other ""sport earbud"" I've purchased)."
2404,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality exceeds my hopes. The base really helps keep me motivated in the gym when running and cycling. I just hope I don't ruin them from sweating too much. Second pair of Shure earphones in 7 years which is saying alot. Sadly, my first pair got caught in the car door and meet an early grave. Just stands to reason if you take care of them, they should last you awhile."
2405,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The earphones are quality material and quality sound. They're slightly difficult to put on comfortably, but once they're in the sound is amazingly full and crisp. Unfortunately, the right earbud broke within two months but luckily Shure offers a 2-year warranty with the product.

UPDATE: It is now almost three years since I bought these and they still work like new. When the right earbud broke, I shipped it to Shure and they fixed it at no cost. I haven't even changed the interchangeable earbud because they last for a really long time. Most incredible of all, I've forgotten them in the washing machine and the earphones still work great. Highly recommended, it's worth the $100 investment for these quality earbuds."
2406,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing! I got these for a recording session to try to block out the stage noise so that I could clearly distinguish what was coming from the sound board. They block out all of the ambient noise that isn’t coming directly from them. I am sitting about 20 feet from the musicians playing acoustic guitars, acoustic violin, trumpet, cajone, acoustic piano with only a standard interior door separating us and I don’t hear a thing that these are not directly producing."
2407,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first IEMs that I have purchased for myself. I've heard a few others, S4s, Beats, Turbines, and these by far out-perform those in my opinion.

I'm not exactly an audiophile, but I do love precise sound with good clarity and balance/neutrality. These have just enough bass for my taste, not too little, not too much. The sub-bass could have more impact, but it is a minor complaint. Lows are accurate and do not get muddy. Satisfying. Mids are splendid, clear and warm. Highs can fall off a little bit, but they're still good. Sound-stage is wide for a single dynamic driver. Using this with a HiFiMeDIY Sabre USB DAC and a Electric Avenues PA2V2 portable amp.

Comfortable and I'm using the medium foams. I had no problem putting them in or any discomfort. Used them for lifting weights today and had no issues. The cord is a little heavy but it doesn't bother me at all, I guess it is a complaint for some?

They look alright, not the best looking around but not ugly by any means. (I have the SE215-K [black])

The case is nice and simple, and the warranty is a nice 2 year.

Came in great condition in the box, not even a small scratch or dent on the box.

Can't complain, these are wonderful!"
2408,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
-Wireless means I can ditch the tether to the phone, which works well for me
-Seems to retain the same quality as corded version
-Can control volume and track via controller, as well as integrated mic

Cons:
-mic is often muffled and the caller cannot hear me well, quality lacking
-The collar clip broke after exactly two months of careful use

Regarding the collar clip, I called Shure today to ask for a replacement. Their reply was, ""Sorry but this is not a part that comes w/ the RMCE-BT1, but we can send you the clip for the wired version, EAC64BK."" After explaining it absolutely does come with the set, I was transferred to somebody else who I left a message with. I'm yet to hear back, but as of now, it is unacceptable that a) the clip broke after two months of light use b) that Shure's own parts department can't locate a simple clip that does in fact come with the headphones. Until I can get this resolved my review will stay at one star. Please make this right Shure. I've spent hundreds of dollars on your products to date."
2409,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is THE BEST monitoring in-ear earphones for the price!
Even tho caging of earphone is plastic, it doesn't look cheap at all.
The materials used were not cheap or lame.
It is legit earphone not only for monitoring but also for enjoying the music.
It's got high quality sound. The treble, mid and bass are evenly divided and they are super clear.
The sound isolation is the best and fit is super comfortable.
I have beats by dr. dre Tour and Solo, and for the comparison, I would say Shure SE215 is better even though it's much cheaper.
I strongly recommend this earphone for those who are looking for a pair quality earphone with $100 budget."
2410,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just what you expect from Shure products! I've been performing for 6 years and I always have had issues with floor monitors. I got the chance to afford my 1st set of in-ears monitor 3 years ago and of course I got the SE215 CL. I loved them since the beginning! I jump a lot onstage and normally perform wearing one earplug and the other one around my neck. Due to this the one that is loose around my neck is normally bouncing from one side to another. After 3 years of doing that, one of the earplugs got damaged and It wasn't properly working. That's why I got a new pair a few weeks ago and as expected they work awesome! Totally recommended!"
2411,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic. I wanted something for cutting the grass and didn't want to spend a lot of money or have a Bluetooth or power pack for headphones. These are great and I love how they fit my ears. I listen to podcasts while mowing and can hear with crystal clarity what they are saying and only hear the mower if I focus on it. Also, no battery pack like others since this is a passive noise canceling ie: the fit of the piece and foam inserts. Easily one of the best purchases made!"
2412,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent but both the cable and the replacement cable I bought ended up failing.

The first cable had a faulty plug. The headphones only played sound if the plug was turned to a specific angle. The second pair failed on the actual cable. The part of the cable near the earpiece which bends around your ear became sensitive as well. If it was in the wrong position it wouldn't allow sound through.

Great headphones, awful cables."
2413,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an updated review of Shure SE215 headphones, which I purchased in 3.5 years ago. I have been using them since then for running and general use. I revised my rating to 5 starts, and am updating this review since the original posting. These headphones turned out to be among the best investments I made.

Sound quality: is very good, surely not exceptional, but for the price they sound amazing, with no blown bass, and quite clear throughout the range. Since buying these headphones, I listened multiple times to Bose or Beats headphones, and keep wondering why people invest so much money into those? After trying several alternatives, including the one listed below, I found the SE215 to provide the most pleasant sound, without distortions.

Durability: one of the main reasons for this update is how superbly durable these headphones are. I have ran more than 1,500 miles in them, though rain, cold, snow, and hot (sweaty) weather. While they are not advertised as sports headphones, they surely perform as such. Never had any problem, and thanks to the ear-hooks design, they stay secure through the whole marathon distance, without dislodging.

Sound isolation: the included foam tip provides an excellent sound isolation. I use them on long flights, and have been very happy over the years. While I never used the active noise-cancelling headphones, these headphones have been always more than enough to provide sufficient noise reduction for a comfortable sleep,

In summary, I highly recommend these as a multi-purpose, good fidelity headphones, especially for running/exercises.

Original Review: Relatively happy, much better than Sennheiser CX 685 which had worse quality sound. Still this is no match to my Denon AHD1001S, in terms of depth of sound and fidelity, but still pretty decent sound across different music styles. I use them for running, and they stay quite fit for the first 30 minutes, but then start to slide when get sweaty, so need to keep readjusting. Overall good value."
2414,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the SE215 after my old SE115 broke (after 6 years of use). I was very pleased to find that the new SE215 is at the same price as the old SE115. I primarily use this for commuting, working out, etc., when audio fidelity isn't as critical as noise cancellation. This is significantly better than the SE115, and I assume the SE112 (since 115 and 112 are the same); it's better in that the bass range is better, and the higher notes are clearer. They are very comfortable to wear, and it's quiet enough on planes that I can't hear the engine noise at all.

Now, comparing this to the significantly more pricey SE425, I would say that the SE215s offer about 90% of the sound quality/fidelity than the SE425 set. I've owned the SE425 line for a while, and I reserve that for when I'm working at home; the SE425 is really more suitable for classical music and jazz when you want more clarity to hear every little detail. I would say that if you really want a pair of quality headphones that will make the world silent and the music pleasant, the SE215 is a very good deal.

Compared to other headphones like the Etymotic HF5 set (which I also own), this is significantly better at noise reduction, as well as clarity of sound. The rubber ear sets also last way longer on the Shures for any set.

The cord does not tangle easily, and quite frankly is cheap to replace if you damage them or if your cat/dog chews on them. That's another advantage over the SE115/2 set this SE215 has -- you can replace the cord and keep the earphones. Very good investment if you damage your cords more than once a year.

Take note, however, that you cannot drop, knock, or throw these around like you would a cheaper set of earphones -- the drivers do get damaged if you do that; they will burn out. I had that happen with my SE425 set a year ago, and the cost to fix was over 50% of the original purchase price. Take care of these, and they will serve you well!"
2415,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect headphones for playing on my worship team. They hook behind my ears and have really great sound. I needed better headphones for the weekend worship sets but didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars. These were recommended by my production friend, and are great.
If you're needing better headphones for worship team, and you use Avioms or wireless transmitters for the band, these work fabulously."
2416,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a professional musician I’ve come to rely on the quality of Shure products and this headset with its exceptional sound quality delivered. The foam earpiece attachments are varied in size to ensure a nice snug fit.

I can safely say I may never purchase anything other than Shure ever again."
2417,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215s are some amazing little headphones for $99. The sound Isolation is above and beyond what I could have ever asked for. even at low I can not hear hardly anything. I have burned these in over the last week and I feel the bass has tightened a bit but still has a nice punch to it. The mids and highs are there but I could ask for more. I want to upgrade to the se535s already as have triple the drivers would really help with sound quality across the board. Understandably these are $99 dollar buds, so for the price these are some of the best bass headphones around. The around the ear design really helps with the isolation and bass reproduction, however it will take a day or two to get used to. As I have had these a little over a week I have put the rounds through these things and can say the durability is very nice. We will see in the next few months if they have problems like a few others have had but as of now I simply cant think of another ear bud in this price range I could recommend over these.

2418,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After having had many sets of headphones that were good, but not great - they each lacked something: Sony - too bassy; Sennheiser, good, but distorted sometimes and lacked midrange and the bass sometimes was too bassy like the Sonys; Shure SCL2s - never had enough bass and stuck out of my ears, so I couldn't put my head against a pillow or airplane seat; Shure SCL3s - better sound, slightly better bass, but still couldn't rest my head on a pillow. Enter the Shure SE215s..... Very well balanced sound - I had to turn off my iPod EQ to get tonal balance (excellent sign for the headphones) and strong, but not overwhelming bass came through. midrange is also strong and the treble doesn't blow your ears away. I can finally rest my head on a pillow!!! They fit snugly and I think the wraparound wire makes sense and is comfortable. I can listen to these headphones for hours without discomfort and finally feel I got my bang for the buck. Now, what to do with all those other duds that came before.....?"
2419,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked these and had them for 4 years. The sound and noise-cancelling on these are excellent. I would have rated them a 5-star because the cable is absurdly long. It's annoying when you work out with these. I use them all the time, and keep the case clipped to my backpack. The loop that attaches the clip to the case is flimsy. Somehow mine lasted 4 years, but it was ""gone"" this past weekend. A $100 paid of earbud deserves a sturdier case.... Oh well."
2420,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just received the cables today and I and am pleased with how easy it is to sync to my iPhone to my SE425. The sound is solid. No regret with my purchase. I did not want to get another set of earbuds since I love my shure earbuds.
2421,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these earphones as a gift for my younger son for Christmas. I was originally looking at the Klipsch S4 Image (which are also good earphones), but was fortunate to find these on a Black Friday Sale for under $90 - less than $10 more than the Klipsch, so I opted to go with them. I'm ""old school"" when it comes to quality of construction and weigh it heavily when making purchase decisions. These fit the bill, and are much sturdier than the Klipsch. I, myself, own a pair of SE425 and have been extremely pleased with the performance, and since I gave these SE215s to my son on Christmas, he's commented numerous times on how happy he is with their fit and performance. Do the research, and I believe you'll find this is a worthy contender for your hard-earned $$$ - especially when you can get near $200 earphones for less than half the price!"
2422,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's clear that the attachment points between the earpiece and the cord degrade over time and cause some cutting in and out of the audio. This can get very annoying, and I will update this review when I buy a new cord and try them again.
The sound is absolutely great, though, and they do a nice job of isolating you from the noise of the outside world. I use them regularly on wingsuit skydives, and I get a little wind noise but my tunes sound nice!

Despite my limited experience with other brands, I'd say these will beat the rest at similar price points. Second pair of higher end Shure IEMs and I'll keep buying them despite the little snag with the cord..."
2423,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I start off the review, I would like to put a disclaimer in that I am not an audiophile in any way. What I'm about to say is based off of my experience and what may be good will be considered negative to other users. Please bear in mind that not everyone will have the same hearing you do so with that said let the review begin.

I reviewed the HAFX101 headphones and pretty much convinced myself not to purchase any earphones that cost above a 100 due to the sound quality that those earphones gave off. I thought ""why need to spend a ridiculous amount of money just to get ""high end"" item when you can buy multiple earphones and have backups for you in the event that you break them"". I was definitely wrong and being really ignorant. I just purchased these . I'm going to admit, these earphones are amazing. Of course, I wouldn't know what the other high end earphones are like since these are my first time purchasing high end (many of you will probably not consider this high end so I apologize for calling them an upper tier, bear with me for a bit) earphones and NOT HEADPHONES and the difference between these and the HAFX101's make it distinguishable day and night. I'm hearing things that I don't normally hear especially with my old HAFX101 and on top of that they even make my Bose Soundtrue headphones very underwhelming. The high's are very warm and not screechy, bass isn't muddled (thank the sound gods) and audible, mids are strong and clear with again details that I've never heard with my other earphones. Even at lower hearing volumes you can still hear each and every distinct sound and instrument that you can find (I have sensitive hearing so I usually play songs at 2 - 4 volume and sometimes 5 but no more than that on the Note 4. I preferably play at 3 because I like playing for hours on end). On top of that you have MODULAR SET of earphones and what I mean by module is that you can seperate the actual earphones from the cables just as you can see in the pictures presented in the product page which means, if you ever break your cables you don't have two buy a new pair. All you have to do is buy a replacement cable and your set and you also have a 2 year warranty from shure so if anything ever happens to your pair then just mail them in and your good to go for a brand new set (just as long as you follow their policy for warranty then you should be in good hands with Shure).

The one thing I'm a tad bit concerned is how you change the earpieces on the earphones. It feels like your yanking out the whole assembly and I'm the type of person that is OCD about keeping things in good condition. Seeing that, I decided to remove the memory foams (I'm comfortable with the silicone tips) and decided to never remove the pieces again. The way you place these inside your ears is something your going to have to get used to and I found myself struggling for a couple of minutes just to be able to put these earphones in both of your ears. One more thing that is just a personal issue of mine (not sure if anyone else hear feels the same way) but I just wished that the earphones themselves (not the cables) we're made of some type of metal like the RHA T10i (which I might purchase as a collection of earphones). It would've been icing on the cake to have had these made out of metal but that's just a personal preference.

At the end of the day, I still give these 5 stars due to it's design, functionality, and most of all it's sound quality and as to the people who are wondering.... why in the world am I giving it 5 when I was able to find a good amount of negatives that came along with it. Well..... again it depends on a person's experience with their earphones and honestly, all those things the I listed are OUTWEIGHED by the positives that are presented in these earphones. With that said, this has nothing but a joy to my ears and to the purchasing price and for a 100 bucks, you can't go wrong with these earphones. I probably will give an update on how these earphones are but so far, I'm really happy with my purchase and do I want to venture out and see all the other great earphones available, why yes I do. Many more reviews to come and this is just one of those reviews (a very satisfying review)."
2424,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these looking for a new pair of IEM's (in-ear monitor) and I found the perfect ones. I can't quite afford brand such as Ultimate Ears (starting at $300 for a decent pair) or JH Audio (starting at $400) but these are on par. The sound quality is better than my Bose earphones and they fit better too. They have no business sounding this good for the price. I wanted something that fit perfectly and were hard to see on stage. I bought the I-MEGO Ztone at the same time because I liked the design, but the sound wasn't even close to comparable. These should cost $250-$300 but for only $97 they are fantastic.

Pros: Crystal clear perfect sound, fit is great, moldable ear hooks, interchangeable ear insert, removable cable (allowing for longer life), compares to IEM's costing hundreds more, perfect mix of bass mid and high.

Cons: Only two choice's of colors (I would've loved gold) ear pieces are tough to get off.

UPDATE: After I bought the IEM's, I found out my entire band for church uses these earphones. No one had complaints. Everyone loved the sound, feel, and especially the quality for the money."
2425,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wear these for 2 hours minimum per day. They fit nicely and stay secure without much fiddling. I will backup a few other reviews I've seen about them being difficult to fit the first few times you use them. the cable that attaches directly to the monitor is stiff and is meant to fold around the top of your ear and come down behind it.

Once you get them fitted and know how to put them on, they are amazing. I would easily say these are the best headphones I've had in a LONG time."
2426,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first pair of IEMs. So, factor that in as you see fit. That being said, I have played two gigs with these and have been quite happy with them. My budget was limited, but I feel like I definitely picked a quality product for the money spent. I understand the limitations of a single driver system, but luckily this band's sound guy is an expert with in-ear technology and provided a very clean feed that I can mix myself through my iPad. These IEMs fit snugly around my ears, fit well inside my ears, and are comfortable all night long. Again, I am relatively new to working like this (I'm a middle-aged drummer accustomed to using monitor wedges), but I'd recommend these. If nothing else, you'll have a relatively inexpensive set of IEMs as a backup. :P Seriously though, I suspect you could find a much worse pair of IEMs."
2427,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a pair of Sennheiser Momentum On-Ears which are fantastic, but was looking for something a little more portable. These earphones are great! I've had them for almost two weeks and the sound is phenomenal - bass is just enough and doesn't overwhelm the mids and the highs a just right. This is what I would classify as a warm sounding set, which is a signature that I find most pleasant across the music genres I like to listen to - rock, classical, new age, & trance, among others . While the foam tips are great, I ended up using Klipsch S4 tips that I had laying around as they fit my ears perfectly and are are extremely comfortable. If the included tips quite don't feel right, go get these - this is the only reason why I gave this a 4 star instead of 5, but hey, Klipsch has a patent on their tips. The over the ear was a little awkward at first, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly and the body ""snaps"" into the bowl of the ear very easily and ensures a good solid fit. The noise isolation is great, do not use these to run or ride your bike. The cable is thick, sturdy, and essentially free of microphonics. Overall, I am very pleased and see myself having these for a long time."
2428,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have small ears so finding a really good pair of earbuds that fits my ears is not easy so I was very happy with these. They fit into the cavity of my small ears and the wires are bendable and stiff so they keep their shape. This means that I can basically fit the main part into the cavity of my small ears and mold the stiff wires over my ears to keep everything in place. Fantastic. The sound is also really excellent. I love that the wires are changeable as I've had Sony and two Sennheiser's before and each lasted about 2 years with the wires being the weakest link. With these, if the wires go, you can just buy new wires and screw them in.

It lost 1 star because mainly for the instructions of putting them into your ears. It's a bit tricky to put in at first and it seems to be getting easier with time but it's been a few months and I still find myself fumbling. If the instructions were better I'd know if it's my method that's totally wrong or if it really just takes time."
2429,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's nice to hear good staging and clear mids from earphones in this price range. The bass is present, fully represented without exaggeration. I can hear reverb and vocal nuances I have been missing with cheaper headsets. I wanted a clear and neutral sound, and that's what I got.

A few notes for smartphone users, the jack is right-angled, and very thick. As a result, it would not plug into my phone with the TPU case on. I fixed this by using a x-acto knife to open the hole in the case a bit. If you buy the android/ios headset accessory with mic/buttons, be aware that the cable provided is not as good as the original, and won't wrap behind the ears easily."
2430,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok corny title but I had to do it. Everyone needs to find their sound. I found them in shure headphones. These are by far the best balanced in ear headphones I have heard. I have tried Sennheiser MM50, Klipsch image s4, Apple in-ear headphones, and my Shure ec2 (R.I.P.) headphones. Nothing to me compares to shure headphones. The sound is so crisp and clean compared to the others. MM50 sounded muddy and did the apple in-ears. S4's sounded very tinny (hurt my ears on the high end) Shure headphones have none of that. Tight bass, good highs, and maybe you can make an argument the mid range is lacking a bit but that shortcoming is quick overcome with the overall sound quality. Like my older ec2 (which I used a few times a week before they died 6 years later) the new SE 215 did not disappoint."
2431,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this product for about 6 months and the performance has been consistent throughout
I also own a pair of bose mie2i earphones, and in my opinion the shure 215's have more acoustic merit

Pros
good sound isolation
very good sound quality: very solid bass that balances well with treble;
with noise isolation it creates a well-rounded listening experience
appears as in picture- people will notice the unconventional design
earbud covers come in several sizes and in foam earplug-like material (for better sound isolation) as well as conventional rubber

Cons
although the cord is extremely thick and resilient, the detaching mechanism, despite the good intentions
of giving you the capability of replacing faulty wires without having to replace the drivers, seems fairly temperamental.
After about 5 months of regular but cautious use, I noticed in the middle of listening to something the right driver had ceased to function
However, after fiddling with it slightly, the sound came back on. After further inspection and several other occurrences, I think the problem
has to do with the connection between driver and cord because it starts working again when I rotate the driver around the socket a certain way

Once this issue presented itself, I started using them only at home so as to avoid further stressing the connection.
The reason I'm writing this review half a year after purchase is because I just picked them up after several weeks of not using them,
and the acoustic difference between shure and bose has struck me so much I decided to write this"
2432,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried Ultimate Ears 600, Sennheiser MM50, and Bose IE2 in-ear/earbuds and these Shure SE215-K headphones (Live Sound Monitor) are by far the best. The Bose earbuds are slightly more comfortable, but they just rest in the cup of your ear where the foam tips on these do a much better job of blocking out external noise and transmitting sound. That means the quality of the music really shines through. I'd like to balance this review out with some more cons, but ""the Bose earbuds are slightly more comfortable"" is as close to a negative as you're going to find here.

The first thing I noticed out of the box was how well-built the cord is. All the above products had issues with frayed cords in the span of about 9-12 months. I've only had these about two months so it's not a totally fair comparison yet, but I can't see them falling apart any time soon.

The second thing I noticed was how fantastically awesome they sounded. I put on my Classical for Work Radio from Pandora and immediately heard details in the highs and the subtleties of play that I haven't heard in any headset since my beloved Bose triports.

It's a bit of trial and error finding the right size tips to use for comfort and sound. Fortunately they include small, medium, and large tips in both rubber and foam. The rubber tips seem to have a softer feel than the foam, but they tend to make my ears sweat a bit more, so I stick with the foam tips. The foam tips do a wonderful job of regulating temperature for me. I wear these pretty much all day at work, to the gym, and on into my evening reddit/youtube browsing and I find the only time I have to take them out is to participate in conversation, never for discomfort. Don't be afraid to mix and match sizes--I found I get the best sound and comfort when I use a large on the left side and a medium on the right.

Finally, the padded case provided in the package is fantastic. Mine came with a little carabiner which makes it a simple thing to clip on and carry with. It also has a tidy little inside pocket for carrying the extra tips and the included cleaning tool.

All in all, if you're on the fence about purchasing these, I'd encourage you to just do it. I love these headphones."
2433,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've gone through a ton of headphones, and I have always gone back to the Shure brand. The comfort is supreme, and it has a decent balance between treble and bass!

Now with these being $100, they are definitely a bargain beat up everyday headphone!

01/20/16 - UPDATE
My old SE115 didn't have the detachable earbuds. When I firs purchased this product, I thought it was a godsend that I can replace the wire whenever. The trade off is the fact that the earbud can become loose from the wire and you can lose the earbud."
2434,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as I read one ""In Ear Monitor's comparison chart"" in Head-Fi.org and these were among the top (in regards of sound quality) in the sub 100$ price range. I am glad I did that research.

Isolation is simply impressive, really helpful when flying. Sound quality out-of-the-box is also outstanding. They are very balanced. I compared them to my full-size Sennheiser HD-595 which I find very detailed and balanced (probably lacking a little bass) and the Shure 215 come close (to my ears) in sound quality.

I would recommend them for musicians. This is a design most drummers and other instrument players would appreciate.

On the other hand, they may not be comfortable and practical for most people. It takes time to get used to wear these, and also taking them in or out of your ears requires some effort and a few seconds, so I wouldn't recommend them for people who need something easy to remove and put back in quickly. If you are at work and somebody comes to talk to you, these will not come out as easy as many other ""earphones"" and you will need also to spend some time putting them back in the right way.

But I find it good enough for protection purposes."
2435,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are good at isolating outside noise and great at producing clean audio - no complaints there. However, despite being very careful about always storing these in the provided soft-sided case, the rubber coating on the wires has started to wear off, exposing wires. I don't expect these to last much longer which is too bad. I expected a much longer lifetime of use at this price point and from this brand. Not sure if this situation is typical or an exception, but either way, I'm uncertain if I would recommend them or ever purchase something from Shure again."
2436,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're a fan of warm sounding music these earbuds are not for you. They have excellent imaging, excellent mids, and decent highs, but in my opinion do not accentuate the bass frequencies enough, and as a result sound a little bit tinny to someone like myself who enjoys music with a little warmth. As a reference point I'm using my Sennheiser Momentum over ears which are the sweetest sounding closed ear headphone I have heard. When I listen to both headphones back to back the Sennheisers blow these out of the water.
I will say that the build quality on these Shures is outstanding and the sound isolation is the best I've seen. I have a hard time hearing people with just one earbud in."
2437,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first headphones in this price range. They're better than my old favorite, the sony mdr-60ex. Bass is amazing. They are very comfortable. They are also possible to wear when trying to sleep sideways. I use them while doing homework, working out, and well just everything. The ONLY thing I don't like is that the cable is rather long.

two year update: The cable one time and I was able to get it replaced through Shure's warranty. Another time I dropped something heavy on the right earpiece and broke it. Again, Shure warranty came through and replaced it... no questions asked. The warranty alone made this worth the price"
2438,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These truly live up to the Shure name - excellent sound, excellent isolation, balanced sound , truly thumpy bass, excellent cable build, little/no microphonics, superb and sturdy connectors.

Since i said thumpy bass, let me clarify, this is an overall performer at all bands - low to high, though much better at handling low frequency than highs, having said that it will produce clear highs and mids and one shouldn't notice.

I listen to a wide range of music : from blues to progressive metal, classic rock, electronic minimal, psybient and some hip hop. In none of the genres i felt these earphones did a less than admirable job ( obviously the source should be either lossless or 320kbps bitrate files) . One of the winners is the excellent isolation it will give you, its almost soundproof and you wont hear any external sounds when they are on ( comes with a ear buds of various sizes and shapes, foam and silicon)

The only hitch may be encountered while getting used to them, they go over the ears and that may take some time to get used to but hey, you better do if you want aural pleasure.

Highly recommended to any audiophile who takes their music seriously."
2439,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These take a little bit of figuring out the first time you put them on, but after that, you get to enjoy great sound quality and isolation. With the headphones in and no music, outside sounds are reduced, but not quite as much as you might expect. (I suspect the brain compensates and raises the apparent volume.) However, once you put music on even at a volume of 10% or so, that's all you will hear. And it will sound great. These are not bass heavy headphones, they have a balanced sound good for everything from pounding electronica to Irish traditional.

Update 4 years in:
Still love these, still going strong with the original cable. I also use an aftermarket MCMX cable from Yinyoo that provides a shorter cable, with microphone, pause button, and jack that will fit into most phone cases better than the original."
2440,4.0 out of 5 stars,"i'm a producer, and these are my go-to when i don't have my m50xs on me! really like that it comes w/ multiple tip types + sizes and that it comes w/ a carrying case w/ JUST enough room for tips and an extra cable. unfortunately, the cable can deteriorate after about a year, so you'll have to shell out some $ for a $15+ replacement cable."
2441,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the SE115 and SE210 earbuds. I lost the 115's and decided that the SE215 was for me based on my excellent experience with Shure. They definitely are an upgrade in audio quality but not enuf to offset the discomfort I felt in my outer ear after wearing them for a couple of hours. I tried wearing them for extended periods of time on several occasions with the same result and regrettably, I had to return them. The 210's are still great earbuds so I won't lose any sleep over not being able to keep the 215's. Just somewhat disappointed. But on the upside... I found my 115's so all's well that ends well."
2442,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Decided on a pair on buds instead of active noise cancelling after reading the reviews of this product.

I must agree with some that getting used to this product takes some time! I've usually used earbuds and it still took a while for me to establish a comfortable fit with the Shures. The cables are indeed on the stiff side and require some manipulating into a comfortable position. There was only some slight cable noise when you move the cables when i first started using them, but eventually got around this. Removal of the foam plugs i thought was difficult and i was worried about damaging them. I wouldn't change these out frequently IMO.

However the sound quality in fantastic esp after a burn in. Music is better, esp uncompressed and IMO the movie audio reproduction is even more improved.

I have yet to try them out with the TASCAM and RP500 DSP but im sure they will be much better than what i'm used to now.

Trick is you definitely have to spend some time getting used to the feel and also getting used to using them very deep into the ear canal."
2443,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall these earphones are pretty good. After spending some time with them, I feel like I can give a decent opinion about them. The sound quality is pretty good. Although I am not an expert and I haven't experimented with a lot of headphones/earphones, these headset definitely had better quality of sound compared to others. I was able to notice more details in my music that I never really noticed before. The length of the earphones is a great feature in my opinion. The style is nice as well. There are only a couple problems. The earphones block out the majority of sound but not all. If you are traveling with someone who plays their music medium to high volume you will hear it, which is implied by its name as it does not advertise ""noise-canceling"". Not really a problem but I just kind of want to mention that. The real problem is trying to put them on and possibly the fit of the ear phones. I have to spend a couple more seconds to put them and after using them for awhile (1 and 1/2 or 2 hours) my ears begin to hurt a little. Not a deal breaker as they seem to be durable and have great sound."
2444,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of Shure earphones and they have both been incredible. I will say that these are a pain to put in, but they stay in place well for me (after I found the right ear pieces) and sound great. I really like that the cord can be separated from the actual earphone, as my first pair of Shure headphones shorted out after over a year of daily use; the drivers sounded great until the day they died, but the cord had simply had enough. I would highly recommend these to anyone wanting a great pair of earphones for a reasonable price; you won't be disappointed!"
2445,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m on my second pair of these. They’re not so expensive that I don’t want to wear them out and about. I wear them at work nearly every day and they double as my hearing protection.
They’re also surprisingly clear on stage. I’ve used them for 6 years now and will use them until they’re dead."
2446,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to work in the Production Arts world, and have been a Shure fan for many years. For running I had used Shure E2C for almost a decade. I had the same pair the whole time, running dozens of races, dragging through almost two years of abuse in Iraq and still they kept on. Finally they shorted out and I sadly went looking for a replacement. I gave the SE 215's a try. Within a month the mount on one ear broke. I paid for shipping, sent it off to Shure, their customer service was great, they fixed it and sent it back for free. A month later they broke again. I guess I could send them off again, still under warranty, but no desire. My faith in these things is lost, and I will be trying to find something better to keep up with my lifestyle."
2447,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these to use as my monitors for the cover band I play in. The sound is great when you get the right tips on the ear buds, plenty of bass and I'm a bass player so that was important. The price was certainly right on this product for what you get. If I had to say one thing negative about them is they don't fit perfectly, but I didn't purchase custom fit buds so there ya go.

All in all a great product I would recommend to any musician looking for affordable in-ear monitors."
2448,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded from the Klipsch S4 earphones which got a short in the cord. I was attracted to these because of their reputation but also because of the replaceable cords--which is very nice for this price range.

The earphones are a little heavier than the S4 but fit very nicely and block out sound MUCH better (I'd say at least 1/3 more sound is blocked out). Due to the wrapping over the ear, the Shure don't get too heavy. I was immediately impressed with the better sound quality and bass (and this is even before breaking in the speaker). Used Phil Collins ""In the air tonight"" as the initial test and really sounded great!

Key to these is getting the right fitting ear cushions. After that, just enjoy the music!"
2449,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of these to replace old pair of Shure E2c headphones - those old headphones were one of the best tech purchases I have ever made.

The sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort on Shure headphones is hard to beat. I travel a lot, and work in a noisy environment. I use these for many hours every day.

My old pair finally wore out (in fact, when I had problems before, I sent them to Shure, and they sent me a brand new pair - kudos to their excellent customer service). The part that wore out on my old pair, was the cable that connects the phone to the wire (at the ear), and on this revision - they have re-engineered this to not fail (with the detachable connection).

I have had the new pair about 5 months, and have liked them as much as my beloved old pair.

Kudos to Shure for putting out a great product, and a reasonable price point."
2450,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not a pro at judging audio quality on headphones. I upgraded to these from the Creative EP-630i and I have to say these are awesome! They block out so much sound I could use them on the airplane as earplugs to fall asleep. Not good for crossing roads though!

I wear them around the top of the ears like other reviewers and I like how the stress areas of the cables are kevlar-reinforced for extra durability. The cables are also completely replaceable so nevermind if you break, fray or cut them accidentally.

Tip: These earphones aren't as translucent as the photos show them to be. They do look cool though, I'd give you that."
2451,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll start with the most important thing: yeah, these sound really, really good. Highs and mids are clear and distinct. Layers of sound appear that you just can't hear with stock earbuds. The bass rumbles, thumps, rolls and menaces when it should. I've had various pairs of Etymotics, Sennheisers, and Ultimate Ears at this price point, and these destroy them all - especially for bass. On tracks like ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and ""Harder Better Faster Stronger,"" these earbuds will move you.

They come with plenty of extra tips, a cleaning tool, and a really nice case. The cord is detachable and replaceable - a very nice touch, considering how often the cord fails on earbuds. The one downside is the over-the-ear cable, which is a little annoying, but you'll get used to it."
2452,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds may not be for everyone, and using them has some drawbacks, but after going through several sets of buds over the last few years I had some clear goals for my next set, and the Shure SE215 met those goals. Durabilty is my primary goal for this latest purchase, but only time will tell if these earbuds are durable. But that is how I became interested in the SE215, because I found it recommended on several Net review sites listing durable buds. They have a detachable cable, and the cable is probably where most earbuds eventually fail, although it isn't always clear where the failure occurs. Usually, I just hear that one side starts cutting out or goes dead completely. Unfortunately, replacement cables for these are as expensive as a cheap set of buds, but even with regular cable replacement, the cost of ownership of these buds may turn out to be less than frequently replacing cheaper sets.

One thing that people may want to know about this product is that it was apparently designed as an in-ear monitor for musicians and not necessarily an earbud designed for use with an iPod or cell phone, although that is probably how most people use it. As such, it has several design characteristics that are different from most earbuds. There are no flashy colors or aggressive shapes. The cable is comparatively long, and it lacks the rubbery flexibility of other earbud cables. The base model also lacks in-line controls, although a model with inline controls is available at extra cost. I opted for the base model without inline controls and bought an aftermarket cable that has the controls. The combination is about the same cost as the one with inline controls but I get two cables instead of one.

In use, the SE215 is the best sounding and most comfortable set of buds I have ever owned. Some people describe the sound as bass heavy, but I only found that to be the case if the sleeves are of the silicone flange variety and are very tight fitting. In my experience, these buds are best used with the compressible foam style of sleeves, and I am currently using the largest set of these that came with the set. The compressible foam sleeves tend to de-emphasize bass, as well as being more comfortable. With the foam sleeves, I would characterize the sound as balanced, but still with excellent bass. I have no doubt that a big part of the perceived sound quality of the SE215 is due to its sound isolating qualities. Without some degree of sound isolation, the listener simply won't hear a lot of detail and nuance in the sound. The best comparison I can make is that using the SE215 is close to the experience of using a good set of over the ear head phones. That is high praise, but over the ear head phones are also designed for sound isolation, hence the similarity. Because of the sound isolation and the detail that comes through in the music, the experience of using these buds is immersive and strangely addictive. Using the SE215 has become my favorite way of listening to music.

These buds are also the most comfortable I have ever used, especially for long listening sessions. They don't fall out easily because of normal body movements like walking, and because of the over the ear cable routing, small tugs on the cable don't yank them out either. The downside is that getting the buds properly inserted and the cable properly routed is a fiddly and time consuming process. Because of the detachable connector, the cable rotates freely on the earbud and everything has to be held in just the right position to get them properly placed. Another small quibble is that the set does not come with a cable clip. I had to scavenge one from one of my dead earbud sets. This is an omission that should be rectified.

It remains to be seen if I can list durability as Pro instead of a Con, but here is my Pro and Con summary of the SE215:

Pros
- Sound isolation and sound quality make for an immersive listening experience
- Nice bass, but not too heavy as some others claim
- Very comfortable for long listening sessions
- Replaceable cable
- Once properly placed, they tend to stay put

Cons
- Price
- Getting inline controls for portable devices is an additional cost
- Fiddly earbud placement and cable routing
- Stiff cable
- Lack of a cable clip"
2453,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Always loved Shure, even the lowest model SE215 delivers amazing sound and bass. Use these on my street bike under my helmet and they are awesome. They are snug so doesn’t hurt my ears with my helmet and noise cancelling so on the highway all I hear is music. Would deff recommend if looking for headphones for helmet."
2454,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You know you child loves their gift with they tell you they want to take it to bed while they sleep! That is what our son told me after we purchased these ""AWESOME"" ""SICK"" in ears for his birthday. He put us to the test as we sat around the living room and he closed his eye with these in his ears...we all yelled, spoke loudly and he didn't flinch or hear a thing...only the music playing in his ears. They fit perfectly and he has informed us that even if the cable breaks, it is an inexpensive fix. He was so pleased with these. He will use them with the sound systems at various locations where he preforms. A must have for your musical teen!"
2455,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been on the market for some high-quality earbuds ever since my last pair of Bose earbuds got mutilated after about 4 months of use. I am a very active person with an appreciation for high-quality sound, as I spend every day listening to music. I listen to music when I bike, run, lift weights, ride the bus, and when I can't sleep. Because of this, I needed to find a durable pair of earbuds without sacrificing sound quality. When I saw that the Shure SE215-K earphones were half price at $100, they immediately caught my attention. I read the numerous reviews and waited about 1-2 months before making the final decision to buy them.

Sound:
I am no audiophile, but I can vouch for these being the most crisp-sounding and consistent headphones I have ever had the pleasure of putting in my ears. The bass does not drown out the percussion and other subtle sounds, and you can hear every detail the artist put into the song. I primarily listen to metal music, and the precision of the sounds is amazing. Also, these sound amazing when you are running or biking. They cancel out all outside commotion and really allow me to get in my zone. Just be careful if you're in a situation where you need your hearing, because you won't be able to hear anything except the music that is playing. It is amazing how consistent the sound is across all volume levels. You can listen to a song at 25% volume and it sounds just as great as at 75% volume.

Durability:
These earbuds were built with durability that you simply do not see in other earbuds. Shure thought of everything to make the most durable pair on the market. There is no risk of the cord exposing the wire, unless you drop them in your bike chain. The cord detaches from the bud and there is a plastic-like cover that ensures a tug on the cord will not ruin the earbud's sound by yanking the wires out of place. I feel safe wearing these while I exercise.

Comfort:
Once you figure out how to put these on correctly, they can be adjusted to fit any ear. The foam plugs are difficult to take off, but it is worth it to find the plug that fits your unique ear hole. The plastic thing that goes around your ear breaks in to wrap perfectly around the top side of the ear, securing an optimal fit, even when being active. Also, these are quite comfortable wearing at night, even if you're a side sleeper.

all in all, some great earphones!!"
2456,4.0 out of 5 stars,"old pair of Shures had cable fray in places that appear to be more robust in this newer version of these headphones. Small! can roll up and put in your pocket. Was doing a lot of air travel and needed something to cancel out the surrounding sounds which these do very well as long as you seat them in your ears properly! Didn't want big bulky over the ear headphones to carry around.

Next pair will likely be 315($199) or 425($299), possibly the Bose QuietComfort® 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling($299) however the Bose require the headphones to be charged for the noise cancellation to work"
2457,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently my Monster Turbines kicked the bucket so I was in the market for a new set of Ear buds for around $100. After researching for days I found that these made allot of lists for best headphones for about $100 so I decided give them a try. Initially I struggled getting them in my ear, the cable goes over the front of your ear and down behind it, and way they fit into your ear was a foreign to me at first. Maybe I was tired; maybe I had one too many beers, but had to Google some images to figure it out! Finally, I got them in my ears and cables situated, and I will say that they are perfectly comfortable. I wear them at work and they do a great job of noise isolation, so much so that I have to take them out when someone needs to speak with me. Compared to my old Turbines which had just your standard ear bud fit, these don’t easily pop out and back in, it takes 15-20 seconds to get them on and situated. I know that’s a small complaint, but when you have to do it often, it can be cumbersome. Finally my last complaint is the jack that plugs into your MP3 player is fat and doesn’t play well with cases. I have to take my I phone case off in order to plug it in. Now, on with the good; I was not sure if I liked them initially as they had much more bottom heavy sound, the Turbines were much brighter. After some time I realized the sound stage is just different and they grew on me. Listening to music, I heard elements I never knew existed in some of my favorite songs! They sound great! I would definitely recommend them if you’re in the market for a set of IEM’s and have a $100 budget.
Pros:
• Removable cable can be replaced with one that controls your I phone
• Great sounding for the price
• Noise Isolation
• Multiple Tips to customize fit
Cons:
• May be too Bass heavy for some
• Very different fit then a standard ear bud
• Plug to fat to work with most cases"
2458,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Aside for a shipping mishap on my original order, which Amazon took care of in a timely and professional manner, I am incredibly happy with these IEMs. They took a day or two to get used to on my ears due to the wire coming up and around over your ears, but the sound quality is unmatched, especially at this price. The ear buds come apart from the cable, which is very heavy and feels like it will last years. You can buy a replacement cable on the cheap if you need to, and not have to purchase a whole new pair of $100 headphones."
2459,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to have a pair of E2Cs. Unfortunately, I lost them. This is the newer version of that product.
I have been using a cheap pair of earbuds by another company, and haven't been happy with the sound quality. Luckily, these sound just like me E2Cs. Great low end for earbuds of this price, and a very nice and powerful sound across the full spectrum. You may not have the mids and super-fine details of a more expensive set, but you would be hard-pressed to find something better for this price.
The headphones are well-constructed, they come with a great selection of cushions, they have a solid and removable cord, and they fit perfectly in the ears.
If you are looking for a great mid-range pair of earbuds, these are a great choice. My music doesn't sound muddled and not ""full"" anymore!"
2460,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I own several pairs of expensive headphones, and these work two-fold and outshine the rest. I own the bose noise-cancalling headphones which are great but require batteries. These guys work not only as ear plugs for flying in helicopters or other loud aircraft, but also have great sound. I even wear them to block out my roommates snoring. The amazing part is that the sound quality say on a flight line is still super awesome even though super loud noises would hypothetically block it. The bass and treble are amazing. I would def. order these again if I lost them. Such a great product for a great price. And they are durable."
2461,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great but they don't fit that well, which reduces their noise suppressing feature. And they are incredibly hard to put on. If I'm wrong about that, I'd love to know... please comment and tell me what you do to decipher which way they go every time you put them on. There is so much swivel and reorientation going on, it's hard to figure out how to wear them. It takes a couple minutes to put them on each time.

Once on, they stay on pretty well, because of the over-the-ear wire option.

The other thing I'm dissatisfied about here is that Amazon misstates the MSRP as being higher than it is, and they thereby claim that these things have a bigger discount than they really do. The true discount is very small."
2462,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They have great sound but I can't wear them. I've tried all combinations of ear plugs and they just hurt my ears. But they sound great when they are in and sealed properly. Block out everything. I wish they were comfortable for me. Maybe they'll work for you. Not for me.

Revision: I got some different tips for them and they seem to fit well. The noise isolation is great but I've found I need to hear a little of my surroundings so I'll probably just use them when flying and in high noise environments like mowing the lawn and such. For my regular everyday listening I'm using the Bose ear buds that are in about the same price range. They work well, sound good (except for high noise environments) and let me hear what's going on outside."
2463,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased a pair of Shure SE 215 earphones after almost two weeks of research into products currently on the market for MP3 listening.Currently, I can say every time I use these 215s, I am totally impressed each time I put them on.My only prior experience with Shure products was in the 1960s,with microphones.They were all I could ask for also.The 215s are as described in several other reviews,they take some getting used to,but are worth the time spent finding the right set up for your ears.I would recommend this product to anyone!! UPDATE/I am still very happy with these earphones,since my original review,I realized that after reading more details I found that these ship with medium sized foam tips,this size may not work for everyone.It will well be worth your listening pleasure to order the package of replacement tips in all three sizes and pick the ones that best fit your ears.."
2464,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the second pair of SE215s I've purchased. While the first pair are alive and well, the second pair's right ear bud no longer works. I've had them for ~45 days and they have only seen light use in non-adverse conditions.

Pros: Sound isolation is outstanding. Fits snugly and will not fall out. Useable in a motorcycle helmet.

Cons: Stopped working 45 days into light use.

They would get 4 or 5 starts if the product kept working."
2465,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price these have amazing sound. They actually have a decent seperation and good soundstage, I listen to a lot of classical, and it sounds about 3/4 as good as my Sony WH-MX10002 which are probably the best I've ever had. I also use a lighting cable from shure which signifcantly improves the sound, since it converts with the onboard dac to 24 bit/48khz from standard 16bit/44.1 khz sound. The installed medium foam and the medium flex fit best. I have average sized ear, so I didn't have any problems at all. I tend NOT to use in-ears, because actually do have a problem getting a seal with most earphones, but not these, the seal completely perfectly so I can get the full effect."
2466,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used these quite a bit, and the more I use them, the more I love these. For $100, the sound quality is out of this world. As a drummer, I have the volume cranked with all instruments mic'd up. The low end from the kick and bass guitar come through great with no clipping at all. Would highly recommend to anyone. The only drawback is that they take a little bit to break in the cable that wraps around your ears. But once they do break in, they stay in your ears perfectly. I have always had a hard time finding buds that will stay in my ears, but these work fantastic. Highly recommend."
2467,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fine if you have no other ""good"" headphones. The frequency response is even and the removable cable is a nice idea. However, as with any connector there is the possibility of it shorting out and causing interruption in the signal. Along with other reviewers I had one earbud cutting out and found this an unacceptable situation. I had to return the set. The comfort and durability of the product is great otherwise. I just can't deal with intermittent connections on a headset in this price range."
2468,5.0 out of 5 stars,"'Legendary Performance'. That's what it says on the box. Sounds like a typical product selling point. Sure, Shure, your products are legendary. I get it. You have a good marketing department. They'll probably be good. Maybe even marginally great.

So, with that in mind, here's what happened:
Unboxed headphones.
Sifted through needless papers warning be about death and destruction from using headphones (I didn't read into it that far. Might not have said this).
Slipped buds into ears
Turned on tunes.
*Mind blown*

So, for comparison, I normally listen to a pair of open-air Sennheiser HD570s. They are good. I mean, really, truly, amazingly good headsets. But they are open air, and I wanted something for the office. These Shures are mind-blowingly good indeed. The bass is strong, but not over the top. The midrange and trebles are astounding. Instantly, I can hear detail in some tracks that I've never heard before with my Sennheisers.

The sound is warm and open. The seal that the earbuds make is really amazing. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the foam that Shure uses on these headphones.

For the price, these headphones have no right being this good."
2469,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these earphones! The best thing about them and the reason I got them is that they're super durable! I'm on my second pair now, but the first lasted through 4 years of daily use, only having to replace the cable once.
The sound quality is really great for the price. The range of sound is great, with a pretty even spread from deep bass to high treble. I'd definitely recommend also purchasing some of the Spinfit eartips/sleeves to go with them, as the ones that come with can get morphed after a lot of use, and others can improve the sound quality and isolation. The only con for these is that it took a while to get used to the fit around the ear, but now they're super comfortable."
2470,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these as both In Ear Monitors while on stage, as well as normal headphones with my iPhone. The noise cancellation is fantastic, and the sound quality is very clear and crisp. Although it is a single driver, there is a nice blend of bass, midrange and treble. I have listened to everything from acoustic to metal, and can pick out everything in the mix. On stage they are great. I use them in conjunction with aviom in ear monitoring controls and they allow me to hear the entire band very well. For the price, they are a great product and I hope to one day be able to step up to dual or triple drivers. But for now, these work wonderfully within my musician's more meager budget."
2471,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third or fourth pair of Shure earphones. I really didn't like these at first. In fact, I almost sent them back. However, after using them for a few months, finding the best fitting tips, and most significantly, figuring out how to put them on quickly, I have to say they are by far the best sounding.

After 16 months of regular use, one of the channels developed a short. I'd get a crackling sound when the cable was wiggled. Shure provides a 2-year warranty. I went online, completed the form and mailed the earphones along with Amazon receipt back to Shure. In less than a week I received a brand-new set, not just a new cable. Kudos to Shure!"
2472,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Significantly worse sound quality than my old SE210s, which are still working great after 5 years. I bought a pair of these for a friend and decided to get myself a set to make sure they were good. Sound is very muddy, the highs are not very clear, and the bass is exaggerated. I would compare these to iphone earbuds before comparing them to my old SE210s. I guess the build quality is better than my old headphones, but I bought these for sound...

The new cable is neat but these take ages to put in ear compared to my old SE210s with the ordinary plastic cable. It's a pain to get these seated then wiggle them around and possibly unseat them while trying to put the formed cable over your ear. It also has a terrible connector that will not pass through an iphone case."
2473,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have used Shure earbuds for a few years now and have loved each of the two pairs I have owned in the past. I received the SE 215-K model of earbuds on Saturday and have used them a few times now. The sound that these produce is as superb as my previous ones but I don't like how these fit. The hard plastic part that fits into the outer ear is not comfortable and the thick wire that wraps around my ears is too thick. These are just very uncomfortable. I can only stand to have them in my ears for about fifteen minutes at a time. This is bad considering that I wore my other ones all day with no discomfort at all. I wish I would have just bought a new pair of the older model.
2474,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is good. I like the thick strong cables. It is a quality product. But I don't have as much noise isolation as I like with any of the different sizes of foam earplugs. It works well for bike riding and walking, but I am looking for something with better isolation for use on the motorcycle where the outside noise drowns out the music too much. I had some IR6i earplugs which worked good on the motorcycle, but they are no longer available and I lost the pair I had."
2475,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these, they're absolutely perfect for working musicians that need affordable in-ear monitors for performing. They're also perfect for working in noisy environs (like power plants or constrction) where you need hearing protection, but want music while you work.

The sound quality is amazing. Rich bass, sweet mids, and tight highs, everything is reproduced perfectly. These are near reference quality, which is better than you'll need in any of the aforementioned situations.

Buy these!! DON'T BE STUPID."
2476,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds have very good sound isolation when playing music, and work pretty well when not playing anything at all. The bass is pretty impressive for earbuds, and everything else is balanced well. The braided wire is very tough and it takes a while to get used to in the beginning. I am 5'7'' and the the wire is a little too long. I always find my wire getting caught on my bike if I don't have it tucked in. The only real gripe I have is that it doesn't have inline controls. It's very annoying to always take my phone out to pause music or adjust the volume. For $100 dollars, I would have expected controls to be included."
2477,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my second pair of Shure earbuds. My first were the SE115 and I loved them. They fit snug like earplugs and had great bass. When they finally died after 2 years I was planning to buy them again, but came across the se215s. since 100 bucks is the sweet spot for earbuds for me, I got these since there was not a price huge difference to upgrade.

Pros
The earbuds can detached at the ear, so if you mess up the cord all is not lost.
Great sound
Price is right

Cons
This is just a personal preference, but on the se115 the cord detached where the earbud cords came together. You could buy an accessory cord for phone/ipod controls. I liked this because I could detached the cord without taking off my earbuds and put the cord under my shirt, and it would disconnect there instead of ripping out of my ears or damaging my ipod if it got snagged.

Also, these are meant to wrap around the backside of your ears. There is a wire that bends around."
2478,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointing, I purchased this product approximately 7 months ago for a bargain price of $97.00 (cheap). This morning while on my run, I lost sound on the left side. this is indicative of cheap Chinese made product. As the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for!"" I think if a U.S. company could make something like this I would by another pair. In conclusion, be advised that if you purchase this product, don't expect it to last more than 6-7 months or suffer the disappointing consequence. It does have a comfortable fit and sounds great for a disposable earbud."
2479,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The IEMs are excellent! The only higher end thing I can compare them to are the bose earbuds. They aren't quite as ""Basey"" as the bose are, but they have an excellent sound profile. The sound isolation is ridiculous.. I can't tell you the amount of times I've received looks from friends and the wife for not hearing the door, hearing the phone ring, the dog barking, or shouts from the next room over. Woops!"
2480,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned several pairs of earbud headphones over the years, from sony, sennheiser, and shure. These are the best by far.
We all know that Shure sound quality is amazing, especially at this price point, but my biggest complaint with earbud headphones is that after a year (of heavy use) the cord connection to the bud ALWAYS wears down, sometimes breaks. I want to reiterate that this has happened without fail for me, on schedule.

So when I went looking for a new pair this cord replacement system sounded ideal, and so far it hasn't even broken at all - because the replacement port is in the area that it usually breaks in!

My only, minor, complaint is that the ear wrap around is so durable that it's not conforming to my ears and feels a bit awkward looping over them, sometimes pulling the buds out of my ear as I move around. This may be alleviated by my finding better fitting foam pads.

Sound quality is great, balanced, and I hear instruments I've never heard before from lesser quality buds. The music tracks I listen to are usually 320kbs, but I have some higher quality which I would need to test on a player that supports them I.E not an iphone."
2481,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work great with my now 2 year old se846 ear buds. Just had to snap the cables on and pair it with my phone/pad. Pairing pairing was a breeze: turn off, press center button till the phones say 'bluetooth pairing', then click on the phone's blue tooth connect button. Finding the power connector was far more difficult. It is located on the side of the button box beneath a really small black cover, and I needed a magnifying glass to find it. Once found, using the connector was easy. The sound is fine, and I haven't noticed a drop in quality compared to the OPPO HA-2SEPortable Headphone Amplifier & DAC i have been using for the last couple of years. The sound is outstanding with either amp, but I love the wireless connection to my devices. Count me a fan of this RMCE-BT1."
2482,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an EXCELLENT product. It works just as intended and it doesn't even get in the way of anything because the cord is somewhat short, so its perfect for me. I like to use my bluetooth at home while I'm working on things. Because I can get distracted while holding a phone, its easier for me to have the headphones on.

The sound for media is excellent. The sound for voices is a bit off but...all blue tooth seems to be off slightly. There is one thing though...
If you pair the headphones with multiple electronics, it may connect to both items. I paired it to my phone and computer. Well, I leave my bluetooth on for both. When I turned on everything, my headphones tried to connect to both computer and phone, and it did.
What ended up happening was that it showed on the phone and computer was that the headphones were connected, but it didn't work for either one. Just make sure you pair to one thing at a time or it may try to connect, and you'll think something is broken when its not."
2483,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit (original review below): I received the replacement pair and as hoped/expected everything is right again in the world... They sound great! I'm short of 5-stars because I haven't quite figured out how to easily put them in my ears... Once in, they sound great. Decent job of sound isolation, not quite as good at this aspect as my old Etymotics, but loads better than other ear""buds"". The sound is solid and so far, I'm very pleased with these IEM's; bonus is the price point that this quality comes in at. If you've got the green to step up to this price point, it's worth the investment.

Thanks Amazon for the easy exchange process and making this right as soon and as easy it was.

Original Review:
Very unhappy upon initial listen... The packaging was great, and everything was unopened and hadn't been tampered with. However the left channel didn't work. There seems to be a ""sweet spot"" about 4"" up from the jack end that has to be ""wiggled"" or crimped just right to get anything to play in the left ear. It would cut in/out when messed with in that spot.

Thank you Amazon for having an easy return/exchange process; I'm going to take advantage of the exchange since this was the first round. I'm hopeful that this is an outlier and an anomoly that won't happen again.

I'll return with an update and new star rating once the exchange comes in. I've also sent Shure an email, and will comment appropriately (good/bad) with how they handle the feedback as well. Again, I hope and expect that this was just not my lucky day, and definitely not indicative of their standards and quality... We'll see."
2484,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Super disappointed. Zero instruction on where to FIND the charging port. It’s tiny- and on the controls. Also terribly hard to find were the L and R wire indicators so I could snap my Shure earbuds on to the Bluetooth accessorie cable. The lettering is so small you can’t read it without a magnifying glass, and the instructions nor Shure web site offer any assistance. I was thrilled with the sound, the dynamic and the volume when I was using the earbuds with the hard wire, but must admit I am terribly let down by the Bluetooth accessory. They were difficult to pair, the sound cuts in and out, and the volume and fidelity is extremely week. In short, 180 degrees different than the wired version. I guess the upside is that the Bluetooth cord won’t get caught in the wheel of my motorcycle if it comes unplugged, so I will try it out, but these will likely be returned so I can order the cord for my SE215 earbuds. Can’t say enough good about the earbuds, but the Bluetooth is not up to par."
2485,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I listen to only rap and hiphop and I was surprised on how much bass these actually had. Upgraded from a very bassy set of ath-im70 earbuds. Those have a lot of bass but the highs are really capped. Using the foam tips for a good seal. These open up the soundstage a lot more. Driven them with a cell phone dac and a audioengine dac with a deep v eq and full bass from Poweramp on an Android phone. Of course the audioengine dac pushes them harder but these can handle it well. One of my favorite songs to play on them is ""poppin' them thangs"" - g-unit - heavy bass song with a light Melody that you can differentiate between the highs."
2486,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First the good:

For in-ear monitors that costless than $100, the sound quality is surprisingly rich, deep, and accurate. I won't go into detail on the sound, as others have covered it quite thoroughly. Certainly not the ""best"" money can buy, but certainly among the best $100 can buy.

They are also durable. I've been using a pair under horrible conditions for almost two years (outdoors, In heat and humidity, exposed to plenty of sweat).They still work and sound great...well, they did after I replaced the cables. While the cables are more durable than any other earbud cables I've used, they did finally fail. The great news is: I then bought a pair of new, replacement cables, plugged them in, and am continuing to use the same, original pair of SE215s.

The best thing about them, and other sound-isolating in-ear devices? When you reduce the ambient sound level, you don't have to turn the volume as high to listen. Result? Better sound with less ambient noise interference, AND reduced potential for hearing damage.

The bad? The connectors between the monitors and the cables can collect dirt requiring disassembly and cleaning. It doesn't happen often, just once or twice per year with heavy use.

The most difficult thing about the SE215 is fitting them, and they MUST be fitted properly or they'll sound thin and tinny. The wire loop must be bent carefully to ensure proper alignment with the ear canal, and the correct size foam inserts must be used. The smallest foam insert barely works in my ear canals and doesn't work at all in my wife's: she can't wear the SE215 because of fit.

This brings up a final point about fit: everybody's ears are different. Once you have the loops properly fitted to your ears, they probably won't fit anyone else's. We tried. We swapped out the foam inserts, but the loops wouldn't allow proper alignment with my wife's ears. Once the loops were bent to fit, the inserts didn't work. Then the loops had to be bent back--and they'll only tolerate so many bends before they break.

In summary, once fitted, these in-ear monitors are excellent for the money: they sound great and they're durable. Proper fitting can be an issue, but once properly fitted, they'll likely only work for one person. The only practical way to share would be having two sets of wires, bent to fit, with two properly sized foam inserts. Worth the money? An enthusiastic 'yes'."
2487,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are two common focuses of earbuds that I often get asked. ""Are those earbuds loud?"" and ""Are those earbuds high quality with their sound?""
Now, there is so much more that goes into a pair of earbuds than their loudness and sound quality, (durability, comfort, etc.) but those are the two most common. These earbuds will satisfy both questions. Yes, they're loud. Yes, they have amazing sound quality. However there is another pair of earbuds on the market. I can't imagine that if you're in this market range for earbuds and have not heard of them, but they are the 1More triple drivers.
Me personally, I would go with the 1More Triple Drivers any day. They have more bass and also have a better soundstage. Not to mention an in-line microphone. The 1More Triple Drivers are less loud, although, most people will find their volume to be just fine. Also, they are less durable in comparison to the Shure SE215s. Although, it's hard to compete with a KEVLAR-REINFORCED cable. That's not to say that the 1More Triple Drivers aren't high-quality as far as build goes. They just aren't AS good.
Now, I can't diss on either decision. They are both great earbuds. All that I'm saying is, if I had the choice, I would rather go with the 1More Triple Drivers. However, as I said, neither decision is a bad one."
2488,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I lost my old wired SE215 after 4.5 years (which were themselves a replacement for the E2C model that I had for over 6 years) and replaced them with this SE215 BT, so I already know about the great sound and was used to the ergonomics of these sound isolating earphones. These are, of course, the same earphones as my old set, just with BT instead of wired (though as others have noted, they are interchangeable, you can unplug them from the BT cable and hook them into the regular wired cable)

The BT is pretty easy to use. I've not used other BT earphones so I can't compare but I have used other BT devices. One of the other reviewers wished the controls were lower on the cable and I understand the complaint but find it a minor issue myself. I'm happy to have the short cable and don't find it difficult at all to manipulate.

Haven't used them long enough to comment on the battery life, will report back"
2489,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My ears are really ""picky"" (no pun intended) when it comes to accepting earbuds -- I really think that I am in the very small minority of people in which most earbud headphones do not fit my ears. This is further complicated by the fact that I've been searching for headphones that stay in while I am weight training as well as running at the park.

Luckily I stumbled upon these Shure SE215's while surfing on Amazon. I was worried that spending this much on headphones (more than the $20-30 I was initially only ready to spend) would not live up to the $100 price tag. I am far from an audiophile, but boy have I been happy with these Shure's. After my Sennheiser Momentum over-the-ear's, these are my favorite headphones when on-the-go. The sound is very clear, with very clear lyrics, mid's and high's. The bass is very good, too; while sometimes I feel it could use a little bit more 'boom', it is nevertheless deep and does not drown out vocals or instruments.

One important thing I have come to learn about what makes headphones sound 'good' is ... the FIT is extremely important. This is doubly important when it comes to the Shure SE215's. For one, the in-ear monitors (IEM's) fit extremely well in [my] ears. And thanks to the bendable around-the-ear wire hooks, the IEM's are not going to pop out of your ears during exercise -- this is something that has always been a problem for my ears with earbuds. The second thing is, it is imperative that earbuds of any kind create a nearly air-tight SEAL inside your ear canal -- this is extremely important in delivering the bass to your ears and not let it leak out. Fortunately these Shure's come with 3 sets of foam tips, as well as silicone sleeves. I had purchased a pair of Comply foam tips for these headphones, but found that these, nor the stock Shure foam tips, locked in the bass well enough for me. But to my surprise, the stock silicone sleeves provided the best seal and sound! Not what I was expecting, I was thrilled that I found one setup that worked just right for me.

My first Shure's, a really good experience -- provided everything holds up over time, I can see myself going with this brand again when it's time to upgrade ..."
2490,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've has several pairs of Sure headphones in the past and have loved them. But these are the worst. The Bluetooth frequently does NOT work. These are some of the worst wireless headphones I have used. They need to be re-synced with your phone about twice a week, are highly subject to interference while walking around, and they frequently lose connection while using so they are not reliable for a call. They definitely used cheap components on these and it shows. Total waste of money."
2491,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for a long distance motorcycle ride and researched what was considered the best sound isolating earphones for riding. The Shure SE215's sounded great in my living room but only sounded ok on the road. In fact one of my buddies I was riding with bought a set of ""truck stop specials"" for 1/4th the price of these and they not only sounded the same (if not better), but were far more comfortable and isolated sound WAAAAAAYYYY better than mine. The final reason for the low review is I found the headphones to be awkward to put in the ear and remain there. I tried the different size ear pillows it came with but nothing really worked out too well. Save your money and just grab some cheap throw aways."
2492,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The primary reason I purchased these was because of good reviews of their noise-isolation. I must agree- these are by far the most noise-isolating earbuds I have ever worn. Noise levels of these are significantly less than my noise-canceling ear buds!

The second reason I purchased these was because of good reviews of their comfort. They have a small profile that fits within the external ear, meaning that I can lie down with my head against a pillow and experience no discomfort. I am not aware of any other earbuds on the market that share this characteristic.

I was delightfully surprised by the excellent build-quality of these earbuds. Although these are in mid-tier price range (currently $99), they have the build quality of higher-tier earbuds that normally go for $200-$300.

I highly recommend these. They are great for studying and falling asleep in a noisy environment."
2493,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I just ordered a set of these to replace my old, reliable Shure E3c earphones. Both are over-the-ear earphones. I found the SE215's boomy and lacking in mids and highs, music that sounded live and crisp in my old E3c's sound dead and muffled in the SE215's. I'm returning these and trying the SE315's, instead. The only positive about the new 215s was that (for my ears) the fit of the small black foamies was much, much better than the yellow foamies in the E3c's. Incredible isolation, almost TOO good, if you know what I mean. I could hear my own heartbeat and every step I took translated to a vibration in my ears. Also, the formable wires at the ends of the cords provides an improved fit around the top of my ears than the old E3c's. The 315's seem to share the same physical design, so I hope that the sound quality is better. Oh well, what did I expect? The 215's were half the price of the old E3c's, ten years ago!"
2494,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love it. I hook my 425s to it every so often at work or on the road and I have no complaints so far. It's stayed connected to my Nexus 6p and my iPad 2nd Generation (yes the old one). I haven't tried it with an iPhone but I assume it would work just as well. It is well worth $100 to get myself a very nice set of wireless headphones.
2495,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say, I bought this for mainly color and Bluetooth capability that came as side dish. It’s a little too expensive for a side dish thou..
However, the main SE215 earbuds are probably one of the best out there for the price. And the fact that I can just swap lines around makes this pretty worth it (I did purchase wire as well). Can’t think of how many earbuds have been trahsed because of the line.

Edit: I thought there was lack of function due to not having user guide, but I searched it up and it was just different command. Three -> four stars"
2496,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these earphones to replace another set of Shures whose cables spontaneously shed the insulation, leaving 2 very thin wires exposed to each earphone. The new earphones have cables that are much thicker, and probably won't flake off like the first ones did. However, the insulation is so stiff that it's hard to position the earphone in your ear. Also any movement of your head can cause the earphones to shift in the ear canal, intermittently blocking the sound in that ear. Otherwise, the sound is good if you can keep the earphones in place."
2497,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a big fan of shure's E2C headphones. Yes, I too was bit by the ""one side cutout"" issue but their sound was beautiful with great noise reduction. I bought the SE215s as their replacement and must say they are very nice. Sound is great, rich, clear, and balanced. The cord seems sturdy and the ability to replace it is a nice feature (I bought a replacemnt cord just in case). My only minor issue is the fit - my left ear canal must be slightly larger than my right and the ""seal"" is not as good on that ear. It does not impact my enjoyment but I find myself adjusting the left side (pushing it back in ear) a little more often than I did with E2Cs. Again, this is minor and I would recommend these. Good sound, good noise isolation."
2498,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not pretend to be an audiophile, but I have nothing but praise for their sound. I will let OC reviewers quibble over nuances of sound quality. I got these earphones mainly because of their reputation for good sound isolation. For me they excel at that. None of the included ear canal tips fit my ears properly, so I got some ribbed silicone ones from Sweetwater that did the trick. The tiny dots denoting the and left right earpieces are silly, so I painted on a larger ones. Once I got the knack of putting the earphones in place I became pleased with their sound. I have experienced no listening fatigue so I gather that they produce little distortion, another key feature for me. I am mildly annoyed with the geeky look of the clear model. I guess I expected that the wires would break and I wanted to be able to see them do it. But these wires are not going to break, ever. I should have gotten the black ones instead. Just really great earphones. Why pay more?"
2499,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really great sound, but getting them in your ear is a 30 second process of twisting and angling, and then they're not the most comfortable things on the planet. Also, they were lacking the out-of-the-box bass of Sennheiser CX300 II's that I'd bought time and again prior, so had to dial it up in my mp3 player's equalizer. As someone who's gone through no less than 7 pairs of CX300's mostly due to poor cable durability, the robust build is a welcome change and the reason I switched - will update review should anything change."
2500,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's very convenient to upgrade a pair of SE315's I've had for years to Bluetooth. It is buddy and not ideal though. I am using these with an iPhone 8+, and iPad Pro 10.5"" running iOS 11.0.2.

- Function button will pause/play songs but double and triple press does not change track like the wired cables do
- There is no downloadable user guide and I lost packaging so I can't confirm the above is not a different sequence than the other cables
- Battery life is low than I'd like--I would have gladly traded some extra weight/size of the enclosure to get 50-100% longer battery life for long flights
- No USB-C...
- Sometimes when trying to resume playing music on my phone, it will cause Music (the native iOS app) to immediately pause, it just keeps pausing whether I try to resume play with the app or the remote. I have to turn off, and repair to resolve the issue
- Cable clip that you can use to connect the two sides is nice but it's fiddly and seems it will quickly wear out or rip. A magnetic connector would be a great improvement

It'd be nice if there were an accompanying app to setup which devices it remembers and make it easy to switch between. Similar to Bose. As it is, I have to turn off, put into pairing mode, and repair to switch between my iPad and iPhone. On other headphones it is a much simpler process.

Not a bad first offering from Shure, but it has a lot of room for improvement. These are good enough for workouts and casual listening but I hope Shure recognizes they need to be dumping a lot of money and resources into iterating their Bluetooth offerings to stay relevant."
2501,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure SE215 are great for every day listeners but to say it is great for its price can be far fetched. Music you listen to may be a factor in appreciating these earphones, as many acoustic and classical music may sound muddled and confusing. The sound stage isn't there, but you get more of a direct sound like you would hear from a laptop, but instead tunneled directly in your ears. For comfort and build, I would have to give it a star as it is pretty comfortable if you get a hang of the ear loop design. Overall just a basic earphone."
2502,2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE on Bluetooth: The dropouts are starting to get a bit ridiculous. Easily two to four a minute. What in the world... EXTREMELY Annoying...

Good stuff for the price. Especially considering if you bought the SE215 with the 3.5mm jack separately, and then bought the Bluetooth cable, it'll cost $50 more. The SE215's themselves are a great entry level IEM for those who aren't too pedantic about their music. It's dynamic drivers aren't as accurate as their balanced armature counterparts, but that's what makes these IEMs great - they're fun.

The Bluetooth on the other hand, it's better than most solutions on the market right now, but still needs work. There is an audible noise floor, albeit being very very low (IMO), and Bluetooth connection is still not perfect, there's this occasional cut-out of playback for about half a second every now and then. Haven't had a chance to test battery life just yet.

Build quality? Not amazing, but definitely solid."
2503,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE215k is a shallow fit, over-the-ear earphone. The package contents include: the earphones themselves, a set of S,M,L silicone tips, 1 set of memory foam tips, a cleaning tool for the ear tips, and a soft shell carry case. The earphones are made of a rigid plastic and the cables are thick and of high quality. These are very comfortable, but you will have to adjust to how big these are if you haven't owned something like this before. A nice little feature about these earphones is that the cables are removable and replaceable. You can either get the original cables from Amazon or Shure, but the cables from the Logitech UE series earphones just as well and a bit cheaper too.

On to the sound. This earphones has a lot of bass that extends down fairly deep and can sound a bit muddy on some tracks. With genres such as hip hop, dubstep, EDM, etc, these do a great job and will fulfill the needs of your average bass head. The mids are warm and very clear and the highs are a bit rolled off, maybe a little rolled off. Due to the rolled off highs, these are not fatiguing and can be used for several hours before having to take a break. Keep in mind that these isolate very well, so if you're walking down the street or anything, make sure you are well aware of your surroundings.

The Shure SE215K is not without flaws however, there a few things that are bothersome right out of the box. The first is the fit of these earphones. While it isn't a big issue, new users might have problems properly inserting these into your ears. The core of the problem is the memory cord that wraps around your ear. You will need to bend constantly to conform to the curves of your ear but after a while it will retain its shape.

These earphones perform extremely well and for the price, it includes many accessories. Shure even offers a 2 year warranty with the SE215K which adds even more value to the package. If you're a fan of good bass, warm mids, and slightly recessed highs, these earphones are a no brainer."
2504,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best earbuds I've ever owned. I just got a set of Bose Quiet Comfort 35 headphones with their best noise cancellation. Because these earbuds tips are foam they actually isolate better than the Bose headphones. Phenomenal. And because outside noise doesn't leak in the bass is insane. They also respond super well to EQ adjustments. Super clean sound. They aren't conventially shaped but for good reason. They are insanely comfortable. You can lay on you ear and they don't dig into your ear. No complaints about them. Love them.
2505,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these 1 1/2 years now, mostly for jogging or gym work. They are great! Better bass than other earbuds I have tried. Takes awhile to get used to putting them in your ears, but the seal is tight and you block out a lot of external noise. So, these are also good on airline flights. My set once went into the washing machine for 15 minutes, in a shorts pocket, before I noticed. I let them dry out for 2 days, and they worked fine. About the only drawback is that they are like fishhooks, constantly snagging on everything. If I bundle them into a hand-full, it takes a minute to untangle them at the gym. Small price to pay for such good quality."

I notice on a couple of songs delivered via iPod, there can be some audible fuzz in the treble. I downloaded Apple lossless to see if the file is the cause or the earphones. Still fuzzy in right module. Soon after that I lost most of the sound in the right module. Before sending in, I looked over the maintenance to see if the cause was me. It was. When wearing during workouts, the sweat and ear wax will attach to the inside grill of the removable ear bud and block or distort sound. I removed them, cleaned with soap and water, dried them, reattached and the sound is back to out of the box quality. Just cleaning the outside of the buds is not sufficient."

After the distortion and cracking became intolerable I purchased a replacement cable. It work great for a few months then the distortion and cracking creeps in again for the past few days.

Bass: Clean for the most part. Only get a little muddy on song where the studio tried to pump up the bass more than it should have.

Mids: clean and warm

Highs: it's there but doesn't hurt your ears.

These are also fun sounding. Not sure if that is a real thing but that's how I will describe them. I have not tried to take the cable off as I think only reason to do that is when it needs to be replaced."
2514,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Use these every day at work. They work great for airplanes, or the subway, they block out most of the outside noise. I do Not recommend for running etc. They are not water proof, and the connectors by the headphone start to do weird things.

So great for the office, airplane, subway. Not good where lots of sweat / moisture are going to be poured all over them.

They take a bit to get used to and are kind of weird to get in the first few times, once you get the hang of it and find the correct ear attachment they are amazing. Music is now disappointing when I am not listening to it on these."
2515,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these things, one of the best products i have ever purchased on amazon. I was going to buy the model they sell for 800$, but i decided to buy these, the sound quality is very amazing. i use to have a 300$ headset but it i now use these to game and listen to music on. if you are looking for a extention go to https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GBC9OU8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ."
2516,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The earbuds themselves seem to be of good quality and produce sound in line with the price point. However, the cables REEK of cheap imported vinyl. Additionally, the cables are stiff and transmit sound when physically disturbed. At least the connectors are industry standard. To get rid of the nasty smell, I invested in a set of good quality cables and all is well except that my wallet is now $50 lighter than it should be."
2517,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SE215 has a very non-fatigue and relaxed mid and highs and a very fun bass due to bumped-up lows. Great macro-dynamics and coherent sound due to contact with your ears. Because recessed highs and bumped-up bass, they are less analytical than some of the higher end IEM but they are my go-to earbuds for walking and air travels.

Have had them for a year and recently compared those to Etymotic ER4 XR. Compared to SE215, ER4 XR's has a more analytical sound due to a bump in 2K Hz and can be fatiguing for those who don't like too much high frequencies. ER4 XR's bass is more recessed than SE215. I returned ER4."
2518,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried a lot of different in ear headphones (Bose, Beats, Ear Candy) and these not only have the best sound, but are truly noise cancelling. I've used both the foam inserts (like old school ear plugs) and the thin rubber versions - they both fit well and are comfortable. The BEST part of these headphones are that the components pop apart for replacing. I'm super hard on headphones and after having them for awhile (and constantly getting them tangled, yanked on, and kinked up) the sound started getting ""crackly."" I replaced a pop apart section of the cord and voila! they're just as good as they were when I first bought them. The Bose in-ear headphones I had before these were not only more expensive but went right into the garbage just a few months after having them. I will keep (and LOVE) this Shure pair as long as they continue to make replacement parts."
2519,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great! But please note these are over-the-ear monitors, and don't seem to be designed for use like regular earbuds. If you do a lot of online video messaging and don't like earphone cables dangling as you speak, then these might be worth trying. I use them to monitor audio while video recording and keep them behind me. It's great in that application.

A couple of subtle but solid points: the case is a not soft case, and that makes a difference. Thank you Shure for giving me something protective to hold these when not in use. Plus, the multiple size and shapes of the sleeves is really a nice touch."
2520,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sadly, my puppy (back then) chewed them up as well as the replacement pair I begrudgingly bought after those. Needless to say after $300 and no headphones to show for it, I was reticent about purchasing a new pair.

As with the old pairs, these new SE215s can only be heard to be appreciated. They no longer come with the christmas tree fitting that looked more like a torture device. But that's beside the point. The fittings you're interested in are the expanding earplug styles in small, medium, & large. There's a band I'm an avid fan of and I've been listening to all of their albums for roughly 15 years now. Before I owned Shure headphones, I thought I knew every melody and note in every song of theirs. What I failed to realize was that with headphones which allowed true noise cancellation (not BS electronic white-noise) I was able to listen to far lower volumes. Confused? I was too. At such low volumes, you can hear what would have otherwise been drowned out by the louder elements of the same song. The added bonus was riding the subway on the C line to work from Brooklyn to Manhattan and the normal cacophony of f-bombs and arguments became a silent movie to whichever track I chose that morning. Bonus points for faster tempo music during fist fights!

There are two honest drawbacks despite my fanboy appreciation of these headphones audio quality.

1. When someone needs to talk to you for example while working at your desk, they're a pain in the ass to keep scrunching and putting back into your ear. Doubly so with this new over the ear design (which also takes a little practice).

2. The realization that you don't clean your ears as well as you think you do. Don't believe me? There's a reason they come with an ear-wax removal tool. Gross."
2521,5.0 out of 5 stars,"very nice and durable .. I often fall asleep with them,, they sound great and if I break the cord I can order a new cord .
I have lots of different earbuds including Bose ... I have to be very careful with the Bose since the cable breaks and your earbuds are history
I did add Comply brand earbud covers but the ones that come with them are pretty good as well."
2522,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great. I have tried DOZENS of bluetooth headphones/sets/buds and I decided to keep these. Sound is great!
2523,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These were a great purchase for use as in ear monitors and daily headphones! The sound quality is amazingly crisp and clear and the bass is solid. It really depends on what music you listen to though (I prefer rock and the thumping lows of the kick drum sounds great along with bass guitar when turned up a bit, but it's not too bass heavy, very evenly distributed highs, mids, and lows). I really enjoy the feature of the removable cord so you don't have to waste money on another pair if the cord frays or something. As for fitment, I like the extra earbuds included so you can get the feel you want. Also, the stiff but bendable end near the earbud sometimes loses it shape but it's nothing too big, I'm just being a bit critical. Sometimes it just needs to be messed with a bit to fit right. The fact that the cord is wrapped in Kevlar just adds to the durablity of the product, which I find is a nice touch. I'm not sure why anybody would spend $100 more to buy the SE425 when the SE215 has the whole package at a much better price. Overall 10/10 would buy again

One last note- while using these as daily headphones people thought they were hearing aids (I got the clear version). The black version is a good choice too but I find that the clear is better if you want it to look discrete and semi invisible."
2524,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones, VERY comfortable, to the point where you forget that they are in, and they block almost all of the outside noise when something is playing. Sound is clear and crisp, i am not an audiophile, but they do sound great. Mine came with everything except the cleaning tool, that being the only downside these are amazing earphones for the price! Fitting them is not that hard, just watch the how to video. Highly recommend!"
2525,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have a great sound and prevent outside noise from entering. They fit into my ear perfectly. Unfortunately, the right side had a bad connection and was always going in and out. This happened after only a few uses. I returned them for a refund and won't be buying another set."
2526,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's hard to tell the difference between the wired and bluetooth connection. That's a big advance for Shure and for anyone who uses their earphones.
2527,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds started out strong, but within a few months of purchase left bud sound started cutting out at certain angles and the foam pieces became so loose they were constantly falling off and getting lost. The only positive aspect of this product is the strong cord, but that's not worth the price."
2528,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and the tips are nice, I ordered some comfort tips for better fit. The fitment around the ears is great, stays in place when running, lifting weights, situps/laying down and doing jump rope. There seems to be no noise/rub on the wire and it is nice and thick. Not an issue so far and I've had it for quite some time now. I use it at the gym constantly. The 3.5mm tip is a bit on the clunky side if you have a nice thin MP3 player/phone you are using but not causing any issue just thought I'd mention it"
2529,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a singing drummer in a rock band, I elected to go with in-ear monitoring instead of using floor wedges. I didn't need to go wireless, so I paired the SE215's with a Rolls Personal Amp system and am up & running for under $200! These in-ear monitors sound awesome, and have a surprising amount of Bass level especially since they are single drivers. Plenty of Bass, to the point where I had to turn the Bass Guitar way down in the overall mix. And the sound isolation is good as well. I recommend trialing the different sizes of the included foam earpieces to customize a size most suitable for you. I went with the largest ones which isolate better than the small sizes for me. Perhaps best of all, my ears don't scream after practice or shows anymore as I only hear at what volume Ievel I so choose. This product has truly helped make me a better player/singer as I can finally HEAR the Mix and my own voice! Highly recommend this product."
2530,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Most have left positive reviews that I am in agreement with. Amazing when combined with an iPod and a headphone amp. Takes you to another world. Total isolation is required and I will say that Shure should make it easier for those with larger ear openings. I did order extra large yellow foam sleeves and helps but still have to work to get a great seal. Shure, please add extra large foam sleeves or something to help make a quicker and better seal? Once sealed you are in heaven.

One funny thing I did notice is that with these isolated ear buds it is so clear a sound and so isolated that all you could do was listen, and not sing along like with on ears, etc. Baby's will not bother you on airplanes!"
2531,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely take some getting used to when putting on. It can apply pressure to your ear (slightly annoying) if you don’t put them in correctly. Try the different sizes, it does make a difference. Sound so far is good, didn’t blow me away, but it’s still early. Note that the plug isn’t a straight shot like Apple earbuds. It’s at a 90 degree and if your case is bulky, it may not reach. I had to shave down the casing to get it. Will update as necessary."
2532,5.0 out of 5 stars,"if you want an objective review of the sound quality and build quality of this earphones, you can either youbue it or google it.. I am pretty sure they are the single best earphone at this price range that can actually rival the much more expensive ones. Thus i won't delve into the technical side of this earphone because there is already plenty of sites out there that do this better than i can.

well, I am more shock of is the unparalleled build quality of this baby.

this thing just look classy and everything is fantastic. The earbuds are made of memory foam, the shapes bend to best fit your ear canal. One of the side benefits the foamed earbud is the superb noise isolation; i can't even hear the typing from my mechanical keyboard while listening to music on medium volume.

Even though the wire is replaceable, it is double layered to increase durability. Mine is the silver version so the wired is sheathed in a thin transparent white plastic, looks awesome.

the earphone fits so well and comfortable inside your ear you won't even notice it after a minute or 2. I run with it almost everyday and it never falls.

All in all, i am extremely impressed by how well this product is and at 99 dollars it just dwarfs the competition. It does take a while to get used to putting it on on a regular basis and it does look weird for some people.

UPDATE:
Sound quality is fine as usual
but sadly there is already distortion of sound causing by the connector.. oh man, as a vivid earphone user the very sign of this gives me a big headache especially for a pair of earphones that has only been used for less than 2 weeks and is being extremely well taken care of .

i am sending it back for a replacement, hopefully the next one will be problem free..

i dont want to downgrade my review until i extensively test the new one.. hopefully mine was only a lemon because i really like this product"
2533,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm using these as in-ear monitors with the band I play in, and they do great. The foam earpieces do a great job of blocking out sound around me, which protects my hearing as much as anything else. The sound produced by the SE215 isn't audiophile quality, but there's plenty of volume available and it has a pleasant, full range."
2534,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pricey but sonically a step up from cheap buds. The foam molds this includes are far superior to anything else other than perhaps custom molds. But I still don’t think it’s worth the price. I think this is more in the range of a 50-70$ product. The Bass response isn’t particularly inspiring and if that’s what you need, this isn’t for you."
2535,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound Isolating is superior to Noise canceling. Noise canceling has to guess the phase and frequency of the sound to try to knock it down. When it guesses wrong the errors become noise creating. Sound isolation is basically ear plugs. Sometimes in a noisy environment I put these in my ears intending to play some music and even before the music starts, the din of the background noise disappears to provide a silent sound stage for my favorite tunes.

The wires of these go up and behind your ears. This is a great arrangement. I have another set that is of the same sound isolation type, but he wires hang down as they typically do. When active like running, the wire bounce and conduct sound to the earphones. The SE215s don't have this problem since the wire weight is supported by your ear. At first it can be hard to figure out how to get them in. I wouldn't get on a plane without them."
2536,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these for working out as well as general listening.

- Great sound quality
- VERY noise isolating, almost dangerous. Wore these in NYC subways where it's super noisy when trains are passing by and you don't hear much noise from the outside. These are not earbuds, these go inside your ears - big difference when it comes to noise isolation
- Durable - wires seem thick and strong
- Well reviewed on audiophile sites
- When working out, they are worn looped around the ear so they don't move when you exercise or run. Seem sweatproof so far"
2537,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried these with my Shure 315 earpieces and they did not sound good at all, very tinny. I switched to my S 215 earpieces and they sounded MUCH better. It seems they’re most compatible from a sound standpoint with the Shure 215 model earpiece"
2538,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound technology, the usefulness of the device is mediocre. Shoving the hard awkward ear pods in my ears and attempting to loop the messy wires over my ears is pretty annoying. Microphone is badly placed and not outdtanding, so not great for calls. Bluetooth synch to devices is slightly below average."
2539,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got these in and couldn't wait to unpack them because of all the great reviews of it. I was hesitant because of the reviews that said the one ear would go out, but I love a good pair of headphones and heard these were the best bang for the buck. As an FYI, I have a pair of Klipsch S4i and Monster turbines. (not to mention my gaming headsets: Logitech g9930 and Razer carcharias. I like headphones!) So, here's the rundown:

Upon receiving the package, it was pretty cheap packaging. I was hoping most of the money went into the headphones instead of the packaging. Don't get me wrong, it was in a standard carboard box with plastic to keep it in place. I guess after getting a pair of monster turbines where the packaging was amazing, I am a little spoiled. Some might say this is a crazy thing to judge about, but I know that if they care for their product, they will put care into the packaging as well.

Upon opening the package, I noticed the left ear foam piece was melted and looked nothing like it was supposed to. Maybe it has been sitting in the head too much? It wasn't that big of a deal since I knew I wasn't going to use the foam tips anyway. I much prefer the rubber ones that are included with the packaging. It was a pain to get the tips off and the rubber ones weren't that great to put on either, but it wasn't incredibly difficult.

Putting on the earphones did prove to be a little difficult at first trying to figure out how they are supposed to go on. Once I did, I found that these earphones provided such a tight fit I couldn't hear much around me even without any music going. For me that's a bonus, but for some they may not.

It does come with a small zipper case with a metal carabiner clip on it. I guess it would help with travel when you're not listening to them. The chord is Loong! and very nice! It also comes with an earwax cleaner for your earpieces which is always nice to have.

Now, the sound: these earphones sound pretty amazing. The highs are clear and crisp, the mids are okay and the bass is pretty nice. I like a lot of bass in my music with bass drops and such and this hits them with a nice punch. For the price, these headphones are better than just about anything else out there at the same pricebreak of ~$100. I would get them again if the need ever arose. Still breaking them in, but they sound pretty nice out of the box already."
2540,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality of these is good. However, the way you have to put these in and take these out is pretty inconvenient and hard to get used to. Also, I tried multiple tips, but they just ended up hurting my ear canals after wearing longer than an hour."
2541,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I actually review this item I want to mention the seller ""The Variety Spot"" that I purchased from Amazon through. They are the BEST! I recently purchased a Rolls PM351 personal monitor and got the Mee Electronics headphones that appeared in the 'also purchased' section of the listing. Those headphones could not handle the sound, particularly the bass coming through the unit. I was in a tight spot because I wanted to use the personal monitor for some gigs coming up fast. Through research I found that the Shure PE215 headphones would probably be the best match since they are made for this application. I asked The Variety Spot if they could help me out by shipping ASAP and guess what? It was out the door within a couple of hours and with USPS 3 day priority mail! I received the unit in 3 days and am so happy to be using it in time!

The unit itself is solid. Shure sells some higher models that probably are better but for the price you will probably not find earbuds that can handle something like a stage monitor system as well. I play bass and sing some and so naturally I want those coming through. I tried several headphones including the Mee Electronics, some Smoking Buds that I had lying around, some Sony earbuds and some Monster over the ear headphones that I have. None of them could handle the bass coming through the Rolls PM351. The Shure PE215 earbuds are sometimes slightly overdriven by the bass but other than that they do the trick very nicely. No surprise since they were made for this application. As a bonus they are the best headphones I have for listening to my music from my devices. Very balanced sound with the punchiest bass you will ever find. I believe that Shure also makes a model with a mic if you want to use it with your phone.

For the price you will not beat these earbuds for stage or just listening to music!

Thanks Variety Spot!!"
2542,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not bad for the price. I've owned quite a few in ears in the $30-$60 range and I am happy that I paid a little more for these. I am a general music listener and podcast listener. For me, these sounds very good when listening to different types of genres. I listen to a lot of podcast and these do an amazing job at isolating external noises. My boss has snuck up behind me a few times without even trying. I enjoy the extra clarity in these earphones when I compare them to my previous sets. If these we're priced a little more cheaper, I highly recommend them."
2543,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use ear bud headphones solely for riding on my motorcycle. I usually have the rubber tipped kind but went with the foam tip for these.

The foam tips block as much outside sound as an actual foam ear plug design to block sound. It's great for wind noise inside my helmet. I find myself turning the volume way down as I can still hear my music while blocking the damaging wind/engine noise, and I can still hear my environment.

They also lay completely flat in my ear, and the cord that wraps around my ear does a great job of keeping the ear bud in place, even in my helmet.

Sound quality is also fantastic for the price. Cord is super durable. I like that the cord is also replaceable/interchangeable.

Definitely recommend."
2544,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for an upgrade to my Etymotics which I like very much but were lacking in lower end frequency response. I had listened to the Shure SE 425 and 525's but $400 or $500 for in ear iPod headsets? I'm not cheap but have a problem spending twice as much money for an accessory as I paid for the device. I read a review on the Shure SE215 and decided at $99 to buy a pair. So far they're great! I'm a part time musician so I'm pretty picky about my music. The SE215's have a big sound, perhaps a little bass heavy but since I'm a bass player I like that. Cons: This is not a small in the ear and the design makes you experiment a bit to get the right position and feel. Once in properly you are not going to forget you're wearing a headset. Several people have talked about left ear hiss. So far no problems here but I've only had the set for a few weeks."
2545,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is superb, sound isolation is great and natural, and fit is perfect. Removable cord is great in case it breaks, which is very hard do. Can be worn with glasses or goggles quite comfortably, and honestly you could wear these things all day and all night and still not have to take them out.
One trick I use is to run the cord down my back under my shirt; this protects the cord and greatly reduces the chance of snagging on something."
2546,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are great for a long time I had wanted these headphones to use with my monitor system for drumming and they sound great, the package however came a little dirty and with scratches, but the headphones were great they were non damaged and looked perfect. In the beginning it's a little uncomfortable to put on and it takes a while for your headphone to get used to you ear shape, but over time they fall right in place. I really recommend them they do isolate all the noise so I would read the instructions on how to and when to where them if on the go. For safety reasons. But the sound quality is great everything is clear the bass is incredible. I did expect the headphones to be a little louder, but I guess it just my phone. I really recommend them they are great!!"
2547,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones to have if you enjoy music quality when it comes to noise isolation , stage , clarity and tonal accuracy. For the price you will be hard pressed to find anything that comes close to the quality of these .."
2548,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Affordable and great response, I'm currently using these through an onstage monitoring system and though I'm not adept at this..newer use of technology, I'm accustomed to playing into the onstage mix coming from the band..this product is proving to be quite an asset. Only thing missing is a clip to keep it to your collar and perhaps your belt loop. As advised by our worship drummer, putting the connection into your back pocket reduces possible damage to wires by putting any tension on your pocket instead of the connector. Using the ambient Mike on the monitor allows you to hear people speaking to you and house worship, invaluable when rehearsing because the noise cancelling on this earpiece works really well, lol."
2549,5.0 out of 5 stars,I play on stage about twice a month where in ear monitors are used. These block out the sound in the room while giving me clear sound in my ears. The sound quality is what would be expected from SURE and the construction is great. The cord is long enough to wear as in ear monitors and the construction is very durable. They fit and stay in the ears great once you find a foam piece that fits. All kinds of sizes come with these headphones so finding a pair that fits wont require seeking aftermarket stuff. I highly recommend these headphones.
2550,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound! Exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for a pair of wireless headphones that have great sound and great fit. If you are looking for in-ear wireless headphones that allows you to listen to every instrument then look no further.
2551,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One side of my Klipsch S4's went out so I was looking for a replacement around the $100 price range. The headphones primary use will be at the gym and secondarily at an office job. After some online research, I decided on the Shure SE-215. I've had them for a little over a month and I'm happy with my decision so far. Sound wise, I would say that it is slightly better than the S4's because of the foam tips which reduces outside noise. There's a little learning curve getting adjusted to the over the ear placement and the feeling of the foam tips vs rubber tips but it's worked out for me so far.

Pros
- Great sound for the price. Foam tips create a good seal blocking outside noise.
- Over the ear fitment. This took a bit to get used to but it keeps the headphones in place with lots of movement.
- Replaceable cable.

Cons
- Cable is ridiculously long.
- Very difficult to change tips. Changing tips is a chore and shouldn't be as difficult."
2552,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just replaced my included Apple EarPods with these Shures and what an improvement.

Previously I've owned Etymotic Hf5, Skullcandy Heavy Metal, Sennheiser 380HD 'phones. The sound is on par with the Etymotics, not as full as my Senns (which are over the ear cans, so not really an apt comparison).

Cable is plenty long. I'm a tall guy so this really nice. Also, it doesn't seem to tangle very easily and the included case is padded, so that's good.

My only real complaint is the lack of included in-line mic and controls. I knew this when buying so not a big deal, but I'll certainly be purchasing the music control add-on soon (but the lack of a clear version is holding me back, are you listening Shure?)

Definitely a worthwhile purchase for $100."
2553,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a replacement for a pair of Klipsch X10s that had their flimsy cable die just out of warranty. Got sick of replacing expensive IEMs over this issue. The Shure line is the only remotely affordable option with removable cables, and they're not bad at all aurally - but there are some immediately obvious drawbacks.

Pros:
Superb sound isolation and secure fit makes them ideal for commuting
With a proper seal, they sound great for the price - nice bass that doesn't overpower
Removable, thick cable

Cons:
Awkward insertion process
The monitors themselves are large enough to feel uncomfortable in the ear after several hours
QA issues - had to send back a pair due to (apparently common) issues with sound dropping on the left ear.
Fat plug won't fit most phone cases"
2554,2.0 out of 5 stars,"the sound is great on these earphones, but the problem is after a few months of use, the right ear driver started to make static noises. When I tried pulling out the left ear driver from the cable, the ear driver socket was probably too tight and ended up pulling out the wiring inside of the driver.
Also, the paint for the logo completely faded away. These earphones are not well-made. At least not the pair I received."
2555,4.0 out of 5 stars,Technically a very good product. I have a little trouble keeping the buds in my ears.
2556,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have warm sound without muddiness and decent soundstage (compared with my other buds) with good isolation.

The wires are rotating in the earpiece housing so one needs to pay some attention while putting them on.
Memory foams provide very good seal and easy to put in and several sizes are provided as well.

Unfortunately, with the good seal comes its bad side - no heat/vapor transfer.
My ears become itchy in about 1.5-2 hours of listening and hot in about 2 more.
The wire has no microphonics that I can hear so I think these make pretty decent physical activity phones (much better than my prior sennheiser buds)."
2557,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these better than the more expensive units. For casual listening the set great. More bass than the 315, and 425 I have tried. The highs are a bit flat to me, and the midrange a bit flatter when compared to the 425. For listening to rock on my smart phone these really fit the bill. The weak link is my phone."
2558,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a replacement to a busted pair of Klipsch S4's. Sound quality overall is better than my S4's were. Highs are crystal clear without any harshness. Mid and low frequencies come in very clear as well, but I feel these lack the bass response of the Klipsch. Not a massive difference, but something to consider. If you like a lot of booming bass you'd probably be better served with Beats headphones. I am really enjoying the sound quality and clarity though. I'm hearing things that I never heard before in my music which is quite fun. I do wish they had more bottom end response though, maybe I'll play with the equalizer on my device to see if I can make up for it.

These took a bit to get used to the fit. I looked like a goof for the first 10 minutes trying to figure out how to put them in, but after a few tries you get better at it. Once they're in they are very secure. Outside noises are virtually eliminated, as the contact points are made of a material similar to a really good pair of ear plugs. That's a huge plus for me, as I was looking for something to make noisy flights more bearable. There are multiple sizes included to fit any ear. That said, the driver itself is rather large. I have ""Colbert ears"" where one sticks out and the other is more flat. My flatter ear ends up hurting a bit from the driver pressing on it. No problem with my stick-out ear. Kind of hard to explain, and your results may vary. Last note about the fit is that these have to be put in a certain way, meaning that it does take a bit of your concentration to install them. You can't just walk out of a coffee shop with your cappuccino in hand while installing them with your other.

Another great thing about these headphones is the cable which is replaceable and rather thick. I've destroyed a number of headphones from frayed or damaged cables, and I feel these won't be susceptible to that same damage. Also, the cable seems to be shielded. Meaning when you're walking you don't get ANY noise interference from cable movement or the cable knocking against things (your body, your arm, etc). The Klipsch were HORRIBLE with this.

Overall I think they're good and I'd recommend them over the Klipsch S4. Sure they look a bit strange and require more effort to put in your ear. But they are much clearer, better built, and have much better sound isolation. Minus one star for the strange fit and slight lack of low end."
2559,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I expected to love these IEM's based on all the rave reviews out there and my previous experience with Shure phono cartridges and microphones. Unfortunately, I found them quite uncomfortable, and their housings had a tendency to fall out of my ears. None of the supplied tips seemed to seal well with my ear canals, resulting in weak bass response. The black-colored foam tips are extremely soft, and they take a long time to expand again once compressed. The rubbery tips are more manageable but did not seal well. This fact combined with the stiff cords looped over the back of my ears caused these IEM's to fall out regularly. Plus, they take several seconds longer to get situated in your ears compared to normal (i.e. non-IEM style) earbuds. IMO, the Monster Turbines and NuForce NE-700X earphones are superior sounding for less money and provide superior comfort than Shure's SE-215, which I have returned."
2560,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I evaluated many in-the-ear options before settling on the Shure line. In fact I tried a few and each time, the cabling failed long before I thought it should. Shure solved the failed cabling issue by making the cables reliable and user replaceable. I've replaced the cable once in about 2 years. Once you install these correctly with the proper seals, they work great at sealing out the environment while remaining comfortable for hours of use. I am considering a second pair to replace another brand who's cabling has failed and is not replaceable. Recommended."
2561,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Headphones are fantastic! I workout around 6 days/week and switched from the Power Beats by Dre, as much as I disagree with Beat's products... I liked the fact that the Power Beats were stationary, and sweat proof, as I am a heavy sweater...

Initially, the SE-215's are a bit tough to break in, but once they are, the sound is fantastic. The noise cancellation feature is spot on, almost to the point of it being dangerous when I run in the city. The frequency response and power output are combined to produce some great sound. The cord is a bit bulky for a set of earphones cord, but it doesn't bother me.
Shure is a great brand for audiophiles on a budget.

The good: Headphones sound good for the price, and fit snug, once broken in.

The bad: Mid range is a bit lacking compared to low's and high's. Also, nearly impossible to take off ear foam components... Since they are made of memory foam, when I squeeze them and try change them, I end up squeezing the foam so hard that it completely flattens out, resulting me to stop trying to pull the immobile ear bud from the headphones themselves. I like the memory foam, and the stock size is probably my size, but this is very frustrating."
2562,5.0 out of 5 stars,"(Original review from May 2014, updated January 2015)

I'm a runner who sweats heavily. I originally ran using Etymotic ER-4P earphones. My first ER-4P from 2003 had a stiff wire. I ran in extreme weather, like heavy rain, and it never failed. The triple-flange silicone tips were essential to keep moisture from damaging the earphones, something other brands didn't offer. I was set with the Etymotic brand. But after 3 years, the wire failed, which was understandable. I sent it in for repair. It came back with a new style of wire. A fragile, twisted type, and it was nowhere as good as the original stiff wire. It now failed yearly. I sent it in each time, and it cost about $80 to repair. I got another ER-4P so I could use one while the other was being fixed. I loved the sound that much! One day, I ended up needing to send both in for repair at the same time. I put both away, and decided to try a cheaper model.

I got the Etymotic HF5. It cost about $90 on Amazon. It had that great stiff wire, and used the same triple-flange silicone tips. In the gym, it sounded just as good as the ER-4P model! Sadly, its wire failed in less than a year. I called Etymotic and was told it would cost $80 to repair. So I put it with my two broken ER-4Ps. Why not just pay $10 more and get a new one? So I did. Well, its wire failed within a year. I was so very careful with it, too.

So desperate to keep using Etymotic earphones, I got the $30 EREK-5, a kid's model which has a volume limit to protect your hearing. It used the same silicone tips, which is why I got them. But these sounded so awful, I had to just put them away.

So in May 2014 I was prepared to send in my Etymotics for repair and just live with their fragile nature. But I came across this Shure model, which had the same type of silicone ear tips, and, I couldn't believe it, a detachable cable! Plus the cable costs only $20? I had to take a chance on this, so I bought it. For a little over $90, it was barely more than repairing one of my Etymotics. I also bought a spare cable and silicone tips, so I was all set.

When I got the earphones, I noted a few things. The cable is quite long, so I thought it would be cumbersome while exercising. Also, I had to practice putting these on a few times to get used to it. It's a little awkward at first. After pushing it in your ear, you have to wind the wire over the top, then down the back of your ear, and squeeze it a little for a custom, secure fit (the wire keeps its shape when you take it off, which is a plus). But these sound so good while exercising, I happily adjusted to the wire length and the quirky wire-around-the-ear business!

In the gym, I use this Shure model, plugged into a Sony SBH20B bluetooth piece (which is a tiny 1 inch square). Clipped to the back of my shirt collar, it works wirelessly with my Samsung Galaxy tablet.

After each workout, I take off the silicone eartips (to keep them from stretching out and becoming loose-fitting, which is when you toss them out) then wind the earphones around my hand, and put it all into a rigid camera case (rather than the included soft case - it's a habit I formed while using Etymotics). I originally took apart the whole Shure earphone to let them dry, but have gotten lazy and just take off the silicone tips. Now and then I'll get a crackling noise in the left or right earphone, so I take it apart, wipe the connectors, put it back together, rotate the earphones at the connector joint a couple of times, and it's all good again. It's my fault for not taking it apart to dry every day, but it's still working great, despite that!

When I first got these earphones, I of course had a bunch of Etymotics silicone tips, and they're kind of expensive, so I didn't want to waste them. Thankfully they fit, so I got to use all the tips up, and are now using the Shure tips.

After 6 months of daily sweaty abuse, these Shure earphones are working like the very first day I got them. Still have the backup cable in its original packaging! Had I been using my Etymotics in the gym, I'm certain I'd be sending them in for repair by now. This Shure model can withstand all my sweat, all the daily winding/unwinding, so for those of you who want great sounding audio during your exercise sessions, I highly recommend this Shure model. The best earphones I have ever used in the gym! I will edit this review the day my earphones fail and I have to swap the wire. I'm betting it'll be the end of 2015, or sometime 2016. That would be awesome, but even better if it never failed, which might happen, since the wire is so stiff!

To sum up for exercising audio fanatics:
- These sound just as good as Etymotics ER-4Ps while you're in motion. Sitting quietly on a chair, sure, the Etymotics sound better. But while exercising? Yes. These sound fantastic!
- The earphones detach from the cable. A huge, huge benefit, as the cables are always the thing to fail. $20 for a spare cable that you can swap out instantly? It doesn't get any better.
- Triple-flanged silicone ear tips! These are the best for exercising, and I think besides Etymotics, Shure is the only other one that has these.

My highest recommendation, get these earphones, a spare wire, spare tips, and enjoy your workouts!

PS - I just checked out the current Etymotics ER-4P being sold on Amazon. They still have the fragile, twisted wire. I'd buy another in a heartbeat if they changed it back to the old style. So sad :("
2563,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We use these for in-ear monitors at our church. Everyone thinks they are comfortable, and they sound great for our application. Come with foam and silicon ear plugs of 3 different sizes. The silicon ones really help isolate sound."
2564,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought to replace a pair of the Beats Tour earbuds that had to be replaced under warranty TWICE before I owned them 6 months. Please, don't let my lack of judgement then affect my credibility for this review. I have erred. To err is human...these Shure SE-215 earphones, however, are divine.

Construction: The wiring is a little heavier-duty than I expected, with robust connections at the joints. Would imagine that it'd take quite a bit of roughhousing/abuse to cause a failure - I expect no problems here. The actual driver construction seems strong enough - I can see the glue joints on the plastic enclosure, but I cannot feel any seam.

Materials: Again, the wiring seems rather robust, although I'd have preferred a slightly less tacky insulating material used as they tend drag a little bit. The driver enclosures seem to be built of a pretty robust plastic. I opted for the clear ones, which don't necessarily look rock-solid, but I imagine its just a case of being able to see the little bits and pieces that makes them seem less than they are.

Sound: Everything sounds crisp - I listen to just about everything through them (crappy brostep through Wu-Tang Clan through Dave Matthews), and the quality of the reproduction is more than great. There seems to be no over-emphasis on specific tonal ranges (unlike my prior Beats), and there seems to be ample range across the entire...the lows hit low, the highs hit high, and everything just sounds smooth. Kinda sucks, but I'm gonna have to get rid of some of my 128 kbit/s files - I can noticeably hear the squishy cymbals and muffled bass now. They also tend to isolate external noise very well too, especially with the foam ear sleeves.

Fit: Comes with a variety of different ear sleeves and sizes...I'm a big fan of the ""memory foam"" type. The over-ear part contains a piece of paper clip type wire that is bent to adjust the fit and feel; I have mixed feelings toward this because its simply too pliable - it seems that every time I take them off and put them back on, I have to re-adjust the fit to keep them right. Unfortunately, that's gonna be responsible for 4-stars instead of 5. I would love to see a more robust metal wire that doesn't bend and flex so easily. Even better, I'd love to see a hardened sleeve material over the ears that can be heated with a hairdryer to shape and retain rigidity when cooled. Wishful thinking...whatevs.

Features: I'm a huge fan of the attachment point between the wiring and the driver - I've owned too many earphones/earbuds over time that I've had to replace because the connection between the two was broken. If such a tragedy occurs here, you're telling me that I can simply buy a new wire and plug it into the driver and have it work?! Sold.

Overall: I love them. They sound great, the feel great, they fit great. They fit comfortably and snugly under my motorcycle helmet, and I can actually hear my music too. All in all, I STRONGLY recommend these."
2565,5.0 out of 5 stars,"really nice sound with a bump in the mids. I use these as monitors on stage and they are very comfortable. The cable is protected well and the plug has extra padding that might get in the way of some smartphone cases, but that really shouldn't be an issue considering what these were designed for."
2566,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound very good. I'm using them with the Comply P series. The sound is excellent; no frequency range drastically overpowers another. I wouldn't call them neutral, they are a little on the bright side. The cord is amazing and sturdy and doesn't pick up static or movement. I use these while working out and they have been great so far. I doubt they are sweat proof but they've held up fine so far but we'll see."
2567,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had it for a week now. So far, I like it.
SOUND QUALITY: It is quite good, especially the clarity of the sound. I am able to hear a lot of details.
NOISE ISOLATION: You need to try different ear buds to find out the ones that fit your ears. Once you have the right one, the noise isolation works very well.
BASS: Like many other reviewers said, the bass is not overwhelming. You can barely feel the bass when the volume is low. Once I found the right ear buds, the bass seemed to be a bit more prominent, but still not satisfying. I would give it a 5 star if the bass is a little better."
2568,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn't have room for my Bose bluetooth headphones on my last business trip, so I reached for these small earphones. It was my first time really using them, and it was a very nice experience. They block out sound passively, through the design of the earphone in your ear tunnel. Even with no music playing, the difference on a plane without them is drastic. They do not require much power to get a good sound level. The quality of the sound is pretty good."
2569,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like listening to music when I work .... keeps me on task. These headphones do a great job blocking out the ambient noises of an office. I listen to a lot of jazz and classical music and I must say that the sound clarity is very good. Takes a bit of a getting used to in placing the earphones but once you find the right fit they seal wonderfully. the cord is tough but pliable. They do get a bit tiresome after wearing for a few hours. I started to notice them about 3-4 hrs aft e r continuous wear..... but I think most earphones get prretty uncomfortable after long periods like that. I personally have no complaints and would recommend these.
2570,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally purchased these headphones to use with my iPhone 6s and TV.

But even if I do, I'm happy that I can just replace the cable because they detach from the earphones. I've had to get rid of too many headphones in the past because of broken cables or plugs."
2573,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure SE215-CL Sound Isolating Earphones with Single Dynamic MicroDriver

This is about my 4th pair. I use them with my iPod when I'm at the gym. Shure is a name I've trusted since my teen years singing in night clubs. I'm now 69."
2574,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my SE215 earbuds for over a year and still love them. When I compare my earbuds to earbuds friends have bought for more then $250, my earbuds sound better all around. Their earbuds sound more crisp at the higher frequencies, but overall the whole sound experience is better with mine. The base on the SE215 is really good, haven't found any earbuds that sound better, base wise, then mine for around the same price. The quality base is the most noticeable thing I hear when I compare my earbuds to more expensive, non-Shure brand, earbuds.

Before I bought my SE215's I was really worried about all the reviews that say the cables go bad after a short time. Mine still have no problems whatsoever and I have been listening to them for at least 2 hours a day for over a year. I take really good care of my earbuds and I use the carrying case whenever I transport them. I even through them into my laptop bag everyday on my way to work and still haven't had any issues.

Bottom line, if you are wondering whether to get these headphones, just get them. You will not be disappointed. After listening to my SE215's I have had friends go buy a pair the next day because of how much they loved the sound quality of these earbuds for the sub $100 price.

Cons: The only complaint I have about these headphones is they can be a little uncomfortable after wearing them for more then three hours. I never have had a problem with my right ear, but my left ear will start to get sore after about three hours and if I leave them in for more then six or seven hours I will have to remove the earbud from my left ear because it can really start to hurt. I don't listen to them for more then four hours very often, so it isn't a big deal. Even with this problem I would still buy another pair in a heartbeat because the quality sound that is produced from these headphones is amazing. Also, I wouldn't recommend these headphones if you are looking for something to wear while sleeping.

Last note, I have a sound system at home with Sonas Faber Toy Towers and a REL T-9 sub. I bought this sound system for listening to music and not home theater (though the T-9 is geared for home theater). I've listened to other high end music sound systems, including the Alexandria 2 from Wilson, and can easily hear the difference between these high end systems and other systems. You can definitely get earbuds that sound better then the SE215's, but the only earbuds I've ever heard that sound better are the higher end Shure earbuds and other brand earbuds that are well over $200 dollars.

Hope this review helps!"
2575,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have had these for over two weeks and I can say that I can clearly here a difference between these and the standard earbuds that came with my iPhone 6. I like that fact the it come with different styles and sizes of ear tips plus that the cable is replaceable. They are very lightweight and after you get used to how to put them on the are comfortable for long periods of use 4+ hours. The lows are present and well balanced the mids and high sound smooth at moderate volume but can be a bit harsh past 85% volume. Overall great headphones for the price
2576,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best in-ear headphones I have owned yet. Amazing sound, very stable in your ears (especially for jogging), and completely isolates your sound as well as a non-noise cancelling headphone can do.

I have had mine for two years before I needed to get them replaced, but it is mainly due to my usage and less to do with the product. Over time, if you use these for running, sweat can cause corrosion in the connector from the cord to the monitors. I plan on buying another pair of these strictly for office/home/travel use and a seperate one for running, otherwise I believe these would have lasted much much longer."
2577,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Moving from a set of regular earbuds to these earbuds is like night and day. The sound quality is amazing, and you'll hear the little details you've never noticed in songs that you've heard a hundred times. They have foam earplug-esque tips to comfortably create a seal in your ear, which also helps by eliminating most background noise. I wear them for about 5 hours at a time, and I haven't had any discomfort like with other earbuds."
2578,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality, but too much of a pain to insert and remove. Would be fine if you plan to leave them in for long periods of time without a need to take them out, but since they deafen you to the outside world, you'll need to take at least one out even to have a quick conversation with someone next to you. I ended up returning them."
2579,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a review of the Shure SE215-K Sound Isolating Earphones.

Summary - If you are looking to go between the average seat of quality earbuds and professional, these are your thing. I have purchased and tried the bose sound true, the Audio Technica ATH CRK10's and tried several other types and these in my opinion are the best so far even though they were not near the most expensive. When I tried these, I realized that my best sounding set still were not giving me all the depth and clarity my devices had to offer. You can literally hear all ranges very clear and unlike most other earbuds, each range comes through balanced. There is no distortion in the bass and yet it is strong but not over powering like some. (No muddyness and no tin type highes.)

I am not going to recap the specs listed on the product page as you can read them there. One thing I have learned from buying earbuds is that you really can not go with specs. You need to try them out and use your own ears.

What I love above these.
-Amazing clarity, detail and solid bass.
-They are very comfortable, are not heavy and feel nice in the ear allowing me long term use without having sore or hot ears.
-Came with a carry case with a clip so I can clip my gear and go.
-Does not require an amplifier or DAC. So unlike some Inner Ear Monitors, you can use these on common devices like your phones, Ipod, etc.
-Has detachable cables. Most earbuds you have to look for warranty or replacement if you damage a cord. These you can just go purchase a replacement cable which are not expensive. (I have also seen replacement cables for these which add in the microphone so you can use for hands free calling on your phone and have seen cables that will make these wireless - blue tooth.) So lots of options in terms of cables.

Cons
-The over the ear design will take some getting use to if you never used like me. It takes me a little bit to get them in my ears and positioned how I like them. So if you want a set to just pop in, this type may not be for you. The design however keeps them in place and sounding great even if you are very active."
2580,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good: for $100 bucks you seriously can't beat this sound quality. it is the best. I used to have shure e4c but when they broke I decided to buy cheaper ones and since I know and trust shure for their customer service I went with them again this time with 215. This headphones delivers quality sound at the cheapest entry price for any In Ear Monitors. durability, sound quality, packaging, customer support all is best of the breed. Enough said, i'd pick this pair over etyomotic , bose, logitech, ultrasound any day (and I say this cuz I've tried all of those brands).

Bad: the fit on this headphone is weird (unlike e4c) and subjective. If I get the right fit, then it feels as if you dont even have a headphones on and that is the good part, however when you don't get the right fit, you just are left struggling and it may even hurt your ears (not pleasant). Because the fit is so weird, it does take good 1 min to put it on correctly and takes some effort to take it out. For something as used as earphones this shouldn't be the case. But again other than the FIT i don't have any complains with this pair, hence 4 stars.

Update 9/13/2013: As originally suspected, it still hurt in my ears after prolonged (10-20 mins max) use. No matter how I put it on, with whichever sleeve, its a problem. However still best durability and sound quality for $100."
2581,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great in ear. What you'd expect from shure. My 1 less star is due to the clear color not remaining clear for long, and I take care of my gear. Would purchase black next go round. I'm live 3x a week. These make beats look like junk. Excellent fit, very customizable."
2582,2.0 out of 5 stars,"No complaints with sounds quality, but that should be expected to some degree from 100$ ear buds. Popping and clicking started 6 months after purchase though, which is a real bummer. This is my PC set, so I don't even take this set out and about. In general I look for at least 12 months of good quality from any pair of earbuds I buy. Shoot, I even have a couple of pairs of 20$ panasonic buds that have lasted almost 2 years on the move every day. Quality is elusive with ear buds, and for that I'll have to keep looking somewhere else."
2583,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is great. I use them for video editing as well as blocking out the noise of my roommates when I am trying to work and they all get home. It's really important that you crimp the cable and pull it tight. at the base of your neck to ensure the best fit
2584,4.0 out of 5 stars,"That neck rest on the cord is awfully shaped and shifts from one side to another, audio quality is the exact same as the original se215s, I wish they'd incorporate an app and software updates to add battery levels and modify the voice that mimics the one as Bose. Not bad for the spare headphones I occasionally misplace around the house."
2585,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was uneasy purchasing these but now that I have them and use on stage with a large horn band they are awesome. Just the right amount of mids and highs and not too mush bass in them. they have multiple ear buds to make them comfortable with any ear fit
2586,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Feel very nice in your ear once you can figure out how to wear them. They are a little awkward to figure out how to get them placed in your ears. The over ear wires are a little stiff to wrap over the top of your ears. Hopefully they will break in and feel better. The sound is good. More bass than the Etymotic Research earbuds that I have been using. These sound great, just different than the Etymotic. The seal is good with the memory foam tips. Ambient noise is greatly reduced and the foam is very comfy."
2587,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I have owned these buds since October 2011 according to my purchase history with Amazon. These are the best buds that I have ever owned. I have previously owned a set of EC2's and they were great until I packed them with out their case and cracked the plastic housing of the drivers. Then I bought some Bose ear buds and hated them. They didn't fit properly and even with the different tips I couldn't get a comfortable experience. After some research I decided to get these that were billed as 'In Ear Monitors'. I am not a performing musician or even a serious hobby player but I have seen artists using these and similar ones in the past so I bought them. They are amazing. Sound quality is clear at very low levels and do not distort at high levels. They have even forced me to turn on the volume limit on my Iphone so that I don't cause permanent damage. Like others have posted these are not meant to be used when you have to have some situational awareness like when biking or out in public in general. I have found that I use them most often when I am at home and don't want to disturb others with loud music or when flying. Despite previous reviews the case, alb eight a soft one, not only holds the buds but also replacement tips as well. One thing I LIked was the different tips that the unit ships with. It allowed me to customize and find the perfect fit and order replacements here on Amazon. With my EC2's I would often find that if I left the buds not in their case I would loose the nibs. My SE215 buds I replace only whenever they have accumulated too much wax. (In ear headphones and ear health is something for another review). These phones have worked flawlessly and I have even take to using them in Garageband. The long cord allows me some movement and like another reviewer stated you can take them out of your pocket while wearing a jacket and not worry about it.
So this is why I finally got around to posting....

I no longer have a good connection on my plug. Something happened seemingly overnight and I have to manipulate the plug to get clear sound. A phone call to Shure and they want me to send in the unit, drivers and cable to test. I was apprehensive at first because I was out of warranty and just wanted to buy a cable but they said they would test everything for me. I have shipped my favorite Earphones ever off to Shure to be evaluated. Under current pricing if it is only the cable I will get my phones back for $16. Not to shabby. I will update once I get my buds back."
2588,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well spent with this price range. Excellent noise isolation, punchy bass, solid mid, appropriate treble, low distortion and broad stage, its sound impresses me even without burning in. The clarity needs improvement but what else do you ask for in view of this price? In my opinion,it performs electronics best. My other suggestion is that you'd like to get a pair of black color instead of clear one. 'Cause clear color in real looks like electrician's tools. And you'd need an additional hard case. Its attached case is too soft to protect this IEM."
2589,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from Apple ear buds. These blow them out of the water in terms of sound quality. Sound stage is amazing, highs, mids, and lows are all there. Once you fit them correctly (with the provided foamies), these are incredible noise isolating IEMs. I work downtown in a major city and I can hardly hear traffic between songs when walking about.

Pros:
- Sound quality is excellent; once fitted correctly, they produce an incredible sound stage, including bass.
- Noise isolation is excellent; I can hardly hear traffic let alone colleagues in the cubes next door.
- Nice length of cable; not too long but not too short. Travel case is handy when not in use. Monitors are detachable.

Cons:
- The stiff over-the-ear ""memory line"" that molds to the back of your ear takes getting used to. Putting these on and taking off takes a decent effort in comparison to non over-the-ear types of IEMs."
2590,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these specifically as an IEM and will not use my typical earbuds again for this purpose. I am pretty new to singing in a band. I am a trained classical singer and choral director with a degree in music. Using an IEM is quite a different experience in sound than I have experienced before, but of utmost importance if you are in a band (floor monitors are worthless). I have used several other earphones (including my Bose), but these are ABSOLUTELY the best when singing in the band. I am still getting use to putting them in my ears (getting easier each time I use them), but once in they are secure and the quality of the sound is excellent. If they are in your ear correctly, they are feel great. I have had them in for close to 6 hours one ear felt perfect, but one was rubbing and needed to be adjusted in my ear. It was a simple fix. You really have to see these as a piece of equipment that have to be used correctly for the best benefit. If used in that capacity and given a short amount of time to 'learn' how to use them I am sure you will be as completely satisfied as I am. The price can't be beat for the quality. I would not wear these as an everyday earbud, but could see them used for running and/or working out."
2591,4.0 out of 5 stars,My nephew recommended these for me as I have very low tolerance for noise and couldn't find any earphones that would truly cancel noise. I hesitated between these and the newer ones but he told me that these would do just fine.... wow is right! You do not need to have the music at high volume to cancel what's next to you on the plane or in the house.... These are indeed the best music quality and noise cancellation... they come with a nice container and several sizes of M L and S ear piece another bonus bc I have small ears and the Iphone ones really hurt me without even cancelling the noise... I got them in black so they match my MotoG phone and I stream Amazon Prime music.... am in heaven! Thank you for an incredible product! Oh ps. I removed a star bc really with all the design software available to the company they can make directions a LOT more user friendly they were horrible I had to youtube the stuff.....
2592,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing headphones,
I thought I had great quality headphones before purchasing a pair of SE215 Shures. Well constructed for the price range, Many headphones at this price range do not come with the removable cable, which is a feature I love. You have the freedom to replace a cable if it is damaged or to purchase an aftermarket cable for the IEM's. Fantastic feature!
The IEM's themselves are solid, and give fantastic sound clarity and quality. Those suggesting that there is no base to these headphones need adjust their player/computer settings. These give out a generous amount of base, I am new to micro-drivers so I don't know if there is a break in period. But two weeks of heavy listening and these are great. The sound is very clear, very distinctive I can pick out each sound from a song and which direction it is coming from. The base is more then enough for any audiophile unless you like The Bass drowning all the other sounds.
They are a little tricky to put in, yes. And there is a small learning Curve to this. But most people who are getting $100+ pair of IEM's or Custom IEM's are going to be listening for long periods of time, not taking them in and out every five minutes. I believe an after market cord without the mold-able ""ear cuffs"" would cut some time off inserting them, for me anyways. But for the quality I can deal with it.
All in all these are a very great set for the price, and give off an amazing sound at the $100 range."
2593,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was going through a pair of ear buds approximately every 3 months, you know the kind that you normally find in checkout lines and impulse buy points in a store.
Then I bought my first pair of Shure, and two years later I'm replacing them with a second pair. I can't get into dB ratios, bass depths, etc, etc, etc, but I can tell you these are well made and handle everyday commuter use very well.
The sound is great (talk radio and podcasts mostly) and they do cancel out annoying traffic noise.
Stop buying the $9 pair at the grocery store and do yourself a favor. These are great."
2594,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was searching for an earbud that would help to filter out ambient noise at work and also have some great sound. I found it with the Shure SE215-K's.

I have a nice pair of Sennheiser over the ear HD565s but I don't like to wear them to work because if working in close proximity to someone, they have a good amount of audio leakage from the drivers which can annoy people in the vicinity.

I originally was looking for something with active noise cancellation to allow me to better focus at work, but after much research, decided to go with earbuds which would allow for noise isolation. I was not disappointed with my choice.

While it feels somewhat silly paying around 100 dollars for earbuds when there are others on the market available at a fraction of the price, I didn't want to listen to tinny music with a bad soundstage. With a massive amount of great reviews and top 5 list showings, I decided upon the SE215-K's.

The earbuds are a bit of a pain to get used to in terms of ""screwing"" them onto your ears, but once they are their and you've picked the proper tips, your going to be in your own world. They block out a good amount of ambient noise and don't require a large amount of volume to put you in total seclusion. Sometimes this can be a disadvantage, because they are small, people may not realize that you cannot hear them and will talk to you while you sit there an enjoy your favorite albums until you notice them looking at you in disbelief because your not responding.

I also use these when doing outdoor work. While this may not be the best thing for my hearing, I love mowing the lawn and actually being able to hear my music or audiobooks. I often wear them underneath some over the ear protection so that I don't have to listen to them at such a high volume. There is nothing that beats going out with the chainsaw/lawnmower/snowblower and being in your own world while actually getting some work done.

I unfortunately lost my first pair of these while on a business trip and after agonizing for a few weeks about whether to try something else, or go cheaper, I finally caved in and bought a new pair, this time the clear ones to change it up a bit. These are great enough to warrant a second purchase!"
2595,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought to use while riding a cruiser motorcycle with no windscreen and no helmet. Paired them with EATFL1-6 triple flange sleeves and they work fantastic!! Cuts wind noise significantly and allows you to hear your music at less than 100% volume. I tested them to 100 mph (empty freeway for short period) and they stayed put with very little wind noise. Unfortunately you don't hear much else either. I've got earbuds with a somewhat better sound reproduction but none would stand up to more than about 30 mph before the wind would severely depreciate the sound. These do sound VERY good. Little heavy on bass, which I like anyway but slightly lacking on treble. Set EQ to treble boost in phone setting and it was better. My biggest problem before was longevity, the remote switch was always out in the wind and the wires would quickly break at the switch connection. These don't have the switch and I wear them wires to the rear with the cinch close to my scalp and the wires drop right into my collar. No whiplash on the wires so they should last a long time. I'm working on finding a remote switch so I can pause my music and adjust volume without digging out my iPhone. Lot's of options there, will try and post an update when I come up with one. I'm very pleased with how these worked out. Update 7/3/17: Using these frequently and they work flawlessly, still extremely pleased with them. Found a remote switch and functionality was greatly improved when riding in a group as it allows pausing my music without removing an earbud or digging out my phone when I want to speak to someone. Won't disclose the product here yet because it is defective and I have requested a replacement."
2596,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The SE215 are good earphones, no doubt, but the bluetooth implementation on this cable is terrible. With my phone 2 feet away I get dropouts and, I can't believe this still happens in 2018, the music SPEEDS UP! There is nothing worse for music than speeding up, I'll take a pause or a dropout any day, but making a vocal that I love sound like the Alvin and the Chipmunks is just awful, I'd rather not hear the song if the playback rate can't be kept constant. So these had to go back. I got the Mee Audio X8 instead and the bluetooth is much, much better."
2597,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound of these IEMs is disappointing in my opinion. In this review I will compare them to a much cheaper pair of Audio Technica CKS55. The IEMs were tested on a FiiO DAC and on a regular laptop port. While these are definitely better than a pair of Beats or Bose, I only find them marginally better than the cheaper ATH-CKS55. Sound quality wise, the Shure SE215 have a relatively neutral sound, with no genre of music sounding any better than others in my opinion. This is good if you like listening to many different genres, but if you only listen to a couple you may be better served looking for headphones which best fit those genres. I primarily listen to EDM and occasionally metal which the ATH-CKS55 are quite good at. The neutral sound of the Shure seemed to take away from the basslines and drum rhythms from the electronic music, though metal and rock sounded excellent with them. Rap and pop sounded very good along with EDM, but no particular genre made these headphones shine. There are plenty of included earpieces to find a comfortable fit, though the headphones are not good for taking in and out often due to the way in which they wrap around the ear. The earbuds are detachable allowing for easy cable replacement if it gets damaged, and the clear casing looks very nice. Overall these are very nice headphones, however the price tag seems too high for what you get."
2598,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay. I've owned the wired SE215s since 2010, and have been waiting for a Bluetooth version. The early reviews of these had me a bit worried, but the only thing waiting did was waste time in getting these IEMs in my ears.

They sound identical to my wired SE215s (albeit from the same compressed streaming sources). No problems with Bluetooth at all. Also, not sure if it's just with my Pixel 2 XL, but the phone shows you battery level. I need to try these headphones with other/older devices to see if this shows up. I was also worried that the cable with the battery and control pods would be heavy, but no issues for me yet.

Overall, if you are a fan of this style of Shure headphones, don't hesitate."
2599,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Was turned off by shure in past. Goofy ear fit, goofy behing the ear wire management, crappy cables, crappy foam buds, and wayyy overhyped. I go through a set of buds once a year and they all cost about 100 bucks. These Shures are better constructed and the included bud choices are excellent. Although the buds can be detached from the wires I havent had any issues with them detaching on their own or with connection interference. The sound is spot on for its price range. Far better than the Shure's of years ago.
BTW I do NOT baby these earphones and theyre holding up just fine and the fit is very very good."
2600,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, great implementation. I haven't tried the Shure 535, but I was originally going to purchase them. I figured I'd give these a go due to the much lower price and good reviews. I was not disappointed."
2601,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to test them out with the in-ear monitor that we use in my band and I was extremely impressed with the sound quality. The sound field is extensive and very nicely balanced in the hi, mid & low frequencies. The bass is punchy and solid without overpowering the other frequencies which, as a drummer, is very important to me. The fit in and around the ear is excellent and provides excellent sound isolation so you hear what's in the ear monitor without being distracted by ambient sound. I let my bass player try them and he absolutely loved them. I also have a pair of Sony MDR7550 pro audio ear monitors which are awesome but, I'll tell you, for the price, you cannot beat these. They are very well designed and the detachable cord is a big plus. I will definitely be buying a few more sets of these! Shure really hit a home run with these bad boys."
2602,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought to use these in a shop that requires hearing protection. I've tries a few different pairs of headphones that advertise noise isolation and they always come up short. These provide great noise isolation and sound fantastic. Try out a few different sizes of the plugs to figure out what fits right, if they are uncomfortable then you probably have the wrong plugs on. Highly recommend these headphones."
2603,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I won't go into a long rambling review on these headphones. Bottom line is, they are worth the sub-100 dollar price. The bass is a little lacking, but very well balanced to the overall tonal quality of the ear buds. As a comparison, I also have the Velodyne V-pulse ear buds, and the bass in the V-pulse is much better, but the Shure's are a step above in midrange and high's compared to the V-pulse. This is a great overall value for Shure ear buds. If I had it to do over again I probably would have stepped up to the SE315's."
2604,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These sounded great during the first use. But when I tried to change the earphone tip, the plastic post snapped. This was on the first night of ownership.

I ended up returning them and going with a different brand that uses a metal post."
2605,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start out by saying that the Shure SE215 saved me. I've been having a lot of problems with my recordings and finding the right monitor balance because my headsets just don't block out enough noise and my other pair of earbuds don't stay in. These earbuds block out a lot more noise than I expected, the lows/highs balance is perfect, and you can't yank these out. Once they're in, they're in. I highly recommend these.

My one and only problem with these is changing out the sleeves. I haven't take off the medium black foam sleeves that came already on these things because I was afraid of breaking them. It seems that if I go to change them, they won't come off. I really don't want to break these and put 100 dollars down the drain. I'm happy with the sleeves that are on there now but if I ever need to change them, it may be a problem. I would appreciate comments on the best way to remove the sleeves without breaking the earbuds. Thanks."
2606,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bottom line is you've got to spend quite a bit of money to get a pair of earbuds with significantly better sound quality than these, and then you'll also have to buy a dedicated amplifier to really get the most out of them so, this is just about as good as it gets in these price range.

This little wonder from Shure deliver poweful bass and rich, creamy mids that will put to shame many other similarly (or higher) priced options. The highs could be a tad better, but then again you'd have to spend more in a multi-driver model to get top quality in every range, IMHO.

For those who are considering buying a pair of ""real"" earphones for their portable music devices, let me tell you, go for it! You won't be dissapointed, you guys just don't know how good your iPhone/iPod, Galaxy, or whatever device you use really is until you've tested it with a pair of decent ear pieces instead of the lousy ones that come included with them."
2607,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really great sounding earphones - big improvement over my Shure E3s. Wish I would've got'em long ago.
Using with a Shure PSM400 in-ear system.
Using the included medium black foam sleeves - fit snug for great bass, and stay in! (Used the yellow foam sleeves for ages, they worked good but these much better)
Two other band members got'em also -- they are very happy too."
2608,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had countless headphones from Apple, jlab, Bose, Sony etc. Hands down these are the best for the price. The foam is 100% moldable to any ear. The cord is robust and strong with an oversized jack that fits through most cases. The sound is impeccable. Clear at any volume. I wear them 3+ hours a day and my ears aren't sore."
2609,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work fantastically!
I've owned a pair of Shure's in the past, however these blow my old pair out of the water.
The foam cushions are my go-to when I want to ignore the world.
my hour commute on the train almost feels too short; whether I'm watching a movie, listening to music, or reading a book, time seems to move quicker, it's much nicer when you don't have to listen to the constant nosies that accompany public transportation.
be warned however: while the noise cancelling feature is nice, it can also potentially be dangerous, you will not be able to hear anything around you, so you should be extra cautious when crossing streets, or walking home."
2610,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these as provided in-ear monitors at some of the places that I've drummed. The main church that I play at provides the model a few steps better than these and sounds even better. If you want a pair of quality ear buds or want a budget-friendly in-ear monitor solution, this will do the trick.

Also, as others have said.. Give them a break-in period before developing an opinion. When you get them, just plug them into your iPod overnight with songs going at medium volume. That should do the trick."
2611,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like to listen to music when I ride my motorcycle, especially on long trips. I went through many different earbuds from different manufacturers before buying these. I wish I would have found these first. The music fidelity is good, most of the wind noise gets blocked out and I can still hear surrounding noises to respond to traffic. I bought the replacement cable so I could adjust the volume or turn off the music."
2612,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It takes some getting used to to put these on correctly, and after about a week of use, I still struggle a little to put them on in the dark. Also, the included ear tips didn't fit me very well, medium was a bit too small and the large was a bit too large. I also purchased Comply Tx100 at the same time and with Comply ear tips, all is grand. I had been using Klipsch S4 for a few years until my new puppy chewed them up. These are definitely a step up from Klipsch S4. Twice as expensive as S4, but I feel it's worth it. I had them on during a business trip and they were comfortable and blocked almost all of the airplane noise. I also have Bose QC15 and they are awesome at canceling airplane engine noise, but a bit too bulky and does not block out crying babies. For $100, can't beat the price or the sound quality."
2613,3.0 out of 5 stars,FYI there is a manual in the case - hopefully this will save you some anxiety when figuring out how to put these in your ear. The buds are not labeled L and R. I felt like I ruined the earbud foam when changing them out for a different size but it popped back into shape after a few minutes. Not sure what I expected after testing them outside and listening to cars drive by but they seem to work better with a tighter in-ear seal.
2614,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is very good. They seem a little more bass heavy than the SE210's they are replacing, but have a relatively balanced response. These definitely sound better than any $10-20 headphones I've ever heard. The wireform near the earphones helps provide a secure fit even during exercise. It takes a little getting used to the over-the-ear fit if it's something you aren't used to, but are fine once you get used to it. The variety of eartips help ensure you get a good fit and do a good job of blocking out sound. The cable seems to be relatively heavy-duty while still flexible. There is some cable noise, but is far from a problem. The replaceable cable is an interesting (and I believe good) idea, but is kind of difficult to get the cable properly snapped into the earphones. Thankfully this is something that you will probably rarely do. Overall I would recommend these earphones if you are looking for something in this price range."
2615,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My biggest concern with earbuds was sound quality, fit, and noise isolation. These literally are the only earbuds I've seen that do all 3 successfully. If you are still using Apple's earphones and you switch to these your mind will be blown. I used Apple's earbuds one time since 2008 and knew they were terrible, but the problem with most other sets is the fit (i.e. always falling out).

The design of these earbuds is awkward at first, but you get used to it, and once you find the bud that fits your ear you will experience some of the best noise isolation I've experienced (closed headphones included). These went from my every day earbuds for commuting / work / beach, but now they are replacing my Grado SR80s for home use as well.

If you're debating whether not to get these, just do it already. They're light, they sound great, noise isolation is excellent, fit is excellent, and the best part is that they're cheap for the quality.

Only complaint I have is the removal of the ear buds, that was a pain in the ass, but, by default they give you the medium size so you should know right away if you need to swap at all, go bigger, or go smaller; so you should only have to do that once."
2616,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far just from having them a few days, I’m seriously impressed. I didn’t expect the quality of noise isolation from them. They come with several sized plugs, as well as both foam ones and rubber ones. I prefer the foam, as they work like earplugs, expanding in the ear and allowing noise isolation. The cord can be bent to conform to the ear, and it feels high quality. Great bang for the buck, hopefully they continue to be such high quality with use. Very happy!"
2617,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounds and changing the modes of my hp music I get to hear the diff. settings very well.
Good bass and clarity overall and seals were superb.
Fits lightly and easily into ear. Cables are a bit rough to handle perhaps but this could be good to avoid entanglement.
Bought this to compare with my UE at similar price [100usd]. this is much better and wished I got this first!!!
Great entry model for musicians and audiophiles.
I use this for studio drumming and church playing (boxed up drumset)."
2618,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, these earphones are great sounding. Good bass and a very accurate reproduction of the music that I listen to when I drum. The only reason for three stars is that the sound isolating ear tips don't stay in my ears when I'm drumming. I've tried different sizes and different combinations of ear tips, but haven't really been able to remedy the situation. They're a bit clumsy to put into my ears and for whatever reason the right earphone consistently falls out. If you use these to simply listen to music, they'll be fantastic. For drum-along, they didn't work for me very well."
2619,3.0 out of 5 stars,"While the sound quality is superior to many in its class: crisp and clear. I find myself preferring a far cheaper design when moving around, bending over, etc. where the controls are on the earpiece. This is because the controls on these flap around too much. Fine for a walk, but not loud enough and out of the way for much else."
2620,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros
-Great sound (I'm going to ignore specifics, there are plenty of reviews on that)
-Awesome, Awesome, Awesome cord. Seriously, this is the best cord I have ever seen
-Good carrying case
-moderately good selection of eartips (the meelectronics mi-6 hi-fi's have 6 pairs that are all very different, these are all very similar)
Con
-the foam eartips are incredibly hard to get off and look pretty bad after being used. I much prefer the silicone tips.

Overall, these are very worth it"
2621,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best buds I've owned...stay in place and sound great when out and about. Wouldn't recommend to audiophiles using in a sound isolated space - they're probably not perfect, just good enough for most people in environments with background noise."
2622,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones! I purcchased them several months ago now, and I've enjoyed using them as daily users, gym usage, and isolating when studying. The design is great for staying around the ears. The cable is thick and durable and does not have a lot of noise when on clothing nor does it have a lot of wire memory. The sound is balanced with a nice lean to the heavy end to my ears. I love my bass heavy music, but these do a good job of accurately reproducing music without being murky. I have noticed that sometimes the connection on a ear gets loose, but simply pushing the cable back into the ear set solves the problem. :)"
2623,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, comes with different size foam inserts. You have to pull hard to get them off, be careful. They block out most of the outside. I use them on long flights for movies and music. Also use them while playing in a band to hear the monitor feeds, they work really well. I also like that the cable can be replaced when it breaks, the headphone part rarely does."
2624,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This model sounds excellent. It provides balanced, rich representation of Rock, EDM and classical music, as well as spoken content on podcasts. The bass is clear and deep but not overly pronounced. The high frequencies sound really clear and are balanced well by the mids. Finally, the build quality is better than any portable music equipment I've ever tried. I hope to enjoy these on the go for a long time."
2625,4.0 out of 5 stars,"All I can say is WOW! These Earphones are incredible! I use them for causally Drumming and they cancel almost all the noise I make. I can almost hear nothing then I put these on. The sound quality on the other hand is nothing too special in my opinion. At $99 this earphones is great at noise cancelling better than most headphones I ever wore, but the sound quality is average. If you are looking for sound quality I would recommend Sennheiser."
2626,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are fantastic! Previous reviews are correct, it takes a bit to get the fit right, but there are plenty of ear bud options with the unit. It also take a bit getting used to the way they insert, by wrapping around the ear, but once you get used to it, it's really nice and keeps them secure in the ear. I am a bit of an audiophile and have a Linn british HiFi at home with great clarity, so I am usually very disappointed by in ear products. I ride motorcycle on long trips, and so far these are fabulous. With previous in ear units, I would have to have a significant volume to over come the wind noise in my helmet, but with these and the noise cancellation, I can really reduce the volume, and with the way they fit, they stay secure easily putting the helmet on and off. Sturdy construction, nice long cord. One of the best purchases I have made in a long time. If you're looking for a quality in ear headphone under $100.00, look no further, GET THESE!"
2627,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, these sound decent. The clarity is what I would expect from a $100 pair of in ear headphones. The real reason I don't give it more stars is because I can't stand the 64"" cable. I prefer working out with in-ear monitors and the cable is just way too long for me to put my phone in my pocket while I work out. I end up getting it caught on just about anything. I thought about upgrading the microphone/remote cable, but after seeing the horrible reviews on those, I'm thinking I'm just going to return these and get something else."
2628,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to use the Westone UM1s. I broke them (my fault). I tried a pair of Shire 315s and really liked them, but they weren't in the budget. So I ordered the 215s and hoped for the best. I love them. They fit so tightly I can barely hear anything not routed through the monitor. For the first time ever I'm asking the sound engineer for drums. The sound is solid and clear. They're capable of producing more volume than what is probably necessary. They seem rugged enough to last too. Perfect."
2629,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: great sound for the price, sturdy construction.

Cons: not comfortable at first, takes a while to break them in, earbuds not small enough for my ears, wires are stiff and not tangle free"
2630,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It sounds very good. Not too much treble or too much bass. I really like the sturdy wire that doesn't tangle. Once you learn how to perfectly insert them into your ear canal, the sound that you get has a value of about $200. One downside is if you have them on too long you will hesitate to take them off because then you will have to reposition them. They cannot be stored in the black case they come with...it is too small. Unlike the ad shows, you have to place them over your ears."
2631,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best headphones I have ever worn, bar none. I've had them for about 2 years now, and they work as well as ever. They haven't even shown the first sign of falling apart or decreased sound quality. How they sit in your ear took a couple of weeks to get used to, but now I prefer it to a 'regular' fitting earbud. On a sound front, They've got great bass, but they balance all of the elements of sound well, unlike the beats I had before.

If you're on the edge of buying these or not, do it. I promise you will not regret it."
2632,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow.
That's really all I can say about these magnificent earphones. These beasts are perfect regarding sound quality, durability, and sound-isolation.

SOUND ISOLATION
The sound-isolation is off the charts incredible. These earphones can block out the loudest of sounds including a go-kart engine and even a rock concert. This may be only because my ears can fit perfectly. The earbuds I use on the earphone is the foam-tip earbuds because They provide excellent fitting.

DURABILITY
I read many other review regarding the bulkiness of the cord, but I found it comforting knowing that the cord will almost never break on you. Sure, they can break sometime, everything can, but they can easily be replaced by another cord for $20-30. So far they haven't really provides a problem for me.

SOUND QUALITY
If you have read other reviews, you will have heard that they sound excellent, and I am here to say they sound magnificently astounding. I did an A and B test with. Skullcandy 50/50, Skullcandy Titans, and Audio Technica ATH-PRO5MK2CM headphones, and all of them, above $50, sounded shallow and muddy compared to the Shure se215. The sound changed drastically, and I applaud Shure for this. I'm surprised they retailed these earphones at $100 because they have the quality of the regular $200 price tag.

Overall great sound and isolation. Most people don't like the cord, but I certainly do."
2633,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound damn good and they really really do block out sound with the foam ear tips ime, but I feel like Ive had much more dynamic sounding car stereo setups before. Maybe it was the quality of the audio files I consumed? I'm sure they will sound a bit better with higher quality files though. I feel like agent Smith while walking around with these things on in public because they look so amazing and unique imo."
2634,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earphones for my daughter as she is an aspiring worship leader and plays in the student praise band at our church. Since I use a pair of my own, I already knew the fidelity was top notch, clean highs, good bass response, noise cancelling, all the things you need on stage running IEMs. I highly recommend this product. You could spend three times what you spend on these and not improve the over sound quality appreciably. Go with these and keep your money."
2635,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought these earphones to use when I drum. After having them for some time now, I want to say that these are great! work great at insulating the sound of the drums in my ears. I like how they feel around my ears, and have no problem with them! music coming thru them sounds great! I always wanted a great pear of earphones for drumming with, now I got them! and I am happy! get these if you are tight on budget. these earphones are AMAZING for this price! I would recommend these!"
2636,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound pretty good , I use them with motorcycle so with the ambient noise its a little hard to notice quality. a little tricky to put on , but once you get it right they reduce noise more than any ear plugs i ever tried , I really had doubts about the advertised NRR , but it must be true or close to that.
I can have them on for about an hour before they start to cause pain , might be the pressure from my tight fit helmet or the large size foams I use but that the compromise for the noise reduction."
2637,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price they are alright. The sound isolation is good but the quality of the sound is a bit dull. The highs are rolled off on these headphones making everything sound a bit soft. Low and mid response sound fine but for the money, i'd definitely look into a different pair. The cable is also very very long making it a pain if you're just listening to music on your phone or iPod. Running or exercise with these on? Forget it.."
2638,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
Sound quality is terrific with very crisp highs and very clear, if a little shallow, bass
The cable is detachable. In my experience, the ear buds will last well beyond the life of the cables
Wide variety of ear tips made finding a tight seal very easy
Great passive noise cancellation (If you find the right ear tip)
No sound leak at all. Crank these bad lads up without annoying those around you
Cons:
Does not play well with moisture. I wouldn't suggest working out (I broke a pair after about a month at the gym)
Some may find the over-ear cable design to be a tad wonky
Cable lacks remote (In-line remote cables are available though)
Summary:
I have owned earbuds from Beats, Bose, Etymotic, Klipsch, Monster, etc. The SE215's are my favorite buds of all time, and the last pair that came close in terms of sound quality and durability were the Shure SE210's. While the sound recreation is stellar on the mids and highs, heavy-bass lovers may find the 215's to be lackluster. Do yourself a favor, end the search, and just get a pair of these."
2639,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product works as described. With the proper size/shape ear-piece, this product will provide great noise-isolation and produce a wonderful range.

A interesting note, if you play a song that has a lot of bass and the sound quality is poor, you likely have a poor seal and will experience less sound isolation and worse audio performance as a result. Be sure to try all the ear fitting to find which works best for you!"
2640,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic range and durability. The cord is longer than I'm used to, around 4.8' which can be cumbersome to manage if you're using it for mobile phone use as I am. The thick cord also has a tendency to stiffen in the cold, which can make unexpected difficulties in adjusting the cords position during activities."
2641,3.0 out of 5 stars,They were the poorest wireless headphones I have ever had they weren’t even worth half the money that I spent on them twice they are not sweat resistant and shorted out making them useless
2642,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound quality. The most impressive part is how well they stand behind their product, I had to send them in, and they were back quickly and without any hassle. Excellent work. (great for motorcycling, low profile, get the in ear style tips)"
2643,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a staple in the music performance category. If you are playing live music and your band has in-ear monitor capability, these are the go-to headphones without breaking the bank too much. They have great sound isolation and I find the sound quality is true and raw rather than being colored with tons of bass or something like that, which will give you a false sense of how you and the band sounds."
2644,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good set of earphones. I was using them in a church band thru a monitor system. First time I used this kind of system and boy was it nice. Did have floor monitors blaring us so we could hear our instruments. The tip that comes with it isn't the best at sound isolation, it was adequate. I bought some triple flange sleeve but I haven't figured out how to change the tips. I found instruction but I just feel like I'm going to break something. I'm sure I'll figure it out, but guess they won't fall out."
2645,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I admit I'm no headphone connoisseur, but nonetheless I have not been really pleased with the sound quality. I often like to tailor my musical experience by genre (i.e. change intensities of various frequencies) and have found that from very low bass (e.g. hip hop) to very high pitches (e.g. classical music), these headphones have performed pretty well. In terms of sound isolation, they work extremely well and allow me to tune out really easily when needed. Lastly, I LOVE that they wrap around my ears - this means that I can actually wear them and walk around without them falling our of my ears (a big problem for me given my big ears.).

Overall, highly recommended for the given price point."
2646,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The detachable joint between the earphone and the audio cable was not machined properly and is loose on my right side. As a result, the earphone can rotate freely at this point which allows the earbud to wiggle out of my ear. This issue is exacerbated when exercising. I will not purchase another product from Shure. Do not recommend for exercise.

Sad to see quality audio packaged in a poorly manufactured product."
2647,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, these are better than I expected! Amazing sound, great sound isolation, and they are extremely comfortable also once you get the hang of putting them in! I previously owned the Klipsch Image S4s and these blow them out of the water sound wise. Build quality is also top notch. I love that the foam tips are difficult to remove as I've always had issues with them popping off and getting lost in the past with other earphones. I also love that the wire can be replaced without buying a whole new set as that is usually the weakest link. The only downside is that now all of my other speakers sound terrible in comparison :)"
2648,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Hey, we all hear what we hear, eh? Eh?

Not bad, but not as good as a hunnit bucks. I have skull titans (discontinued - $40) that sound about as good to me. I bought these to wear under a motorcycle helmet and although they're a PITA to wind around and into your ears, they do afford a halfway comfortable fit as long as you manage the cord out of the way. I'll probably spring for something with as flat of a profile, but wireless when I break these or run out of patience."
2649,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok sound, sub par reliability and expensive replacement parts. I bought these about four months ago. First the flexible earfitting wire in the cable broke, which just made them a little less comfortable. Then the cable itelf stopped working for one side. No problem! I thought I bought interchangeable earbuds for a reason!. I looked online to see the replacement cable was $30 a little to rich for me, I bought some cheaper ones on ebay for half the price. They of course broke which is not the fault of shure, however it is their fault that the plug in one of the earbuds broke, rendering one earbud totally useless. The replacements are almost the price of the full set, so I didn't bother. I first bought these hoping they would be durable enough for me, but the very thing which I had hoped would solve this problem--interchangable parts became to issue due to the clunky unreliable earbud-plug mechanism."
2650,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to be my knock-around IEMs (workouts and so on) and was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality. Very nice bass and overall presence alongside good sound isolation makes them ideal for busy environments. But what I can't get past is just how badly they fit... Everyone's ears are different but I've had many different IEMs over the years and these are the first that ever actually hurt. I can't wear them for more than maybe 30-45 minutes without having to take a break since they've rubbed my outer ear raw, the driver is just too long. The overly long and badly positioned memory-wire doesn't help since to get it into a useful position it will then force the back of the IEMs harder into your skin.

Bottom line: very good sound quality for the money, but depending on your ear size/shape you might be in for a painful experience."
2651,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice sounding Bluetooth cable, SE215 headsets sound good. I use the cable with my SE535 units. The combinations is great and I have a pair of cheaper earphones to use as wired units."
2652,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't wear earbuds. If they fit my left ear they don't fit my right ear.

These fit both ear perfectly and are comfortable for up to two hours. After that I need a little break. They also stay put when running.

Sound is Excellent! I haven't tried any $150 plus IEMs but these beat the pants off everything at lower price points. Good clarity and a wide sound stage for such a small design. Its not as punchy in the base as I'd like but the mids and highs are distinct and crystal clear.

Although the base is very much affected by how far I push the rubber part into my ear. Too far and it sounds basier but gets uncomfortable fast.

I lost 1 pair and bought a replacement about a week later. Couldn't be without them and wasn't willing to risk buying a competitor."
2653,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tricky at first, but second nature to wear after about a week or two. Full disclosure, my ears did hurt during the first week wearing these 24/7 (I really mean 24/7, I'm doing 10,000 hours of language exposure), but after the first week my ears can handle them mostly all the time (some one-ear usage with shifting which ear gets them). Also full disclosure, I'm not a musical performer, I'm only listening to a device with them so if you're getting these to perform on a stage ALWAYS WEAR BOTH OR YOU'LL DESTROY YOUR HEARING. Otherwise, just listening to second language exposure, it's fine to just listen to one unless you like your music loud, then beware your ""need"" to turn up the volume since one ear vs. two ears makes a ~6 decibel difference.

I also get compliments that they look pretty cool.

4,000 hours with these so far."
2654,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Their sound is very good, as advertised. Noise isolation is good. However, the comfort level for me is not very good. I have trouble with the stiff wire that curls around the ear. It's uncomfortable and sticks out like I have antennas on my head. The rubber ear sleeves, even though I keep them clean, cause irritation and itching like no other earphone I have owned before."
2655,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I initially wanted to spend much more on some of the higher end buds from Monster, Sony or even Shure, but I settled on a budget of around $100 to replace a pair of Sonys that cost me about that much six years ago. I decided on these after reading reviews. The first thing I noticed was the more substantial, thick cord. It seems like it will be less susceptible to breaking down and also tangling like the thin cord on the Sonys did.

These earbuds come with a good amount of accessories for fitting and storage. There is a baggie of different ear tips made of silicone and foam. The medium sized foam tips that were already installed seemed to fit great right out of the box and I'm not sure that I will even bother trying anything else. The foam tips seem to create a much better seal than the silicone tips on the Sonys I had...and they stay put. Because of this, the bass response is quite good and the noise isolation is noticeable. Additionally, they come with a zippered soft case. The case is good quality and will be great for storage and travel as I frequently transport my headphones in my gym bag, to work and when travelling.

I am no audiophile, but I wanted something that is above average in terms of quality and sound. For $100 these were definitely worth it. Time will tell how good the quality really is, but I have the feeling that these will last for quite a few years."
2656,4.0 out of 5 stars,"All I have to say is I got what I paid for. Just a minor inconvenience and that would be that it doesn't seem to hold well when I do calls and play music. It distorted my music, but the call seemed to still do well. Android users won't like that the volume buttons don't actually do much of their functions. I'm sure it works fine with iPhone users, but it seems to lack features when it comes to Android users."
2657,2.0 out of 5 stars,"took a while to figure out how to wear them comfortably. I had just got to the point where I was starting to like them when the left headphone died. I would expect that kind of behavior out of a cheap set of $10 headphones, but these were way too expensive to die in 1 1/2 months. I would have only given them 1 star, but when they worked they were nice.

The support team was very responsive. I returned them and had a replacement ear bud very quickly. The only problem was that shortly after getting a the replacement ear bud, the other one died. Very unhappy when an expensive product like this fails."
2658,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just realized I've used this for 5+ hours a week at the gym for 2.5 years. The right earbud is starting to skip, so I wanted to see how long I've had them... No idea why it's starting to skip --- just old probably.. Great product. Lasted way longer than any other earbuds I've ever had. If Shure reads this and hooks me up with a replacement pair, I'd be like, ""bro thank you"""
2659,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In one word, amazing. I use these while riding my motorcycle, and not only do they block out the wind noise, they sound incredible. I am an audiophile at heart, and modified my helmet radio to accept earbuds. I've tried many different options, but these are the best. Comfortable, excellent sound, and low profile."
2660,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these headphones because I am a professional musician who often needs to transcribe music from audio recordings. I need something that provides clarity and fine detail so that I can pick apart the many parts of the music. These headphones do an exceptional job! They have a great deal of bass to the sound but it isn't mushy. I've only taken one star away because the headphones are kind of a pain to put onto my ears. It is sort of a process getting these headphones on properly. Maybe there is just a learning curve...
2661,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an earlier model of the same earphones and loved the sound and fit. through extensive use and years of wear they eventually lost some functionality. I have since tries Beats, Denon, Sony, Marley, and have QC Bose over the ear. I my opinion Shure has the best sound quality and construction. I am not has hyped up has most people are with Bose and thought in ear/active noise cancellation and sound from the Denon set was better but Shure is my favorite by far"
2662,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound at a reasonable price. When I first turned them on I had the audio cutting in and out. Reconnected the cable to the ear pieces and that fixed it. I am very impressed the soundstage of these IEM's.
2663,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After only three months, the right headphone only works when the connection between the cord and headphone is in a few specific spots. After paying around $100 last year, I expected these headphones to last me around a year before breaking. I'm not sure if I buying a new cord would fix this problem. There is nothing visually wrong with the cord, headphone, or connection."
2664,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did some research before buying the Shure SE215, reading reviews of various earbud products on Amazon and on blog sites devoted to reviewing products like these. Although I had heard of Shure products before (microphones, specifically), I had not heard of Shure earbuds prior to my research. Based upon that research, I bought the SE215.

This is a great product. I am not an 'audio-phile' but the sound is spectacular, perhaps even as good as my Bose Q15 ANR headphones. Some reviews spoke about difficulty bending them around the ears. Either these folks were paid by another company to write something bad or they are just too inept to use any product - please keep knives away from these folks! I had them out of the box and in my ears within minutes and I have never had a problem with them.

Other folks claimed, likely also disingenuously, that they would not stay in their ears. Before the Shure SE215, I never had earbuds that stayed in my ears. They all fell out, including the Bose earbuds. (Nothing against Bose, they make great products, but their earbuds did not stay in my ears.) The Shure SE215's stick like glue. They have never fallen out. In fact, they fit so securely, that when walking, the vibrations from ones feet can be heard. Some might consider this a problem, but it will be the same with every set of earbuds that fit securely.

Great product - I highly recommend them."
2665,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are excellent IEMs for the price, I don't have a large amount of experience with other in ear monitors but the sound through these is crisp and clear. The bass reproduction is pretty good, it's not too heavy at a neutral level without any enhancements but they can give a nice big clean amount of low end if you increase the low frequencies. One complaint I have is that the foam sleeves that come with the monitors are very difficult to remove, luckily they fit me fairly well so I haven't bothered with them too much. Also, I would recommend getting the black ones, it's very difficult to see the left and right letters on the clear ones which I bought. Overall though, a great product from Shure!"
2666,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to replace my Shure SE-110 earbuds. They were fantastic, but years of hard use had finally taken them to the breaking point. The SE215s arrived in the retail packaging, though it was a bit scuffed up. The package contains the earbuds, carrying case, 4 or 5 sets of different sized foam and rubber ear pads, and a cleaning tool.

The first thing I noticed about these is that they addressed all the flaws of my previous set. The cable on my old pair frayed and broke where they curved over your ears. They have added a reinforced rubber sleeve at that location to prevent it. On the old pair, if they cable broke anywhere, your headphones were trashed. The SE215's now have a disconnect at the earbud so that if the cable breaks you don't have to trash the drivers.

Sound quality is great, if you're coming from cheap earbuds to these, you'll hear things in your music that you didn't even know were there before. I look forward to many good years of use out of these."
2667,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these. Really solid seal for isolation - you won't hear anything around you. I use them when flying and usually can't hear anything around me including the overhead announcements. My only complaint would be that the foam pieces are extremely difficult to get off. I haven't been able to remove mine to try a different size ... everything attempt I've had, I have felt like I was going to break them. Other than that, very good sound quality and overall great product."
2668,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved these ear buds.
The cord is really long but you get used to it. Very solid build.
I love that I can replace the ear bud part of the headset that usually fails first. I love to foam ear pieces.
I've read that the replacement cable is sub-par/in mic option which is a little scary as I might need to replace that part soon.
Beats (gaga/diddy/lebrons) I've tried them all and they all failed in a years time. Finally gave up on them.The Shures SO MUCH BETTER. The sound quality is incomparable. Crisp high notes and the bass isn't lost either. No excess sound gets in."
2669,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great sounding. Only issue is that when singing open jaw for big moments my ear canal closes up and dulls or slightly mutes them, maybe it's just my anatomy. Not sure..."
2670,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After couple of etymotic and klipsch and many more i bought these as a second headphone. Oh my god these are super headphones far better than etymotics hf2s and klipsch s4s. The first minute you will hear the difference mid and lows, the isolation. Nice package, cheap looking case. What did i do? I gave these to my brother order 535 right away. To be honest the 535 did not make the same impact as 215s. I will wait. But at 80-90 dollar range you will get best sound, high build quality, tank like durability. Klipsch s4s feels like a joke compare to shure 215 and they are close in the price range. Go and buy them, you won't regret it."
2671,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After trying to find replacement after replacement for earbuds that just stop working after a year, I decided to buy one with removable cables. The Shure SE215-CL are probably the greatest earbuds I've ever used. Not just in sound quality, but in build quality and sound isolation. I can now ride the NYC subway while playing music at 50% volume without having to worry about surrounding noise. EASILY the best headphone purchase ever."
2672,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super great sound quality, super comfortable to wear; super great ability to separate the headphone from the original chord and reconnect it to a different one if your cat decides she needs a midnight snack. I'm not a hugely careful person and used to break or overuse earbuds into dysfunction within a year- not these guys! They'll take a couple smashes and smacks (though, don't do this intentionally!) before they give up. Definitely worth the cost if audio and durability are high priorities."
2673,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound was just ok in these earbuds but the comfort and ease of putting them in my ear was lacking. Positioning the wire to go behind the ear was annoying, but once it's there it stays. I take my headphones in and out frequently, making this style really inconvenient. The foam inserts are really difficult to swap out for the other inserts. Sound isolation was excellent though, just too bad it did not work out."
2674,2.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones themselves are the tried and true se-215's but the BT adapter is mediocre. Don't quite expect mediocre product from Shure. Problem is that signal cuts out occasionally.
2675,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is great but I am having a hard time getting them in my ears correctly. I wear glasses and have to be careful in taking them off. I caught my glasses arm and broke it off. I wish they would just go straight into my ear and not have to wrap around behind and on top.
2676,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, just as I was about to give up on earphones or earbuds and stick with headphones, I decided to give these a try. I've always hated earphones/earbuds because they never seem to fit my ears right. When I saw these, it sounded like the foam used in the construction of the earbud made a much more formed fit. More like foam ear plugs for hearing protection.

I attend loud concerts regularly, play drums, and shoot guns too), so I'm pretty familiar with hearing protection. Now that I've found these Shure earbuds, I will never go back to another line of earphones/headphones. These little isolating earphones are just what I needed. I can use them not only for listening to my iPod, but I can even use them for sound monitoring with the drums.

The package comes with a nice array of accessories. Plenty of sizes of ear pieces, and a nice quality little soft pouch. Fitting them in and wrapping the cord over your ear is something I'll have to get used to. It took me a few minutes to figure it out, but then it fit great. The sound is good. A little bass-heavy, but I'd rather have too much bass than not enough (can always use the EQ bass reducer on the iPod). I think my Bose headphones are still better for hi-fi at home. With these Shure earphones, I ordered the white/clear/silver color rather than the black. In hindsight, I should have ordered the black. I thought the clear would blend-in with my clothing and skin and therefore look less noticeable. But because of the translucent cable and the fact that it's both silver and copper wire underneath, it actually draws more attention. Almost looks like jewelry. Face it: Because of the design of these, people are either going to think you're hard of hearing and wearing a hearing aid, or you're a rock star and wired for the big stadium show.

A couple of words of caution: As another review said, these little babies seriously do isolate you. Now, maybe on a subway that's a good thing. You can get lost in your little world listening to music or an audio book on a commute. Or maybe in your dorm room studying or meditating with some nice ambient music on. But honestly these earphones would be absolutely dangerous to use while jogging or riding a bike. You'll hear nothing but the music. No care horns. No police chase. No rabid dogs chasing you. Sorry if I'm stating the obvious, but these earphones really are like wearing deafening hearing protection. Another related issue: If you're listening to soft or quiet music and you're moving around, you'll hear every foot step you take, every burp, every breath, every Dorito you eat, and all the jostling of your body. That's just the nature of the beast when you plug your ears totally up. Last thing to mention: Make sure to set the max volume limit on your iPod before you plug these earphones in. If you're not careful, you'll blast your eardrums more with these plugs than with over-the-ear vented headphones.

Solid recommendation on these earphones. Just be careful where/how you wear them."
2677,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a nice set of earphones. They perform as I expected. The quility seems to be a step up from my last pair of Shure E2-Cs. The part of the cord that wraps around the ear is now reinforced which makes me think it will last longer. The sound isolation is very good. The inserts are made of coated memory foam. They sound great too.
2678,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Living in New York can get very loud, especially if your near the train, i bought these because i never give earbuds a chance in my life. So these seem good for my price range. And wow are they a huge step compared to the muddy as hell Skullcandy Supreme Earbuds. I have to say, the price is worth it, and the case it has comes in handy as if i need to put them away, ill be safe about using these headphones and put them in the case."
2679,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had purchased the Shure SE530 some years ago. The cabling finally wore out and they were done. They were quite wonderful and short of putting to hi-fi speakers to my ears, nothing compared. I thought about a reshell, but decided to try these. The sound quality of these SE215's is nearly equal. It was a little tricky learning how to wear them (several times until I grasped the concept), but no issues now. I primarily use them for workouts, walks, etc. I also have a pair of Klipsch S4-II, which does not have quite the sound quality, but are a good second."
2680,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had 500's but destroyed them on a bike ride, cord got tangled in my wheel & ripped the cord. Well that shouldn't happen with these.... sound's not bad, fit is solid Shure. Best isolation there is, decent bass, clear mids.... I tired the cable with the mic, but didn't see the advantage of $50 just to have a mic. I just speak into the phone.... the only thing is they are expensive for what they are.... headphones....."
2681,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my $50 Ultimate Ears broke within 2 months, I bought these on impulse. The wire on my prior earbuds pretty much tore and the left ear stopped working. Once I read in one of the reviews that these Shure earbuds have a very sturdy wire, I was pretty much sold because I was so mad about my old ones breaking. When I first receives these in the mail, I was quite confused. How do you put them in your ear? I had to read the little manual sheet to realize that the wire goes over and behind your ear, not like most earbuds. I admit, at first, these were a bit awkward to wear, but after a while, you get the hang of it and they slip on your ear perfectly. I love dubstep, so I listen to music with a lot of bass, and these earbuds perform. The wire is also very sturdy, just as the review stated; wire is very strong and won't rip. I definitely recommend these earbuds, they are well worth the three digits."
2682,2.0 out of 5 stars,"One headphone died from faulty wiring after a few months. I purchased these in the vain hope that top of the line headphones would have made their headphone copper wires more than a few micrometers thick, but despite the much thicker wires (which are probably just additional plastic), one earbud has died after 6 months of light use. For $100 consumers should expect better.

The sound quality is good but is not distinguishably better than the Sennheiser CX 300 II, which are a third of the price, last the same time, and are perhaps easier to use (not as bulky in your pocket, no silly around the ear system). For lack of a better option I'd recommend the Sennheisers instead."
2683,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The noise canceling and isolation work so well, I can't hear people talking a few feet away from me. Sound quality is great, with audible bass but not too much. 6 different ear inserts mean it should fit just about anyone, but the standard size has worked for everyone I know. The cable is long, very durable and replaceable. It takes a little getting used to because the cables go forward, then up and over your ears, unlike most earbuds that just dangle."
2684,5.0 out of 5 stars,"clean and neutral sound. Great isolation of noise. If you want a good hifi sound, this is a good choice."
2685,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound good, but don't expect them to last more than 2-3 years. I've had different versions of this level Shure earbud for about ten years now, and all have failed within 3 years. Usually it's the cord. Now the cord is replaceable, so it's less of an expense... but why not just make a product that lasts?

It's a shame, because they sound good."
2686,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are amazing..love the deep bass and the clear sound. I travel frequently for work and once these are in I hear nothing but my music and movies. They are a bit awkward at first but once you ""figure"" out how to wear them you will love them."
2687,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to use as in ear monitors for live playing. (I am a drummer). The sound is good, if you can get the proper fit- I have to use foam inserts and insert them completely in my ears to get adequate bass reproduction.

One major annoyance that I quickly discovered was that if you move around a lot, the rotating connection makes an audible grinding sound when then earphones are fully inserted. This is not a sound emanating from the earphones; it is a physical sensation caused by the rotating connection mechanism that is audible ( when inserted) especially when no sound is being emitted from a sound source. Very annoying. I ordered these as replacements for some E-3's that I used back in 2005 - The E-3's fit way better, and didn't have the annoying grinding sound.

Aside from that, they do sound good- be sure to keep around plenty of fresh foam inserts; If they do not fit snugly in your ears, there is very poor bass response. Conversely, if the fit IS snug, the bass response is fantastic."
2688,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading that these Eapbuds are used by a lot of musicians, I figured that they would be a good investment for $99. Was I ever wrong. When I was able to get around to using these, the right loop that goes up and over the ear has a BAD connection. If usually does not work, but when I do get it in just the right position, it goes out in a few seconds. On top of that, when I do get it working temporarily, my Bass Guitar makes this thing rattle terribly, I tried all kinds of different gain settings on my Tech21 and Alesis NanoCompressor, but I have to have the gain/volume WAY down to keep them from rattling. I then tried a pair of Skull Candy earphones and a $45 set of Audio Technica active earbuds. Neither had this problem. On the Audio Technica earbuds, the volume is probably 2-4 times louder without any rattling like in the Sure SE215-K. These things are terrible. The bad thing is that I wasn't able to try them until after my return time had run out with Amazon. I need to buy another set of the Audio Technica for backup. I like them better than my Bose Active Noise Cancelling in that when the battery goes out in the Bose, there is no sound. With the Audio Technica, I still have sound, just no noise cancelling. I am really disappointed with the Sure. I wonder if I just got a bad pair."
2689,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for an active lifestyle. Ear buds stay in place really well. Pretty decent sound isolation - used them on several military aircraft instead of ear plugs.

The only downside is the really long cord, so not any real problems with it. I looked for a shorter cord since the ear pieces snap on for easy replacement. Still haven't found one, so I end up stuffing the etra cord in my pocket.

This is my 3rd pair of Shure in the last 10 yrs and I'd guess this pair will go quite a distance."
2690,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was speculative on the idea of spending so much money on a pair of headphones. When I received them, I frantically put them on and..

It was like I was taken away to a island where I was being treated with a personal concert.

.. all dramatics aside, this is one of the best IEM's I've bought in the seven years I've been sound engineering. Definite plus on the construction, especially the mold-able ear loop stress reliefs."
2691,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these October 8, 2014. I used to use these for college daily, but now I have been using them daily at night to listen to YouTube videos, then white noise throughout the night to help me sleep. They aren't the most comfortable out there, but they get the job done and I'm able to sleep with them without major discomfort. Soundwise they are good, with the sound leaning a little bit metallic top end, but remember all ears hear differently. I haven't had it short whatsoever and they're as good as new! Hopefully they will last me another 3 years or more."
2692,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are very comfortable and have great sound for the price. They do cut out a lot of sound as well. I use these when playing drums as part hearing protection and part in ear monitor. Can't be beat for the price.
2693,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this wireless connection and would have given it a 5 star rating yesterday. Distance, battery life, ease of use, and sound quality were all great. I used it primarily at the gym matched up with a pair of 425s. Came home from the gym yesterday and went to charge it but the light wouldn’t come on so I took it to another charger in the house where it lit up and seemed to be charging just fine. Went to unplug it this morning and I was shocked when the connector burned my fingers. It was very hot to touch. I had a bad feeling. Sure enough, it no longer turns on. The buttons won’t even depress. I’m gessing the internals melted or swelled. I will include some pictures that show the casing is now warped from the heat. It might be hard to see without a before and after picture but trust me, it’s warped. All this of course happened 10 days after my return window with Amazon closed. I will attempt to work with the Shure warranty department. Will update with progress."
2694,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as an affordable option for in-ear monitors to use on Sundays when I lead worship on stage with my band. I am quite impressed with the sound quality, the noise isolation and the discrete look of these earphones. I've seen other brands at 5 times the price I paid for these and while I'm sure they are worth the extra money, I just can't justify spending that amount with the budget I have to work with. I am very pleased with the case they came with in addition to the varying sizes of ear molds to custom fit them to the consumer. The dynamic range is more than adequate to be able to hear clearly both the high and low frequencies of the various instruments of our band."
2695,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great. Sturdy. Comfortable. Good case. Only downside is that putting them on is relatively much more complicated than any other pair of headphones I've owned. You have to wrap them over your ear. Once they're on, they won't fall off. But I do get pretty frustrated sometimes."
2696,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an audiophile and I should say that this earpiece met my expectations as far as sound. I will keep this short and give the pro's and con's

Pro's:

- Very good balanced sound. I compared it to my Klipsch S4i II which has a very good review by cnet as well as other sites. I must say that the sound quality of SE 215 surpassed it when it came to clarity and the well roundedness of the sound. One of the best when it comes to sound quality in this price range.

- One of the sturdiest earphones that you will find. It's built like a tank compared to most others in this price range.

- The detachable wires are great. You can replace them without shelling out the bucks for a new one.

- Excellent noise cancellation.

Cons:

- The only issue I had with this, which is not really a bad problem, was the seal on my ear was too tight. While I enjoyed the noise cancellation I couldn't use it for long durations. Considering the fact that it was built mainly for stage performance, it makes sense that the seal is superb and its not streamlined for hours and hours of music.

- The chord length can sometime bother people because its built really well and its regid.

So!! All in all a 5 star product when it comes to build and sound quality and for the right kind of usage."
2697,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for months now and am just getting around to this review. So I have a lot of listening and use on these. I use them mostly for air travel. I originally purchased these because of the high noise isolation ratings. They really do have very good isolation properties, the audio quality is also exceptional for the price as well. This is important to me as I have been designing loudspeakers professionally for around 30 years. For the price I highly recommend these."
2698,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful set of headphones! I am using them with an IBasso DX50 player and have been nothing but pleased with both the sound quality and fit. Everything from Anthrax to Aaaron Copland sound wonderful. The fit is superb! I will say that changing the supplied earplugs was quite a pain but there are some helpful videos online for some tips. It is only a very minor quibble though. For someone like myself who is just starting to get into Hi-Def sound these are a wonderful starting point! I will surely be upgrading to the SE535 or maybe even the SE846 when I get the chance.
2699,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the money, you cannot ask for anything better. I have an older version of these headphones (SE110) and the clarity you get with these newer drivers is much better. Some may not like the over-the-ear design. This is a personal preference but once inserted, they stay in place without any discomfort. Plus, the passive noise reduction is great for the traveler who flies long distance. I am able to save my hearing but using these during the flight to reduce the cabin noise."
2700,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my delightful and hardworking Shure SE315s finally decided to break after 6 years of pretty much daily use (replaced the cord 2 times), I needed to find a replacement earbuds. After reading a lot of reviews and contemplating, I realized I was not over my 315s. Once you've experienced amazing sound on a daily basis, going back to cheap earbuds is almost ""painful"". However, the 315s were a little too pricey for me to replace at the moment, so I decided to go with the 215s. Checked a couple of other reviews and it seemed like there wasn't too much of a difference.

Surprisingly the SE215s are a little more bass-y than my old 315s. The sound (to me) sounds pretty similar. Same high quality, heavy duty cord from shure, and as someone who used to go through many, many cheap <$10 earbuds, heavy duty cords are a godsend! The foam tips beautifully mold to my ears and it doesn't feel like anything at all. I love how they include many different sized tips (foam and rubber ones).

I don't have too much to say that already hasn't before, but if you're trying to decide between SE315 and SE215, the 215s are a great choice, not only because it's about $100 cheaper, but to a lay person who's not an expert audiophile, these are great!"
2701,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not sure where to start...
Well I was excited about finally having an option to wirelessly connect my 846s and found that this shure product would be amazing. Problem is.... I got something that I’m pretty sure isn’t a shure product. The box is legit, packing is legit but the actual product is completely fake and trash. Not to keep on ranting but see attached photos so you know what I’m talking about.... I would be weary of it. The cables are garbage too, the piece that attaches to my earpieces fell off both ends within an hour of using. Didn’t realize it was a fake until after I just so happened to look at the box and noticed the cable I got is not legit, no logos, no nothing cheap plastic and poorly made. I’m going to contact shure directly to see..."
2702,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm moving up from a pair of Audio Technica earphones that are half the price. They were great earbuds, but they were horribly uncomfortable for my tiny ear canals. I decided to splurge on these and I'm happy I did. The sound quality was fantastic and I didn't even have to break them in. They are not as comfortable as I'd like, but the pain in my ears doesn't linger as long as it does when I wear the AT's.

Another reviewer mentioned that a con of these is the sound isolation. I would have to agree. They block a LOT of sound out. It's great for planes. I was on a flight with a poor baby that cried for over an hour. With these on and listening to music at a low volume, I couldn't hear the baby at all. However, I can't wear these around my apartment. I think someone would scare the earwax out of me because I wouldn't hear them coming."
2703,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered and tried several in ear phones based on ""best"" lists of professional online reviewers and Amazon reviews, trying to find the one that sounded best to me and had at least acceptable comfort. I ended up keeping these Shures along with the Beyerdynamic MMX 101 iE. The reason I kept the Shures is because of their warm, balanced sound. I can play these loud without any hint of harshness or listening fatigue. Played loud they sound quite punchy and have solid bass output. The midrange (vocals) is very smooth and accurate. Treble is very good, but could use a bit more extension. This is hard to do without adding harshness. I will always prefer a slightly rolled off treble over harshness. These are a bit of a pain to put into your ears, but once in, they are quite comfortable and provide a tight seal with excellent isolation from outside noise. The build quality is second to none in this price range. By comparison, the Beyerdynamics I mentioned earlier have more bass output, more accurate bass, not quite as good midrange, and similar treble. The Beyerdynamics also have a wider soundstage than the Shures, but much lower build quality."
2704,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I go through earphones like most people go through tissues. Not that I'm careless, exactly, but I'm very active and have lost many an earphone to slammed doors and missing eartips and water damage. The first thing I noticed after unboxing was the large L-jack connector. I was worried it wouldn't fit with my case (a Griffin Survivor) but it fit just fine. The second thing I noticed was the strain release on this jack which really should be standard but sadly is not. Anyone who's had exposed wires where the jack meets the cord after one too many yanks knows why a good strain release is important. The cable is thick but not overly so. I would review the different tips but I've yet to be able to get the originals off. To me this is a pro as I lose ear tips way too easily, but to some it may be a con. I'm lucky in that the default tips fit my ears well. According to Shure, you can freeze them for 10 minutes or so and the tips should screw right off. Haven't tried it yet 'cause I like the defaults.

Sound quality is excellent and clear, though I am nowhere close to an audiophile. Live songs can sound like you're in the theatre though, which is great. The cord is super long too, which is not annoying as I'd first worried. From end to end mine are about 5' long.

True to my nature, I've dropped these a few times, closed a door on them, and been running out in the rain with them, and they haven't suffered at all. I've had them about two months. Now I don't even hesitate to put these in my ears, which did take some getting used to with the weird wraparound design. But that design does lead to a secure fit.

I love these earbuds and can see them lasting a long time, so if you're looking for active wear, I'd say these are worth your investment."
2705,5.0 out of 5 stars,"...and these earbuds/phones are still working as well as they did on day one! I am only writing a review now because I am 1.) Lazy and 2.) Been victim of having to go back and adjust my comments because my initial review was a bit hasty.

Some of you may be thinking these are expensive (even for being on their lower end of products), but think about all those times you settled and purchased the less expensive solution only to be disappointed. For me, it's been 5 years and counting... even if they broke today - a cost of $19.00 per year is just unheard of these days... I'd buy another set (I own two now) because you just can't beat the ROI.

It was the performance of these earbuds that have lead to a recent purchase of a Condensor Mic from Shure. I'll be back in another 5 years to let you know how those work!"
2706,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these for 5+ years and there hasn't been a day I haven't used them.
The sound quality isn't the clearest hifi you will find, mostly because of the single driver, however they have a natural response throughout the spectrum but just a little flat on the highs. They have absolutely no hype which makes them neutral, a little ""boring"" if you will but ideal for my use case.
I'm a drummer, been giving these a rough treatment for 5+ years and both the cable and the drivers just don't want to break, I'm amazed.
In order to get a good sound make sure you chose the right tip so that they fit snugly in your ears.
They cost $100, I've tried Shure's top of the line in-ear monitors that cost several thousands, I don't see why someone would buy those.
The cable is easy to spool around the palm, somewhere around a 2 inch diameter, which fits just right in the pouch, I wouldn't recommend bending them any more than that.
After many years the part of the cable that's the ear hangers have developed a greenish color, probably because of oxidization, sound quality remains great.
Just like the 57 or 58, Shure have hit the sweet spot in price and quality with these, if you only have this amount of money so spend I think this is a solid choice."
2707,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Would have given these 5 stars because the sound quality and noise isolation is unbelievable for a pair of IEM's. My first issue with these earphones is that the part of the earpiece that the foam tips attach to is plastic whereas I would love a more durable construction to make sure it doesn't brake if I'm having to struggle to change ear tips. Secondly, my right headphone had a slight ""clicking"" noise whenever I turn my head too far left, it's not horrible, but you can notice it and it can be a little annoying if you're walking with them in. However, I do only use these for studying in the library and they are EXCELLENT for cancelling out any background noise and allowing me to listen to my music at any volume I would like. Would love it if Shure updated these with a sturdier construction, but they are definitely worth their price nonetheless."
2708,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible sound for the price! This could be said for many budget reference audio solutions, but what makes these stand out is their incredible soundstage. Nothing- and I mean nothing- that I've heard under $500 (and I've heard a lot) comes even close to what this $99 pair of buds provides (except for maybe it's siblings in the SE series.) I use them for music and studio applications, and they are more than suitable for both, with only slight EQ tweaks needed to suit my personal preference. Fit is great, but give the cord some time to bend to shape! Tips fit well into my ear canal, which I would consider medium sized in relation to others. These buds are also easy to drive with any source audio. It's also important to note that unlike some competing models, these are TRULY isolating. They are also built like tanks - I experienced both of these traits when I used them while skiing in sub-zero conditions this winter. The world around me was completely blocked out - so much so that when I was going on more crowded routes I was inclined to use just one bud so that I could be warned of fellow skiiers! These things are NO JOKE for their price, and receive my instant recommendation when anyone I know is looking for incredible audio at an incredible price."
2709,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these in 2012 and still happily using them in 2016. I listen to a wide range of music, but primarily use these headphones only while traveling, on planes primarily.

The sound quality is good, the noise reduction quality is quite good, and the fit is fairly good. Easy to travel with and easy to get on and off.

I don't do professional music production so I'm not sure exactly how great the sound / frequency range reproduction is, and I am not really interested in heavy bass directly into my ear canal, but I believe the quality is great for my listening needs.

They are comfortable but due to the semi-tight fit, I don't recommend using them for multiple hours on end. Although I have - I've listened to music for hours straight on longer flights, and must say that after an hour or two the fit can get uncomfortable, but bearable. I don't recommend sleeping with these on, at least for more than an hour or two - I switch to molded earplugs if I'm on a redeye or longer flight. I don't think it's possible for in-ear headphones to maintain comfort for a very long time, so I'm very happy with these regardless of these comments.

Overall, no real complaints and I love music, and these help me enjoy it on the road."
2710,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, but the cable started going out on the left side after only 3 months. I honestly expected more from this brand at this price point. Wish it came with a shorter cable, too. Can't use these headphones while running or working out due to the cable length and lack of durability."
2711,4.0 out of 5 stars,After some research on different in the ear monitors I decided to give Shure a try again. I had a pair of e2c headphones in the early 2000's and I loved them. When I heard that Shure had finally released a Bluetooth connected headphone I had to give them a try. These headphones are pretty good when it comes to sound isolation. Sound quality is right where is should be for the price. Looking forward to a codec update (according to Shure there will be no codec update for these).
2712,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am traveling around the country a lot. I use these for music or when I am watching a movie on my tablet. The sound is excellent. The base is very nice without being overpowering. I used to use the very popular over the ear noise cancelling head phones, but set them on the shelf years ago. These are easy to carry. I don't need an extra carrying case to bring on a plane. They fit fine in my pocket or laptop bag. I don't feel like I am loosing anything on sound."
2713,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had these Shure BTs for 2 days and used them extensively with my Shure SE 846s. They sound terrific and make the 846s much more useful. Now I can easily use them while working out. Not sure whether I will ever go back to the standard cable.

After 2 weeks of regular use, they are even better than I thought they were after 2 days. Terrific sound — easy to pair."
2714,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound isolating qualities are exactly what is advertised. DO NOT DRIVE WITH THESE IN!!!! You wont hear anything.

Base response is warm and natural sounding but not strong enough to wash out low mids.

Mids are a little muddy in my opinion but i think it is because the treble response is soft.

Overall I use these for IEM's and they are a great tool to keep track of what I'm doing on stage.

And they dont stick out like ultimate ears. They sit in your ear canal and partially fill the cavity that surround the opening to your ear canal before looping over and behind your earlobe."
2715,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm very happy with these headphones. I use them as in-ear monitors with a church band, for regular listening, and as headphones when working out.
Positives:
Great, well-balanced sound.
Lots of earpieces, so its easy to find a good fit.
Removable cord (the spot where my headphones usually break)
Negatives:
If you've never used behind the head headphones, they can be a bit uncomfortable at first.
They REALLY block out sound. Could be a positive if you're into that sort of thing, but I can't wear them at work because they make me seem unresponsive to coworkers (in reality, I just can't hear them with these in).

Overall, these are a great value and I highly recommend them."
2716,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sure SE215 are REALLY good! Highs are clear without being sharp, mids are there and the bass is a little boosted which I like! These are really good for traveling and they are really comfortable! However the clear version will discolor after a while! Watch out! I would recommend the black version."
2717,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Last month i lost another pair of Shure in-ear headphones (a different model that is now discontinued) and I was mad. I loved those for their sound, construction quality and the carrying case they come with. I really wanted to get the exact same ones again but they are now discontinued, so somehow i convinced myself to try some Harman Kardon AE's. BIG MISTAKE! Sound was average but they were the most uncomfortable things to wear and their carrying case was terrible. So, i sent them back and got these Shure SE215's.
These things are a STEAL for the price. They sound awesome, they are VERY comfortable to wear and they even look cool. They are the same style as rockstars wear during their concerts.
I wouldn't even bother looking elsewhere. Get these and stop reading reviews.
Happy Shopping!"
2718,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent IEM's (In-ear-monitors) for the price. I use them both for live performances (I'm a guitarist/vocalist) and for listening to music from my phone or laptop. As long as you have a good sound guy to mix your monitor feed, these will sound excellent. Vocals sound great through them, as well as lower frequency stuff like drums or bass. Also, they're great at noise cancelling, so you only hear what you want to hear.

After using these everyday for almost two years, the cable started to exhibit some wear and tare and i had to replace them (only $30, so not bad). But really, that's a testament to how well-made they are, as every other pair of earbuds/earphones i've used have broken down much faster with less use."
2719,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Combined with the Tripe Flange Sleeves (not included ... WHY???) I FINALLY have a way to enjoy music, audiobooks and podcasts while riding my motorcycle.

These do a great job of blocking most of the wind noise I experience inside my helmet without needing high-cost, battery powered noise-cancellation provided by other manufacturer's headsets.

They also do a GREAT job of blocking background chatter of colleagues in open-plan offices ;)"
2720,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As long well known, Shure is the best all-around professional audio company that is also value added. The SE215 model stands up to this, and even at $99 (MSRP), you get a powerful punch. With single drivers, the lows and mids are obviously not what you'd hear with upper Shure models, but Shure did a great job at averaging out what you'd need for this level of ears. I find myself finding more and more uses for this set."
2721,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When it comes to audio quality, I have a very specific taste. I like booming bass, but not over-exagerated and fake - real bass. I like CLEAR vocals, and being able to distinguish all the different instruments and layers in music. Previously, I bought a pair of Klipsch Image X10's, and I thought they were amazing. However, they were a little fuzzy and sort of unclear. Deffinitely not worth the $350 I shelled out considering they broke in about 6 months after normal daily use. The connecter to the device completely broke, and made them worthless. Klipsch may have good sound quality, but they REALLY need to put a little more effort into the build quality. I did some research after those broke, and came across these. I was skeptical of the round ear tips because I have VERY small ear canals, and only Klipsch's pattented oval ear tips fit my ears. Of course, I was right to worry because when I tried the ear tips that came with these, I was scared I had just wasted more money. However, I thought, why not take two great brands and combine them? I took my old Klipsch ear tips and sure enough they fit like a glove on my new Shure SE215's!! And thus, the BEST HEADPHONES ON THE PLANET are born. The sound quality on these bad boys is just OUTSTANDING. It fit all my requirements and even more. PERFECT amount of bass, clear vocals, and no part of the music is left unheard. I was just simply blow away by the sound quality. (I also own Audio Technica ATH-M50's, so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to sound quality. What makes these headphones even better is the tank-like build quality. I feel like these could be runover countless times by cars and never break. I would suggest getting the clear instead of the black - they look SICK - the cable looks silver and it will never get dirty unlike ordinary white headphones - you can see all the components and drivers through the clear housing and it's just a really cool design. These headphones are a STEAL for $100. What else can I say? Shure, you've done it again."
2722,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For a few years, I had been using my old Sony EX71's (which still sound great). I've wanted to upgrade for a while and have tried various earphones along the way, but none have impressed me. After some online research, I decided to order four pairs of earbuds - the Ultimate Ears UE600 and UE500, Klipsch S4 and the SE215's, with the hope of finding at least one pair that's a keeper. I was looking at the under-$100 price point.

The UE500's sounded okay, though the bass was a bit boomy and the highs could be cleaner. They also seem cheaply made and I wouldn't expect them to last. The UE600's are excellent and I may keep them. The balanced armature driver provides amazingly detailed vocals and instrumentals. They don't provide very deep, extended bass, however they do seem to handle lows accurately and are fine for everything but bass-heavy genres like hip hop. After hearing the S4's, I'm surprised that they have such a large following. They sounded very average, with exaggerated, boomy bass and rather harsh (sibilant) highs. Just shows you what one good CNET review and effective marketing can do. For the current price of $59, however, they're worth it if you need some loud earbuds with good sound isolation to use in noisy environments.

The last pair I tried were SE215's. To be honest, I wasn't too excited about these, as I expected them to be uncomfortable, with the over-the-ear style and relatively bulky design. But that all changed as soon as I heard them. These are the nicest sounding earbuds I've heard by far. Smooth, balanced, warm, distortion-free sound from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows. And the bass is not only deep, but tight and controlled. I can see the sound of the UE600's or S4's being fatiguing after an hour or so, but the 215's sound so sweet I think I could listen to them all day. While no audiophile, I think I'm pretty picky and I honestly can't come up with any criticism as far as the sound. Shure has been around since the 1920's and has a good reputation, which gives me confidence in the design and engineering that goes into their products. Many of today's trendy brands probably just outsource design and manufacturing overseas and are more about appearance and bling factor, rather than sound quality. I've always had this image of Shure appealing to purists who prefer a totally flat frequency response and who listen mainly to classical music. The SE215 is the first model that has more of a v-shaped curve, with some bass enhancement. The amount of bass is just right - somewhere between flat and extended, as with bass-heavy earbuds. The result is a rich, full sound that is great with all genres of music and which most regular, non-audiophile users will probably prefer.

The quality is top notch. There are substantial strain relief moldings at all cord junctions. The cord and plug seem quite rugged and furthermore, the cord is replaceable. The 215's have a 2-year warranty, which is great for earbuds. Six sets of tips are included (3 silicone and 3 foam). I went with the silicone tips, since I'm too lazy to mess with the compressable tips each time.

Putting them on is fairly quick and easy once you get used to it (though slightly less convenient than under ear buds). They're also very comfortable, once you know how to position them properly. If you wear glasses, there might be some discomfort after a while due to having both the wire sleeve and the arm of the glasses resting on your ears. There are some photos online of people wearing the SE215's incorrectly (left and right sides reversed). Obviously, using them correctly makes a huge difference in comfort and bass response. The over the ear style helps keep the cord out of the way, where they're less likely to snag on something. The sound isolation is very effective, which means they shouldn't be used anywhere you need to be able to hear. If you're considering these but are hesitating, give them a try. I'm glad I did."
2723,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've purchased several ~$100 earphones over the years and these are by far my favorite. They are comfortable, the cable is durable, they keep out external noise, and they sound very good. The only weakness I would say is the highs aren't as strong as the mid or lower ranges, but that makes them a bit easier to listen to for extended periods. I also have been using these for about a year with no issues and usually in that time I get tempted to buy other earphones, but I just can't imagine finding anything better. The next pair of earphones I buy will be higher end Shures."
2724,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was going to give 5 stars, but after riding for awhile with these, I noticed that my ears were getting more and more sore. The fitting molds are great, and they do fit relatively well (not like customs, but hey, these aren't custom), but because they are hard plastic, they wear on my cartilage in my ears. If you have pimple in your ear (gasp!), they are unwearable.

I do love the sound and the loudness, and the cable length is good, too."
2725,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a replacement for some my wife had that died after a few years of using while running. This new pair is solid and sound terrific. I have used Klipsch, Bose, and these Shure, and these are some of the best sounds headphones I had used. Deep bass, and tight fit...once you get them in just right, which can be a challenge at times, but once you get used to putting them in, and bend the wire just right, they go right in."
2726,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This pair of headsets are quite good. great sound, good cord and nice size. The issue I have is with me. My right ear canal does not go in at the correct angle so my right ear doesn't get sealed like my left. This causes the sound to not be as good as it can be. The soft buds completely seal the ear which is nice but when you are eating you notice pressure build up in the ears and I find myself touching the ear-buds a lot when that happens.

Overall, great sound size and customization possibilities with the provided buds."
2727,5.0 out of 5 stars,"just opened them, and they've managed to make a great replacement for some old E2Cs (which I love but really don't fit my tiny ears properly, they fall out even with the smallest sleeves), more recently followed by 2 broken pairs (Ultimate Ears and Klipsch). I won't stray from Shure again, sound quality is top notch and all the areas where my previous 2 pairs have broken (wire broke away at the jack connector) are reinforced and seemingly durable. Did I mention the sound quality is top notch? I can't wait to drown out the NYC subway sounds during my commute with crystal-clear and deep sound."
2728,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a set of earbuds that sound good but also have good noise isolation to use while mowing the yard or watching a movie on a flight.
These earbuds sound great, sound is well balanced, good bass but not to boomy. While they are not noise canceling, they provide enough isolation to listen to music or movies comfortably without having to crank the volume. I would recommend."
2729,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Read some online reviews about these headphones and I decided to take a chance. So I added them to my Christmas Wish List and my wife got them for me. All I can say is WOW!!!!. There is a learning curve on how to get them to properly fit in your ear, but once you get ""it"" and are able to feel the proper fit, it's very easy. They are very comfortable and the sound is INCREDIBLE. I had a pair of Denon, which I loved, but the wire sheath where they attached to the earphone kept pulling apart. And while they still work today, I was always concerned that one false move and a wire would get broken. My next pair was a pair of SkullCandy Titan. At first I liked them, but very quickly they became uncomfortable to wear for long periods. But with the Shure SE215-K are simply the best I have owned. The sound is clear and defined, and are very efficient. They are not too bassy, but not to tinny either. They are very balanced and sharp and defined. I would highly recommend these if you are in the market for a new pair of headphones."
2730,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The earphones are fine. After having used it for 2 months, the quality has deteriorated. Now, I know that these are headphones used for on-stage hidden comms and music but that doesnt provide an excuse for it's incredibly feeble design. The strengthened cord that wraps around the back of your ear on my right ear broke from countless times that I had to fix it just because it keeps on loosening. I do NOT recommend this product."
2731,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After looking at comparable earphones from Klipsch, Etymotics and Shure, I decided to settle on Shure's SE-215. The SE-215 delivers in sound quality. Highs are crisp, mids are clear and lows produce some great bass (pending you have the proper cushions in place). Compared to the Klipsch S4, the SE-215 has richer mid's and the bass was more tonal compared to the slightly ""boomy"" klipsch drivers. All in all the sound quality was above my expectations for a pair or earphones costing approximately $100.

My only gripe about the set was the cable. It's very long but more than that, the 2 inches closest to the earbuds are made up of this thicker material that is god-awfully frustrating. Bending it to the contours around your ear is tough, especially when moving and it's prone to come loose during rigorous activity (Marathon Running / Rock Climbing). Thank god you can replace the cable but it should have came with something a bit more manageable."
2732,2.0 out of 5 stars,They feel great and the volume is good. But missing a jump ahead or back button. Also the bass is way to much and no way to turn it down.
2733,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I do professional sound engineering so have a bit of a bias towards liking anything Shure says. That said... I am quite happy with these.

I used to use much cheaper ear buds under my helmet, then those $80 Etymotic Research ER7-MC3-BLUE-I-A MC3 units (with the built-in iPhone control & mic, to enable easier phone calls with the helmet on). BUT, those stuck out too far, even when fully inserted, and sometimes just a smile or yawn would open up the passage way and VROOM comes wind noise at 60 MPH.

The Shure units are much more low-profile, fitting more in the ""cup"" of the ear (not sure the proper term). They have never suddenly come lose and lost their acoustic seal.

The cable which comes with these ear buds is solidly built - good for motorcycle use (think what a live stage musician would do to them, night after night... the cable is sturdy and well-made).

Note that there is no iPhone remote control or mic on this cable, though Shure sells a rather expensive one that I may buy soon, after my existing $15 version I bought fails (that is, the second one I bought, as the first cheapie already died). So... as always you get what you pay for.

And on a motorcycle, where ruggedness and reliability matters (because distractions are dangerous), I'll suggest these buds to anyone.

Enjoy!"
2734,4.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are pretty good. The sound quality for the prices is about what I was expecting. The foam pieces that come installed on them are not that comfortable but the earbuds come with multiple tips that you can switch out to. The tips that are on it are very hard to get off. I found that one of the tips felt good in the ear but form a seal completely inside your ear and can lead to some ear pressure issues (i have sensitive ears).
2735,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic in ear monitors, when they work. They sound amazing, and if you get the right tip size and fit, very comfortable and secure. I am disappointed, however, that after about 10-15 uses, and not doing anything rough with them, that the left ear bud appears no longer to output sound. I have tried different devices and configurations, but either I got a faulty pair or the cables may not be as strong as I would hope...so now I have to buy new cables just to see whether it is the cables or the left unit itself. With such a great start, I am, honestly, a bit disappointed..."
2736,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like Shure headphones this is my second pair, my first lasted about 3 years. I really like the sound (I am not an audiophile) of the head phones, nothing is over powering. I will say though that after while, they get very uncomfortable for me. I was on a flight from LA to Sydney and about 6 hours in, they were pretty painful in my ears.

I am keeping them but have ordered another set of earphones from Amazon to try for my next long flight."
2737,4.0 out of 5 stars,"good sound. isolates extremely well, I missed my station on the subway! uncomfortable to wear and get used to at first, but I got eventually got the hang of it. People stare at me funny as I loop it around my ears though. The clear one looks a lot prettier on screen than in real life. In person, it's a dull grey and looks unfinished and cheap and ugly and industrial looking. I might get klispch again just because it looks prettier."
2738,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a drummer at my church, so I primarily use these as in-ear monitors for a live music performance application. The buds are designed for maximum isolation from outside noise (great for drummers!), which helps preserve the bass frequencies. These are fantastic, especially for the price. I've owned and demo'd earbuds costing 2-3 times as much that didn't sound as good as these. I was especially pleased with the bass response; I can't understand how a single-driver earbud has this nice of a range. I ordered the clear ones, which don't stand out as much visually (a good thing!) Music from my iPod sounds great too; they handle a variety of musical styles very well. Easily the best earbuds I've used at this price; I would reccommend these to anyone, especially musicians."
2739,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Why is it so hard to find decent headphones? These do not sit comfortably on the ear, the sound is medicore for the price.

But the real issue is that they are cheaply made. Mine have broken (sound is no longer coming from right bud) not 3 months owned. I've had second hand free headphones last longer.

Do not buy these, or any product from this manufacturer."
2740,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these in ear headphones. It took me a moment tho realize that there were indicators to tell me which ear piece was left and which was right. Once I realized that the sound improved tremendously.
2741,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for motorcycle riding and wish I'd got them years ago. Much better than cheaper ear buds for isolating wind noise even if not listening to music.
2742,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these! I initially found the foam tips to be extremely tight fitting because I never had over the ear-earbuds, but now that i've gotten used to it, I'm never looking back. These keep out sound extremely well and have very good quality music- especially for the price you're paying. I found that the wires are a bit long, so I bought the shorter ones and replaced them."
2743,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these headphones in. Sound quality is amazing. The cord is very solid, it's not like your average headphones with the cheap wiring. The wire is actually covered by a tough and sturdy material so it seems pretty hard to actually separate the wire from the buds. The only downside to this product is putting it in your ear. I had a hard time putting these into my ear because I was not familiar with structure of the earbuds. It takes some time to get use to it. My only tip is to shape the wire around your ear before placing the buds into your ear canal. Once I got the earbuds in, the fit was fine. I can barley hear anything after they have been placed in properly.

Overall the quality of the product and the sound quality of the earbuds are excellent. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for high end earbuds."
2744,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These do a great job of blocking out wind noise while riding my motorcycle, which is the primary reason I bought them. They are comfortable on long rides, even if they are sometime hard to get situated right under my 3/4 helmet. The only reason that I took away a star is that it requires you to buy another $50 cable to control your music on your phone, and the cable they offer is not very good compared to the stock cable."
2745,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Summary:
-This is my 4th pair of Shure's.
-Owned E2C's and older models.
-These are the best (and cheapest) so far.
-I use custom molded castings of my ear-canals made by my ear-doctor and the sound isolation/sound quality is absolutely amazing. I'm a helicopter pilot and use them for hearing-protection everyday.
-Slightly less comfortable

Pros:
-Bass is deeper and more pronounced than other models I've owned. I'm very particular about sound and like a good balance...have to say that the bass is unquestionably an improvement. I use a graphic equalizer with my player and these have a much broader range of adjustability...some people say they have too much bass, but if you actually take the time to adjust your equalizer, you'll find that you just have more control. The bass response is therefor quite satisfying as it is never pushing the driver near any limits. Rich, deep, period.
-Shure's have always been my go-to brand but I've always broken the wires by month 12-14. The modular wire system in these new models is pretty much the answer to that problem.
-They look cool. especially with my clear ear-canal castings.

Cons:
-They don't fit in the ear as well as previous models...a little big so they contact my cartiladge and irritate it over time if not adjusted properly. I suspect that it is my custom ear-canal inserts so I wouldn't worry about it unless you're going that route.
-Because of ^ and the fact that the wire-plug can swivel, they take a little longer to put on/take off...you kinda have to get everything all setup before you pop it under your hair/glasses and into your ear."
2746,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have had shure earphones before and needed to replace my current one when the ear piece broke after many years of excellent service. I went straight to Shure and started researching models and chose the SE 215-K. It isolates sounds in the airplane but you can still hear when the communications come on or if the flight attendant speaks to you. This one is better because it stays in the ear even if you make sudden moves and the sound is better than the older one.
2747,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Crazy sound isolation - when these are in I cannot hear a thing. The soft flexible sleeves that conform to your ears does an exceptional job blocking out sound. The cables feel very sturdy so my fear of detached wires after a year or so of usage is no more. One of the best (if not the best) sound isolating earphones I have purchased and used. As usual, cannot beat Amazon pricing and I would highly recommend."
2748,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought them in May and the sound already cuts out from both ears if the wires move a certain way. Faulty connector or bad quality cables. Disappointed considering these are fairly expensive and this is a result from regular use and keeping them always stored in the bag it came with.
2749,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never liked isolating in-ear earphones before, because usually I bought cheap ones which made bad sound, and uncomforting feeling. Besides that I have pretty big ears so my earbuds would always fell out on bicycle/running/other activity. I just ruined my Apple's new earphones when I broke on my bicycle and they fell out of my ears into the tires..

Ok, let's go to Shure SE215-K. This are the most expensive earbuds I ever bought (even though $ 90 some people don't consider as really expensive). I love the sound, they never fell out of my ears on the bicycle/running. They isolate all the sound around me when I listen to the music (so people have to wave at me if they want to talk).

It gets really windy in Hawaii and I was never able to listen to audio books on my bicycle on windy days, now I can.

When I first inserted earphone into my ears it took me some time. Now I can get them in in less than 10 seconds :)

I just love there earphones, and am just sad I didn't buy them before."
2750,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are nothing short of amazing for a mid-frequency set of earphones. The isolating cushions are like actual plugs (makes sense, these are for monitoring), and keep the kids screaming in the next room out of my head while I'm working. My only regret is not getting the version with the in-line controls, and that I couldn't drop the cash on one of the sets with a wider frequency range. I can only imagine that the $999 set sounds like an iMAX theater."
2751,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounding headphones! Would buy again.
I use them as IEM's for my rock band.
Full balanced sound...make sure you use the best
fitting tips. Believe it or not this greatly improves the
bass response. At first I tried the wrong size tips and
was less than pleased. Once I got the right seal it
also increased the noise reduction. Great product.
I have tried the SE525 series at a friends house for
comparison...they hold up well. If you have the extra
cash you can spring for the 525's but if you are on a
budget like me, get the 215 series!"
2752,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have returned these headphones.

They can be a little cumbersome to get to fit in your ears. It takes some practice to get them right. Overall the comfort is pretty good but I could see them popping out of your ear at times. The quality of construction is good and i can see them being durable over time.

Audio quality:
They can get loud, but, they do not offer much low end. Its mostly high and mid range.

They do seem to block the outside noise pretty well.

For me they didnt give me what I was looking for. Im going to stick to my iPhone earbuds and continue to search."
2753,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these little guys used with new tips on them for $85 including shipping from here. I was pretty hesitant spending that much on a set of earbuds but since my band is trying to set up a custom motioning system and these were the cheapest we could find with the best reviews, we all ended up going for the SE215's. I was blown away by the quality first off, I could hear things that my set of $150 mixing headphones wouldn't pick up on. And they actually stay in my ears! I haven't even felt them close to falling out yet.

Apart from using these with my band, I also have been taking them to work (I work in a metal machine shop) and I gotta say the sound isolation on these are insane. I can barely even hear the machines, quiet sections of songs still ring right through and even reverb is audible. They are also very comfortable with the right ear-insert. They do take a bit of getting used to because of the over-ear design but honestly they have become more comfortable than any other earbud I've used. I still don't know if they are worth $100 but I'm definitely not, by any means, kicking myself for buying these."
2754,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use them for the gym. Sound quality is outstanding, and I'm sure the cable rot is not going to happen here like it did with my previous Shure EC2's - though with those it even started to happen several years after I got them - because they've included a rubber thicker layer around the ear area. Other headphones don't stay in my ears, these will only fall out if I pull them."
2755,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned these for almost a year now, and enjoy the sound quality just as much now as I did on the first day. They have held up very well during the time I've had them, and I use them everyday and sometimes in rough conditions; the single sign of wear is that the ""SHURE"" logo on the side has faded slightly. The comfort level is fine, as they are made to be molded to your ear and hold that position fairly well over time. In terms of relative sound quality, these out-perform anything at a similar price range, Bose included (in my opinion).
A note on the earpieces: I use the stock round silicone ones occasionally, and these are fine for most use. However, I recommend buying the triple-flanged earpieces from Shure if you are after noise-isolation (search Shure EATFL1-6, they should be about $8 and are well worth it)."
2756,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's a lot of good things about this product. I don't even know where to start.

The cables are thick and firm (more so than normal earphones. Some might not like how it retains a little of it's shape), and extremely well reinforced. You know all those places where you break your cable at? Well not anymore...

Also, not many how much they move around, there's no vibrations to be heard. That's something not too many earphones can be proud of.

Detachable cables. I didn't even know about this when I bought it. Basically, you can detach the actual earphone pieces from the cable for replacement (the cable that is). It just pops right out, but only if you want it to: it has a good mechanism to keep it in place.

Clear headphones? I normally don't care about the color (unless it's pink) but making it see-through was a great idea. I like to see the cables inside of it.

A lot of people have trouble actually putting these things on. Even I had trouble with it at first (even though I already had one pair of shures before). They're only cables, but they're also over-the-ear models. Most Shures are I think. They wrap around the top of your ear and slide down to fit comfortably into your ear. It's comfortable, but some might not like how it does that. Don't even try and put them in like conventional headphones. It won't work.

You get two types of earpieces: a soft malleable type, and a hard plastic type. The soft type is great to block out a lot of exterior noise, but it gets dirty real quick. It's kind of nasty if you plan on sharing your earphones with others. The hard type doesn't get dirty whatsoever, but the quality drops, meaning you can hear the outside.

This product is absolutely amazing. And for half of the price it's a damn steal. Not to mention you also get a year of warranty included. I recommend this product 100%, and I applaud Shure for getting it right."
2757,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start this out by saying that if you've never owned high end earbuds/IEMs, you will most likely love these. If that describes you I would unequivocally recommend these as the sound quality, bluetooth technology, sound isolation, comfort, and battery life are all above to well above average. It takes some practice to properly insert the buds in your ear but you’ll get it.

Now, audiophiles. As a musician and general audio fanatic that has used Shure products for years, to my ears these are about a 8/10 value for the $150 price point. They are good but not great.

To start with the good, the lows are powerful but sometimes too much so. The single sound driver in these buds overstates the lows so I’ve found tweaking EQ to increase treble from your playback source to be very helpful, especially if you’re using a program like iTunes or Spotify. I listen to a variety of music including jazz, rock, pop, hip hop, classical, and I would say that across genres the bass is pleasant and adequate with the “treble booster” EQ adjustment.

Now the problem is with the mids and even more with the highs. The mids are undeniably muddy. This becomes obvious with heavily layered tracks where the instruments and effects struggle to distinguish themselves. The cutting clarity that I expect to hear from a cymbal crash or a piercing guitar note just isn't there.

I'm comparing these to the old school Shure E3C series (comparable to the current SE315) which had some design flaws but sound-wise are a big step up -- enough so that I plan to upgrade these at some point to either the SE315 or SE535s.

In sum, these are entry level Shure buds and to me they sound like it. Overall I'm still glad I bought them, but they are not quite what I had hoped for based on the early reviews here."
2758,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best in-ear monitors for the price. Incredible, crisp sound, especially for a single driver unit. I have considered many times dropping the several hundred dollars to get a pair of custom molds, but I can't help but wonder if they will really be that much of an improvement upon my current SE-215s. Keep in mind, I use these several times a week as a touring musician. I have used many other brands, and these are the ones I keep coming back to. Eventually I feel that I will cave and get custom molds, but I couldn't recommend these more for a musician on a budget, or for an audiophile looking for great quality."
2759,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Paid about 100 dollars and after about a year, they still work great. I wear these running and to the gym. So sweat was never an issue. And I like how these go behind the ears. When when you have an occasional tug on the wires, they don't fall out of your ears like other earphones. Nice sound isolation. Bass is good but not bumping. Wouldn't mind a little more bass. Wire length a little too long but better than short. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
2760,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The cable near right ear broke and audio keeps cutting until I re-adjust it. Very annoying. Wish I could return/replace them.
The ear cushions are very stiff and painful in my ears. I had to switch them with my old Klipsch S4's silicone cushions which are softer on my ears."
2761,4.0 out of 5 stars,These were purchased as a gift for my son. He really likes the headphones. But the earpieces are a beast to take off and swap out. You almost feel like you are tearing them up in order to take them off. I would think an easier design would have been made. Other than that we are satisfied with the product.
2762,4.0 out of 5 stars,Son likes them. He claims he can't hear me talking to him when he's wearing them. I don't know if that's good or bad.
2763,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The price is nice. They fit well and are comfortable. But in the past 2 years we've had 6 pairs and had issues with 5 of them and I think we take really good care of them. We only use them once a week. Be it a bad cable, an ear going out, something has gone wrong with all most all of them. They were under warranty, but it gets old either getting a replacement cable or sending it in to get a new ear. I believe there are better options that hold up longer and some that are even cheaper."
2764,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They're great and fit very well. The cable is extremely long and it doesn't come with some sort of cable management. Sony ships theirs with a little wraparound thing and MeElectronics ships theirs with an actual clip. Considering how long the cable is, it would be nice if it came with something to handle it (Seriously, I'm 5'8"" and the cable is almost as long as I am tall)."
2765,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had one pair of these before and sold them because i needed the money. Bought again because is the best for the cost i could find and they serve my purpose either on live stage and home recording monitorizing. Will buy again if i need to.
2766,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you love in-ear headphone with excellent audio quality, plus a noise cancelling feature, your search is over. The price is high but the experience is worth every single penny. I'm currently using it at work and is so light to wear, and more than that external noise doesn't bother me anymore. I don't recommend using it outdoor, might be dangerous to not listen sirens, honks etc."
2767,4.0 out of 5 stars,I've used like Shure products for the last 10 years or so. I like to mainly use these while working out because of the way they are worn (loop over back of the ear) as they prevent then from pulling out if the cord is yanked. These are pretty good although I like the older ones (fit) better for some reason. The cord is very long - a bit too long in my opinion as it sometimes gets in the way. Good sound for shure. :) Good seal too.
2768,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these as my in ears when we preform. All I can say is wow what a difference these can make for vocals. Very clean and these handle bass so much better then my other cheap pair. I would recommend these to any singers who want to take it to the next level when performing.
2769,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great drummer ear phones!
2770,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading many reviews on various headphone, I selected these as a Christmas gift for my college age son.
I have experience with Shure record cartridges from back in the day, and they always delivered great sound.
These were delivered days ahead of the anticipated schedule and the box was packed well and the product was as ordered.
My son began wearing the headphones the afternoon of Christmas and instantly made comment as to the sound quality compared to the ear buds he had been using with his I-Phone. After a week or so of him being back for the Christmas break, I asked if I could try out and hear how these shure headphones delivered music. He was happy to show me the way to put these in the ear and drape the cord over my ear. I experimented with various music from his I-Tunes and then played some music off Pandora on my own I-Phone. I found the sound very clear, clean and dynamic. The buds felt comfortable in my ears. They also did a tremendous job of blocking out any outside noise! When I go to replace my own headphones, these will be ones I purchase. Overall I am very pleased with the purchase and my son is VERY PLEASED with the gift. These are extremely well built, fit the ear like a professional studio ear bud, deliver great sound and are available at a price point that wont break the bank, but that also makes you aware to take care of them as they are a fine product."
2771,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I use them while practicing drumming with either my laptop or iphone. Otherwise I have Vater earplugs for drumming. I have ringing in my ears (all the time) from not protecting my hearing the first 40 years...

They sound really great. I can't complain at all about the sound. I think they are at least as good as my Bose IE2. So 5 stars in this department.

They come with different ear foam inserts. This is great. I can't say any of them are perfect, but you can play around until something works well enough. I can get the right level of noise dampening versus hearing the drums. I give them 4 stars here. The ear inserts really are nothing better than cheapo $10 earphones. You just get foam and rubber options of various sizes. I would have expected something a little higher quality (for example, see the $20 earplugs that they have for music listening which are just oh-so-slightly better).

There is an interesting feature where the earbuds detach easily (but not too easily -- a good thing!) from the cords because the cords are always what fails on earphones. I really like this feature -- but they are new and I only use them playing the drums so I don't know if I will ever take advantage of this. Pretty neat idea and build execution!

They really smell when you get them! I hate smelly plasticy things! It was stinking up my music room. It's been a couple months and I wiped them down with rubbing alcohol (not sure if that helped or not). So now they don't seem to smell anymore. But come on! It is such a turn off to get your brand new expensive (expensive for earbuds, but sure not luxury items I get it... ) electronic thingy and it wreaks like... well sickly plastic fumes.

Now that the smell is not an issue, my complaint is that the way they stay on is janky. The cords closest to the earbuds are bendable and stay int he shape you bend them in. So you kinds of create an over the ear hook so they stay on. Contrast these with the Bose IE2 which are a dream (I get that the noise blocking feature is way different than the IE2 earbuds which allow ambient noise in so you don't get run over while jogging, etc.) I wish they really did something different with this part. The functionality/fit is *meh*.

So in summary (sorry about the length!) I dislike the smell, the only adequate quality foam/rubber inserts, and the moldable wire supports.

I am getting more used to them as I use them more, but I don't think I will ever love them. I am too picky for that to happen."
2772,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say? It's my second pair of mid fi products and I love it. These IEMs are a solid choice for somebody getting into higher audio. If you want something that is more ""fun"", this is for you. It has a really strong impacting bass that is accurate as well. The mids are fine, nothing special but there isn't much range on the treble and isn't as great there. Its a comfortable pair of IEM's to me, however some people may not enjoy the over design of the earbuds. For anybody wondering, they work fine with glasses as well. I would highly recommend these for anybody looking at a $100 purchase."
2773,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great sounding in-ear monitors. The sound quality is outstanding. Figuring out how to put them on is not easy. There are several ""cushions"" included for proper fit - trying a few to get the right comfort and sound is critical. One type [expandable] I tried felt good; but after wearing for an hour were VERY uncomfortable .... switching to another type worked perfectly. I use these for listening to recorded music and also for live sound with a band - they work well for both. As you'd expect from Shure - these are high quality and well-built earphones. My previous monitors were Ultimate Ears that boasted of strong low end ... they were good but not nearly as good as the Shure, The Shure monitors carry the whole spectrum without overly coloring the sound. I plan on using these for a long time."
2774,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very durable and quality headphones. If you like clarity and don't require an enormous amount of bass, then these will do just fine. I love mine, the inserts take some getting used to but I prefer the foam over the rubber. They come with both so it's all personal preference."
2775,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to earbuds. Once I found the correct sized ear tip, these fit like a dream. I ended up choosing one of the memory foam cushion tips, which fit very much like earplugs, and these earbuds fit better than anything I've ever used before. I can honestly wear these for hours on end without complaint. An amazing fit, great sound, and a good value. Love these!"
2776,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is great with these, with the caveat that if you are using a lower quality music player (such as many smartphones) these will also help you hear the deficiency of your music player. They do a great job with noise isolation, so you can work in a noisy cafe without being distracted. They also have about 2-3"" of heavy-gauge wiring just next to the earbuds that stays in shape so you can bend the around your ear to keep them in place."
2777,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The SE215s were apparently just the ticket for her!

She mostly listens to dubstep and other bass-heavy music. The Se215s are often mentioned as particularly good for dubstep and electronica, and se seems extremely happy with them. Another thing she appreciates is the good selection of extras they come with.

Excellent for the price, would buy again. In fact I did, as my daughter lost the first set through a freak accident :("
2778,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones, having purchased Shure headphones previously. The original were great until the dog chewed off one one!! I purchased these thinking that the would be as good as the ones minus one end. Wrong. They didn't sound as good, and now one side doesn't work at all. Is this today's quality control? If I can exchange them, I will try another pair."
2779,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is good but I find the ear pieces regularly need me to adjust them or put them back in, especially when I'm exercising. I tried more than one size, which came with the order. I wish I had bought another pair of Bose earbuds, which are a different shape and much more comfortable. The Shure ones are like ear plugs that you must wedge into your ear canal. For this price range, I expected them to be more comfortable."
2780,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I Absolutely love these!

Pros: Great sound, incredible noise isolation, long cable, great memory foam ear tips with lots of size compatibility, very good fit, very comfortable, best earphones I have ever had. Better that Powerbeats and Klipsch Custom 3's

Cons: Maybe cable length, noise isolation is very good making these possibly unsafe for outdoor use

I looked at a lot of earphones and I am really glad I went with these. Perfect for working out. They never fall out of my ears or even come loose. Also very sweat and moisture resistant."
2781,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect sound, these are my favorite all purpose earbuds. Supreme comfort with the memory foam tips, and VERY high quality sound for the price.

Not to mention, they fit so snug and flat that I can fall asleep with them in, and I often do use them to fall asleep, while listening to ASMR videos. The only better earbuds I can imagine would be the higher SE models by Shure. (I literally dream about opening a pair of SE846s)"
2782,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a believer! My boyfriend recommended these for our upcoming trip. I was considering Bose noise cancelling, but did not want the bulk. These come in a very compact bag and cancel out the jet noise and chatter on planes. I also bring them to work now so I don't hear the background noises of chatter, keyboards, phone calls, pagers that can irritate me. Excellent 100 bucks spent."
2783,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Obviously different, but I was worried at first about the fit. They definitely sit differently in my ears. They do not go in nearly as far as the SE110s. I had the medium sized FOAM plugs on my other pair, so I figured the medium would be the best on the 215s. Nope, far too small to give a good fit and block out ambient noise. I switched to the large foam plugs and got a good fit. They do not block out ambient noise as well as the SE100s did for me, but the sound is better. The bass is clearly superior to the 110s. I run regularly with them in, and there are no issues with them falling out. The less pliable cord that goes around the ears can be annoying, but you just need to use the cinch/tightener on the cord and they stay in place fine. Taking a little bit to get used to, but I really like them now."
2784,4.0 out of 5 stars,"i use these in ear monitors mostly while riding my motorcycle and they replaced my SE210's which bit the dust. Overall I have to say I liked the SE210's better, but of course they are discontinued so I thought I would try their replacement the SE 215 which were acutally a lttle cheaper.

The SE210's were a bit more comfortable and I believe had slightly better sound. The SE215's have a more robust cord which was a negative on the 210's. The cord is also easily detachable in case it breaks, but is a one piece design instead of the two piece design of the 210's I liked that I could unplug the cord of the 210's in the middle of the cord instead of at the device input. Gave more felexibility for using.

As for the sound, they sound very good, but like i said, I thought their predessesor had better sound quality and were a little more comfortable.

Overall I give it 4 stars out of 5."
2785,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using Shure headphones for years. They make a great product and their quality is fantastic, but at a lower cost than many of the competitors.

The latest models have replaceable cables, as those are very often the first pieces go to through wear and tear. But the earbuds themselves keep on working great, cable after cable."
2786,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you're sitting on the fence these are worth it! Great company. Great first pro earbuds. Best price for quality pro earbuds won't find quality this cheap. Surprised cord hasn't ripped I sat down with cord wrapped around something metal and the headphones nearly ripped out of my ears and they still sound great and cord is fine.
2787,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these earphones to practice with my band (I play bass) and have gigged with them several times. I've also used them on plane flights, and they cut ambient noise as well as high end over the ear phones. They only have one driver, so the bass response isn't great, but for the money I've been quite pleased. They come with several different sizes of rubber ear pieces, so one of them is likely to fit you."
2788,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Using them as Aviom monitors on-stage every week. Good isolation, full bass, clear highs, good mids.,. there is no comparison between these and regular earbuds. Once levels and stereo placement of other group sends were set on aviom, it was great to set my guitar feed in the middle and let it roll. Also, these are comfortable, Only negative I can list is it takes a little effort to get them in and pull them out. Definitely a great bargain alternative to custom IEM's costing, after ear molds from an audiologist, $500.00 to $800.00 or more depending on your wallet (and ego...:) ). Also great to passively listen to music with, just realize that normal conversation is not an option while wearing these...wife thought I was ignoring her. For passive listening, recording reproduction is very pleasing, if not ""studio monitor"" accurate. Very sweet sound."
2789,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first got these iem I was stunned at the lack of bass that they had but after some burn in the bass started to show though. Now if you are looking for deep thick bass look else ware but if you are looking for crisp clean bass these fit the bill very well. With the corect tips these iem can really tune out noise so be careful if out and about. Thes iem are very easy to drive cleanly running on just about any sourse but seem to not gel well with tube amps.

For referance other cans I own are ath m40s, grado 325 woody and cable mods, dathbyers."
2790,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great hearphones. Thick and durable cord, three sizes of ear pieces and the best part: the music. Sound is really good and bass is deep, mids are punchy and highs are crisp. I listen to a variety of music from jazz to classic rock to hip hop and most everything in between. They shine on all fronts. Sound isolation is great. I've listened to these at 35,000 feet and had no issues. The only drawback I get is problems getting them to stay in when I run but the sound overrides that. I would recommend if you're not a snobby $800 hifi headphones type yet still want some great earphones for whatever."
2791,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. I've had a set for years and bought this set for my son's birthday. They're durable and comfortable. I often use them while waiting for my son at Taekwondo class. I can hear what I'm listening to at a minimum volume level, all while kids are shouting."
2792,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product sounds great, I have had no issues with it as of yet. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a professional quality sound isolating earphones. I have heard that this product has a tendency to break after a few months. If this is the case for me, I will update my post here. However, as of this moment (owning the Shure SE215-CL for a little over a month) they work great and this customer is very satisfied."
2793,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound fantastic, and the included ear pads work better than my custom-made Westone hearing protectors to cut outside sound. Perfect for use in noisy environments or on stage. Note that the ear pads may not work well for everyone -- at all depends on the size and shape of your ear canals."
2794,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed...my first Shure war buds back in the day had better sound quality and were bullet proof. The 215’s I’ve has for some time now and have been struggling with each bug intermittently cutting out. It’s been irritating but usually resolves after a little adjustment of the wires. Now - no luck. Left bud is dead. After doing so research seems likes a common problem. Not Shure I’m going to try another pair.
2795,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these to replace a pair of SE310's I left on a plane. Sound quality is excellent, exactly what I expect from shure-clear notes and balanced sound. The multiple included eartips makes it easy to find the ones that work best for your ears. The external body of the headphones is larger than it appears, slightly uncomfortable for me, but maybe I'll get used to it in time. It is flat, so it doesn't hurt your ear if your head is laying against a pillow or airplane seat. If the external body of the headphones was slightly smaller, I'd give this product 5 stars."
2796,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just unboxed these after they were delivered today, so I can't speak to their longevity. But after listening to music for a good hour, all I can say is 'wow.' These things sound great and are comfortable in my ears. The noise isolation is incredible, they function just like ear plugs. I can't wait to try them on an airplane.

As of now, I highly recommend them. I hope they stand up to the daily abuse I will be putting them through."
2797,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I did a LOT of research on looking for a high quality pair of earphones. After purchasing this I am very happy. They sound fantastic. A lot of comments on how hard they are to put in, but once you get it down, it's no problem. The only thing to be weary of is the sound isolation - they do a fantastic job of isolating, but you must be careful around traffic, or any other dangerous activity."
2798,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All I can say is wow. I have always been a huge Bose fan probably due to the advertising and decent sound quality (was perfect quality until now). A few days ago I would of swore that my three pair of Bose headphones had all others beat, I was totally wrong. As soon as I put these on and fired up the first song I immediately got a huge smile. Then I was disappointed, not disappointed at my new Shure headphones but more that I had wasted money on Bose for years. Let me go back to the start first though.
I researched headphones like crazy wanting the best sound possible. I kept finding articles saying Shure. I had never heard of them so I was unShure (unsure) about spending money on something I haven't tried or heard of. I had both Bose and Shure headphones in my shopping cart. I kept removing the Shure headphones because I didn't want to waste my hard earned money on and unknown brand to me. Finally I was tired of the back and forth and removed the Bose and bought the Shure. I am so glad I did.
I received my headphones two days later and opened them struggled to get them on my ears. These aren't like normal earbuds it took me a good five minutes to get it right. I had music playing but it sounded terrible because I couldn't get them the right way on my ear. As soon as the earbud slipped in the right way I was sold. I heard things that I had never heard in my music before. Every note was crystal clear. The bass was perfect and deep without being overwhelming. My kids were playing and being loud but the earplug type of earbud completely cut them out. I have listened to many songs now and I have never heard my music so perfect and accurate. These things blow Bose out of the water. I see a lot of questions on Amazon asking how they are compared to Bose. If you are reading this (my first review ever) I can tell you to take the leap and you too will be a Shure fan for life. I will definitely try more of the higher priced versions in the future. I will probably never get to try the Shure SE846 due to the price at least until I get my kids through college then I might treat myself for doing an awesome job as a parent. On another note it did come with a nice case, ear pieces, and cleaning tool. In all honesty though the earbuds are the only thing that is important here. My one and only negative is that due to the clarity and perfect sound representation is that some artists that used lower quality mixing or whatever would degrade there sound quality can be heard. These headphones allow you to hear the improfections perfectly which isn't an issue with the headphones at all. It shows the quality of sound being released by these. I will update my review if I run into any issues. If you don't see an update it's because I love these and have had no issues. You might also see bigger and better reviews on the better models of Shure headphones as I purchase them...can they get better? I don't know how they could but we will see.

Update: I have had these over a week now. I have spent way to many hours listening to music with these. I am still impressed with the quality and the bass these can pump out. I notice things in songs I have never heard before. I am a huge fan of these headphones. I will never change brands again....might just upgrade to better models in order to see how the better models perform."
2799,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best earbuds I've ever invested in. This is in fact my third pair I am buying because I had initially gifted one to my boyfriend and I lost my first pair (a moment of silence for the lost pair).

Thank you God for Amazon.com's easy ordering process. Got a better color too (in my opinon). Only downside is I can't workout with this. But WHATEVER I use this to work which is SUPER essential for better productivity."
2800,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Shure SE215-K headphones a little over a week ago and have been overall happy with them.

Two minor issues:1) The plastic part of the L-plug is too large in diameter for these to fit in my portable devices with a case on them. Neither my Galaxy Note nor my Tablet. 2) they take a little practice putting them on. It's taken me a while to get where I can put them on one-handed as they really need to be seated in your ear canal for best sound. The different sized ear pieces help, but they do take a little of practice put them on easily.

That said, I really like the sound... it's even and doesn't have any of the harshness I found in a lot of small driver in-ear headphones."
2801,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Somewhat upped cymbals around 2-4khz band but not irritating. The rest is pretty good including the bass response where some might be wondering. Very clear sound but people looking for a good sound stage and neutral sound should better look at something else.

The detachable cable is not as great as I expected since you need to use the same special cable from Shure but it is indeed a relief in case you frequently get your cord damaged like my brother.

Putting them onto your ears is a challenge at first few times but you get used to it and the plugs are quite great."
2802,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me awhile to get the hang of inserting these in my ears quickly, but after a few days my lack of coordination was resolved. :)) These have very good sound quality, stay inserted (I've never dislodged them or needed to reseat them in the ear), and they do a good job of blocking outside noise. My gym has several obnoxiously loud people, and the SE-215's allowed me to workout in complete bliss. Also, I feel no soreness whatsoever in my ear after a 60-minute workoout. Another brand used previously was NOT comfortable in hindsight."
2803,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These fit and sound ""Fantastic""!! It took me just about a minute to figure out how to put them on as it is not as hard as some others had made it out to put them on and they are ""Sound Isolating"" as I work in a US Postal Processing Facility and they are very quiet."
2804,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First let me start off by saying that the sound quality is excellent on the e215. I only had two complaints, 1. It does not include a microphone and the microphone cable that you can buy separately is not coated with the same flexible material that wraps around the base of the e215's cord to help keep them from falling out your ear. 2. The sound would cut in and out if I moved the cord. I looked online and found this to be a common issue with Shure. Amazon exchanged them for another pair and they are now working perfectly. Dispite the issues I had with these earbuds just by judging from comfort and sound, these are the best earbuds I've ever owned."
2805,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried most of the brands in the market but I've never seen something like this before. It's a complete professional item. Unlike beats by dre(just bass and the rest is below average), Shure has proven in all kind of genres. You actually hear the other instruments that you've never heard in the song you always listen. Material has way more quality than any other brand except those $500 ones. This item is underrated!"
2806,4.0 out of 5 stars,My son has these and loves them. Bought them on his recommendation. Had a hard time to get them to fit correctly. Tried the different ear pieces and sizes. I don't think they are that sound isolating. Especially for the price. They are better than the earphones that come with the iPod.
2807,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Somehow I don't like those active noise cancellation earphones which depend on batteries. This one works very well by just isolating the noises. Used them on flight and while mowing the lawn, not completely silent, but enough that I can still enjoy music and movies."
2808,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones were bought for only one purpose - for use in the office to disconnect from everyone else and not be able to hear anyone else. THEY MEET THAT GOAL 100%.

However, their downside is the bluetooth mic. HAD THESE headphones had no mic - I WOULD HAVE KEPT THEM.
The mic is poorly placed as it sits behind your ear - which is the typical way of wearing these headphones - makes it hard for anyone else to hear you. So unless you are prepared to talk loudly, avoid these."
2809,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds great the fit is amazing and I can't hear anything outside while I have them in. The little over the ear part of the cable can look stupid though so I bend them a little tighter so they tuck behind my ears.
2810,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Needed the earphones for playing drums and recording with instruments and click tracking. They were easy to fit, initially easy to set up and the sound is nice. Isolation is better than I thought. The cords are tough and durable. Audio response is better than I imagined. Highs, mids, and lows are clean and clear. Even for my hearing impairment. They are very impressive and sound good enough to use with players or phone. They are very comfortable. Shure has made a nice earphone here. Highly recommended."
2811,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I own a shure headphones that are not comfortable but I love the sound, so I thought I might give it a try on shure earphones.

Overall, I think this particular model would work better for those who want to listen to music in a very noisy area.
It does a great job of isolating the sound, but I really don't like how you hear your own movement; It's great if you don't move at all of course.

I prefer flat sound but this has that bassy sound that I don't like. After setting the EQ on my pc, it kind of solves it.
The sound is pretty clear and good but it's just not clear enough for an FPS game (I find that no matter how I change the EQ and sound effects, I can't hear some sounds as clearly as with my other earphones).

The built quality is great. It's the most sturdiest pair of earphones I owned. No quation there.
The way it's worn + the noise isolation makes me think that it's defnitely more suitable for musicians who need monitoring outside (like at a concert). I don't really recommend this if you are gonna be in a quiet house.

For the price, I am not really satisfied with my experience"
2812,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried almost every in-ear Bluetooth headphones and these are the best. They fit perfectly in my ear and do not fall out while working out or running. I use the foam earbuds and they form such a tight seal that it blocks out most of the noise when not in use. While in use I don't hear any outside noise. Even when mowing the lawn I can't even hear the lawn mower.

As far as Bluetooth goes. I did have an issue with dropouts but it's not the headphones, it's my phone. I have a Galaxy S8 + and there has been issues with that model. I was able to toggle airplane mode and I haven't had the issue since. I actually think it's a problem with the WiFi Stack and Bluetooth. Also, at the gym I have had no issues with dropouts, even when I am 40' away from my phone.

If you are looking at other headphones in this price range I can assure you they don't compare to these. I literally have tried just about all of them."
2813,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Audio quality is great. Fit takes a little bit of time to get used to and cable is longer than I would like 99% of the time + has a large connector that still got loose over time. After about 4 months of using these, the connection wore down enough where I could here fuzz if the cable moved around at all. I bought a replacement cable but same issue after less than three months."
2814,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for listening to my personal library of music, not as musicians ear buds or as the audiophile's best audio system, but as excellent earbuds for my music. How's the sound? Amazing! Better than my over the ear headphones. Takes a little practice to get the hang of getting them in and out of your ears, but they sound so good I hate to take them off. Someone will ask me a question and I think ""This better be good because the music shouldn't be interrupted!"" Are there better ones, probably, are these great for your library of music, yes!

The sound is absolutely amazing! I have a pair of mid-high quality earbuds I got for around $70 and I thought they were great, until I got these! Large dynamic range and holds those notes at the ends of the scale. They made me want to find my more sophisticated music to hear all the nuances I was missing. For $100 a real steal. I looked at about 12 different similar ear buds and finally went with the Shure name and I'm glad I did!"
2815,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this device to use with my SE425 IEMs. Since Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone, I've been looking for a good wireless solution. All of the options out there carry some trade-off, even this device. There are other options out there, but I decided to go with this since I have had good experiences with Shure in the past for things like microphones and audio equipment.

About 90 days into owning this thing, it stopped working. At first, I thought the battery was just drained, so I plugged it in and left it to charge. I then noticed the battery got externally hot, and knew something was up. I sent it back to Shure using the service RMA feature on their web site, and they sent me a new one at no charge. Based on the device alone, I would give this thing a 2, but the fact that Shure stood behind the product despite being slightly out of warranty was pretty classy.

Here is my take:

Pros:
-Good audio quality for music / sound output - out of the other Bluetooth adapters I have tried this one seems to be the best in this area at least in my opinion.
-Long battery life compared to other devices
-Lightweight / minimal and doesn't get in the way

Cons
-Horrific mic quality. It's garbage. Any bit of wind or outside noise will make it useless.This is really surprising considering these guys are known for making professional microphones.
-The volume of the voice prompts is cranked all the way up to the point of being painful."
2816,1.0 out of 5 stars,the cable is faulty. the left earpiece works fine but the sound on the right one constantly breaks up. you have to adjust the cable or never move your head. I am very much disappointed.
2817,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good headphones. I'm not an expert in sound quality so I can't use the buzzwords, but I can definitely tell the difference from stock Android headphones. The foam earplugs do a good job of cancelling out outside noise, and the sound is quite richer and the bass is quite deep.

One major criticism is the way they fit on the ears - the wires are meant to loop over the ears, and I find this to be very frustrating. It's hard to put them on without using both hands, and the memory wires around the earphones don't fit quite as well as I'd like. That's why I rated this four stars - otherwise, really nice headphones."
2818,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for use as backup in-ear monitors for live stage performance, and for the price on Amazon, they were a bargain compared to other pro monitors (like my Westone Elites). I play a variety of instruments, some of which require precise sound reproduction as well as isolating the rather loud on-stage wedges. Hearing a clear mix is critical, and I just needed inexpensive backups, so I wasn't counting on these meeting these lofty requirements.

These are nice earphones, and I now use them as my go-to in-ears. I even bought another pair for yard work and other activities where sound protection is needed.

I've had no quality problems after a few months of heavy use. These are well-made earphones using durable materials. The soft, moldable cable sleeves are designed to wrap around your ears, providing a comfortable, secure fit. These also have a cable ""cinch"" that can make the cables cling to the back of your head which helps prevent snagging. Unfortunately, I have to re-tighten it after an hour or so of playing. The driver housing's swivel design helps fit your outer ear better. Choose the size of the squishy ear buds correctly (included) and you won't know they're there after a while.

They do have a slight low-end punch that tends to emphasize sounds around 100 Hz (like kick drums), but it is not annoying. (Sometimes you can play with positioning in the ear canal to adjust bass punch.)

Over the years, I have collected a handful of favorite headphones (SONY MDRV55s, Sennheiser HDs, Bose Quiet Comfort for noise-cancelling), and while the Sure SE215s do not match the stratospheric audiophile quality of my favorites, they perform exceptionally well on-stage or when active and needing noise isolation."
2819,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me save you the money. I purchased the MEE M6 Pros about 2 years ago. They don't get heavy use but are used almost each weekend for in-ear monitors on stage. The sound isn't amazing and had some struggle picking up a good range but was good enough to hear the majority of the band and singers. However, when I came across the Shure's I thought I'd give these a try. I disregarded many reviewers that said the same thing I am about to say - the sound quality of these SE215 is equal to the M6 Pros even after getting comply tips. Seriously. Save the money unless you just want the name brand its not worth the purchase. If you want to get a better range you're going to need another driver in your IEM. I haven't tried the M7's but that would be my next purchase before moving up the Shure IEM line to get the daul drivers - talk about expensive.

FYI - the M6 is currently $45 on amazon. The M7's (dual driver) currently is $120. If you really want to spend double the price...buy the M6 and send me the rest =)!"
2820,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a frequent traveler and I have had my Bose QuietComfort headphones for quiet sometime and overall very happy with it, until I tried some sound isolating earphones. Regarding the sound quality, there is not much to complaint about Bose, I'm happy with it and I can really enjoy my music in the aircraft due to its noise cancellation capability. But after trying these sound isolating earphones, there is no noise you need cancel as the noise is being isolated. 2 major features that I like are: 1) No batteries, don't have to worry about running out of batteries, 2) Size, this is much much much smaller than the Bose and it comes with a carrying case, that completely replaces my Bose QuietComfort..... well, I still use it at home, but it will not travel with me. So if you are looking for something light, easy to carry and travel with you and with very good noise canceling capability, give this a try."
2821,5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound amazing and are easily the best pair on in-ear headphones I have found for ≤ $100. I anticipate that I will be able to use these for live IEM . My first real test will be this coming weekend so I will update this post accordingly.
2822,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a gift for my husband. He LOVES the earphones but hates the plasticky inserts for the ears, If you don't like them either, try using the foam earpieces that come with other brands that are like foam earplugs... As soon as he replaced those, he LOVED the earphones. He used http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0078JXDRI/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and they work great."
2823,4.0 out of 5 stars,"PROS: Sound quality is solid for tiny earphones at this price point. Highs are clear. Lows are good enough. More importantly, they protect my ears. I can drum along to any track with the music at a safe volume and still hear my drums through the mix. It also comes with a nice carrying case, and they look pretty cool. I feel like a Backstreet Boy with these guys in my ears.

CONS: It is really pretty hard to change the earbud sizes though. The first time I finally managed to pull one off I thought I had broken the stem. Be careful taking them off, but you will also need a lot of force to do so. Don't put them in the fridge, like others have suggested.

Now to test their longevity!"
2824,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product gave new life to my SE535 earphones! I am so happy that Shure came out with these (albeit with the Shure price tag). I am now able to enjoy the sound quality of my SE535's with my headphone jack-less iPhone X! As expected with most bluetooth devices, easy to setup and pair. Only wish they would make this with the Apple W1 chip for even more seamless connection to my iphone."
2825,5.0 out of 5 stars,"See my review on my Shure EATFL1 earbud sleeves. These replace my good long time use earbuds and I am just as happy as I was with those pro units. Relativrly inexpensive and top quality sound. As a rock musician and a drummer these are everything I need to hear the bassist and the chimes and everything in between. Used with the sleeves they fit so much better and stay in place, however they remove easily."
2826,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because I read reviews that outside noise was minimized and the design held the ear plugs in place. While the noise was reduced significantly, I did not find it as ""noise cancelling"" as some reviewers. However, it was sufficient enough that I was very satisfied with the results. Comfort was also good once you get the hang of plugging the buds and wrapping the wires.
Highly recommended."
2827,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't even know what I was missing until I got these. I wish they were a little smaller, as even with trying on the various ear pieces, after a hour or so my ears get sore, but the sound quality is worth it."
2828,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve needed a good set of in-ear monitors for a long time but also needed a good set of ear buds for listening to music and TV at home. I had been using a pair of Bose ear buds for about four years now. I paid a $100 for them thinking: “Ok, you get what you pay for.” Now, I don’t want to turn this review into a bad one for Bose but I’ve been very disappointed with them given what I paid. Let me just say that they have never given me the sound quality that I would have expected from Bose and this doesn’t count the poor fit and discomfort. And of course, they’re simply unworkable as in-ear monitors.
So finally, I sprung for these Shure SE215s and MAN, I AM IMPRESSED! – and for the following reasons:
1. Comfort – It took me a few minutes to figure out how they were supposed to fit. Then I discovered that several inches of the wire going into each bud is bendable so that I could mold it around my ear. It took me just a few more minutes to get them to fit perfectly. Then, with the variety of little rubber cushions that I could swap out, I got them to fit even better than perfect. And best of all, they just don’t pop out even when I shake my head. And the only time I even notice that they are in place is if I actually wonder about them. In other words, I feel them the same as I feel my shoes.
2. Sound quality – Of course, this is ALWAYS subjective but I have to honestly say that I decided to wear them and listening to some Gavin DeGraw and some Joe Bonamassa while I was reading through the documentation. OMG! I’m literally crying happy tears and hearing some things on my CDs that I have never heard before. Oh Yeah, these are THAT GOOD!
3. Next, I took them to my next gig and plugged them into the back of mixing board’s monitor speaker output. My board has enough of a pre-amp on it that I don’t need to amplify these Shures anymore than that. I work with a singer so, it’s just the two of us on vocals and my acoustic guitar …. but it’s ALL amplified up on stage. I cannot say enough good things about these. I am not the lead singer but this means I have to do the harmonies. This is harder to do that one would first believe and it is absolutely imperative that the harmony singer hear himself/herself. These SE215s do exactly what Shure claims they will do and just what I have been needing.
That’s enough for now. If any pro working musician is looking for the best bang for your buck in-ear monitors, these are the ones. I love them!"
2829,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are freakin' awesome! The big sound they produce is pure magic and the noise reducing qualities are excellent. I've had ""noise cancelling headphones"" from other manufacturers that require batteries and power to work, and these solve that problem and provide much better sound quality too. Five thumbs up!"
2830,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I was looking at these headphones, I was hoping that they would block enough noise to allow me to use them while drumming. I could not find that information in any review on the internet. To any drummers looking at these, they do cut the drum noise down to a level where you will not injure your ears or drown out the music you are listening to. On top of that you don't have to blast your music to get this. When I am listening to something while playing, I still only have to put the music at a very low volume. Also, I play with these in even if I am not listening to anything, using them simply to cut the drum noise. Basically, they work great for me as a drummer. The end."
2831,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these as an upgrade for my wife's in-ear monitoring we use in the band. She says these sound much better than the stock ones that came with the IEM system, and are more comfortable to wear"
2832,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE these earbuds! Use them, wear them, enjoy them. They fit great. Sound great. I've owned three pair. That's the problem. The left earbud busts within 2 months with each pair I've owned. Not the wire which is usually the problem but the actual earbud itself. 1 right out of the box. To fix it costs almost half the original cost. A total love hate relationship. Hence the 3 stars."
2833,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve had mine for years and I’m still using them. I had one cable go bad, but I’d say it was more my fault than anything else. Replacement cables can be found for $30, so it’s a much better option than buying entirely new earbuds. Other than that, they sound really good too"
2834,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I will start off by saying im not an audiophile. This is my 2nd pair of ""nice"" headphones. Ok on to the good parts about it. They have GREAT isolation. Almost too much haha. The sound quality is nice and clear. Dont know how to explain it very well but it was very flat.
The bad... I bought these for use in school or while doing homework thinking that itd help me concentrate. However i could not get past the how uncomfortable they are. Im not a picky person and thought they wouldnt be that annoying but i was wrong. Its very difficult to put on and by the time you get it in, it has already began to irratate you so you yank them out. The swivel connection was extremely loose and would just slide around while trying to put on. Cord is very annoying and heavy.
These are for performing musicians, not for the average person that wants good isolation. I made that mistake thinking theyd be ok for my day to day life. Overall very difficult to use and only mehh sound. Not for the average joe."
2835,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok so these sound good ... but - the wires are very, very stiff. The stiffness even makes audible noises if you like turn your head. The way you loop them over your ear is weird. The noise canceling is by using these foam inserts which are weird to put in your ears. Worse of all - mine broke after light use and it's a hassle to do a return under warranty. I just bought something else instead."
2836,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent bang for the buck. Good isolation. A little weak on the low end compared to the multidriver models but when playing through a PA the clarity on stage is awesome.
2837,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound amazing and are some of the most rugged headphones I've ever had. They hook around the top of your ear and stick in your ear providing a very solid and soundproof setup. The sound quality is great, and the bass in these things is killer. The see through option is pretty cool also. For the price, they're really unbeatable if you're looking for a durable and high quality pair of earbuds"
2838,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are unlike any headphones/ear buds I have ever had.
They are flush in my ear. They reduce noise. They have great sound like full over-the-ear headphones.
Someone recommended these for wearing under a motorcycle helmet since you can listen to music and reduce the wind noise. They are good. I can't really hear the bike and only hear a little of the wind at highway speeds.
I also use them at the gym and they drown out the noises of a typical gym.
I also use them while mowing the lawn, in conjunction with over the ear hearing protection, and they work great. Cuts out even more noise and they sit in my ear flush so the other unit can also cover my ears.
Getting a full face motorcycle helmet on over these headphones can be challenging. That isn't the headphones fault, but its just the way it all works out. Just the nature of the beast. But once on, they work out really well.
I like the modular design as the ear phones come off, separate from the cord. Should the cord every break, in theory, I can buy a new cord.
There are 6 different sizes ear plugs in the package that allow you to find the perfect fit.
These are truly innovative."
2839,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these in March, and only 6 months later the over-the-ear sleeves have broken and no longer conform to my ears. The drivers still work, but I'm already looking at a $25 replacement cost for the cable. Very disappointing."
2840,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Durable. Great sound. Replaceable buds. Please note: durability comes at a small price. The cord is a little on the thick and heavy side.
2841,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Had been relying on Jaybird X2 as my running headphones, did the job for the most part but outdoor BT connection is good but not great. For example with phone at waist bending over to tie a shoe results in audio dropout and some times just the turn of the head. Jaybird products after X2 have fared much worse that I no longer consider them so when this wireless Shure SE215 was announced I was ready to buy and try when available.

BT outdoor connectivity has been solid for me, only time I've ever experienced an audio dropout is when the battery became low and needed a charge. Otherwise I couldn't be happier with the wireless connectivity.

*Update* The Shure BT cable has stopped working, lasting only three months. Stopped working during a run and won't turn on or charge since. I assume sweat my have gotten on the controller and created a short. Too bad as they were great when used with a single driver ear piece but it does not appear to be sweat proof. If you plan to use this during a strenuous workout or hope to use with a Shure ear piece above the SE315, this solution will not be a good one.

8 hour claim of battery life is maybe a bit high but not outrageously so. I got almost a week out of use on a single charge, so maybe just under 7 hours.

I have always considered the Shure SE215 as best bang for the buck and sound is similar here. I have also always liked how they are small and disappear in the ear. And of course you could always attach higher quality phones if desired, though I do feel more comfortable sweating on SE215's than my SE846's.

Controls are good and easy to use, volume can get cranked up as high as you want. Also you can find out the estimate of remaining battery at any time through the controls.

The cable doesn't really lend itself to being reduced in length but I just clip it to my shirt and I never really notice it during my run. I suppose it would only be a problem if you had nothing to clip the wire to."
2842,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using in ear monitors for years now. These little puppies produce a vastly superior sound to my ear than any other ear headset I've experienced so far. The kick and bass guitar are strong and present. I like their low profile so that it's not obvious to the audience that you're wearing any earphones at all.
2843,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these for drums and every day listening. They work great. I would be interested in seeing a frequency graph for these, because the range and decibel limit accross all frequencies is really high. These ARE studio monitoring headphones, after all. Anyone who says that these ""have enough bass but not too much"" isn't using a good MP3 player, because I am using the Poweramp app on my phone and the bass will go go as high as you want. Enough to shake your eardrums and give you an instant headache, with zero distortion! I turned it up just to test it, and didn't last long. The high power mid range compliments the thunderous bass. High end is crystal clear. They are also durable. 10/10, would buy again, and recommend.

Note: I experienced distortion while using my 5 year old iPod Classic but absolutely none while using my phone."
2844,1.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this pair to replace another se215 pair I’ve had for about 1 year that started crackleing after a friend used them. I Love the way they sound but after purchasing this new pair in October the right ear has quit working after two months. (It is now December) Going to try to contact Shure to see if they will replace them. Not happy. I will update when I either get good results or not.
2845,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best bang for the buck. Being a drummer, I always had the issue of cheap earphones falling out of my ears. These wrap around your ear and make a sound proof seal, it is amazing. I should've bought these years ago, for the price, I don't think you can go wrong."
2846,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the most awesome earbuds anyone could want.. My boyfriend rides a motorcycle and that is the reason I got them for him.. They cancel all external noise and deliver a really crisp sound.. He also uses them on the lawn tractor... He let me try them to see how fabulous they are.... They truly met all our expectations
2847,2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: I have now sent these back and had them replaced by Shure 5 times. At some point after a few months, one of the ears or both conks out. When they are working, they deliver top notch and high quality sound. And again, Shure stands behind their product and has consistently replaced them every time that I've sent them in. That said, I have sent them in 5 times. I think that the first order of business to making a great set of headphones, right behind sound quality, would be durability. Earphones are wrapped around fingers, stuffed into pockets, and jammed into bags. They deserve better care than they get I'm sure, but they need to be able to stand up to the day to day demands of the urban commuter.

This is my previous review and I do stand by it. High quality when they work!
First and foremost, the sound and fit of these headphones is wonderful. I live in New York City and they truly keep the sounds of the street and the subway out and the sound of my playlists and podcasts in. The headphones are equally excellent for spoken word and music playback. (Quick hint to iPhone users...go into sound settings and play with the equalizer!) I've been loyal to Shure for the last few years and I have not been disappointed in the products. That said, my headphones get a lot of wear and tear. Lots of folding, wrapping, and pocket stuffing goes on with the headphones in my life. While I try to be careful and use the handy bag Shure headphones come with, the headphones have taken a beating and when tears, shorts, and sound issues have come up, Shure has always stood by their 2 Year Warranty with quick and reliable service, repairs, and replacements. Most recently, the right ear began to short out and some wire became exposed. I filled out the easy online form, sent them in, and within days I had a brand new set of headphones delivered to my door. THAT is service!
I love a company that stands behind their work and their products. Not only are Shure excellent headphones, they are made by an excellent company with customer service in mind.
I'm looking forward to my commute later to inaugurate my latest pair!"
2848,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not ""shure"" if I received a defective product but these earbuds apparently don't have any bass at all. Of course they are monitor headphones and not entertainment boomy earbuds but still when plugged into my computer without an EQ they would sound worse than airplane earphones, only being able to hear mid highs with warm mids and low ends completely muted."
2849,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the things, and use them every day. The mids and lows are great, and could not ask for anything better. The highs are mediocre though, as they start to sound tinny at points, really ruining the mood. Also, the soundstage is great, though I have had better. Sound isolation is amazing, and is what really makes this IEM worth it, as it should be. I would definitely recommend them, but if you listen to pop and other high frequency genres, I might look at others."
2850,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So satisfied with these headphones. They're a little tricky to get in at first, but once you get the hang of it the performance is excellent. I've used these so far in my friend's studio, playing right next to him drumming and still hearing a good mix in the headphones, and on an airplane filled with crying babies. Once these things make a good seal in your ear, it's just you and your music. A+"
2851,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this expecting another one of Shure's high-quality experiences, but ended up very disappointed. Although they headphones were well-made and extremely comfortable, the sound was muddy, unclear, and so base heavy it was hard to actually hear the vocals. Ended up returning these and buying a cheaper but infinitely better sounding pair of Klipsch R6s. The Klipschs have better, punchier base, and manage to do it without loosing the rest of the song."
2852,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the SE215-K in Black for the 2012 Christmas Holiday. Very well constructed unit. The earbuds / drivers have a solid construction to them, and the cable is sturdy.

Sound Quality: Excellent
Isolation: Excellent - (Too Good actually, more on this later.)
Price: Reasonable
Intended use: Office work

After using these at the office for the better part of a month, these are great at isolating me from noisy co-workers. When fitted properly the comfort and sound on these monitors are excellent.

Some minor things to note:
The isolation is very good! This can be a downside, as I would not recommend these for people who require situational awareness, such as running.
The if you are not used to earbuds the fit can take some time to get used to.
Make sure you have the correct earbud in the correct ear. It's easy to mix them up, and the fit suffers terribly if you do that."
2853,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are solid quality, and some of the best I've owned. Unfortunately they were stolen when my car was broken into, but I will likely buy another pair down the road sometime."
2854,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my son as I've used E2's, E3's and E5's in my lifetime and knew they are worth the money. The only reason i give them a 4 start and not 5 is because the seam of the plastic rubs the back of the ear because of the size of the earbud making it slightly uncomfortable. Other than that, you get used to it and it's a great sound, and an excellent buy! Enjoy!"
2855,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great. Very well built. I tried to love these and I still use them, but I can't find peace with the over the ear fit. I also replaced the earbuds with the flange type in an effort to isolate more noise, but the fit was terrible. I've had success with Compfly tips in the past and may try those. Overall these are great, high-quality in-ear headphones, but just not comfortable for me, or easy to use."
2856,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is crystal clear and great, we like it.

Update: After a few months of using it, it is still one of the very best. The bass, mid, and upper-range are all crisp and clear to me!"
2857,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great in ear monitors. It takes a little to get used to with adjusting them in your ears. However after a while it's not a big deal.
2858,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for use on my Harley Road King. My wife and I do thousands of miles each year. We both wear 3/4 helmets. I have a Zumo 550 with XM radio and love listening to news and music. I found these earphones, when properly placed in the ear, block much of the road noise and allow listening with a fairly low volume level on the Zumo. They lay flat with the ear level and don't snag when you put your helmet on."
2859,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a drummer and I bought these to replace my E2Cs, which lasted a LOT longer. I play with an Aviom personal monitor system and play to backing tracks (accompanying keys, extra guitars, etc.) with a click track and guide voice (to que chorus, verse, etc). One day, the person programming the guide wave made it a little too loud and blew my left ear bud. The right still works fine, so I can't say that it was THAT loud, but since that day, the left side no longer works. I know this because I switched the left and right buds, and the right works on either side, the left bud does not. It started with just static in my left ear and now it's completely silent. This is after 4-5 months of use, much heavier use in the latter 2-3 months.

I went on line to see if I can get a replacement ear bud, and while there's PLENTY of ear tips to go around, there's no replacement buds! So don't be fooled by reviews that state ""easy replacement"" with detachable buds....they're not exactly that easy to find. Shure's website doesn't even have them. Searching ""SE 215 replacement parts"" turns up nothing as well. It's the weekend now and I have to wait until Monday to call Shure b/c their tech support is only open M-F.

*** UPDATE 6/24/2014 ***

I had called Shure 3 days after my last review, and they said to ship the bad ear bud back to them for repair and pointed me to their website where I could get instructions and the form to fill out. It was well under a 2-year warranty, so all I had to pay for was the shipping cost to send it to Shure. They state NOT to send it in a paper envelope, and that they are not responsible for the product until it reaches their facility (understandably). So that meant I had to go to the post office and send it in a padded mailer with tracking, which cost me around $8 US. Shure didn't TELL me to send it with tracking, but the impression I got based on their instructions led me to be safer than sorry. I just received a replacement via UPS this morning. So I've raised my rating one star based on the fast turnaround; while not convenient, it was certainly better than having to purchase a new pair. I would have liked to have been given a shipping label via email or some form of shipping where I didn't have to pay for it. True, $8 is better than $70, but still.

I also raised my rating another star to 4 stars because I realized I didn't rate this product on sound quality and overall use, which are both rather good. During the week I had to use alternative ear buds (a $30 brand bought at an airport kiosk), I realize now how far superior these Shure buds are. The molding sleeve (can't think of any other way to describe it) that rests over the ear is a very nice thing to have along with the slider that allows you to sinch-up the cord to the back of your head and allows for a tight and secure fit."
2860,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first you fumble around trying to get the dang thing in your ear, but after you figure it out you appreciate the design. The thick cord material and over the ear design are great at reducing cord sounds from zippers and general movement. They are great for running and working out for that reason. The sound quality is excellent, definitely on the brighter side."
2861,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing quality, great for travel, limits outside sound. Very nice headphones, pleased with the Shure brand."
2862,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing sound quality, crazy good noise cancelling (almost too good in some situations, if that's even possible). The durability of these little 'phones has also astounded me. I have put mine through the ringer (outdoor work in rain/snow, put through the washer/dryer multiple times) and they just keep on trucking with no issues. The only thing I had to replace was the cord, which was easy since it's detachable. Would absolutely recommend for someone who is looking for fantastic sound quality and durability in a pretty reasonably priced pair of headphones."
2863,2.0 out of 5 stars,Muddy sound. Sounds like a cheap Bluetooth headset with memory foam earbuds. Quality for value does not meet expectations.
2864,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great sounding and do a great job of isolating background noise, but are uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. The plastic body presses up against the outside ear cavity and after awhile begins to make ear sore. I ended up purchasing some inexpensive wireless earbuds to replace these."
2865,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from 3 year old Shure SCL3's, I already had high hopes of build quality as well as musical quality coming from the SE215's. One thing that initially got to me was the different form factor which does take getting used to (mainly because the SCL3's were simple ""straight into ear canal""). Also it might be because of the shape of my ears or size of ear canal but the seal with these don't seem to be as tight as compared to the SE215's even though I use the yellow foam inserts for both of them.

Lastly, I'm not much of an audiophile but these definitely have much more bass than I'm actually used to but for the genres that I listen to this is more than welcome. The only gripe that I have so far is the type/quality of the carrying case that comes with it. My previous Shure case was a hard case which I appreciated since it kept the foam inserts intact while this one is fairly soft which allows the foam to be compressed (basically defeats the purpose of having the foam inserts if they're already pre-compressed when you take them out)."
2866,4.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely keeps baby cries and subway noises out. Would be great for people who take public transportation or fly a lot. Not very good if you're crossing the street and don't pay attention because you won't hear the honks.
2867,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are simply amazing!! A little awkward to get in your ear but once you do the sound is simply wonderful!! Keeps out the sounds around you much better than anything else I have ever tried including the Bose over the ear sound attenuating earphones! I love them! Music is the best!! I can see why the musicians love these things. My new favorite way to listen to music!
2868,2.0 out of 5 stars,Returned. Nothing good about these buds fit is terrible and the sound quality is average at best. Shure went down hill with these
2869,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very comfortable ear buds that have a great sound when they are put on correctly. Thus the rub, putting them in the ear correctly is not an easy task and takes some manipulation. Once on, they have good bass and mid range response and are particularly effective with symphonic and instrumental music. Their sound is a 5 star and their ease of use is a 1 star. However, I have found this positioning in the ear a problem with all ear buds."
2870,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Few notable things:
1. One pet peeve of mine is cheap headphones where everyone around you has to listen to what you're playing on your headphones. These Shure's don't have that problem. It has to be ridiculously loud for a person sitting right next to me to even hear a hint of sound. (even in a quiet room)
2. They are not very intuitive in how to place in your ears -- know that there is a semi hard wire that loops over the ear and the earbud swivels into place or just read the directions.
3. These are a lot like wearing earplugs and like earplugs it will pull every little bit of earwax out with them. So, keep your ears clean and it's probably a good idea to have some alcohol wipes to clean them up after use."
2871,3.0 out of 5 stars,"There were in deed, sound isolating. Would be ideal in long-use term setting such as on a long flight. However, due to the stiffness of the cable, they are a dickens to put on. Would or could not use these on a daily basis. The sound is quite good once you get them on properly."
2872,5.0 out of 5 stars,I play in a church band and these earphones have been perfect for isolating sound. The sound from the earphones creates a sense of space and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Best earphones I've had.
2873,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great iems, Good sound quality, clarity, durability(dunked them in some coffee and they still work just fine) etc. They are a tiny bit uncomfortable, as they sit in my ear in such a way to where it's pinching some part of my cavum conchae but I think that has more to do with my having pretty small ears than anything with the iems.

My only gripe is that I got these to game with when I don't feel like wearing my headphones and the sound stage on these isn't very good. In this same price range, gr07 BE serve this purpose for me better."
2874,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I tend to be a little forgetful and leave my earphones in my pocket when I come back from work sometimes. I've had these headphones for three years now and they have survived three trips through the washer AND dryer, still functioning perfectly. The hardiness of these headphones alone makes it worth it."
2875,5.0 out of 5 stars,Noice cancellation is awesome even inside server rooms. Just have to change the default tip and was perfect. Needed a little time getting used to inserting to my ears.
2876,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very good economical professional monitors. Only thing about them is you've gotta make sure you have the correct bud in the correct ear. They will pop right in if they are correct.
If they are on the wrong ear ,you'll have a real hard time getting them in.
But ,their color dot which is really small to see is backwards from the traditional RED is Port side Left and blue is starboard side right. So find someway to label them correctly that you can see with low light."
2877,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds great, if you have odd ears, be prepared for the pain. Fortunately I always have custom fitted ear pieces made, so that issue will go away. Not the highest end earphones, but much better than most of the stuff you get with devices or at Walmart."
2878,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a musician, this is one of the best earbuds I've had in a while. For the price, you get great quality sound. When I'm not playing in our praise team at church, I use this on the plane and it works amazing. It produces crisp sound while listening to
My favorite music and the noise cancellation is at par or even better than the more expensive Bose headphones (which I also have). This is a great buy!"
2879,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really love the sound and the comfort. I’ve used them on stage several times now and the clarity and quality is great.
2880,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I knew with the Shure name on this product that I wouldn't be disappointed. This was a Christmas gift for my 15 year old. It was the only thing he asked for - ""a good pair of earphones"". He loves them. The best part is the spinning ear pieces that engage as you move your head or lean forward so they don't fall out. The sound quality is far superior than any other earphone he's owned. Packaging and accessories are also exceptional quality. He's going to take very good care of these and I suspect will own them for a long time!"
2881,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best headphones I have ever owned.
Bright highs, robust mids. Full bass.
not exactly ""budget"" headphones. but for the price the quality can not be beat"
2882,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good sounding for the money. I do not understand those who feel the highs are not there; they certainly are in mine. Bass is strong and overall balance is pretty good. I do not like at all the stiff wire coming out of the body. I have Shure 530's and they are much more comfortable. They do not match my Hi-Fi Man HE-500's, but do a very good job at 1/6 the price."
2883,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the 4th pair of sure headphones that I have purchased in the last 5 or 6 years. I purchased this set for my son for Christmas. He loves them! I have a pair of SE535's that I use, but these sound GREAT!. Not quite as punchy as mine, but for 100 bucks you can't complain. They are at least as good as my $300 Bose over the ear headphones."
2884,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Returned them as I went with mee audio. For the same price, mee products are much better than Shure. This is from a long time Shure user."
2885,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a set of E2C's that lasted for 10+ years but when they finally bit the dust, I knew I would be going back to the Shure product line. The audio is unparalleled and these are a huge improvement comfort-wise over previous models. If these ever breakdown in the future, I'll be looking for the latest and greatest set of Shure earphones to replace them."
2886,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound after I started to use the Comply Premium ear buds. The standard buds did not work for me. Bluetooth performance has been very good with no problems.
2887,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They aren't primo like the real high dollar ones, but for their price, are excellent. We use them in our band and all of us like them. If you need pro, then these aren't the ones, but for second tier ... pretty fine. I recommend."
2888,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These fit my ears great, I ordered some alternate foam inserts and they feel great, even after prolonged use! Muffles so much outside noise, and provides fantastic sound quality! Very happy with the quality while monitoring a 4-man group and playing :)"
2889,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I researched & tried multiple brands of $100 - 200 priced ear buds (Bose, Sennheiser, etc). After reading a number of reviews on Amazon and other places, I decided to order the Shure SE215's. They are the best! I would even match them up against over-the-ear headphones from Beats & Bose. They provide excellent highs, mids & lows! And the SE215's have an added bonus of being solid noise-canceling headphones."
2890,3.0 out of 5 stars,Battery was only 6 hours. Communication was not solid and had a brief miss/skip in the audio every now and then. I did not think the fit was very comfortable. I liked the cheaper wired Shure headphones I had from a few years ago better.
2891,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great, they insulate noise almost as my pair of Bose QC15 which is high praise for such a small footprint in my bag.
Fit is very ok for me, and I personally like the ""over-ear monitor"" type of earphones.

So why such a bad score?
6 months in, and the left unit stopped working constantly.
When it works it's great, but if I move my head even a little bit it stops playing. It's not fun, especially since although they are very good value, they are still not cheap."
2892,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh my gosh, if you're on the fence on whether to buy these or not, just go with yes, you won't regret it. I've listened to just about every genre with these headphones and all worked out perfectly. The lows come out beautifully, as do the mids and highs, I've never experienced any pair of headphones that had such control over all three. All you have to do is mess around with an equalizer and it sounds perfect, too perfect that I forget i'm wearing them... I've also noticed that I can hear sounds that I've never heard in songs that I've listened to a million times. Only problem is that my standard for earphones is way higher, I can never go back."
2893,5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy s*** These things are no joke! Buy these. Amazing fit. Godly audio quality and sound and crazy good product. Should cost double. They serve as the best earplugs when u disconnect the cord too!!! Don’t buy skullcandy or beats or anything else but these. Trust me it’s best with DUBSTEP and even better with ACOUSTICS and classic rock. Also does great with ANY GENRE including Bach! Buy these!
2894,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for my birthday and I fell in love with them, I attached the white 3 triple sleeves that I bought on a separate order and they worked great. For a drummer there is literally no other earbud for the price thats better. The quality of the sound is great, The noise cancelling is PERFECT. Unfortunately with my stupid actions of carelessness I stepped on one of my nozzles and the tip broke off so I couldn't use one of the earbuds, I thought that was it, a waste of $100. But thanks to Shures AWESOME protective guarantee, Amazon is one of their distributors so I had a 2 year warranty on it! For free! I shipped them out on wednesday and they are coming today on monday!"
2895,5.0 out of 5 stars,"but... these are not typical typical earbuds. It takes a few days to get acclimated to their unique shape and fit. The payoff though is great sound. More importantly they excel at blocking out external noise... whether in the office so I can concentrate, in the yard mowing, and yes, on occassion to mute snoring. I highly recommend them - as long as the person knows it takes a bit of time to adjust."
2896,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones but because the phones are curved they tangle very easily

***UPDATE*** after a little more than one year of ownership and use, the metal wire inside the cord that forms around my right ear has broken and now does not form around my ear tightly. removed one star. headphones still work fine. I'm probably going to replace them with bluetooth or a different style that does not get all tangled up as easily as these."
2897,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Since my old SE215 has been broken after a year of use, I figure maybe it is time for me to try something new, ""the bluetooth connection."" Things were great when I first used it, the product is easy to use and I finally can hear the sound from both of my headphone now (the reason why I changed the old one is because one side won't work anymore, I believe is the wiring problem).
After like two weeks of light usage (approx. 5 hours a week), my left headphone stopped working, and there is only music when my head turns to a certain angle. I knew the wire had broken again.
No objection that Shure can do magic on their headphones, but they don't never heard of Quality Check.
My $100 only works for two weeks, I have no more hope for this company QC, I am so regret that I bought this product."
2898,5.0 out of 5 stars,"excellent pair of earphones, i did a lot of research (weeks) before i decided to buy these. they were the best i could find for the price. the sound quality is excellent. the bass is strong, maybe a bit muddy, but much clearer then comparable earphones, like bose ie or beats. the trebble might be lacking slightly, but the midrange is crystal clear, a real pleasure to listen to. the quality of the build is great too, with a super long wire that is also very durable (kevlar), and an added benefit that is usually reserved for extreme high end earphones, the wire is removable and can be replaced. its also great at keeping out outside noise.
what i did not like was they were not that comfortable and very annoying to get into my ear, required a lot of playing around to get it right. and they hurt my ears after wearing for a while."
2899,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would not use these for stage performance in live situations but they are perfect for listening to recorded music. However, the only people usually used to this type of in-ear are stage performers. For stage performers used to higher quality dual or triple drivers ears, these will disappoint. For casual listener who is looking for something better than stock ear buds, these will be uncomfortable and take some getting used to. If properly inserted (which is key), they sound very good and are hard to pull out from body movement. Quality of sound and build is much better than the Beats or anything you will buy at a box store."
2900,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and perfect for travel. They're small so they pack away nice and block out surrounding sound especially when you put music through them. Skip the microphone option... it's really hard to use these as phone headsets because you can't hear yourself speak and/or know how loud you're talking.

I would recommend for music lovers and people that spend a lot of time in the air!"
2901,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very detailed, neutral and with the right amount of bass/treble. If you purchase these earphones, keep in mind that sound quality relies the most on how the track was mastered rather than bit rate or audio format; thus, given the honesty of these earphones, you're going to listen exactly what the engineer produced, whether it's crap or a masterpiece. So, make sure to get a well-mastered album and choose the correct sleeve for maximum isolation."
2902,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have a great overall sound. A bit of a small soundstage compared to some Seinheisser open-back headphones but good for price and size. Not to mention, these survived a trip through the washing machine. Can't really beat that. What made these my top choice over some other headphones and earbuds was their noise isolating. Also they stay in for biking (not recommended, because of noise isolation), and such activities. I still use over ear for home and isolated listening, but these are great for travel. Some people don't like how far they go into their ears. Still highly recommend."
2903,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice sound quality, about what is to be expected at 100 dollars. Minus one star for the slight discomfort/ cable which is a bit too sturdy for my liking. It is also quite a bit longer for mobile use but I understand that these are IEM's"
2904,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In my opinion, the sound is that different from the bassbuds I owned before. although the bass on these aint that enhanced and heavy compared to my bassbuds which retails for $40, but the bass on these is still very good. the cables are thick, it looks like it would last and I hope so. getting used to wearing these took a while and was a little awkward, but after breaking it in, I have no issues with the fit."
2905,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Shure fan since I bought the SE-210K's that I have used for the last five years. I'm not sure why, but I never had the problems others did with cords fraying and such. I did have problems with corrosion on the metal jacks from my sweat. Also, over time I noticed that I was losing some sound in the left earphone, so I finally decided to upgrade.

The sound that poured from these earphones (the SE-215's) into my ears is AMAZING. I was accustomed to the SE-210 sound and didn't expect too much of a change, just some improvement back to ""baseline"". The music is crisp and clear with great range. I run with these and I had to reset the volume limit on my iPod nano to keep from damaging my hearing. The fit is a bit strange at first...with the SE-210's, I was accustomed to jamming the set into my ear canal as far as possible. The design of these is such that that's impossible, and I was at first concerned that I wasn't going to get a good seal. No problem with that at all, and they stay in place just as expected when doing the hour-long run. They have improved the slider that controls how much play you have with each individual wire to the ear so that it stays in place better than the prior model.

I spent a while debating whether to go with the SE-215's and the next higher model (315's?), but the cost kept me in the 215 range. I have NO regrets whatsoever, at this point, and am totally content with having saved $100 AND getting GREAT sound."
2906,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic earbuds! Those that are wanting to buy expensive in-ear monitors should try these first, a quarter of the price and work just as well."
2907,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are virtually professional sound quality. The cables disconnect so you can change to iPod specific cable with remote control. Ergonomics fit in the ear and stay in place better than any others. The only downside is that the cables do not come with a clothing clip to keep the cable from swinging during athletic activity. I had to pirate one from an unused earphone cable. 5 stars without this oversight.
2908,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, when they work. Bought them in October, by December one of the headphones only works when in my ear at a very specific orientation, which doesn't allow any movement. I was hoping a more expensive pair of earphones would last longer. Would not buy again.

The cord is also a lot longer than I would like. 18"" of cord end up either dangling or being in your pocket."
2909,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great but the ear buds are a bit clunky and after wearing them for extended periods, the ears are a bit sore. But all in all, a great product and better than the old design in which you could not unplug the wires from the buds. In the old design, the wires that made a loop around the top of the ears tended to crack and expose the metal wire strands as the wire sheath got older and stiffer. If this happens on the new ones you can just replace the wires."
2910,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are hard to beat for the price. They deliver nice, full sound. I'm not, however, using the ear buds that came with it, because I really wanted the most noise reduction I could get and these weren't great in that regard. The replacement tips are great, so I now have great sound without going deaf from sitting in front of the drummer. 😉. Would have been a 5-star review with better noise reduction ."
2911,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really wanted to cut the cord between phone and headset. Tried a couple (well-rated) Bluetooth headsets. None of them came close to the glory that is a pair of SE-535’s.

When I saw this, the benefit of not having to tangle around wires and audio jacks to lightning adapters made it worth a gamble.

I haven’t done extensive a/b testing but initial impressions: no detectable loss of quality, character of sound is similar to hardwired. Even the ear wires are quite friendly to shape around my Obama-like ears comfortably and securely."
2912,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these because I didn't want to continue to supply my band members with Shure 535s whenever they broke, stepped on, or otherwise disregarded the value. These are strong for the money - band thinks they sound great, I personally think they sound decent for the money (I use Westone custom ear molded in ears) and would buy again (already did!) to replace their damaged out of warranty units,"
2913,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They work well...but the over the ear wire always slips off. Also, they are not completely sound isolating. I can still hear outside audio, but it's faint."
2914,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my first set of in-ear monitors... and all I can say is *wow*! I've never heard any of the more high end monitors, but these certainly are worth the price tag. I am pretty big on audio clarity and tone and these deliver in all aspects (highs/mids/lows) of rock/metal music. They also work great on-stage when plugged into a monitor system."
2915,5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is my second time buying one of shure headphones.
i cant say anything negative about this product its pure
sound and isolating quality."
2916,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Work really well.

Pros:
Responds to bass well
Isolates noise
Fit well
Sounds quality great
Only $100

Cons:
Cord is pretty bulky. It looks thinner in the picture and compared to some of the Shures my friends use, it is indeed thicker."
2917,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound quality. The stock eartips are decent for blocking out airplane noise. They make accessory eartips as well. I added the EATFL1-6 Triple Flange Sleeves, and now they are better than my expensive noise cancelling headphones.
The fit over the ear is a bit strange, but once you get used to it, they are fine."
2918,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this to use as an IEM. I was worried about bass response and how my drums would sound. The plugs that came with are not that great for my ears. I purchased the triple flange sleeves made for SE models which feel great and basically eliminate all other sounds. I have never heard my drums sound so good. Bass drum is huge!!! Im plugged in direct to a stereo out for one of the aux channels. No EQ.
2919,4.0 out of 5 stars,I got it for lowest price at $59 and for that price this is great product. The design is great and best feature of this earphone. However they have been getting old with the tech in this phone.
2920,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Phenomenal earbuds. It took about a week for me to get used to how they felt in my ear, but now I have absolutely nothing negative to say about them. I used to use Etymotic earbuds (for years), which are also great. I find the Shures comparable.

For more depth, the Shures are much more bass-heavy than the Etymotics. One of the great things about the latter is how 'flat' they sound, which is to say that they don't really change how music sounds; they're transparent. The Shures definitely add some bass, but not enough that it detracts from Classical, Jazz, or whatever else. The cable on the Shures is much longer and more durable than the Etymotics. In one sense that makes them bulkier, but they also can take a bunch of abuse.

Overall, I'm really happy with these. They're just different from the Etymotics, but both are great for listening to pretty much whatever genre you're into."
2921,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Keep in mind the best earbuds I had before where some Bose I won.. and I could never get them to seal right. With the Shure -- After removing the foam small tips that were to small for me (push from bottom and go around and around while pushing up.. and pull up. The instructions say squeeze and pull.. good luck with that.) I put the medium foam tips on squeezed.. practiced getting them in my ear to form a seal and finally got it. Still with practice I am sure I will be faster with putting them in my ears. Squeeze the foam (if using them) and let them expand in your canal. To check to see if you have a good seal, push slightly on them while playing music, if they sound better when you slightly push, you don't have them in right. Keep practicing. I tried various music: Classic Rock, Pop, Bass, Rock, etc. and I am very pleased with the results. Do a Google search and you will find plenty of tunes to test with (and they will tell you what you should hear and when you should hear it) just be sure if you are listening through YouTube that you pick high quality recordings otherwise you may be going ""whhhhat?"""
2922,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These have great treble response, extremely detailed, but are a little lacking in the bass unless you insert them so far they touch your brain. Fitment is fantastic... eventually. I spent probably 2 months fiddling with the little form-able wires, trying 4 different ways of wearing the headphones, all which proved to be not quite as good as the normal way. But once you figure out the right way to wear them, and get the wires formed to your ears, they're some extremely comfortable earbuds, and thats from someone who seriously hates earbuds. The flexible wire wraps around your ear and really holds them on while youre doing other activities, though I probably wouldn't take them running, because the connector doesn't look very water/sweat resistant.

They're holding up relatively well after 1.5+ years, which is longer than my earbuds have ever survived during daily use. The 1/8"" jack is incredibly sturdy, and the headphones cords themselves seem to have some sort of metal braided protection in the insulation. However these have developed a minor issue which comes and goes. Something inside the right earbud is rattling, or pinging. It's almost like the little teeny wire inside the clear plastic earbud is being plucked like a guitar string. It happens when I move my head into certain positions, like if I tilt to the right and then back up. Fiddling with it usually makes it go away, or sometimes I just hold my head still, but it is very annoying and might indicate the earbud is about to fail, but if my track record is anything I'll loose them before I hit the 2 year mark."
2923,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite headphones so far. I am very very hard on headphones and the cable has lasted me about a year it still works perfectly fine for the most part, but i started to notice a bit of ambient sound in them when nothing was playing so i purchased a new cable and now they are back to normal. Some examples of how hard I am on these I have accidentally ripped them out by the cable by walking past drawers, I have had dogs tear them out of my ears by trying to get into my lap and I have even accidentally washed and dried them"
2924,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Used for a couple months now as a drummer updating from a older set of sures. This was a much needed improvement. Why I waited idk. The price is well worth it. Plenty of good all around tones for your needs, and sound cancellation with the foam pieces are great. Where like other reviews I don't think going up to a 315 or 415 is worth the price as you may as well just go up alot higher to a quad driver. Hard to be disappointed in a set of 215 from sure for musicians. Which that is what these are for. A regular set of headphones will have a better stereo sound then these. Although still good but if you use them for what they are designed for then I don't think you'll be disappointed."
2925,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good earbuds. I've had these about 7 months, mostly used at work on constructiom sites. The jack just started cutting out... but this happens to all earbuds/wires over time and overall the cord is pretty tough. The nice thing is you can unclip the buds and just buy a new cord or even upgrade it.

I also wash them the other day(ahhh!). But after a little jinkiness they seem to be workin ok still.(other than the cord jack cutting out). Best toughest earbuds I've found so far and worth the money IMO.

One last thing, if you're not used to having the earbuds that wrap over your ear they might seem uncomfortable at first. I felt this, but got used to them pretty quick.

*Lost my first pair after over a year of solid use and even a couple washes. Ordered a second pair and the left bud was faulty, so I simply unplugged the bud and mailed it back for replacement which was very fast. Thanks again.

**Two months of use on this new pair and the bud that was replaced simply fell apart on me. Pretty disapointed, these should last quite a bit longer. My first set did, but 2 crapped buds in a row is pretty bad."
2926,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My experience with Shure SE215-K and the Bose IE2

I have owned the Bose IE2 earphones for over 2 years and had them replaced twice. The bose earphones are okay but after 6+ months they start to wear very fast. The wire had wear and tear 8 months in from purchase date (authorized dealer) and I had to have them warrantied.
I still own them but decided to buy new earphones because the quality on the earphones started to die out and then wire got really bad again. This time I was out of luck cause the warranty period ended 9 months ago. I used the Bose IE2 daily and it served its purpose. Back then, I was suckered in by Bose advertising and got their product. After looking at many online reviews, I started to wonder if Bose really lived up to their name and quality. So that's when I started to look at new earphones to buy and landed me here.

Please note warranty periods: Bose - 1 Year VS Shure SE215 - 2 Year. To have a valid warranty make sure you buy directly from Amazon.com LLC. If not, you risk buying a non-authorized one without warranty.
After reading many reviews and thinking about the price ($100), I have decided to go with these(Shure SE215-K).

When I received the product, I was happy to un-box them and compare them to my Bose IE2 earphones. At first, it took some getting used putting them in my ear but I figured it out within 5 minutes. I plugged them into my phone ( Samsung Galaxy S4 ) and started to test out multiple songs. Surprisingly the bass was a lot better than Bose and WAY MORE sound isolation. I had another person compare them and they came up with the same conclusion. They are not super earphones like the 400$+ ones but they do get the job done if your looking for decent earphones.

The only DOWNSIDE to this product, in my opinion, is the shape of the wire around the ear. If the wire was just straight down like other brands, I would absolutely love it. This may be one factor to which you may not like the product so please consider that before buying. I am still getting used to the shape around the ear but I believe over time I will conform to it.

Also a huge plus to this product is the detachable wire. If you ever rip the wire due to accident or any other reason, you can just buy another wire on Amazon near $20-$30. So after your warranty period ends and an accident happens, you can be sure to stay in the okay. Unlike Bose IE2, which are totally useless now due to my wire accident."
2927,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones are great. Solid noise dampening, strong sound. The Bluetooth is a little lacking but not terrible. Sometimes I get dropouts even when it's just in my left pocket vs right. (I'm guessing the bt module is in the mic / control part of the cord.)

I know it can be an issue with any device if there is interference in the air, but for a cable that typically sells for $100 on it's own, I expected better performance.

Still, I love the headphones enough to put up with it.

You can still swap them out too for a regular or headset style cord (like for watching movies on an airline's in-seat monitors, or connecting to a device with no wireless."
2928,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amazing! I purchased my first set of Shure earbuds several years ago at Best Buy. When I finally wore them out, I couldn't find a replacement set. I tried Bose, Beats, JayBird (blue tooth), and several other less expensive sets. When I found these on Amazon, I bought a set a month ago. A few mornings ago while preparing to go on a run, I stepped on an earbud and crushed it! I immediately visited Amazon and bought another pair.

The great thing about these is the fit. They fit perfectly into my ears and do not slip. I recently completed a marathon and used my Shure all 26.2 miles. They stayed in my ears and were comfy/cozy the whole way!

Thanks, Shure, for making such a great product and for making it available on Amazon!!"
2929,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these as a replacement for the cord on my 425s. They have good sound quality and basic features; the buttons work as expected. On an iPhone 8+, Bluetooth stays connected reliably, but there are intermittent skips in music, especially when first connecting or reconnecting. The skips are particularly jarring for in-ear type headphones because a skip is pure silence. I expected more from Shure, especially given their experience with wireless technology. Finally, the verbal communication about being ""connected"" is informative and they tell you how much battery life you have left. Unfortunately, the sound quality of these notifications are extremely low. It sounds like a nice lady talking through a muffled landline directly into your ear. Again, I expected more from a $100 accessory to already very pricey headphones.

Ergonomically, the little battery pack nugget isn't too heavy; I have it hanging below my chin when at a desk and barely notice it. When out and about I have it rest behind my head on my neck. In this configuration, the nugget falls to one side and puts a little pressure on the other ear. Not a big deal, and kind of expected. Shure includes a little clip that you can use to combat this but it seems a little hackey.

Overall, this is a good way to keep Shure headphones connected in a world without headphone jacks, but unfortunately the quality of the electronics isn't up to par with the headphones they pair with."
2930,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All my life I thought my ears were not made for earphones, the alwayes don't seem to stay in ,
Until I found these, they have a good seal and a High Quality sound .. I use them for office , never was tired of them _unlike many customers_

Sound 9.5

mobility 6.0"
2931,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want to run these Earbuds on a cellphone, you will absolutely need an amp... they need an abnormally large amount of power to run optimally. I almost returned these because I thought they were defective at first."
2932,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works as advertised. Probably as good as Bluetooth headphone adapter can get. SQ, battery life, pocket performance - no obvious weakness in any department. A bit on the expensive side, though."
2933,2.0 out of 5 stars,broke in less than a year- right side only works once in a while or while putting pressure on the cord. I would have expected better quality from Shure and for the price.
2934,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ride a motorcycle and these headphones fit neatly in my ears under my helmet and block out traffic noise. Problem is the iPhone cords are very, VERY fragile. I wind up heaving to replace them every six to twelve months. Luckily the earbuds just plug into the new set. The earbuds hold up great."
2935,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these to replace an old set of Shure earbuds. They are more comfortable to wear, and easier to put in my ears because the tips rotate. I've been a big music lover most of my life, and this is the best experience. Hook them up to a SanDisk Clip Zip and it sounds like the orchestra is inside your head. Great for shutting out the noise when flying."
2936,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I upgraded to decent headphones a few years back. I found Shure and that's the brand I stick with. I use them all the time. I travel a lot and wear them constantly while on planes, I use them in the workshop in lieu of earplugs, and I wear them while mowing the lawn. They sound very nice, I can't proclaim how nice as I don't feel qualified to compare them with an audiophile's vocabulary but they are exponentially better than what you get with any device. I also upgraded them with the phone accessory and use them for phone calls all the time. Much better than a wireless bluetooth headset...don't run out of batteries either.

That all being said, I have had issues in the past with the sheath over the wires cracking and splitting after a time. This new design, with the earphones being separate, seemed like a great idea. When the cords get mangled or fall apart, get new ones. So, the cord got mangled and I ordered a new one. Removing the earphones and putting them on the new cord, something broke in one of the earphones. Not sure what I did wrong but back to Shure for repair. They replaced it under warranty (they have great service) but still a bit of a hassle.

They are great earphones and I recommend them. But, if you use them as heavily as I do, recognize they will not last forever and you will need to replace them on a periodic basic. This is the primary reason I have avoided any of their higher priced earphones. I would be really upset to have to replace a $400 pair every year (or less)."
2937,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These in-ear monitors sound great, and look good too. Only problem I have is that the fit hurts my ears. Cannot be worn for more than 2 hours."
2938,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm writing this review because I just found my pair in the dryer. I had accidentally washed and dried them and I was a little crushed for obvious reasons. I tested them thinking there was no point but not only did they work, but the sound quality has not changed. They work perfectly and I'm now gonna recommend these to everyone l know."
2939,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, they're big in the ear. You can't lie down on a pillow with them, they're just to painful.

Sound quality would be that of a $30 pair of earbuds. Not worth the price at all. No need to elaborate, if you're looking for an upgrade to high quality earphones, these would be ones to avoid."
2940,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them when they are in - but like the videos said you need to get in front of a mirror to learn how to put them in. More than once. Love the sound and the isolation on planes and motorcycles and cafes, but tough when someone comes up to chat. Bit of a commitment to remove and replace without looking like a nerd in training."
2941,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I could not be happier with these. I ordered them specifically for the noise isolating component, which is the best I have ever experienced. I was particularly interested in blocking voices , and it COMPLETELY drowns out noises in those range of frequencies. I also cannot hear loud noises such as the drone of busy traffic outside my apartment window. Also, the sound is amazing. Highly, highly recommend these."
2942,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been buying Shure for years, but this product is disappointing, The ear pieces themselves are great, but the movement of the cables is audible inside the earphones and it sounds a bit like having your ear scraped with a wire brush. This was annoying both in a gym setting and at the office (you could hear the cable rubbing against the desk)."
2943,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic earphones if you cherish listening to high quality sound, while blocking out noisy environments.

Pros
Powerful bass and very good overall sound quality (I listen to electronic music and RNB)
Blocks out airplane noise and other external noises better than Bose Quiet Comfort iems
They demonstrate solid durability; they have survived near daily usage for 1.5 years and still look like-new

Cons
Not the most comfortable when walking - the wire makes a lot of noise when walking
No microphone"
2944,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can't find better sound for the price! I have other high end sets and these are very comparable for way cheaper. They bring a solid bass that goes well with house or hip hop. Sound stage is pronounced and controlled at higher volumes.
2945,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wasn't sure about over-the-hear headphones, but I wanted the sound quality that these deliver. Compared to others I have tried at this price point, they are wonderful. The over-the-hear fit doesn't bother me because the earphones are supported by the seal in the ear canal, not by the cable. I highly recommend them to anyone seeking good sound quality at a low price or seeking a portable option for when big cans aren't feasible."
2946,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off there's so many reviews on these I didn't think I'd write one, but I felt I have something to highlight. This is my use of them, my content and source. I have an Fiio X3 DAP and listen to lossless flack CD rips. I bought all of this for incentive to get to the gym, receiving them about 4-5 weeks ago. I can say that out of the box I really wasn't all too happy. When first them, as it has been mentioned over and over in many reviews, the bass was very lacking and I found them to be quite harsh maybe around 4K or so. I fiddled with the EQ on the Fiio endlessly and just managed to feel they were OK at best. However, for my use at the gym they worked extremely well, in terms of staying in my ears. I really like the fact that the cords are over your ears, allowing the cord to get a pretty good tug without pulling them out. I'm using the large soft inserts and they are very comfortable. So, I've been using them 4 days a week about 2 hours on those days, plus I let them play 2 days solid when I got them, now there has been just an insane transformation after all that usage. I'm experienced with high end audio and know break-in is important and thought 2 days of solid play when I first got them would do, but it just wasn't enough time. I am now very very impressed, with overall sound quality, bass response, clarity in the highs and mids, and now have turned my EQ off on my Fiio. What I can say, and what should be very obvious, if the music is recorded well, the bass if fantastic, it's very tight and deep. The vocals are simply outstanding and there's lots of detail in the mids and highs. If I'm listening to just general rock when I'm working out, yes there's not much bass. IF IT'S NOT RECORDED THAT WAY nor would there be bass when I listen to those same tracks on some of my other equipment. In contrast if I listen Maroon 5 or Allen Stone, there are tracks that I just have to turn down the volume because there is so much bass, again no EQ. For pleasure I listen to a lot of jazz, with vocals and without and these live up to and exceed what I thought they might. For most of this listening I'm attracted to music that has high sound quality, artists like Dianna Krall, Norah Jones, Fourplay, Joe Sample, Bob James, ect. With well made recordings like these, the headphones are very invisible, and I tend to feel very immersed in the music and forget I'm wearing them. The vocals are centered and they have a very open and airy sound stage. They give a definite feel of the ambiance in which the recording was made especially in the vocals and back up singers. Piano and acoustic guitar's sound very accurate and equal to my impression of the vocals.

So bottom line IMO is, don't pay attention to reviewer's that listened to them right out of the box or with little play time and thought they were less than they really are. And most of all don't expect that they'll be more than the quality of the recordings you have and the equipment your playing them on. If you're listening to 128kbps files on your ipod, you won't come close to hearing the full potential of what these can offer. Just buy something cheaper."
2947,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wants ahead phones that not only sounded great, but could last during a workout. These headphones for that perfectly. Whether I'm doing some intense cardio or heavy lifting these bad boys stay in, sound great and are durable!"
2948,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these, looking for crystal clear sound and noise cancelling to drown out all the people on the train to and from work. For the first couple of months, they worked perfectly. They were exactly what I wanted. Now, all of a sudden, the sound is cutting in and out in both ears. For $98 I was expecting a product that would have lasted longer."
2949,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but not great. They're probably great for the money, though. I previously had the Shure iem's equivalent to these ( I forget the model #), and loved them. These iem's are good, however I can't get them in my ears really solidly. Maybe it's just my ears, but I think it's because the main mechanism part turns toward the rear too closely to the part that goes in the ear. In other words, the part going into the ear is too short. And since they aren't quite in 100% (I don't think), it cuts down on the sound I'm hearing, the low end especially. I've tried switching to smaller buds, which helped some, but I don't quite feel like they're ""mine"" yet. One more thing. I had custom ear molds made for the other Shures I had, and since the design changed, they're useless. Oh, well. They work, and they sound good. Not bad
Joe."
2950,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can only imagine what 315 or 425 would sound like. These are great for blocking noise and focusing on the sound that they put out without being disturbed.
As a drummer these are perfect monitors, just the right amount of everything.
I have tried different types of headphones before some in the $100 range, and nothing comes close.
I would say they could use a bit more bass, but overall they are great and I still give them a 5 out of 5.
I wish the cable was about a food longer, and a built-in volume control would have been a nice touch, however you can always get one.
Will I recommend it? Yes!"
2951,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are worn under a motorcycle helmet, whenever the cables are moved just a little bit the speakers will cut out of one or both ears. Pretty bad for the price."
2952,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After breaking these bad boys in, I can say that I really like them. They have ample bass, and mids and highs that are just right. The foam eartips are airtight as well. I can't hear diddle with them in, which I like but some may not. It also includes silicone tips, which I would imagine would be a little less air tight, but I haven't tried them yet. The cable is solid and feels like it should endure the inevitable tugs and pulls that all cord will experience. And the cord is replaceable, which is nice because that was cause of all of my previous headphones kicking the bucket. For the price they are definitely worth it."
2953,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading other reviews, I feel like I am one of the few people out there who does not like these headphones, but this is my honest assessment:
(As a reference, I am an audio engineer who covers tracking, mixing, and mastering and have been known as very anal about audio quality.)

My entire purpose in buying these headphones was to act as a reference for tracking/mixing/mastering, allowing me to focus on details when needed, and to provide another method of testing mixes in real world environments.

The build quality of these headphones is very nice and the ability to disconnect the buds is fantastic. However, the sound quality is downright pathetic, especially when compared to other offerings in this price range. While the bass response is solid, the mids are undefined, the high mids are incredibly harsh, and the highs are seemingly swallowed up by the high mids. If you are looking for ear fatigue and a complete mess of the soundstage above 1khz, then these are your earphones. For the life of me I cannot understand why anyone would claim these earphones have a good sound for they absolutely do not, even for this price range.

For reference, the Polk Audio Nue Era in ears are a very nice sounding option in the sub $100 price range. Unfortunately out of the three sets I have owned and enjoyed in the last two years, all three have had the left earbud completely fail causing me to abandon them as a reliable option...hence why I was trying the Shure's. I have now purchased the Thinksound Rain2's and hope to have more success there."
2954,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:
They stay put in your ears
The sound isolation is great
The sound is very clear overall and it's easy to distinguish individual sounds in music

Cons:
The tone is heavily weighted toward the mid bass with very little low bass representation (this is actually not bad in noisy environments
Can be a little uncomfortable after a few hours depending on your ear shape"
2955,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best headphones I've ever owned. I wasn't sure how much of a difference these would make with my cell phone, but it's like light and day compared to the stock headphones. The attention to quality is very impressive as well, the cable lining makes it very flexible without getting stuck in a bent shape. Even more impressive is how they don't tangle while in the case."
2956,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the sound from these in-ear headphones, though I will say the bass could be sharper. I also couldn't change earpieces based on the instructions provided. Some more descriptive tips on how to seat these in the ear properly would also have been appreciated. They sit in your ear kind of like a hearing aid, with the cord running vertically up the front of the ear, then looping behind the ear and back down. It takes me a while to get them seated properly, though I hope I'll get better at it in time. Once I do get them properly in place, the cords that should wrap neatly around my ear end up sticking too far up and out, looking ridiculous and feeling a bit awkward. All that said, I still give them four stars because, for in-hear headphones, these to sound pretty darned good."
2957,5.0 out of 5 stars,love these. for under the helmet they are comfortable and sound great and clear. great for keeping the wind noise out. But I can still hear enough with them on.
2958,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are just what I needed. I play the bass for our Praise team and these buds sound terrific, the clarity is good and I'm able to hear all the lower bass notes Easy to install and comfortable. So far they are just what I expected. Highly recommend them."
2959,4.0 out of 5 stars,These work really well and are more than enough for entry level IE buyers.
2960,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Earphones themselves seem to be great, yet the pair that I received appears to be defective. The right earbud cuts out depending on wire angle which I was hoping to avoid with these, but sadly I can't escape this issue still. I'll be sending these back under their limited warranty, and will update the review with the new earphones and the experience with their return service. As of this review I would not recommend them."
2961,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Shipped super fast! Got it next day. Love the sound quality . Not happy that it is not hands free enabled for cell phones or the awkward around the ear thing they added. I understand it is so the cables do not fray quickly but it slows me down when I just want to pop ear phones in my ear. Wish I got to try it on before I bought it.

I do miss the normal Shure 115 M+/"
2962,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Highly dissapointed in lack of design attention to cable. I was excited to order these as I've owned SE215s. I intended to use them for running but found that the cable design is hideous for any activity or movement in general. It hangs long and the battery compartment is heavy. The inline mic control is quite far from your ear. In addition, the drivers don't magnet together or provide other extras you can find in much cheaper alternatives. I ordered these even after seeing other reviews of the cable being too long, foolish decision."
2963,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great single driver inner ear monitors. I use them for riding and working out. This is my third pair of shures and I will keep on collecting them as needed.

My other two pair are the se210 and se310. My se210 were chewed up by my new pup, so the se215 are replacing them. The se310 are for long trips, studying, and work projects.

Sound quality is excellent for the price and the replaceable cables will be an awesome plus if I leave my iem's out on the coffee table again."
2964,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned these after trying to love them for a week. Bottom line is that, for me, they are uncomfortable and difficult to get in and out of your ears. I was unable to listen for more than an hour or two at a time because they began to make my ears hurt.

What might have been a saving grace--great sound--was in fact very underwhelming for me. I must make clear that I am no audiophile, so if you are one perhaps it's best to disregard my opinion on the sound quality. Perhaps I missed out on some fantastic subtleties that have earned these headphones great reviews. But as an everyday lover of music who hasn't before experimented with higher quality sound equipment, these headphones sounded no better than the standard $20 pair of Sony earbuds I typically use. I'm sure that will sound like sacrilege to a lot of people who know what makes ""good"" and ""bad"" sound, but again for an average guy these things aren't likely to blow your mind with their sound.

What I can compliment about these headphones is that they seem wonderfully durable and well-constructed. Take this with a grain of salt, as I'm judging basing on handling the headphones for a week rather than seeing how they actually held up over months or years. The cables are thick and the earpieces feel like strong, durable plastic. This is something that definitely cannot be said about a $20 pair. Even if these headphones don't sound noticeably better to me than a cheap pair, I can imagine having to replace the latter five times or more in the duration that the Shures would have lasted me, thus justifying the cost.

In any case, I plan to continue searching for headphones that are not only durable but also comfortable and sonically impressive. I was able to return these after a week with no issue, so if you want to try these out to decide for yourself if they're the right pair for you, there's not much to lose!"
2965,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than my Bose, Beats, high end Sony and JBL. I even have some Sennheisers that still aren't as good as these. Next I'll have to get some Shure dual drivers."
2966,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds is very good. I use for riding long long trips on motorcycle. Slim fit is perfect for not creating road noise and with foam tips it blocks traffic just enough to hear only honking horns and sirens. I have now sent for chord that has mic included and hope it works as well as this one.
2967,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compact and cancel noises fairly decently when wearing them per instruction. Recommended by a friend who said this brand is a bargain compared to other brands out there.
2968,2.0 out of 5 stars,The sound was incredible but after 3 mos 1 side quit working. My husband was anal about taking care of them too.
2969,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was a little skeptical about these particular head sets because I have read so many negative reviews. So I decided to pull the trigger and get a pair and man was I surpirsed they sound great right out of the box. I have had a chance to buy MUCH more expensive ones but don't waste your money this model is perfect for everyday use. I have a friend who is a church musician and he recommended these. I am very happy with my purchase and will upgrade when the chance arises.
2970,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great, and I like that the earbuds are separate from the wires. Shure has good customer service too - my left driver suddenly died on me after about 2 months of use, and they sent a new one out to me (along with more ear bud pieces and another case) in a timely manner."
2971,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really, really love these headphones. For $100, these are a steal.
As a casual listener of music, who appreciates a nice thump to the bass, these headphones have everything I wanted. The bass is present but not overpowering, details are clear, and the fit is soft. The stock tips that the phones come with the most comfortable tip an IEM has ever came with.
The cable is nice, however after some months, the plastic part that wraps around the ear snapped in the left side. Sound still plays and there are no detriments to sound quality, however I worry that it might malfunction and paying for a replacement cable is a bit too much at the moment."
2972,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, and they lie deep enough in my ear so that I can wear them in my Shoei RF-1100 comfortably. Highly recommended."
2973,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I returned the first one because the Bluetooth wouldn't stay connected to any of my devices.
The replacement was better but it took too many steps to switch from phone to laptop.
I returned it and bought a plug in cable"
2974,2.0 out of 5 stars,"they sounded fine, but the shape made it difficult to get the foam or rubber inserts far enough in my ear to get a decent seal to block out other noise. The cord is also too stiff to wrap around my ears well, so they just drift all over."
2975,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds great, although I'm used to a smaller earbud like the klipsch earbuds. These are quite large! You wear them in your ear like the picture displays. You also must loop the wire around your ear or the wire just kind of hangs awkwardly. Definitely not a fashion statement but the sound is stellar. They also ship with memory foam tips which is a plus.

I use them while riding my motorcycle so the fit is a little snug but its not too bad. Cord is longer than usual, with a 90 degree bend at the 9mm jack, and thicker than most headphone cords. Not cons but things to just get used to."
2976,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not much of an audiophile, but I've started buying and using headphones from different companies like JLab, Ultimate Ears, and Shure. These are far and away the best earbuds I've ever owned in my life. The sound quality is perfectly balanced, the noise isolation is amazing, the cord doesn't tangle or break, the fit is the most comfortable I've ever experienced, and they don't leak sound. Replaceable chord and earbuds are just icing on the cake.

If you aren't sure about whether or not to buy these, I promise that you will not be disappointed."
2977,5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are amazing! The sound is great. The noise cancelling ability is phenomenal. I didn't hear any engine noise on my plane rides. And they're far more comfortable than the typical ear buds that come with Apple products.
2978,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I owned a pair of Shure headphones a few years ago but the cord has ripped and I have been using other pairs that came with my ipod or a pair of Skullcandys. I remember my old ones and I was looking forward to getting these, they were a christmas gift.

I have no complaints except that maybe they could be a little louder, but then I may just go deaf so it may not be a bad thing they dont go louder.

Overall excellent noise reduction you cant hear nothing when you have these on. The sound stays clear even when all the way turned up. Cord can be replaced if it ever rips, a huge plus for me as i have seen many headphones come and go but thanks to these Shure's the cord can just be replaced. As you wear them in they get more comfortable and you will enjoy them once you find the right fit for yourself.

So if your in the market for a great pair of headphones these are a great pair to consider"
2979,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, these things are absolutely phenomenal. These had to be handcrafted by little elves whom excel at producing high quality earphones and sound. It's as if god himself created these. $99 for these? You have to be dumb to pass up on them."
2980,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superior sound and very comforatable! well worth the money
2981,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for two main reasons: to have good monitors for stage and studio use, as regular ear phones tend to fall out while playing drums. My other reason was to own a good quality and durable set of earphones. These earphones do just that! The interchangeable cable allows me to simply buy a new cable instead of a whole new set, if the cable fails. The design is very good as well. These never, ever fall out of my ears. The audio quality is pretty much perfect. Very crisp high end and a very well-rounded low end. Seems to accurately render my music. The noise cancelling is amazing for flights. Purchase these and you WILL NOT be disappointed. Plus, you get to look cool with clear monitors coming out of the back of your shirt into your ears ;)"
2982,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't normally write reviews of products, but I have to say that these are the best headphones I have ever purchased. I don't know if my ears are just shaped differently, but every other pair of headphones I purchased would fall out while I was working out. I have never had an issues with these headphones falling out. I highly recommend watching the Shure video on how to properly wear them in the ear. I also recommend wearing them so the wire goes behind your ears and down your back. That minimizes any noise from the cord rubbing on your clothes. Well worth the price I paid ($99.00)."
2983,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is tough for me to get these buggers to stay in. The stiffer part of the cord near the earpieces is meant to be bent into a form, but mine likes to wriggle around a bit like a fish. The result is that I am constantly adjusting them with my hand or shoulder-nudging them when I am running.

I also don't like the biggish knobby plug-in. It's too big for my phone case to accept, so now I have my phone without its case. First world problems ... I know.

Sound quality is fantastic, however. As an audiophile, that really is my major criterion."
2984,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A bit strange to wear at first, but once I got the hang of it, they are decently comfortable and offer good sound quality."
2985,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my second pair of earbuds after years of relying on headphones. I bought them to replace my Klipsch X4i which developed a short circuit just a bit more than a year after I bought them (and, natch, just past the end of the warranty period).

Background:

I am not an audiophile. I dislike heavy bass music. Indeed, I dislike loud music of any kind. I use earbuds/headphones primarily to listen to the radio and mp3 files while walking (of which I do a lot, in quiet neighborhoods and busy city centers). I neither run nor do any other kind of exercise with them.

That said:

1. SOUND QUALITY

I do notice a difference in sound quality between these and the Klipsch X4i. I think it is richer, but audio performance is so subjective, individuals have such different wishes, that's about all I can say.

2. COMFORT/FIT

It took me a couple of hours to figure out how to use my first earbuds (Klipsch X4i) and get comfortable taking them in and out.

I spent probably close to 12 hours over several days trying to get the Shure to not only fit, but fit comfortably, and I still can't put them ""on and off"" as quickly or as easily as I can the Klipsch X4i.

You can see from the image that these earbuds are both bigger than ordinary earbuds and shaped differently. I assume the engineers figured that the shape/size combination would help seal off outside noise more effectively by putting a bigger barrier in the outer ear. Unfortunately, I suspect that they must have tested the design on men with ears of a certain size. I have to tug and pull and twist all parts of my ear to try and get these to fit snugly. And when I got them to fit ""properly"" in my outer ear, the inner part, the part that extends into the ear canal with the eartips, never, ever quite get ""in"". I could get the inside more or less plugged up only by letting the exterior body of the earbuds sort of stick outwards from my ear.

These earbuds are, not unexpectedly, also heavier than my previous earbuds and not pleasantly so. I switched from headphones to earbuds precisely because I found the pressure of the former uncomfortable. On a short walk, this doesn't matter so much. At first, they are a bit uncomfortable. Then I get used to them. But on longer walks, the discomfort returns and I pretty much can't wait to get home and take them out.

3. NOISE ISOLATION

With the supplied eartips, noise isolation was close to zero. I tried them all. I even tried making my own out of standard earplugs (there's a lifehacker video showing how to do this: http://lifehacker.com/5347245/make-comfortable-noise-isolating-earbuds-for-less-than-a-dollar). I did once, for a few minutes, manage to get a good seal in my left ear but I haven't been able to reproduce it. No doubt, with enough time and effort I might.

Then I discovered ""pluggerz - music"" in a Walgreens (in the section with various kinds of earplugs). These are the standard triple-flanged earplugs one can usually buy to block noise, but they are designed for use with earbuds. I've never liked this style much; I prefer the softer, rounded foam earplugs. $10 for two, but I was getting desperate.

They were easy to attach to the Shure and almost immediately gave me incredible noise isolation. I still can't get the body of the earbud to fit snugly in my outer ear, but other than its probably looking peculiar, it doesn't affect the noise isolation.

Others have mentioned the background ""noise"", the sound of the cables, while using these earbuds. With the supplied eartips, which provided almost no noise isolation, I didn't notice this. With the pluggerz, I do. In short, there seems to be a trade-off between hearing a certain amount of outside (traffic, etc.) noise but nothing else and hearing little or no outside noise but having this kind of hum/white noise/cable movement in the background.

CONCLUSION

I plan to replace these with a more conventional style of earbuds as soon as I can afford to do so. The pluggerz give me good noise isolation, and the audio is really quite good with the Shure, but they are simply way too uncomfortable for extended use - for me."
2986,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is perfect but bass could have been made more richer. The downside of this headphone is just the design. The wire is too long and hard to manage. Other than that, everything is just perfect. I'll be waiting for a next iteration of this headphone."
2987,5.0 out of 5 stars,"these are my first pair of ""good"" earbuds. before purchasing these I had always just bought skullcandy or similar earbuds. After 3 pairs of those had broken within 6 months of purchasing I decided to man up and buy some nice earbuds. These have fantastic sound quality, you can feel the bass, and all the way up the spectrum they sound fantastic. The one issue I have found with them is the noise isolation. My gripe may be good to some people though. I feel like at times the isolation is too extreme. As an example of the extremes of the isolation I was once sitting in my room listening to music on these and someone knocked on the door and called my name and I heard nothing. This can be great for when I'm riding the bus and I want some peace, but it can be a bit too much at times. But for the price you can't go wrong with these. If you want earbuds in this price range with equal sound quality that don't have the insane isolation that these have you should try the klipsch image s4."
2988,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I play drums, and these earphones are very good for the job. No complaints. They fit tightly in the ear and are comfortable, stay in place no matter how you move... A very good purchase!!! And, I forgot, great sound!!!"
2989,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would give these a 5 star but I found the highs/treble to be a touch too crackly/tinny for my taste with a flat EQ. Again, this is my taste. Others find the highs to be just fine. The treble reducer EQ preset on my iPod resolves this issue. Mids and bass are very present and are produced very clean and clear. Bass is not muddy or overpowering, although it can be overpowering without being muddy via an EQ tweak if so desired (bass heads will not be disappointed). A friend of mine has these and insists the highs sound better with the treble booster iPod EQ preset. I couldn't disagree more. We both agree the sound they produce is fantastic and fun. He has the black translucent set. I opted for the clear ones over black due to some reviews on head-fi suggesting the cable being slightly more stout. Also, they look interesting. Being able to see the single dynamic driver through the case is nice. But bottom line, the color choice was not terribly important to me.

My primary use for these is while working out - cardio and weight training. In the 1&1/2 weeks I have been using them I can say they handle my abuse at the gym very well. I generally am rough with my gym equipment, earphones included. Although I take very good care of my things, I do not baby them. They did not fall out of my ears in any of my exercises regardless of me being sweaty. They remained sealed in my ear canal very well at all times. I found that maintaining a good seal in the ear canal is key to achieving the best sound reproduction as well as sound isolation. Experiment with the 2 different types of tips(foam and silicone) in 3 different sizes(S,M,L) that are included. The foam tips are similar to the industrial style ones used in noisy environments such as job sites, power plants, fabrication shops and shooting ranges for actual hearing protection.

I used the large foam tips that are included for best sound isolation. Although, medium foams fit ok too. I consider them my spare set. I did not try the silicone tips or 'olives' yet. I did not find the cord to be too long. I keep my iPod in my front pocket and the cord is a good length for me. The 3.5mm jack on these is on the larger side but did fit in my iPhone with Otterbox Defender case. In general i found the kevlar cord to be very well made and sturdy. Also, if the cord is damaged it alone can be replaced by un-snapping it from both canal-phones. The 'memory wire' that is used to keep the wire molded behind your ear can be a bit tricky to manipulate at first. Placing them into your ears can prove equally as tricky. However, with a little practice you will get used to it. Once they are in they fit my ears as if they were custom molded. I found the build quality on the canal-phones to be equally sturdy and well made. I suggest going to Shure's website [...] for details.

I would recommend to anybody. Especially with a strict spending limit of $100 as I had. They offer great bang-for-your-buck sound, fit, build quality, looks and 2 year warranty with customer service ratings to back it. In this price range I don't think one could do any better."
2990,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want high quality IEMs for a great price, these are the standard. I use these weekly as my go-to IEMs and have loved them. The sound is phenomenal. Highly recommended."
2991,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't like the way these Shure SE215-K fit. The cord is the thick Shure cable. I prefer the older style SE210 which fit and work wonderfully. I could also buy a replacement extension for the SE210 cable which lasted longer than the original from Shure and for very cheap. I don't see an inexpensive replacement cable for the SE215, but I won't be wearing them as much since I don't like they way they fit, so I guess the Shure cable will last longer this time."
2992,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a trained classical and jazz musician who went looking for great fidelity in a budget price. Outstanding sound on these. Learning curve to inserting and wearing however. Excellent spectrum of frequencies. Excellent comfort with the foam tips.
2993,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These sounded wonderful while they were working. I have had previous generations of Shure earbuds which I preferred, a little more even in response (and didn't give up the ghost so easily). These are a little bass-heavy for me, but plenty of people love that about them. I have tried many different sets of earbuds in the 100-150 dollar range and, in terms of sound, Shure is really as good as it gets ...

Problem is, the left side started cutting out after using them moderately for LESS THAN A WEEK. Cable issues, as several here have noted. Returned. A broken product is a broken product. I would normally give 1 star, but must give 2 because they do sound great."
2994,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've purchased dozens of earphones and earbuds for under $100 over the years. (I reserve the big bucks for speakers and electronics.) Starting with Koss and Superex headphones, I've ended up happy with Grado's. But up until recently it's been harder to find earbuds that are wearable, great-sounding, AND that I could afford to lose at the gym or on vacation. So my wife and I have been using some version of Sony's MDR-EX series for years now, and been satisfied with them. But with quality earbuds finally catching on, there are a lot more brands and models to choose from. So with the destruction of my last set of earbuds and the arrival of the value-priced Shure SE215, it was time to give Shure a try.

Thankfully, there were no nasty surprises. In fact, I think the reviews are pretty accurate overall. Thankfully I've had no problem with intermittent connections at the earpiece as reported by a couple of reviewers.

The SE215 earbuds are quality made, and appear quite rugged. Hopefully they'll last for many years, at least as long as the much cheaper Sony's have. The selection of rubber and foam earpiece ""sleeves"" provide a good range of fit to choose from. I expected to prefer the foam, which does fit easily and snugly, with excellent sound isolation. But perhaps a little too snugly for me, resulting in long term fit-fatigue. I'm trying out the standard rubber sleeves now; so far so good.

The way these fit over and in the ears is unusual, but very effective. They retain their place AND seal even when moving around or exercising. They take 2-3 times longer to insert in your ears than standard earbuds, so don't purchase these if you have to remove your earbuds often for any reason. Since the cable goes over the ear, cable noise is very low, but not completely gone.

Sound quality is very important to me. I want the best of both worlds; realistic, natural sound AND knock-my-socks-off ""great-sounding"" performance. Usually you can't have both in one product, especially transducers. What the SE215's provide is more of the former; a mostly flat response with no people-pleasing-peaks. As a result, your emotional and/or intellectual involvement will be wholly dependent on the music and production values. This is as it should be anyway.

As mentioned by other reviewers, there is no lack of bass. It is quite solid, with plenty of kick when called for, but without bloat. I wouldn't recommend them as ""bass-lover"" models; they just aren't bass-shy. Male vocals can be a little warm, but not unpleasantly so. Mid-range is natural and clear, just like I want it.

Due to a slight hearing loss I am not a great judge of high-frequencies. But to me these sound a little rolled-off in the region I CAN hear. This was easily corrected by a slight amount of EQ above 6KHz. (It may also be that I've become accustomed to earbuds with too much high end!)

I am especially gratified to know that an American company like Shure has survived from 1925 well into the digital age. Shure is still making fine products at reasonable prices. There is just no way to avoid those analog transducers, right?"
2995,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are worth every penny. i have no idea how they don't come up as being one of, if not the best for around $100. They block almost all of the noise out due to the foam ear buds and the sound quality is fantastic. They are small and compact and I know what ear buds i will be buying the next time."
2996,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't get these things to stay in my ears! I've tried all the different sizes of attachments, and none of them keep these headphones in my ears. I'm just annoyed because instead of listening to my music, I spend the entire time attempting to keep the earbuds in my ears. Right now I'm sitting in a library trying to get some work done, but I'm spending the time trying to keep these stupid things in my ears. I guess I'll have to do without music. So far it's seems like these were a waste of $100. I think I might try to sell them and shop around for another nice pair of earbuds. I have some nice can headphones for home, but I want a nice pair of earbuds for when I'm out and about. Does anyone have any suggestions for about the same price?"
2997,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved the headphones. They became my favorite brand quickly. I used them for everything from running to biking. I loved them but I ended up breaking them and I didn't get a response from the product seller if I could get another one. If they accepted the warranty I had for it, my rating would be 5."
2998,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an old pair of Shure E2C's for about 8 years, and they just wore out. I always treat my headphones well, and case them between each use, so I don't mind spending a fair amount of money on hem. I ordered the SE-215K's because the I couldn't find the E2C's anymore. These fit great, and have fantastic sound. I hadn't used hem much until recently, but started wearing them every day at the gym a couple of months ago. Today, the left side stopped working. I expect a lot more from a $100 pair of earphones."
2999,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely stunning audio, I've heard parts of songs I haven't even heard of before. However the fit is something I still have yet to get used to. Overall:
Pros
-great bass
-great overall sound quality
-amazing noise cancelling
-incredibly durable
-good warranty
-detachable earphone from wire
-lots of tip choices
Cons
-hard to fit
-wires harden in cold weather
-no mic or sound adjustment on wire"
3000,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound on these things are great. It's even and balanced, and it shines on albums with organic instruments.

The fitting of these earphones is questionable though. If I put them snugly in my ear canals they'll start to hurt after a while. The solution is to leave them a bit less snug, and everything is okay."
3001,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love 'em. They are a total hassle to stuff into my ears compared to any other earphone/headphone. However, once they are in there, geez the sound is so sweet. And these things, with the foam tips attached, isolate sound like no other. They definitely have improved as they've been broken in. If these ever break, I'm buying them again."
3002,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic monitors. They are a little high maintenance in terms of how to wear them. They sit best if the cord runs out and down your back. So no quick in and out, but once they are in place you are good to go. The isolation is really really good. The sound is fantastic if the fit is good. There is literally a sweet spot where if they are fully in your ear and seal well, the bass comes alive. Unbelievable that they are only $99. Very happy with my purchase, highly recommended if you are patient with getting the fit right."
3003,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is amazing! very nice base and crisp sound.Probably the best I have ever had.Yet I might add, it is a hassle to put it on properly. It is not done like a regular in-ear plug-ins. You need to practice!"
3004,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones sound fantastic. There are six different sizes of ear pieces, 3 foam, 3 rubber. I personally use the foam because it feels like an earplug that fits perfectly, drowning out ambient sound. My drummer can now be perfectly mixed in my monitor. Same for the singers and other instruments. There is definitely a learning curve to getting the perfect fit because the cord can be wrapped behind the ear, but once you get it, no one will ever know they're in there."
3005,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never thought that good earphones were worth the money, until I tried these ones. I actually first bought a pair of the old version of these earphones, they lasted me for 4-5 years. Now I get to re enjoy them in their format. The earphones disconnect themselves from the main cable, which is great because that is what normally fails first (as was the case for my old pair). Now, right next to the earphones the cables are semi rigid, in order to offer support on the ear, I still find this a bit uncomfortable as it is something new and unexpected, but can't complain at all. You will never listen to your music the same way."
3006,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These puppies are solid across the board. I'd prefer sone punchier bass, but as far as isolation goes, I don't now of an IEM that can come close. If you're looking for a smooth pair of IEM's that isolate REALLY well, you found em. The sound stage is also broad and well filled, even for non bass heads. The fit might be unconventionalat first, and over time the cord will curl in really frustrating ways, but it's nothing serious, and you can get used to it all.

I highly recommend em."
3007,5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones are great for noise isolation. I use them while on the bus and they allow me to listen to my music at a low volume and not needing to have it at full blast to listen like with other headphones. Also they don't make any cable noise for when working out. The only thing to watch out for is that they may be way too isolating to the point where I miss conversations behind my back or people trying to get my attention. Overall I reall recommend this product for anyone looking for a great pair of headphones. One small thing to watch out for is the strange way to put them in place on your ears since it is a bit ackward at first
3008,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great set BUT..... after 2 years I had to replace the cable cause it went bad. Replaced it with the Shure EAC46CLS for $34.99 from Amazon.
3009,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great for the 3 sets that I drummed in. Left ear shorted after 3 music sets of 3 songs each. So I guess 45 mins of play? Sound was great but they broke quickly and I don't see an option to fix/return.
3010,4.0 out of 5 stars,I'll be the first to admit it. I didn't spend much money on earphones. These earphones had me realize all the parts of music I was missing. They also helped with wind noise on my motorcycle. I highly recommend. They are a little bulky bits that's the only complaint I can even think of.
3011,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Came directly to my door two days after I ordered them, on a Sunday. Really good quality, I can stand them being on full blast without any repercussions, although maybe not recommended for too long. Bass isn't too overwhelming, just the right amount of it. Noise barely gets through over music, unless someone is screaming at the top of their lungs, or volume is really low. The only negative thing about them, and its not even a significant issue, is the cord length, but I'm guessing since they are made for performers, I can't really complain about that. Overall. Excellent everything, well worth the amount I paid for them."
3012,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned 2 pairs of the old Shure e2c's in the past, and while I liked the sound quality, they both ended up having problems with the cable, specifically the part that bends over the ear. Eventually on one ear or the other, the cable would get brittle, and the insulation would crack - boom, you'd start getting dropouts on that side. Bummer. I was excited to see that the new generation of Shure IEM's, even the ""low-end,"" now include...drumroll...detachable cables! Hooray! So now if a cable fails, just replace that part and keep rocking. But wait, there's more...they included TWO sets of cables, one for ""pro"" over-the-ear IEM style, and the other for smartphone use - it even has the microphone and volume controls. Awesome. And that cable has a 45-degree angled connector, which I'd never seen before but is surprisingly effective at keeping the plug in the jack while in a pocket, etc.

On to sound and fit. These seem on par or a little better than the old e2c's - nice, full low end, and plenty of detail. For casual listening, they're excellent. I found them quite good for stage use as well - paired with a Posse personal mixer, you've got a great onstage system. The housing of each earphone has a very slim profile, which looks good and allows for using them in bed to listen to music or watch videos - you can put your ear against the pillow and not feel the earphone pressing uncomfortably against the ear. The memory foam tips that come with it are excellent - a big step up from the old foam or rubber tips they used to supply. I bought an extra 5 pairs of the large tips, which fit me best, so I always have some on hand. Honestly, they seal better than the custom tips I had made for my old e2c's. Impressive. And they were cheaper!

For an entry level IEM, I don't think you could do much better than these."
3013,2.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted only 3 days until the left earbud started making an unbearable rattling sound when reaching high levels of treble and bass. Not the kinda durability I expected from Shure. Will change/update review when I receive my replacements. Other than that they sounded great while they lasted.
3014,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would have given this 5 stars but for my initial difficulty in choosing the correct ear cover and getting them to stay in my ears. Finally in front of a mirror figured it out - the whole thing fits into the ear (duh :-)). I had never tried anything like this before and once I figured out how to keep them in, I was amazed at the outstanding quality of sound they provided. Glad I didn't give up and return them."
3015,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best damn earphones for traveling. Light weight and better sound than Bose and Beats. Great price
3016,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I will admit to being a Shure fan. I have owned a pair of their SCL4 earphones that I have always loved. Well, those became misplaced, so I set out to purchase new ones.

I debated about getting the SE215 VS the SE315 vs the much more expensive SE425's and decided to go with the less expensive SE215's based on their reveiws here and at other locations.

The earphones come with a set of the medium squishy foam inserts pre-installed. This was my only issue with this unit - the foam inserts had become welded onto the earpiece and I was using enough force to remove them that I was concerned for breaking my brand new earphones before even getting to use them. A quick trip to the Shure FAQ online and I found that if you can wedge your fingernail under the white plastic portion, you can pry them off. Shure also has some instructions for freezing the units (!!) to facilitate removal of the ear insert.

Once I finally got the correct sized inserts for me installed, I was finally able to listen to them. I mainly listen to pop/rock music and on occasion some classical. For pop/rock, these things are wonderful - tons of detail. I hadn't noticed that in the song ""Best Day of my Life"" that you can hear them counting in during one of the rests. Or all the atmospheric effects at the beginning of ""Kings and Queens"". I love being able to hear all those details. The bass levels are very nice - crisp and not too ""boomy"". With a good ear seal, I am plenty happy with the sound of these earphones.

For classical music, they are good, but probably not quite as nice as for pop/rock music. Now, it might be the quality of my recordings, (orchestra recordings aren't always the greatest), but it doesn't seem to pick out the details that I want to hear when I am listening to classical with them. If you mainly listen to classical, then you might look at the more expensive units Shure sells. It is possible however that I am overly picky, as I do play in an orchestra so I am used to listening to orchestras from the ""inside"" so to speak.

The connection to the removable cord seems very high quality. It is fairly simple to snap them in and out and the connection feels very solid. The cord is very long and very flexible, which is nice. The earpieces have a small section of bendable plastic right at the driver area, so that you can curve them around the top of your ears. Once you get the plastic formed for your ears, they just pop right in, very easily. I remember always having to fiddle with my old SCL4's and these go in much faster and seem much more comfortable.

For the price, these things are a steal. I wish I could do a direct comparison between these and my now lost SCL4's, but I am pleased as punch with the quality of these and I don't miss my old SCL4's at all."
3017,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these in ear headphones. I live in Texas and I run 3-4 times per week with the headphones. The sound is great and the cord is longer than other brands I've owned. It takes a while to get the cord and ear piece to fit perfectly. Therefore, I gave it 4 stars but it is more like 4.5 stars."
3018,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a Christmas gift for all 3 of my children and they can’t stop talking about them! Excellent quality!
3019,5.0 out of 5 stars,I think the bang for the buck here is the best you will find. Love mine and the six different ear pieces that come with them to find that perfect fit.
3020,5.0 out of 5 stars,The first test was nice. Very good performance.
3021,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally! I found ear buds for my workout where I'm not adjusting them. These are perfect for the gym, I workout at least 5 days a week a majority of the time weight lifting so I'm always in different angles and these ear buds allow me to focus 100% on my workout/music as before I would have to mess with adjustment when I really start to sweat, no more. I highly recommend them to my gym rats out there."
3022,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is amazing. I went from Beats buds to these and I'm very impressed. A little more difficult to put on than I'd like. It's a two handed process that can be pretty tricky on a New York subway.
3023,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking primarily for quality of build/longevity, and secondly, sound quality.

You can't go wrong with this pair. Built sturdy. The cord is the best quality I have seen (even reinforced where it wraps above your ear).

The sound quality is great. These days, companies sell their units bragging it has ""deep bass"" and such. These units have well-balanced lows, mids, and highs. (I rather rely on my EQ anyway, if I wanted higher lows or highs, for example)."
3024,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the fit and the quality, but despite having used the provided case and being extremely careful with the cord, the wire has broken through the reinforced rubber on both earbuds, the part that wraps behind your ear, after 9 months. I'm hopeful that this was just a defective product and I can get it replaced under warranty (left my warranty information at home and at college right now, so the replacement will have to wait)."
3025,2.0 out of 5 stars,I was very excited for this product. The sound quality was great but unfortunately after live 3 live Performances My Right Ear Bud Went out. Wish I could get a new one sent to me. I don't blame to company I just think it was a manufacturer defect.

I'm using them on stage as in-ear monitors and these stay in place when I get sweaty from stage lights...and being fat! Fit and stay put much better than cheaper units I've used in the past. Getting a good ear seal seems to be crucial for good bass response, had plenty of different sized ear buds to accomplish that."
3028,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is good, but after a few weeks using the phones the logo on each driver started to wear off and today the left driver open it's casing. I'm starting to think these phones are fake."
3029,4.0 out of 5 stars,Been using these for nearly a year. Very comfortable great sound quality and noise canceling. Only reason for the 4 stars is that the way they sit on/around your ear is awkward.
3030,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are some if not the best headphones I have used in a while. I live in NYC and the noise from the subway can be deafening sometimes. This keeps the noise out and I can actually listen to my music comfortably. The quality of the cable (which can be removed) is very tough, if it can handle daily trips to and from work on the subway in the rain, snow, ice, and grime of NYC then trust me these can handle a lot. The range of sounds is great, you can really hear the many different instruments used in every song. You can finally listen to music the way it was meant to be heard. Get these if you are looking to listen to music, you will not regret it."
3031,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound isolation is better than any other in-ear devices I've used (Apple iPhone buds and inexpensive buds), but it's limited. If you're listening to a full rock/R&B/jazz/pop band, that will cover most of what bleeds through, but don't expect to have your ears to yourself if you have the music turned down, or if you're listening to music with silent spaces in it, or listening to, say, a drum solo, which just won't cover all of the frequencies. Maybe I'm not using the right size sleeve, but I've tried more than one, and the ones I'm using seem to be the best for my ears.

The sound seems very clear with a lot of higher frequencies available. Personally, I prefer more bass, though. I was used to Apple iPhone buds, which throw a lot of bass at you. However, I mostly listen to music on iTunes on a computer, which gives me a 10-band equalizer, so it's easy to pump up the bass.

The over-the-ear part is just a slightly heavier piece of cable; it's not hard plastic, so it's not at all uncomfortable. You don't have to run the wires over your ears, actually. At first I just stuck the things in my ears and let the cables hang down in front. Now I do run them back over my ears. The fact that the cable is detachable and can turn in its socket makes it easy to align the cable back over your ears.

All parts or the cables feel very thick and robust, and the ear pieces seem pretty robust. I worry a little bit about the plastic tubes that the sleeves attach to. You have to work pretty hard to remove the dense foam sleeves, and I worry about breaking the plastic tube that they sit on when removing a sleeve. It's kind of a delicate operation involving careful use of fingernails. However, you're not likely to remove sleeves very often, and on the plus side, the foam sleeves will not fall off and get lost underneath something. The hollow ""flex"" sleeves are easier to take off, but I don't think they would be likely to fall off, either.

(Note for iPhone users: Apple iPhone earbuds have an unusual feature: The plug that goes in the device socket is extra long. This allows them to work with an iPhone that has a thick case around the audio jack. These Shure headphones do *not* have an extra-length plug--just a standard length plug--so I can't use them with my iPhone without taking it out of the waterproof case I use. However, I bought the Shure's mostly for use with my computer.)"
3032,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a bit difficult to put in your ear properly, but once you do, they sound amazing. Listening to Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"" will give you the chills at the climax. Good bass presence and I don't hear anything missing. Not a huge audiophile, but I tend to notice annoying issues with headphones and can't use cheap ones.

I plan to use these on a motorcycle for both hearing protection and music, so we'll see how that goes. I'll post back if they aren't awesome for that. There is some feedback when touching the wires, which is normal for these kinds of headphones, and I hope that doesn't ruin things on the bike.

I do wonder if the black color comes with nicer feeling wires. These are a little stiff. I suppose I can always get black wires, as they're replaceable (a major selling point for me with these c-note headphones).

The part of the wire that coils over the ear has some kind of bendable sheath around it - it doesn't want to bend perfectly and is a bit annoying. Maybe I'll figure out the best bend."
3033,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I use earbuds for multiple hours a day during my commute + at work to block out ambient noise. Previous earbuds I've bought from both Creative and Sennheiser lasted anywhere from 1-2 years before one of the wires inevitably failed. I purchased these earbuds after reading from multiple sources that they were significantly more durable than other similar products on the market - with the added bonus that they have detachable wires.

Unfortunately, the Wednesday after I received these, i noticed the right ear would go dead when I turned my head to the left. After tinkering with the wires a bit, I discovered a point of failure just above the split from the single cable to the double cables. All in all, the supplied cable lasted 6 days.

In terms of usage and storage, I had zero incidents where the earbuds were snagged, tugged, or mishandled in any way. I made sure to gently wind up and store them in the carrying case they shipped with. The individual wires that run from the splitter up to the earbuds themselves feels quite thin and frail, so I'm not totally surprised it failed here, just that it failed this fast.

Quite a shame, because sound quality from these is excellent, and they're quite comfortable.

Fingers crossed that the warranty plan I got will actually come through and get this fixed in a timely fashion. Will update review in the future depending on how the replacement is handled."
3034,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are pretty nice. They took a little getting used-to, especially in how to put them on. After a week or so it becomes automatic. They really are sound-excluding, so don't walk or drive with these. You can't hear a d@mn thing besides your music. My wife hates them. Some may consider this a bonus.

Music is clear and crisp. I was able to turn the volume WAY down, and still hear everything. In fact, I'd warn any buyer to be VERY sure the volume is turned way down first, before turning the music on. It will hurt like H3LL if you play at your normal earbud type volume and you just plug in and go. Trust me, I've done it several times.

These are probably the best headphones I've ever tried. The experience reminds me of the first time I heard the headphones on a walkman years ago after years of AM radio. A new world."
3035,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used in-ear monitors for many years now. I do have to admit I am quite spoiled in that I have a custom-designed set of Ultimate Ears 11 Pro, which have 4 drivers and custom fit to my ear. Nothing I've ever used as an IEM/headphone comes close to the UE 11 Pro Custom.

Given that as background though, these are solid performers for $100, single driver IEMs. I use them primarily for running and going to the gym where I don't need the sound isolation or depth of field that my Ultimate Ears give. And, I did use them on stage for a couple shows (I'm a drummer) and was pleasantly surprised at how well they held their ground. These are the IEMs that the rest of my band used, being what came in the box with our Shure wireless IEM system, and they all liked the sound reproduction and external isolation.

I do suggest ordering the EATFL1-6 triple flange sleeves for these regardless of your use model. The triple flange sleeve will provide you both a little more exterior noise isolation, and help fit in the ear more securely if you are using these in an active setting like running.

I can definitely suggest these to any band just starting out with an IEM system, all drummers who want to practice with hearing protection and be able to jam to tunes on an iPod and not have the bulk of headphones, and to the active set who want something that sounds better and stays in the ears better than iPod ear buds."
3036,1.0 out of 5 stars,These sound great but I just got so tired of wrestling them to get a good fit. The memory wire is equally useful and annoying. If you can’t get a perfect seal they sound terrible and that is by design. I just lost my patience trying to get them just right.
3037,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll keep it simple - after years of wondering how I'd like these strange-looking earphones, I decided to pick them up when they were on sale for about $80.

Sound: excellent, especially for the price. Crisp and clear across a wide range, and complaints about their bass capabilities are exaggerated. In fact, I find the bass pleasingly strong and yet to disappoint after about 9 months of continuous use. Mid's and high's are great - but not enough to 'WOW' you, especially compared to full-size headphones. But that's too be expected. Overall, 4.75/5.

Isolation: superb. I use these at work when I need to concentrate and block out background noise. Put on some music - even at a mid-level volume - and you won't hear much going on around you. Very pleased, 5/5.

Fit: again, excellent, once you get used to them. The options of interchangeable buds that come standard are very good, and I found a combo that works great for my big ears. Plus - even if you don't like any of the standard offerings, there are plenty of cheap third-party replacements you can try. 5/5.

My only knock on these is the cord. The sections that wrap around your ears and lead to the phones themselves start flexible, easy to mold to your ear shape. However, I found that this 'moldable' section wore out, and lost strength after about 3 months. The sound is unaffected by this development, but it makes them pretty annoying to try and get a perfect fit. Overall, frustrating, but doesn't affect sound quality, 2.5/5."
3038,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. One side stopped producing any noise after a few months, The process of replacing them was very simple and quick.'

I don't like the wire that goes behind the ear to hold the earphones in place. Initially it feels confusing trying to figure out which way the wire is suppose to be rotated to fit around the ear. It certainly doesn't feel intuitive. However I have gotten used to the design and it is easy to put the wire in the correct position now.

My complaint is that the wire does not stay in a strong position. It constantly feels loose, and even though the headphones stay on fine, I find myself wishing the wire provided a more snug fit.

One of the things I love most about the headphones is their flat profile. I very often listen to music in bed before sleeping and end up on my sides a lot. With my other headphones this is uncomfortable because they put extra pressure on the ear. The flat profile of this earbuds helps to relieve that pressure a lot when my head is pressed against the pillow."
3039,2.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, I thought it was only okay. I needed a replacement after my Meelectronics A161P broke. A161P set a high standard for sound quality for me, so although this pair was great on certain points, it just did not meet my expectations.

Pros
- Excellent sound isolation - I wore these while commuting on the train, so that's a huge plus
- Mids and highs were great
- Cables were thick and gave the impression of sturdiness, and the ability to replace the cable is a nice thought

Cons:
- Fussy, clunky and uncomfortable - People warned about this, true, but I still wanted to give it a shot. I've never had to adjust earbuds so much! They felt too big in my ears and would often stick out. Also, I had to adjust the cable over my ears too often. It's a deal breaker.
- Not balanced - bass heavy. The bass level was too distracting for me. This was disappointing because many reviews hailed this pair as being ""balanced"". Clearly, it's not. If you like extra bass, this would be a nice feature, but not for me.
- Sitting unmoving was fine, but once I started walking, every move I made produced that ""underwater"" feeling. Also very distracting. I've had a few other noise isolation earbuds where this was a minor setback.
- Cable was too long. When walking around it can get caught on stuff
- Didn't care for the carry case

Over all, for how much it cost and the list of cons, I felt compelled to return this item. After this pair, I realized that I much prefer balanced armature earbuds like Meelectronics A161P. The only gripe I had about A161P was that the cables were flimsy and so the pair didn't even last a year. But the noise isolation was also excellent, and the ""underwater"" feeling was minimal compared to this pair. (If you love extra bass, you would probably not like the A161P.)

So next I got Etymotic HF2 (similar price level), and I'm far happier with that because it has:
- Balanced armature drivers and to me more sound balanced than these Shures (great mids, highs, and bass level was strong but not overpowering)
- Excellent sound isolation
- Not clunky and fit well in my ears
- ""Underwater"" feeling was minimal
- Cable length was just right and seems sturdy
- Nice carry case"
3040,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for earphones to listen to sleep sounds at night. All others I tried were too bulky or poorly constructed. I had the westone um-1 earphones and they were okay but the right ear stopped working. These shure's are durable, non-instrusive and sound great. I love that the cord breaksaway so I have no fear of choking myself at night. Definetly recommend these if your need some to use for sleeping."
3041,4.0 out of 5 stars,Solid headphones. My only gripe is that they fit strangely around the ears. It's a hassle setting them up.
3042,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair. The first set broke after a couple years but I sort of abused them. The sound on these things is absolutely amazing, coming from a life of $20-30 headphones.

The foam buds are very comfortable and excellent at isolating sound, it ships with three rubber sizes and three foam sizes."
3043,4.0 out of 5 stars,"very good, great for a transatlantic flight and i can drone out everyone else, it was impossible to fall asleep with big noise cancelling headphones. The sure are flush with my ears."
3044,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Really wanted to love the freedom of bluetooth for my SE425's but the novelty wears off really quickly.

Pro's: great battery life

Con's:
1. Reduced sound quality. You lose the crispness and hi fidelity that makes you buy Shure in the first place. There's a constant buzzing/feedback that you can hear when the music is paused.
3. The design is frustrating at best. Ok so you can clip the battery pack to the back of your shirt and everything is fine, but then the mic/controls are behind your head... means that you have to adjust your setup every time you want to answer a call because the phone will prefer the bluetooth mic unless you disconnect the entire set. You have to wear the cable in front of you to use the mic, but the earphones are designed to loop over your ears and tie in the back, making it really awkward. And why does Shure insist on using memory wire? It adds bulk and weight to the ears, greatly increasing ear fatigue; I had to take a break after a few hours, which is not something I worry about with my cables (I removed the memory wire on those as well).
2. For a company known to make microphones, this Mic is utterly useless. Even when directly in your face the sound comes out very low quality and breaks here and there. Forget about using it if you tie the cables behind your head."
3045,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You really can't hear anyone when you have these on, which is pretty amazing, because I never really want to hear anyone.

removing the foam attachments is difficult. Once you get the technique down, it becomes easier. Best way to do it is to take something non-metalic (end of credit card, etc) and push from the bottom up on the center rubber body of the foam attachment.

Anyway, sound on these is amazing. I can't say I've tried earbuds that sound better than these. For $100, they blow away just about everything"
3046,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality when working correctly. The problem is that if you use these working out they need constant cleaning. Never really got a true fit out of these and they lasted 18 months before one of the ears stopped working. The ability to change cables seems to create additional problems. I bought them for $100 and thought I would get more out of them. They are not water resistent in the least bit. Overall I would rate these as fair. I refuse to pay more then $100 for any earbuds since the mark up on these product is so significant.
3047,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones, they are my second pair, replacing an older pair I had. The sound is great!
I do have a ""complaint"" about this particular pair, they don't fit my ears near as well as my previous pair nor any other Shure in-ears I've used. They keep falling out during live performances and that's getting annoying. Not sure what's different, our family owns 5 pairs and they all fit well except this pair."
3048,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The left headphone cable started cutting in and out when moved after the first week of owning them. They have a 2 year warranty, but require me to send the cable back first before they will issue a replacement. I fly 2+ times a week and like to use these on my flights and don't really want to have any downtime without them. Bummed. For such a big company you'd think that they had an advanced ship warranty solution with a credit card hold so I could continue ""using"" them until the cable arrived. Also Shure does not cover the shipping of the cable back to them for warranty...figure it out Shure."
3049,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been keeping these as backup headphones since using them. My Audio Technica ATH-M50x pair broke after a few years, but these sound almost as good as those. I highly recommend these for anyone who wants to have a pair of in-ears or to have as a backup pair."
3050,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent sound. Not for gaming as positional audio is terrible on fps's(at least in my experience). However thats not what I got them for. Their profile allows you to sleep with them on your side pretty comfortably,not perfectly, and the sound isolation is good enough that I can barely hear the mower when doing the lawn!"
3051,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are worth every penny, best headphones I've ever owned and I've owned EVERY type you could imagine. They were recommended to me by my boyfriend who works in music and uses them in sound checking for pretty big bands."
3052,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate writing reviews, but feel as thought I owe it to the folks at Shure. This pair of headphones is easily my favorite piece of audio equipment I have ever owned. When it comes to traveling or casual listening, these phones have the best definition you would ever need for such purposes. Furthermore, if there is ever any deterioration of the actual headphone cables, they are inexpensive and very easy to replace.

Keep up the good work!"
3053,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the low profile. I can keep these on under a helmet which was key for my choice. The sound is great, though it is often hard to get the plugs to sit well enough in the ear canal to have it sound 'best'. The long cord is both a pro and a con depending on the situation, but it's always better to error on the side of length (too short is the worst)."
3054,3.0 out of 5 stars,Part of the cord was missing when we got it. When we got the replacement we realized that the first one was a fake...Shure has been given the info and is investigating. My son likes the real pair though.
3055,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great. Durable and nice sound quality.
3056,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got these, and coming from a pair of Sennheiser CX215's, I can easily say these are the best earphones I've ever used. Very clean sound compared to anything I've used before, a nice amount of bass, and I'm hearing details in my music that my cheaper earphones just cannot show. I never knew what I was missing, always going with cheap, budget earphones and headphones, but now I can safely say that I'm never going back."
3057,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect sounds, great bass, sound isolating and very comfortable to wear. My last 3 sets of headphones I have purchased were Shure brand and I am so impressed. So much better than Bose and a better price."
3058,1.0 out of 5 stars,"One side started to fail after only about a month of moderate use. It works most of the time, but sometimes cuts out intermittently. This is way too fast for a $100 pair of headphones to stop working.. Even if it is just the replaceable cable."
3059,5.0 out of 5 stars,"note 1: ALL Shure earbuds WILL experience problems after 6 months. however, Shure provides excellent 2-yr warranty. you ship the merchandise back to Shure and they return good units in about 2 weeks.

note 2: SE215CL or SE215K?
according to Shure, they are one and the same except the casing and wire, CL is ""clear"" transparent casing and wiring. K is black casing and wiring. i own BOTH however, for some reasons i found the K (black) much better sound than CL. if i had to do it again, i will go for K (black casing).

i have been using Shure earbuds since 2005
e3c, e5c, SE215, SE435.... all extremely good earbuds priced from $100-$400.
by my assessment, SE215 is the best earbud ($99) consider the price to benefit ratio
no doubt you get better more refined sound in SE435 and e5c (discontinued) but the additional pricing (300% more) certainly does not deliver 300% better sound. i would say for the additional $200 you pay for SE435, you get at best 10%-15% better sound compared to the SE215.

conclusion:
if money is not an issue, buy the SE435 or even SE535, they are really good.
but if you want to be smart consumer, and don't mind 10%-15% less sound quality, SE215K is what you need."
3060,3.0 out of 5 stars,I use these in the gym and they work great. Battery life is decent at 6 hours but 8 hours would have made a big difference. I never loose connection and the sound quality is pretty good. However placing the in-line control so far from the ear piece is extremely uncomfortable to access if you want to wear these with the cable behind your head. This prevents me from wanting to use them most of the time being as I use the controls often to change music and volume. I don't understand why it would be designed this way. Additionally the cable could be a little shorter. It's the little details that prevent a good product from being great.
3061,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent for the price, only a shade behind the Westone 3's which are quite a bit more expensive. Not fatiguing at all, very natural sounding, very accurate. I had a number of the old Shures which were never particularly good or fun to listen. These have come a very very long way."
3062,1.0 out of 5 stars,"what is the problem, after few weeks the the bluetooth cable stop working unless I connect it to a power source, help please. btw battery is full."
3063,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these. I did notice however that the ideal bits to use are the memory foam ends and not the silicone ends because the silicone hurt my ears when I'm removing them after use. Another down side is that the ends right out of the buds are very stiff and you have to wrap them around your ears for them to fit but once they are in, they are definitely not going anywhere. The sound quality far exceeded my expectations because after I saw a mediocre low range, I was surprised when the low end was crystal clear and definitely present. I strongly recommend these earbuds if you are comparing these to beats. You are only paying for Dr. Dre's naming in development with the beats."

3069,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These fit nicely, especially if you're playing in a band. They're comfortable and come with a few different earpieces. I don't abuse them so I don't know how tough they are. I have worn them with my ipod too and they sound fantastic."
3070,2.0 out of 5 stars,I got these ear-buds early december (about 2.5 months ago). The right speaker has cut out and isn't making any noise. This sounds like a speaker failure rather than wiring issue since there was no crackling or gradual decline in sound quality. My return window has passed so I'm currently furious about spending $100 on earbuds that lasted less than three months. I used them lightly and never worked out with them.

3072,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my third set of SE215s. Each set lasts me over a year, which is impressive. I go through cheap headphones in less than 3 months. Aside from being fairly durable, the sound quality on these is stellar - I'll buy a 4th set when these wear out."
3073,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these ear buds!!!!! I thought that these buds compared to the last pair of Sennheiser buds that I had purchased and were more comfortable. More comfortable, but had a very crisp high ends. This was great, but to me the bass was a bit compromised at times. If you run an EQ this becomes a moot point and most audio sources have a downloadable EQ. After I bought these last year I sprung for some really upscale buds, i.e., the Sennheiser IE80's. I think that at this point that I've reached perfection to my ears........"

3076,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love using them riding my motorcycle. they are a bit stiff to wrap around your ears at first. I wish they made the same cable as the stock one but with the skip song and answer a call option on the cable. The stock cable is awesome though, very flexible and strong."
3077,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic sound and sound isolation. Not too comfortable when worn for more than an hour. Very high quality build, especially the Kevlar coated wires. Compared to a pair of Bose active sound isolating headphones, these are cheaper, more discreet and deliver comparable results in terms of sound and sound isolation. A great product if comfort is not your first priority. Make sure you insert them as deep as possible and keep the volume low... The sound is delivered very very close to your eardrums."
3078,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Effective on the airplane. I also like the sound quality of these SE215-CL, but after I wear them for a long time my ears begin to hurt.

I got these for my wife, who wanted good sound quality but a more reasonable price. I got my SE530's about 6 years ago, so the brand has changed a bit since then.

The detachable cables are a great feature. The old earphones had a nasty habit of splitting where the wire went into the earpiece, leaving you with dud plugs. This makes cleaning the wires easy, and replacing them when they break easier.

The clear plastic is cool I guess. I don't really care one was or another since they go where I can't see them, but it is certainly a different style.

What I don't like is the metal wire in the speaker wire where it meets the earbud. The idea is that you can bend it into a shape that fits your ear, but my favorite part about the Shure buds was that they wrap around your ear easily and snugly. The stiff wire actually makes this harder, especially with the new detachable cable.

Still, the sound quality is stellar, and when I need new headphones, I'll get Shures, for sure."
3083,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones take a bit of fiddling to get a nice, tight fit. But once you get the fit right, they provide outstanding sound-isolation and fidelity. If you wear the cord behind your head, they never accidentally get pulled out of your ears. Excellent ergonomics."
3084,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect good
3085,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, great noise isolation, long lasting. I am torn about whether to reduce them by 1 star for price/value, but I got a previous pair replaced by Shure without discussion after long time use, so will stay with 5 stars."
3086,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are absolutely worth the money. You won't be disappointed. We wear them while motorcycling and I never miss a single nuance whether it's Wagner or Pink Floyd. I love these things!! At the gym I'm never bothered by other chatters or peoples loud tromping on the treadmills anymore, talk about total noise cancelation!"
3087,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing about these IMHO is the isolation. You can really tune out noisy on-stage sources with these. Also the price is right. I wouldn't go any cheaper. I like the biggest single-flange gels.
3088,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a gift for my wife and she loves them.
She plays in a band and had not used in ear monitors before. Easy fit and great sound."
3089,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great noise-isolating headphones that are incredibly comfortable to wear once the ear buds are sized correctly. Very good at isolating noise on a plane. Great sound quality. Carry case makes it easy to travel with. Would highly recommend.
3090,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These IEMs are great! As an entry level audiophile I searched the web high and low to find the best pair of IEMs for me and I'm happy to say that I think the SE215's are them. This is my third or fourth set up nicer IEMs and all I can say is that these have absolutely no business sounding this good. For less than $100 you are going to change the way that you think about music. The only word of caution that I give is to give the memory cable some time, a few of my friends (whom I convinced to buy some 215s) loved the sound but simply couldn't get used to the way that the cord laid over their ears -- after a bit of time they too fell in love though."
3091,5.0 out of 5 stars,allows me versatility
3092,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As other reviewers have said, the sound quality of these in ear monitors is very impressive. I will not get technical and break down the frequency response curve and such since others have already done so. I will simply say that to me they sound great. the only problem for me is that the outer part of my ears where the body of the iem sits is on the small side, so they do become uncomfortable for me to ware for long periods. But oh the do sound so good."
3093,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these as a replacement for Shure E2C earphones that I've had for 6+ years and which still work although the insulation around the wires is cracking a lot which is the only reason I'm replacing them. I've had the SE215s for several months and the sound is just as good ad my old E2Cs with excellent, rich, deep sound and phenominal noise reduction. I'm not an audiophile and listen mainly to jazz and classical -- never rock. The sound quality of these earphones is great, as good as if I'm listening to my large floor speakers playing from my stereo.

Noise reduction is phenominal, just like my old E2C earphones. I wear these on the NYC subway which is extremly noisy and never have to raise the volume which I keep somewhat low. Ditto at the gym where music is blaring over the loudspeakers and it doesn't bother me (that's why I bought my E2Cs in the first place, so I could listen to my music at the gym).

Sometimes I will plug the the earphones into my ear and not listen to anything, just to use them as ear plugs so I can sleep on public transportation.

The problem is with the cords. These earphones, like the old E2Cs, are worn by wrapping the cord over the ear -- it's bizarre if you've never used them before but I got very used to it on my E2Cs and loved them. However, the SE215s have a much, much thicker cord that simply does not bend enough and has never conformed to the shape around my ear. It alwasy feels like they're falling out. And if I try to have the cords go down my back it's even worse. These heavy duty cords, which I am sure will last a long time, are the only reason I don't give it a full 5 stars.

Update 12/25/14: Just thought I'd mention that after two years of frequent I have the following additional comments:
1. The stiffness of the cord as it bends around my ear is still an issue. Much less that when it was new, certainly, but it's still an issue

2. Of perhaps greater importance is that if you use this with a phone, such as I do with an iPhone 5s, and you put the phone in a case, you will very possibly NOT be able to plug it into the phone without an extender or without taking the phone partially out of the case. The plug is a standard 3.5mm male jack but the casing or jacket around it is so thick that it does not insert into the phone's jack while the case on. In fact, the diameter of the casing around the plug is actually greater than the depth of the 5s!. I am sure this was done to make the whole thing sturdier and lasting but it creates a problem. When I first got these earphones I had a different device with a case that had a huge opening and it wasn't an issue. But it's an issue with my iPhone 5s case and it would be an issue with every iPhone case I've looked at. You need to buy an extender or partially remove it from the case. If you don't use a case then it's not an issue"
3094,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good build quality and comfort, they won't fall down from my ears. Good and detailed sound. I was using a pair of se-112 and it is an improvement both in build and sound quality"
3095,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds with top quality build, top quality cord, top quality sound.. there just is no way to describe how immaculate these earbuds sound. Every pitch, every range, every punch in the bass can be heard and it can be felt. Music resonates more than it ever has for me.. shure has my money in the long run."
3096,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic. I use them when riding my motorcycle and the sound is great and the fit is great, considering my full-face helmet slips on over them in my ears. They stay in place and they don't hurt even after hundreds of miles of riding."
3097,5.0 out of 5 stars,These sound fantastic. Bass is solid and clear. Music comes through well rounded and way better than any of the Bose earphones I previously owned. I would also argue these are as good or better at killing off the background noise once the music is on.
3098,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure makes a quality product, these are no exception and the prices Amazon sells them at are pretty insane. These earbuds will absolutely destroy the ambient noise around you with no active noise cancellation tomfoolery. They have insanely good bass as long as you wear tips that fit you properly. Make sure you do that. Response is all-around fantastic, the bass is just so striking from such a small package.

The only problem is they're easy to lose. It's just a good excuse to upgrade to the most recent model."
3099,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For my application I could give these a 4+ but the lows aren't really there so overall, they're a 3. I use them for vocals only and the band has to ""pass thru"" since they aren't in the monitor mix. The result- I can here the band and my drums clearly although the volume is lower and and I can control how much vocal I get in my ears. As a plus, I'm able to lower the overall volume to my ears. If the band were in the monitor mix, I think I would want something with a little more low end response, but for this very specialized application, they are perfect, especially at this price point."
3100,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shure makes the best sounding in ear headphones. I have been using shure headphones for 20 years and this is the third model in ear I have purchased. I have tried others but nothing sounds better than shure./ I love them
3101,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounding earphones! The sound isolation is better than I expected. I ride a loud motorcycle with a half helmet, so wind noise always drowned out the music at highway speeds. With these in, I can actually hear the music without cranking the volume to max. My only complaint is that it's so hard to change the earpieces. Luckily the medium foam fits well, because it feels like I'll break the stem if I try any harder to remove them."
3102,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, the isolation is perfect for my noisy work office. I was thinking about going with some bass boosted headphones but these deliver great bass as it is. I got the EATFL1-6 Triple Flange Sleeves as well since the foam ear buds that came stock did not fit well when I would sweat while working out. Even just with the headphones in and no music playing I can barely hear anyone in my office."
3103,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product overall, but I have no idea why the wire is about 300 feet long. I'm gonna need a hose reel to keep this thing together. If it didn't work so well I might be inclined to cut it in half use it as the world's most expensive pair of shoe laces."
3104,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son (a drummer) loves these. He wears them live when playing with a band and also when practicing with recorded music. Much higher quality than any common ""ear bud"" style headphones; these are professional quality sound equipment."
3105,4.0 out of 5 stars,So just got these headphones yesterday and after listening to them today I've noticed how the volume turns down on it's own or that the music just stops playing... I don't know if I got a defected one or what the problem is but overall they're not that bad.. I did think they'd be louder than what they are though but they do block out outside noise which is a huge plus
3106,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product in that it adds BT to existing support SHURE SE earbuds. However, after two months, the battery quickly drains in off mode within 48 hours and the fit around the back of the neck is awkward. I have a call into support to see if I can get it warrantied."
3107,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. They almost sound as good as my $300 Bose noise cancelling headphones. Highly recommended for the money.
3108,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy
3109,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality on these earphones is amazing for the pricepoint.

Only complaint:Learning how to fit them over your ear does take some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it they fit super snug."
3110,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You have to get used to how they have to be positioned in your ear, but after that - these are fantastic for the price!"
3111,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my third pair of Shure's, and the first that I've had any trouble wearing. They're much bigger than the SE115s I am trying to replace, the stiff cord around the ears near is annoying, but the real problem was the size and shape of the ear buds vs the size and shape of my ears. Without proper positioning, you don't get good sound, but putting them in that position was painful. They did sound good, but I am not going to endure any kind of pain just to listen to my iPod. Bring Back The SE115s!!"
3112,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and fit. I have had many pairs of Shure wired and these do not disappoint.
3113,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old E5c's finally died on me after many years of service (wires got caught on one too many weight machines)...I loved the way they sounded and fitted, so I went with these...They have blown me away. They sound just as good, with even more bass. I don't know how Shure does it. I paid around $350 for my E5c's back in the day...These are a 100% steal.

I'm sure someone has mentioned it already, but I highly recommend you CAREFULLY remove the plastic sheath and metal rod where the wire meets the earbud. So much easier to maneuver the wire around your ear.

Thank you Shure!"
3114,5.0 out of 5 stars,I replaced my worn out ultimate ears with these Shure215's and I like these better. Isolation is very good. Bass response is better than my old pair and overall comfort is good. I like the cable as it's heavier duty than my previous ones and it's replaceable. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase and shipping and pricing can't be beat!
3115,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, these IEMs are pretty over hyped. They sound decent. They are designed for accuracy, so highs mids and lows are all pretty bland, just accurate. But for a 100 bucks they're pretty decent. None of the earpieces were comfortable for me."
3116,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfecto
3117,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are hands down the best headphones to use for traveling. If you use the included foam earplugs you can not hear anything but your music. Oh and about that music, these headphones sound great. They sound as good as my open back over the ear headphones. They may lack a little bass but I was never a bass head so that does not bother me."
3118,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best earbuds i have used. Foam tips are the best.
3119,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Takes a while to figure out how to wear them right, but once you have them on right you wouldn't want to remove them and you won't even feel a thing! I sometimes just get up from my chair and try to walk away and I am pulled back by the wires.

Quality wise, these are my first high end earphones so I don't have a lot to compare it with, but a lott better then what I used to own. They are totally worth the price!"
3120,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The phones themselves sound great. Certainly not an audiophile, but I can appreciate the clear highs and mids this pair outputs. If you can find the correct fit, there is solid bass as well. It's sort of a chore to put them in your ear and it was initially difficult to find the right fit. Once you get the fit though, things begin to look up. The biggest issue however, is the discomfort the phones cause after extended listening sessions. They begin to hurt your ear (not the canal) but the outside of your ear and the top where they wrap around. I tried to love these, but the discomfort caused makes them unbearable for me."
3121,3.0 out of 5 stars,sound quality is ok and it looks cool but the only way you can wear them is by wrapping them partly around your ear and that hurts my ears
3122,1.0 out of 5 stars,Mediocre sound .you won't get the wired sound of your se215s. Dead in two months lol really? Cmon shure. Why is this $99?? Where is the value at? An 18 dollar bluetooth cable sounded better. Don't buy this! just buy something else with those $99.your not far from some better products save your money
3123,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ride a motorcycle and the wind noise alone makes you want to wear earplugs. And while one has something stuffed in their ears it might as well be nice to hear some music or some talk radio. Well I have tried expensive and inexpensive well-known and no name brands. None of them seemed to do the trick. Either they were too uncomfortable continuously fell out or had no base or sound quality at all. Then I tried the Shure SE215-CL wireless earbuds and have been extremely satisfied and impressed. Not only do they fit in the ear perfectly, they have a molded plastic section that occupies your whole ear opening plus a softphone insert that goes into the ear canal, but the sound is incredible. Even going down the road at 90 miles an hour with the wind ripping by my head, I can still hear the music perfectly with an incredibly good bass response. They fit like the earbuds that you see music recording artists use when making live performances. I highly recommend these earbuds. They might be a little bit more expensive than some but they are far cheaper than the Bose QuietComfort noise cancelling and they are much cheaper than the Klipsch earbuds. And the fit is very very good they come with a whole selection of different assorted months of buds and lengths of canal tubes so that you can customize these two whatever your ear size is. They stay in the ear as well which is very important. You almost have to pry them out of your ear to get them out. Even with the earbuds turned off they are such a good fit that they act as a noise canceling type of ear protection. Once again I recommend these highly to anyone wanting good sound quality whether they're on a bike or just mowing the lawn or just sitting in your room they are fantastic."
3124,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sounding in-ear-phones. Well-built. Detachable cord is nice if you have to replace it. Excellent external noise isolation. You get more when you pay more but I feel these are well worth the money.
3125,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound quality. Noticeably better than other earphones I own (about $20 price range) even with low quality sources like my laptop or my cell phone.

However, the procedure to insert the earphones in your ear in the correct position is a bit complex, time consuming and awkward."
3126,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these as i break headphones very often. These headphones are a very solid product. They are also modular so they can be fixed easily.
3127,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, feels like the music is being injected directly into my brain. Sound isolation works perfectly, can barely hear the lawn mower when mowing the lawn wearing these.

It loses one star because the cord is pretty darn long. Additionally, these headphones are quite bass heavy, luckily I'm running Viper4Android to soften the bass and push up the treble a bit, makes these headphones sound fracking amazing."
3128,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had other Shure noise isolating earphones in the past, in a different design. I find this design is harder to use. I'm always struggling to get the wire part over my ear, and the ear piece securely in my ear. Once I manage to do that, they work well."
3129,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the most comfortable earphones I've tried (vs Apple Earpods and Steelseries Flux). I am using the foam tips and they provide reasonable isolation from the background noise while sounding great.
3130,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love everything about these buds. Yes, they may take a little bit of time to find what size fits your ear. But once you do.....beautiful sound. Used to use Klipsch S4 and S4i, but they had durability issues (my only real qualm with them actually). But these buds step up the sound quality (just a tad, but it's noticeable, especially in highs and the overall body of the sound is just deeper and more pronounced). The Shure's come in with a bit more weight, but feel much more sturdy. Good $100 replacement, very happy I moved from my Klipsch"
3131,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these when I play in my church all the time. We have an in ear monitor system and these are amazing. They are clear and they are not super expensive. The perfect balance.
3132,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm going to try and give a non audiophile review of these. If you want an audiophile review, read some of the other top reviews and save yourself some time and stop reading this now.

So, seriously, Shure should market these as ear plugs with free headphones. Their ability to block sound is absolutely amazing. To the extent that these headphones should be standard issue for any frequent flyer. No longer do you need to lug around sound canceling cans when you have these lil guys in your briefcase. Crying babies, clapping, chatty kathy sitting next to you -- Gone. I mean, these guys completely isolate you from the outside audible would.

Beyond blocking outside sound, the headphone quality is pretty good. Within the price range of these guys there are probably a few choices with slightly better sound quality. But as far as sound quality is concerned, these headphones really seem to error on the side of being a better Rock/Pop head phone than Classic Piano or Hard core rap. The highs are pretty sharp -- and the lows won't rattle your fillings. But what really makes these shine is the lack of outside noise pollution and how well they place you in the middle of the music you're listening too. These are probably the closest you can get to cans without buying cans.

Install Tip 1: It is awkward putting them in the first few times. Really, and sorry for being crude, the easiest way it follow the same rules you would for putting on a condom. Pinch the tip, then hold it in place while using the other hand to roll the wire around your ear.

Install Tip 2: These are not labeled 'R' and 'L'. Instead they have red and blue dots on them. Just remember ""Red is Right"" and it'll save you some headaches.

They're Spinning!: Also, they spin freely, and can end up backwards. Putting them in backwards doesn't end well.

iPhone: If you plan on using these on an iPhone w/ a case, the plug is a bit thick, It works fine with my bumper, but would need to be modified to fit into my wifes Otter case.

Finally, I DO NOT recommend these for people who plan on wearing them in an urban environment. Simply, you will get hit by a bus. I cannot stress how little of the outside world you can hear when these are inserted. If you are looking for a head phone to wear on your bike, on you walk to work, or anything else that involves being around large high speed metal boxes -- for your own safety -- don't buy these. Everyone else, it's hard to go wrong with these. I Highly recommend them."
3133,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have never used this kind of ear monitor before, give yourself about a half hour to figure out how to fit them to your ears before you have to go on stage and use them. They really do cancel out sound! Worth the money!"
3134,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice product, happy with the purchase. The sound quality is very good, much better than the previous earphones I had. The earbuds fit very well and the foam fit does a quality job of outside noise cancellation (I can hardly hear anything over the music at very low levels). Wrapping the cord over and behind the ear was a new concept for me and a little strange to put in at first, but feel much more securely set. Note, longer hair hanging over your ears can be a frustrating to put in if you are not used to this style."
3135,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great bass response. 4 stars because these headphones take a while to learn to wear. can be a little uncomfortable as well, especially when you are wearing them while you are in your bed or when you are working out. They are heavy as well."
3136,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would not call them audiophile earphones (if there is such a thing), but they block out at least 50% of volume of outside noise, are very well built, and have a very strong mid-range."
3137,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The perfect earphone for the subway commuter. Also, good for doing dishes and listening to podcasts, because you don't have to turn up to the volume to hear well (thus limiting possible hearing damage)."
3138,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these with my apple watch. They work great!
3139,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used these earphones to run for 30 minutes 3 days a week, and within a month the left earbud stopped working. The sound quality was amazing, but these broke faster than the other $15 ones I had purchased. Definitely get these with the warranty."
0,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Right to point, these headphones sound great. A very nice neutral approach with good clarity throughout. They are not bass heavy, if you are looking for that you will be disappointed. My criteria was a good sub $100 dollar IEM setup to plug right into my iphone. No amp, no dac. Just a nice sounding set of in ears I can take with me wherever I go. These deliver right on the money. Looks leave a little to be desired, but I am buying for sound not looks. I tried a pair of BeyerDynamic in ears in the same dollar range and these sound better in my opinion. For sub $100 dollars, I would put these up against anything-- provided you are looking for something neutral / flat.

My one complaint, the fit. It could just be my ears, but I could not get these to stay in no matter what I did or how I positioned them. I switched to the smallest tip and could feel and hear them continually losing pressure then sliding out. I had originally thought being forced to wear these up and over the ear would help, but it didn't. I was about to return them because no matter how great they sound, if they don't stay in my ear it's pointless. I had read good things on Comply replacement foam tips and ordered a pair of the T100 isolation series. That made all the difference, they are stuck like glue now and I can actually enjoy listening without feeling the IEM's fall out. So to summarize, fantastic neutral sound, but buyer beware if you have smaller ear canals the tips might be difficult to work in and hold. There is a great fix out there, but it does require spending another 15-20 dollars for a three pack of replacement tips. I've seen some BeyerDynamic IEM shipping with Comply tips as replacement, might be something for Shure to consider-- I almost returned them because of how poor the stock ones fit me."
1,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great. I've avoided earbuds before because I've never been happy with the bass response. I have to say the bass response is great on this headphones, the only trick is to have them fit properly inside the ear. It takes a bit to select the right sleeve (three sizes provided) and to get the cable looped correctly around the ear, but once fit properly the sound is fantastic. The mic works perfectly on my android device. I'm surprised about the sound isolation. I think it is better than the active noise cancelling on the Bose QC headphones. I've even worn these in a concert as earplugs.

I'm taking one star because after a year of use the rubber cover on the back of the earbuds is peeling and breaking apart.

After using these I bought the SE215, but I stull use the SE112m as my day to day headphones."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible earphones, listened to the se112 with the Shure SE846 ISOLATING FOAM TIPS, I could not detect a difference in sound quality only that the se112 had to be turned up a notch or two. I changed these earphones back and fourth at least 20 times. These earphones are the door to other Shure earphones and products, maybe that is why they sound so good. You can buy Shure foam tips, plus comply p series will fit your se112s. Most of the reviews would be 5 stars if foam tips were used. After being smashed into a narrow cylinder and then placed into the ear they expan to form a perfect isolating seal, making the se112 sound 50% better. PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SILICONE TIPS THAT CAME WITH YOUR EARPHONES."
3,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE112 with wireless cable is pretty darn good. The battery life is stellar as well as the charge time, I never had an issue with it dying when I did not expect it. The sound quality is what you would expect, fairly entry-level. In comparison with the SE215, the lows are a bit lacking (the 215's are known to be a tad bass heavy) with not as much sub-bass extension. The high's and mids however are fairly spot on compared to the 215's, with the 215's maybe sounding a bit clearer, if barely. The wireless implementation Shure created is also quite nice, I had no issues with connection and I could go quite far before it started cutting out.

If you are used to how well the SE215's fit in your ear these are a little strange to get use to, they are much more round and not so fitted for an ear, that being said they still fit fine and won't fall out, the SE 215's do have a superior fit in my opinion though.

My only gripe with these IEM's are that the cable does not detach like most Shure models, which sacrifices the durability and options that the higher end models grant you.The cable is quite rugged though, I thought mine were dead after I snagged them in the rolling seat of my car, but to my surprise when I finally yanked them out there was not a scratch on them nor was there a detached wire internally.

So if you can afford the price increase to snag the 215's with this cable I would go for it, but this is still a quite nicely priced offering from Shure."
4,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My old Shure’s shredded along the right and left cords after 5 years of very heavy use. I hope to not be as hard on these.
The sound isolation is very good. It enables me to not have to blast the volume in order to keep surrounding noises at bay. For an example, at half volume on my iPhone, I can’t hear the usually loud music at Starbucks. But without audio, the headphones don’t block much sound at all.
There’s a chincer that keeps the cord snug to your jaw. The volume controls are easy to use by feel and the mic is a good distance from your mouth. Thought I do notice that many people like it practically in their mouths, the mic picks up your voice just fine where it is.

I like a bit more of a bass response and these give me all the bass I need without blowing out my eardrums. The stereo is clear and gives your music plenty of depth. I’m very satisfied with my Shures and hope to have them for years to come."
5,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because of the reviews and because they're from Shure...but I am thoroughly disappointed. If I were to draw a frequency response graph for these, it might look like a bell curve that peaks in the mid-highs and leaves highs and lows in the dust. Lyrics sound...ok on these. Certain musical instruments like clarinets sound pretty good while warmer instruments like a piano or drums sound gross.

Shure is known for their legendary dynamic microphones. Give the SE112-GR a pass."
6,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not much of an audiophile, so if that's what you're looking for in a review, you might want to skip this one. From a practical standpoint, I really like these and struggled between 4 stars and 5 stars. These are my go-to headphones when I'm in an environment with any kind of background noise ... mostly being in an airplane or on my motorcycle (I wear a half helmet and have stock pipes on one HD and slip-ons on the other one). The sound is great enough for me for both music and audio books and, because of the isolation, I don't have to listen at full volume to hear it well. The controls are large enough to easily operate when wearing gloves. The cord is longer than most, making it easy to connect to my phone mounted on the gas tank or when it's sitting in the seatback pocket on the plane. The cord seems very durable and doesn't tangle. I'd give these 5 stars, but after several hours, they begin to get a little uncomfortable and I need to take a break."
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the loudest ear-buds I've ever owned. The bass is solid as are the highs. The mids actually sound pretty good too and Im kinda picky. Im not rich so I cant afford the $400.00 pair of Bose or Klepschs. I do like to drool on my screen at them though. I have had a few nice pair though. I reckon its safe to say that I buy a decent pair just about once a year, come motorcycle season. The most I've ever spent is $250 on a pair of wireless Beats. Ive also spent $20 on a pair of SkullKandys. So far, these are my favorites. I can't remember how much I spent ($59.99) on them just now but Im sure they weren't cheap. Still, they rock and I like my music loud so I can hear it over my bike, which is also kinda loud. Anyway, if you're on the fence, stop thinking and just get 'em. You wont be disappointed."
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing, and not just for the price, they're just amazing period. As an audiophile and musician of many years, I can't believe sound this solid is available at such a low price. I remember paying close to 300 dollars for a pair of older EC3s and this pair in the SE112 is actually better. It's imperative to get a right seal in the ear and it does need to sit deeper in the ear canal, so it may not be for everyone. But for those who are willing to take the time to learn how to seat these buds the right way are going to be treated to nuances and dynamics that other earphones in this price range just won't be able to deliver. There's a quite long break-in period, both to the drivers and to your brain. It's a phenomenon that I can't truly describe, but once the burn-in period is established. They'll treat you good."
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've hadn't these for 2 months now, and say without reservation that these are the best headphones I've ever owned and one of the best purchases I've ever made.

I bought these because I had become frustrated with the sound quality of all the headphones I had. I hated the crackling I could hear when I streamed music (my primary form of listening) and I also felt like I wasn't getting enough outside sound blocked which prevented me from being able to hear the different levels of bass and treble.

I knew that these problems would be easier to fix with over-ear headphones, but not only do I look goofy with those on, they're also just way too bulky.

I fully expected to have to pay upwards of $120 for a pair of Beats or Bose earbuds, but after doing a little research I stumbled upon these and decided to go for it.

They have exceeded all expectations, solved all problems, and are the only headphones I will ever use. They completely block outside sound (so much so that I slept soundly through a 6 hour flight.) The quality is INCREDIBLE.

I absolutely recommend these to anyone even mildly frustrated with their headphones."
10,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my Sister as a birthday present. I had the SE425s for about a year before they fell out of my pocket one day. Before that I used a 200 series set for about three years. After trying these I have to say that this particular set of headphones is an OK value but I would recommend saving a little longer and buying the 2 series or higher. The jump is pretty noticeable. All Shure headphones are a lifesaver, though, if you use public transportation or fly a lot. You can really turn the world off and relax. If you're like me and use headphones daily it's easy to justify the price.

I used both of my sets while doing extensive cardio and never had any issues with sweat damaging them like people say. I would only caution that replacement cords are expensive in the upscale models. I can't wait until I've set aside enough money to justify getting another set of 425s."
11,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first got these, it was clear that these fit a lot differently than the in ear buds that I'd been using before this. The fit is VERY tight, and they do seal which lead to some issues with ear pressure that I had to suffer through for a while, but the sound quality was good, and isolation was fantastic until about a month ago. After about 4 months of regular use one of the channels started to buzz a bit, and I've been in the unenviable position of having to twist the cable and position it 'just so' to avoid crackling and cutting in and out on the right channel.

I could forgive the comfort issues due to the sound quality and isolation, but it just was a constant struggle to find the balance between ear pressure comfort with the seal and getting them into 'just the right position' for it not to be uncomfortable, even trying different tips nothing felt as comfortable.

The cord seemed very heavy duty, but obviously it has it's issues as after only 4 months one side is beginning to fray. Wouldn't recommend unless you can try in person and will be using these in a very mild, non-active fashion and isolation is a must."
12,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones a year ago. I use them at work for maybe 3 hours a week average. They were great for the first 6 months and then one side stopped working and now the other side is completely disintegrating. I keep them in their own pouch in my desk and I'm gentle with them because I wanted them to last. My headphones usually last several years and for me to pay 50$ and have them fall apart within a year?! I'm pretty upset. Decent sound quality originally, but...long haul? I wouldn't waste my money again."
13,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the third time we have purchased this product. It isolates the sound well, blocks out most noise and the sound is very good for a lower cost earphone. I have used it on airplanes and it works well to block out most noise. The sound tends to the base rather than treble but it is very balanced. The controls work well and the product lasts a long time. I have had one pair for over four years and it still works just as good as new.

You can also replace the ear buds so that is a plus. Keeping them clean can be a chore if you do not keep up with it. Also, they tend to collect ear wax but that should be expected from any earphones. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for earphones."
14,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The 112's replaced the 115's I lost while traveling. The cord quality definitely is not as great as the 115's. I have very little confidence that the cord wires will remain intact long-term. The sound quality it ok - better than low end earbuds, but not as great as the high end ones. If you consider yourself an audiophile, these are not for you.

Noise isolation and comfort are excellent. I use the foam covers with my 535's and my lost 115's, but since I purchased the 112's while away on business, I was forced to use the rubber covers... 'cause oh yeah, the 112's don't come with both like the 115's. Anyway, the rubber covers worked just as well.

If you buy these, I recommend you buy a Shure hard or soft zip case. The drawstring bag for the 112's is useless and protects the buds from nothing but dust."
15,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is good for these phones, lots of bass. In comparison with the Apple in-ear headphones, these are very difficult to use. The insulation is very stiff and the control pod hangs much lower. For me, I like to tuck the cord inside my shirt but with the Shure I have a lot hanging outside and since they are stiff it swings out in front of my face. Also, the remote is hard to use because all the buttons feel the same - meaning that when you want to pause you could easily press the volume controls."
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First bought this model before about 7 years ago. Replaced it with a Shure 215 after 3 years because the wires broke apart due to wear and tear. Just bought another pair now to use at home. Still amazing sound and quality for the money.
However I would definitely recommend paying the extra $40 for the 215 which comes with kevlar braided wires and stiff wire ear loops. Both sound great and have amazing insulation. I can use these on planes or mowing the lawn and not even have to turn the volume up 1/4 of the way."
17,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is good and has all the features that I need. But I bought this only last week and every time the voice says ""battery more than 4 hours"" it turns off and seems to run out of battery immediately after. This is after 1-2 hours of of use."
18,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received these headphones today, and they seem like they're going to be the best pair I'll have ever owned. The sound is stunning for the price, and the build quality seems to be spot on. The wiring doesn't tangle, and the connections are quite sturdy. The buttons in the mic (an optional feature) are solid and take just the right amount of force to press so you won't accidentally press them while working. The fit seems great (even though I've only had them for a few hours), and Shure recommends you wear the cord around your ear. I was weary of this at first because it seems flat-out uncomfortable to wear earbuds this way, but I was surprised to find it's actually not noticeable. The volume is also wonderful. They can be extremely loud, and so I don't need to turn my volume up on my iPhone more than halfway most of the time.

My only issue is with the volume up button. It seems to be less sensitive than the others, which makes me wonder if it will go out after a a few months. I will post any updates in the future with any issues, but I would highly recommend these.

My previous earbuds were Skullcandy Titan - Found here:

Skullcandy Titan (Discontinued by Manufacturer)

They were great, but I foresee the Shure earbuds to outperform them in sound and hopefully longevity. (The Titans were little tanks. Nothing can break those things. I had 2 pairs in 6 years)"
19,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these not because I am an enthusiast or a hicker and wanted something of quality to hear music, no!. I am a professional singer who performs no less than 4 times a week, casinos, clubs... One in particular is so loud, so I need something that no only work as a very good In Ear Monitor, but also a protection to my hearing. The isolation of these is so good at the point that I left them after the set to stay inside the club and have to take one out at any moment in order to hear what other people tried to scream at me. I can compare their isolating efficiency with the Bose ones.... At 75% less the price? Good"
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best earphones I have ever had. I listen to classical music on my iPod, and I'm fussy about the earphone fit and quality."
21,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not blown away by sound quality considering Shure's reputation, but the noise cancelling is superb."
22,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid pair of earbuds. Mids and highs are crisp, clear. Lows are a bit muffled. Pops out of my ear if I am wearing when eating. Also, constantly slides out when only have one ear bud in regardless of positioning, etc."
23,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The toughest earphones in this price range....
I've had them for 6 months and work in a rough environment. They blow away skull candy, (only lasted 2 months), NRG, (one month), These still function and sound like new.

That was then, the quality has changed. Shorts in the wires after 3 months. They used to last years. My use has not changed, the quality did."
24,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great earbuds. The sound is really good and they are very comfortable to wear. Thank you!
25,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are amazing!!! Completely cancel out sound. Even on the plane! Sometimes I even just use them for earplugs on the plane too. I bought another set for a family member.
26,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well made and easy to use.
27,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent sound. Not as good as an older set of Shure earbuds that I've had for years. Good value for the price.
28,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, especially for the price."
29,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound that comes out of these doesn't sound that great to me, the headphones that came with my iPod sound much better as do the $15 dollar pair of sport headphones i've got. I wasn't expecting anything great, but i didn't think it'd sound worse than the cheap headphones i've already got. The instructions say that if there seems to be a lack of low frequency bass to try another tip, i've gone back and forth between all 3 several times and tried positioning the headphones in different positions but the bass always sounds muffled.

But that's not really why i bought these and even if the sound wasn't perfect i could live with that. I was really hoping to be able to use these to listen to music while mowing lawns without blowing my ears out, but these really don't block out much sound at all. Reading the reviews for the SE215 i saw that people were complaining that it blocked TOO much sound, that's what i wanted! Silence enough to listen to an audiobook or podcast on a lawn mower. Seeing that they were both rated at 37dB i figured i'd pick these up so i wouldn't feel as bad about breaking a $100 pair of headphones (as is bound to happen) and i'm not sure if i made the right choice. It could just be that none of the tips/sleeves fit my ears quite right (to notice any sort of ""noise isolation"" i have to really push the earphones in there). I haven't tried them out on the mower yet, but i don't have high hopes.

They do feel well-built and sturdy, especially the main cord, my main grudges are the sound quality and sound isolation.

UPDATE: I tested these out on the lawn mower and was pleasantly surprised that i could (reasonably) understand an audiobook, though i still needed the volume on max. It's not exactly what i wanted as my ears are still going to be ruined, but they fare better than i thought they would at first, maybe because the sound goes directly into my ear and comes out louder? Another thing to add is that when wearing them for extended periods of time (ie. >30 minutes), since they have to be pushed in really deeply for the best sound and to block out outside noise, my ear starts to feel sore despite the tip i use.

UPDATE 2016: I ended up getting used to them and the sound they produce, when they finally broke a few months ago (right around 2 years after i purchased them) i must say i was pretty upset and i think i went through the same adjustment period to get used to my cheap earphones again. I'm not sure that i'd buy them again, but i did end up appreciating them more than i did at first."
30,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Somewhat disappointed with this purchase. Some reviews have indicated this to be the best sounding buds under $100 right now, I'm not sure I would agree. The low to mid range is acceptable for the most part, with reasonable extension into the lowest octaves. The low range (>300Hz) has a reasonably flat response with good dynamics, and isn't over-accentuated and boomy which seems to be the norm in most headphones today. There is some noticeable distortion at higher levels, but the isolation is good enough I usually don't feel the need to push them that hard. Midrange response is also acceptable, but above 4K is where everything goes to hell really quickly. The sibilance of a vocalist, the bite of a snare, the string twang of an accoustic guitar or the clash of a cymbal will all sound just really, really wrong. Lots of distortion combined with a rising response just sounds horrible. There are highs, lots of highs, but there is just no definition to it all.

Otherwise, the build quality is pretty good, they feel like the should hold up for a while. The volume control does not work with my Moto X (2014), but the mic and mute button is all I really want."
31,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds good but the product description is wrong. These are NOT wireform behind the ear. This is false advertising.
32,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't like the sound quality. Not enough base for my preference.
33,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are overall great earphones. I got them to replace my Sennheiser i300s and I chose these specifically because they're supposed to be rugged, especially where the cord meets the jack, which is where my headphones tend to break after a couple of months. Judging by the amount of plastic at that join these should not have a problem there. However, the jack doesn't stay seated in my phone very well. I have an iPhone 6 plus and They way my phone sits in my pocket the cord tends to get pulled out whenever I walk.. or sit down... or stand up... or just put it in my pocket. When I try to put the phone in my back pocket the cord is basically at its limit, because it is about six inches too short.

TL;DR
Pros-
comfortable
they at least look sturdy
good audio quality

cons-
Doesn't stay in headphone jack very well
short cord"
34,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these earphones. The sound is excellent and they fit comfortably. I purchased a second pair for work so I would never be without them. Great earphones for the price!
35,5.0 out of 5 stars,exceeded my expectations. Now I can work out at the gym in peace. It does really isolate the noise. Not sure why so many complain about it being uncomfortable. I thought it was comfortable.

38,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really love the quality of the product. I would highly recommend these if you what a good pair of ear buds and don't mind spending a bit for their quality.
39,5.0 out of 5 stars,My husband is a headphone snob! But I think I scored on these. He said they are great for cancelling out extra noise which is great because he wears them at work and the gym. Also he loves the sound quality and remote feature.

41,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great but the model before em had more bass & a better cable. They wanna charge you four times as much for the fancy ones the started making if you want decent bass. Theyre probably better but I'm not paying $300 for friggin earbuds. These have decent sound & isolate sound enough to jam your tunes during high speed motorcycle rides and high caliber rifle fire.

Be safe; you cant hear w these in.

KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN!"
42,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent bang for the buck, great sound quality. After going through countless lower quality earbuds, this is a welcome change! Having to loop the cord around your ears takes some getting used to, but it's still worth it. My only complaint would be that the (very sturdy) cord could be a bit longer."

45,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use for music and they sound pretty good for small earphones.
46,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I picked these up help me downsize / streamline my travel stuff. They were intended to replace my Bose Quiet Comfort headphones, which I use(d) for travel, but they were a bit big.
At the same time, I wanted good sound as well as the ability to talk on the phone ( I ordered the inline controls and mic option).
These buds seemed to be the best option for the money, checking all the boxes of portability, good sound, good isolation and a quality build (at least on paper).
A week in and I love these buds. The isolation is excellent and the sound well above average.
I have several sets of higher end headphones (Sony, Beyerdynamic and Sennheiser) and these rank up there in terms of sound quality.
Specifically, I find the sound more on the neutral side (which I like) and a bit less pronounced highs than other earbuds / headphones. This doesn't bother me, as it keeps an extended listen from being fatiguing, but did want to mention as the only ""watch out"". So many mixes and headphones are oriented against the ""smile"" (bass and treble boost) that people are used to this type of sound profile.
I listened with the included silicone ear buds, but replaced with Shure's memory foam buds. For me, this works very well, and the cost of this ""upgrade"" is negligible for the added comfort and isolation provided. That said, the included buds work fine as well."

55,5.0 out of 5 stars,good earphones
56,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase and I am happy that I waited a few months to write this review.

First off, I am the type of guy who has never owned an expensive pair of earphones/headphones. I prefer to own versatile, inexpensive earphones between $10 - $30 that can be used for morning/evening commutes, the gym, etc. So when my latest pair of cheap earphones broke, I figured I would get something a little more expensive that would last a long time, but not outrageously expensive (like Beats).

When I was looking for a new pair, I did my research. I wanted something affordable that would last long, be versatile in usage, and give me crystal clear sound. These highly rated Shures were within my top three choices and ultimately, these were the ""lucky"" earphones I decided on.

I was excited when I received the package containing these Shures. However, excitement soon turned into frustration. No matter what you read in the reviews or in the instructions, these earphones do NOT fit SECURELY in your ears. They have an awkward fit and the slightest pull on the cord will cause them to fall out or, at the very least, cause the cord wrapping around your ear to fall out. Thus, these are terrible earphones for the gym or for when you're out running. If you're using these in less active scenarios, then they should stay on.

In terms of the sound quality, I actually have to give these Shures some credit. Perhaps it's because I am used to cheaper earphones, but I felt like there was a very solid balance in sound. I like all types of music but these were great for deep house, folk music, classic rock, pop, indie...just about everything! I have been to some of the top clubs around the world with some of the most sophisticated sound systems, and this reminded me of those experiences of being immersed in top-notch sound quality.

So I was able to get past the awkward fitting and enjoy the sound quality of these headphones, but this was short-lived. Today, on 7/12, the left earbud blew out and I am livid. Although it's only been a few months, Amazon will not accept a return for these. I am hoping that I can contact Shure and they can do something about this. This is not the type of thing that should happen to a $50 pair of earphones. If no one is able to help resolve this issue, then I will never buy a pair of Shures again."
57,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good but not as good as the Klipsch headphones they replaced. Unlike the Klipsch, these are very durable and I expect them to have a long service life. Overall these earbuds are excellent for the price."
58,4.0 out of 5 stars,The wireless headphones are just as described.
59,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like them. I had the ones without the microphone which are good too. Good value for high quality headphones. I like the microphone because I am very often using my smart phone and I like to use the headphones to answer calls.

81,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality of build on these was much better than others (typical of Shure audio products). Wire seems higher quality and slightly heavier duty. However, the quality of the sound (especially bass and midrange) was not as good as my Sennheiser CX300II or my Sennheiser MM30i which cost less. The mic and controls seem to work as well as the original iPhone earbuds that came with my iPhone 5C and compare well with the Sennheiser MM30i. Plug is the TRRS type made to work with iPhones. I like these and use them, but prefer Sennheiser for sound. Wonder what the higher end Shure's sound like. Expected better from Shure."
82,1.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I couldn't wait to get these earphones. Based on the reviews I was expecting something different and the brand shure has me excited. I honestly thought I was going to be blown away with the sound quality but when I listened to them they were ok. The bass was ok the highs and mids are really good but nothing special. I compared these earphones with my Samsung galaxies earphones that came with the phone and they seem to sound the same.. not much difference just a slightly more clear from the shure earphones.. but that's it I don't think they are worth the $50 price.. they are haRd to keep in ear when I was at work they kept falling off ,and yes I was wearing the correct way the instructions say.. I think I might return..."

84,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They certainly don't go anywhere, a bit noise cancelling, but also a little uncomfortable. Still the best ones I've used."
85,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good one ! It is durable and sounds very good. There's a tool to remove wax and clean it up.
86,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect.
87,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them, great at gym very good on an airplane, although not noise canceling if they're in the ear properly they eliminate almost all the noise around you on the airplane, including those annoying people that want to talk for 9 hours on a 9.5 hour flight."
88,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like these a lot. This is my second pair and I will biuy them again.
89,3.0 out of 5 stars,Cord is thick and heavy. Not great for working out because the earbuds won't stay in place.
90,4.0 out of 5 stars,These being Shure lower end ear buds still are better than most others.
91,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely amazing sound from these babies. Better than my Bose soundtrue over-ear headphones. Rich bass and engulfing overall sound experience. Love it!
92,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because i wanted a nicer quality earbud style earphone with a built-in mic for skype calling. I ignored most of the negative reviews before buying because there seemed to be a lot of people who seemed happy with these earphones. Straight out of the box these earphones began having problems. On my first use the person on the receiving end of my call said they heard a constant hiss on my end. I wasn't able to hear the hiss from the buds but i would rotate the jack in the port and that seemed to make it go away initially. One month after using it now it doesn't matter how many times i rotate the jack in port but the hissing stays. My family told me they could live with it in the end. Now just another month of very mild use and the mic is completely dead.
Either the mute function is stuck on,or a dead mic, but no audio can be heard during calls on their end. This is a huge shame because i was wanted this type of earphone but there aren't too many good ones out in the market. These lasted me shortly under three months.
These seem pretty robust but have terrible function. Look at Sennheiser's MM30G"
93,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the fact that the earpieces are very hard to remove. They sound great, I mostly listen to podcast with them."
94,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price these are amazing. Clear crisp highs, great sound reproduction. I bought these when my SE-310s crapped out (after 5 years use). I use them about three hours per day during the week. No comfort problems at all!"
95,2.0 out of 5 stars,"MEH. I've come to realize that ear-phone marketing is basically blowing smoke.

The sound is OK but I am not an audiophile. It works for me. How important is the bass, etc when you are working out? You should be focusing on the workout.

These may be more solid due to use of thicker wires but they still don't last. I work out with them (run mostly) but the left ear bud/wire is already dead!! They are also not the most comfortable as you need to ram in the ear buds to get them to stay in place.

In other words, don't pay a lot of money for any ear phone...they will break."
96,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. Volume control did not work with my iPhone though.
97,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too big for my ears even with the smallest size of ear buds. They never stay in my ears. Also the sound quality is nothing to swoon over
98,4.0 out of 5 stars,not bad
99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Push these into your ear and nearly all surrounding sound is blocked. The microphone is great. Talk on phone in the car without getting background noise.
100,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quick delivery, sounds great."
101,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gift to grandson who received the Bluetooth Adapter. Need I say any more? 😄
102,4.0 out of 5 stars,not at all disappointed by these
103,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Now that I have figured out how these in-ear headphones should sit in my ear (basically the whole earphone is cradled by my outer ear) the fit seems perfect, they stay put and I barely notice they are in. I usually use Bose quiet comfort over-the-ear headphones, so I didn't expect much from these in terms of sound isolation. That said, I have been pleasantly surprised at how well they do isolate sound. The sound quality is way better than the default earbuds that came with my iPhone 6s, but probably not audiophile quality. This product is an exceptional value. I encourage anyone who is not looking for ""head rattling"" bass to give these a try."
104,5.0 out of 5 stars,my favorite ear buds ever. Warranty is great. Very sad they got stolen.
105,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are very nice. Comfy, lows mids and highs are all balanced. I would give a 5 star, but when I got mine there was buzzing in the right earbud."
106,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's good buy it, seriously good sound quality. Though it is tricky to get in your ear properly."
107,3.0 out of 5 stars,Underwhelming in every respect. Should be about 1/2 the price. Don't get sucked into the brand unless you purchase the high end.
108,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product! Really isolates outside noise. Good bass and sound definition.
109,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality. Good deal for the money.
110,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are terrible. They are uncomfortable in the ear, fall out all the time (even after trying the different earpieces) and the heavy duty cable is constantly pulling them out of my ears. On top of the comfort issues the sound is no better than any pair of free earbuds I've ever gotten with a phone or music player purchase."
111,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent for the price
112,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic while right beside a drummer. Sound isolation is great.
113,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good. Lacking a little on low end response !
114,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So a lotta people been talking trash about this headphone and the fit any everything, if you do your research or even read or look into the information they give you right in your face (like the video) it will tell you that the cable is an over the ear type design (a lot of people say that isn't comfortable, I personally find it more comfortable for me to wear these incorrectly). And the sound for me is good, better than my apple headphones that came with my iPhone 5c, and when those finally started to wear after over a year of use I switched so some Samsung headphones I borrowed without permission from my family member, and those were pretty bad with my iPhone. These recently made it to my house so I don't know how long they will last but they seem pretty sturdy and can get some good use especially since I do a lot of active stuff where I listen to music and these already hold better than the previous earphones."
115,3.0 out of 5 stars,Highs and mids arnt bad. Not impressed with the low bass. Distorts when I blast them and they aren't very comfortable and my ears hurt after 15 minutes.
116,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound. Blocks outside noises too.
117,2.0 out of 5 stars,sounded like a tiny plastic chamber.
118,3.0 out of 5 stars,They are fine nothing great just ok.
119,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones for the price. Good at noise cancelling and good sound quality.
120,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got these today. I'm a musician, and I say the sound quality is excellent. As for the sound isolation, I went out and stood next to the wood chipper our yard guy was working with, and it was barely there at all. Having worn them for about an hour now, I'm still quite comfortable with them in the ears.

I suppose the $300 Bose active phase-cancelling items would be even better, but at the price I'm really happy, and am anticipating a transatlantic flight with little jet-noise fatigue. Butt fatigue, another story."
121,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchasing these Shure earphones, it became the very first Shure product I ever owned. The quality is top-notch in terms of materials and the sound itself. I've seen these earphones resists hard tugs and pulls. I've also accidentally sat and slept on these; came out unharmed.

Grading the sound could be difficult because everyone has their own personal preference, but in my opinion the sound is quite clear and contains a decent amount of bass. Though, the lows are not so great.

One major downsides is that every time I'm on the move and I'm wearing these earphones, I could hear a lot of cable noise whenever it makes contact with anything."
122,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because I am very much into music. These were amazing headphones while they worked. But after two months of use the aux jack became finicky. I would have to hold it in place in order to get sound out of both ears. Then it escalated. I would have to hold the aux jack just to get sound in one ear. I contacted Amazon because asking about the warranty, after a week they responded. They sent me a link TO THE PRODUCT PAGE. After following the prompts I was told to contact the same email that had told me to go to the product page. I loved these headphones, but I'm upset with the quality and how unhelpful Amazon has been."
123,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These have very good and accurate sound after you work them in for a few days. When they first arrived, and the equalizer on my iPhone was of after a reset. There was absolutely no base, once you turn on the equalizer and let the low frequency burn in over a few days. The base is fairly accurate and the sound stage is clear after a few days. The center remote Play, FFW, RW, Call Answer button, needed to be worn in for a few days, it was not easy to get it to fast forward and RW, right out of the box. It would jump ahead two songs or just Stop and Play. After a few days the contacts loosened up and work smoothly and accurately now. Overall I am happy with the build quality.

Pros:
Sturdy thick cables, Nice size remote, tangle resistant cable, great sound after low frequency burn in.

Cons:
Takes a few days for the low frequency to burn in, the middle remote button needs to be worked in regarding sensitivity. They can be worn with the cable over the ear for a secure fit, or hanging down from the ear.

Overall, I recommend this to someone that listens various types of music."
124,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm pretty hard on my headphones - and being deaf, I expect a ton of volume. I'm now on my third set of these - though none have broken, I've lost them. They take a beating & blast a great sound. Never had issue with the plug or earbuds.

There is a small amount of 'rubbing noise ' from the cord on your body that transmits into the headpiece. But for the mid range price, that's to be expected."
125,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m not an expert, but I appreciate what these earbuds have to offer. Quality construction and great design. The sound quality lives up to what I expected. The bass is balanced out nicely with the highs and mids. At $99, these seem reasonably priced."
126,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow! These sound great and block out most noise. I added the special silicone tips specific to this model. I will be buying more as IEMs (in-ear-monitors) for a church and also for a private band both using the MyMix personal monitor system. It sounds great playing bass. I'm sure they would do well while playing drums too.
127,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The buds didn't fit my ears well. They come with three sizes which to me didn't vary much. Functionality is fine.

A year later I've decided I really like them. The fit is different from other buds in that the wire drape over your ears from behind. I've gotten used to that and now prefer that type of fit to wires hanging directly down from my ears. The wires themselves and heavy and do not kink or tangle."
128,5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: I still love these earbuds, but I did have problems with them coming loose a lot on stage. I tried some other types in the same price range, but none compared in sound quality. Then I discovered COMPLY memory foam universal earbud tips. I ordered a pair of the T100 isolation tips and now not only do I have even better sound isolation but they don't fall out any more either!

Original review:
I'm very impressed by the fit and how tough the cord feels, and the noise isolation is great. I use these for monitoring my vocals on stage, they function both as ear plugs and monitors. I was using some decent sony earbuds for this before, but they never blocked enough noise to keep my ears well protected. I haven't compared these to more expensive earbuds, but compared to the sony, sennheiser, and philips buds i've used in the $30-$40 range they sound just as good. I love shure products, and I've found that even their lower end stuff is always well made."
129,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just lost my first pair, which I had for a year so now I am back to purchase another pair. These earbuds are perfect. I usually have issues with earbuds falling out of my ear if I move at all but these actually stay in. The sound isolation is exactly what I need while I am studying, and the quality of sound makes listening to music much more enjoyable compared to my other earbuds/headphones. Additionally, these earbuds are durable and well made compared to other earbuds of the same price.If you are going to spend fifty dollars, this is definitely the product to purchase."
130,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good sound and sound canceling
131,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good headphones for the pricepoint, but next time I order headphones - I'll pay up for the better model."
132,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've not received yet the remote control. It's really disappointing....but other than that works OK
133,5.0 out of 5 stars,everything OK! THX
134,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them!!!
135,5.0 out of 5 stars,They sound great a definite upgrade from my skull candy earbuds
136,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are fantastic. I have had a lot of trouble finding the right set of earphones that deliver the audio quality with a mic and has Sound Isolation and that I can use with my iPhone, iPad and laptop. After several failed attempts at other products, I decided to go with this Shure model, what a great choice. They deliver the quality I want and they stay in my ears."
137,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!! No complaints at all love them all the way
138,4.0 out of 5 stars,exactly as expected. shure is my go to brand for years.
139,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate to give these one star. They were AWESOME, and I would have given them 5 stars, but my return period ended two days ago and today one side went dead. NO SOUND WHATSOEVER. There's clearly a short in the wiring but I can either 1) live with only having one in-ear monitor or 2) buy them again (which I won't since they seem to break about 32 days in)."
140,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound.
141,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was deeply disappointed by the sound quality of these headphones. As opposed to the ""sound isolation"" and ""great bass"" promised, the sound was tinny and top-heavy. I tried listening to both music and podcasts, and both sounded like I was playing them from dinky little computer speakers, except straight into my ears. Would rather listen to the crappy $10 earbuds I'd been using until these arrived, since I don't have to crank up the volume to dangerous levels just to hear what's going on on the low end. Also: they keep falling out of my ears."
142,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
143,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the money
144,4.0 out of 5 stars,Usable. That's it.
145,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds great
146,1.0 out of 5 stars,Smallest size bud was still much too big for my ears. Sound quality hasn't been anything spectacular. Overall a $7 pair of headphones would be better than these. The right phone went out after 4 months of light use. Can't say a single good thing about this product.
147,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality
148,1.0 out of 5 stars,I thought these sounded terrible. I read a shining review on the web but I found them to be a $5 type of headphone. I'd stick with Skullcandy.
149,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After 4 months with this product the volume from the two ear buds is noticeably and undesirably different.When turning up the volume from my stereo (or Roku unit) so that the sound in the weaker bud is audible, the sound level in the stronger bud grows too loud. Softening the stereo results in the sound in the weaker bud being too low."
150,5.0 out of 5 stars,sound great
151,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!
152,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great earphones. I use them at night to watch movies while my wife sleeps. I sleep with them in. very comfortable. So if you need earphones you can sleep with these work. The sound is really good. I use to only buy Bose. These are better than the Bose.
153,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds do not work on the iPhone 6s, the casing on the 3.5 jack does not allow a working fit. And the mic/control will not work. Very upset after the name of the product states that it does work for all Apple devices. Even tried calling Shure to get a recommendation for a pair that does work, but was put on hold for 30 minutes. They do sound really good though, just wish it worked with my phone."
154,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have a cheap rubber plug that slightly sticks in your ears and when you walk you hear this thud, thud, thud.

They are aweful and it seems like the person who designed this had no idea about ergonomics or that the human ear is not round."
155,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Used for everyday stuff and also while running. Sound and confort are good. After 2 months the microphone stopped working - went to website to see their procedure and there is not way to do any of the warranty online. Need to print, fill and mail a form with the headphones back to a warehouse. This is really unpractical and time-consuming for a pair of $50+ headphones. disappointing."
156,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because someone somewhere rated them as durable. Well, they lasted a little longer than the $20 skullcandy or sony earbuds I had been buying and replacing, but not that much longer. Also, I don't think the sound was as good. They felt very awkward in my ears. Not a good value."
157,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds decent enough (*but not for this price) but the earbuds do NOT stay put. The rubber is far too hard and slippery unfortunately. I've tried all the sets that came with it and it's just awful. The worst thing is you cannot use 'standard' earbud rubber tips, it's some special proprietary nonsense...

DO NOT BUY"
158,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the earbuds for about 2 months, of very rare and sporadic use. Eventually one earphone stopped working. The audio was a whisper at best. I attempted to have them fixed through SHURE, but the company required a repair fee and taxes on that fee. I'd stay away!"
159,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They broke 1 month after light use. The right earbud itself pulled apart into two pieces. You do get what you pay for in life, so I'm not surprised. Still...one month is lame. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to purchase Bose Earphones, you will be happy you did."
160,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's hard to beat Shure at this price range. Great all around sound. Cord is a bit short in my opinion.
161,1.0 out of 5 stars,"i was disappointed by these. i had the older model of these and they were great and sounded much better. they even came with a better case, and better ends for your ears. wish i would have tried a different model."
162,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earbuds. I'm not entirely sure how the whole ""wear them upside down"" thing is supposed to work, so I don't.

My only qualm is that the controller doesn't seem to work on Android, which I specifically got this model for."
163,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Didnt quite get loud enough and build felt a bit to cheap. Couldn't hear the difference between it and the better $25 buds. The plug pretty easily cracked when i stood up too quick when connected to an airplane seat, but can't really blame that on them since most plugs are identical."
164,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wanted inner ear buds to run with and tried these. Sound is pretty good but they're awkward in my ear and were too uncomfortable to keep wearing.
165,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This product does not live up to the hype.

As a landscaper I was looking for ear buds that were tough, stayed in the ear, and had good sound quality. They are plenty tough but they have terrible sound quality, too high on treble, and would NOT stay in my ear no matter which ear piece I used.

Not worth the money."
166,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I would not recommend these headphones. I thought that the Shure name would still provide some sort of guarantee of sound quality but I was unfortunately wrong. I know that they are not the most expensive headphones, but I think I could have gotten comparable quality with a $20 purchase."
167,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, apparently can't handle being dragged behind my car for five miles. So lose one point for endurance."
168,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound quality for the money. The buttons on the remote take a little getting used to (need to press a bit harder vs. other earbuds). Wish they came out with a braided cloth cord version of this.
169,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Heavy, bulky, but bassy."
170,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good reliable headphone.
Have been using it for a couple of months."
171,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent
172,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My third pair of Shure headphones, obviously the first Bluetooth pair. The sound quality is exactly what I expected from a Shure product. Buy with confidence and skip the other brands."
173,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent noise isolation headphone at an excellent price. Bass effect is truly great. Good value for money $56.00

another best product from Shure"
174,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and good bass for a great price.
175,4.0 out of 5 stars,Needs a longer cord. Real good sound.
176,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am an audiophile, and use headphones on a regular basis. I bought these to replace a stolen pair of Shure in-ear phones that were fantastic. The reviews on these looked good so I thought why not. I was very disappointed with the sound quality, the apple headphones that come with the iPhone are far superior to these even though they are not sound isolating. Sure really dropped the ball on these, price-wise they are affordable, and it does everything is says, but bottom line is the sound quality is very lacking, especially with the low-end. Better save your money and just use the apple factory buds, or step up and spend the extra $40 to the Shure pro-line of earbuds."
177,5.0 out of 5 stars,Phenomenal sound quality and ease of use. 1000% better then those Apple ear buds
178,1.0 out of 5 stars,"PROS:
- sturdy cable
- someone sound canceling
- good sound

- awkward fit
- a bit bulky in size

- other cons as well but I'm over wasting any more time on these because they also just stopped working"
179,2.0 out of 5 stars,"No bass, poor quality sound"
180,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything OK!
181,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok for music listening, but not for audio monitoring. Instrument separation is not good enough, and the sound detail is not great either. If you want a good in ear monitoring earphone get the Shure SE 215. I use them a lot for monitoring while I play piano and sing in our church band, and they are really good."
182,1.0 out of 5 stars,I don't know how these received good ratings. They sound horrible. No bass. I'm sorry I bought them.
183,3.0 out of 5 stars,The earphones would only fit nicely if you hook the cable behind the ear and pop the buds into the ear from the top. I find that quite troublesome and uncomfortable. Was feeling quite irritated with it until I discovered a workaround... I insert the right bud into my left ear and it fits perfectly now!
184,1.0 out of 5 stars,"these headphones are very tinny sounding. they pair easily, but they sound horrible, and they are horribly uncomfortable. they are definitely not worth the $99 price. i will be returning them. if they were a pair of $30 headphones, they'd be fine. the bluetooth is actually very good, a strong connection, but the sound, once again, is really bad. buyer beware."
185,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not fit in the ears properly.
186,4.0 out of 5 stars,good sound but uncomfortable (can't wear them and sleep)
187,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If music is an important part of your life, like it is in mine, then a good pair of wireless headphones is essential. I've tried and owned numerous sets of headphones (both wired and wireless, around the ear and earbuds). I think the Shure sound-isolating earbuds are a solid middle-of-the-road option in the crowded field of headphones, and they're a good value for the money.

What I liked most about these earbuds:

1.) The sound isolation is superb. It's important to note that these headphones have ""passive"" noise isolation, not active noise cancellation. In other words, they are designed to shut extraneous noise out, not to actively counteract the sound waves coming in (which requires another higher level of technology). I have a set of the Bose Quiet Comfort (active) noise canceling headphones, and to be honest, I think the Shure earbuds do nearly a good job of blocking external noise as the much more expensive Bose set. In fact, when my husband was standing not four feet away from me and talking at a normal volume, I could not hear him at all. So that's extremely impressive, and as such I think these would make a great set of headphones for anybody needing to block out noisy roommates, coworkers, etc.

2.) The headphones are also extremely comfortable. I don't like most earbuds, actually, and find that they tend to make my ears sore after a half hour or so. But not the Shure earbuds. The earpieces themselves are almost round, like a ball, and made of a flexible rubber like substance. It's soft and comfortable in the ear.

3.) The Bluetooth technology is straightforward, and--unlike the case with other wireless speakers I've had in the past--I had no difficulty getting the earbuds to pair with any of my devices. I also like that when you turn them on, the earbuds will announce how much battery life you have left.

Features I wasn't so wild about:

1.) As with any set of earbuds, a proper fit is crucial to getting a good sound. In my case, the Shure earbuds had to be jammed pretty firmly into my ears to get the full depth and richness of the audio. Unfortunately, they dislodged easily and often. I tried using them during one of my gym workouts, and I was constantly having to reach up and readjust them. I don't recommend them for working out for that reason; instead, I'll use my Jaybird Freedom earbuds, which have a much better system for anchoring the earbuds in place.

2.) The cord was longer than other earbuds I've had, and the cord itself was a little thinner. This contributed to the buds not staying firmly in place, I think, as they wouldn't stay wrapped over my ears the way other sets would.

Last but definitely not least, how was the sound? I'd characterize it as good but not great. I'd rate the sound quality for music as about the same as I get on my (wired) iPhone earbuds. But the sound on the whole is a lot thinner, especially with respect to the bass, than I get with my NuForce HEM8 earbuds, which remain hands down the best sound I've ever had in a set of headphones. Of course, in all fairness to the Shure earbuds, the NuForce buds cost four times as much. But you get what you pay for, and if I could only have one set of earbuds, I'd go with the NuForce.

The bottom line? I think I'll start using these as my primary set for traveling. The sound isolation is terrific, and they're a LOT less bulky to cart around than my Bose Quiet Comfort set. But I'll use my Jaybirds for working out and the NuForce HEM8 for when I'm doing serious music listening."
188,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones I've ever had!
189,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first pair of Shure headphones, and they are a different experience. The fit is a bit weird because the cord drapes over the back of your ear. They also sound below average if you don’t insert them a special way - upside down then rotate 180 degrees. Weird, right? It makes a difference. I put these through the paces with my standard song list below - one that I use for headphone reviews. The results were pretty good considering the cost. The bass is strong, but not overpowering. While not every voice of the low volume Chinese dialog at the beginning of “Chinese Democracy” came through, the SE-112 did a respectable job producing the majority of them. I have other in-ear headphones that I prefer, but I also paid a bit more for them. The performance across all genres of music is well above average. For newer models, you should expect to pay at least twice as much before you get a noticeable difference in performance.

In addition, the SE-112 are made with attention to the important details. The cable is strong, and it terminates in a right-angle plug - this should be a requirement for in-ear headphones. The material also has a semi-glossy coating that helps avoid tangles. The storage pouch is hard to close, but cases/pouches aren’t even a given in this price range. It’s hard to pick at the design other than the two oddities that I mentioned at the beginning. If you don’t want to break the bank, the Shure SE-112 is a good option.

190,1.0 out of 5 stars,So frustrated right now with this piece of crap I am not going to continue. Logged in to find out if I can still return this overpriced junk. Then go get my wife's 11.00 wal mart special to finish.
191,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE112-K-BT1 Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones have excellent, clear sound with comfortable earbuds. On a scale of 1-10, the base is a 7 and the overall sound a 9.
They are easy to use and work well with a phone call. I happened to be trying them out the first time when I got a call. The volume can be controlled on the Android as well as the Shure cord. I had great sound from the ear phones and I was told that they were very clear on the other end of the call.
I found the Bluetooth pairing quick and easy to do. The directions are good. I found that I had to go to the bluetooth settings on my Android and tap ""more settings"" to have the Shure logo come up. I was done in seconds.
As far as the sound isolating function, I have always been a bit leery of this especially with ear phones. I must say that I cannot hear anything outside of the phones when they are firmly in my ears. Whether this is simply blocking the sound or isolating, I don't know. They do seem to be very much better than my other non-isolating phones.
I like the fact that it comes with a simple zippered case which has a pocket inside to hold the charging cord, extra earbuds and a cleaning tool. It also has a clip to secure it to a loop on clothing.
The phones stay on and in my ears securely and are not a bother. There is also a small clip which can attached to the cord and then clipped to your clothing. I'm very happy with how they feel and sound."
192,4.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE - rewritten review. I initially didn't rate these very highly but on further experimentation I have to change up my review. I have a an older pair of Shure isolating earbuds - the kind where you roll the foam until compressed and then put them in your ears and let the foam expand. They are superb and are what I judge anything else by. I also own a pair of Sennheiser earbuds that are in the $30-ish range and really like them for everyday use.

These Shures fit where I would expect them - squarely in the middle. They are competent earbuds with adequate frequency response, though the bass is a little lacking. The Sennheisers that I have provide an abundance of bass and are ever so slightly boomy, not something you could say about these Shures. I would say the bass is adequate, but definitely not the lower end of the bass register. The Sennheisers reach a little deeper than these. The high-end Shures do have that very low bass, but they are more than 1.5 times the price of these.

These have over the ear wires, which helps support them - but you may or may not like that about these. The cords are thicker than you might be used to, but they contribute to holding them in place - they would be very good for active use. There is a slide on the cord that adjusts the amount of ""hold"" that the cords have on you. This all will make it much less likely to yank one out of your ear if you are a walker, runner, etc. like the plainer versions.

My overall view is that while the sound is slightly below what I would like, the overall package makes it a decent value at its price point.

I would also agree with other reviewers that it's important to get these situated in your ears correctly or they will be quite disappointing."
193,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are some of the better wireless headphones I’ve used. I am not a fan but looking at a new Iphone without a headphone jack is making me look for a pair I can use and still get decent sounding music. I own a corded pair of Shures and I love them. These wireless ones do not sound as good but they are far superior to any of the Jabra, Beats or Bose sets I tried. Sound is plenty loud, well balanced with nothing jumping out that sounds out of place. They are kind of boring from a sound perspective but that is OK in my book for wireless headphones.

Pairing was easy and ongoing connection has been mostly flawless with the exception of one time which required re-pairing. There have been no drop offs in sound or cracking or anything. Watching videos has been good as well with zero lag in audio. Everything stays synched nicely. Battery life has been pretty good as well and is close to stated time although I am getting about 30 minutes less. I assume that is because I tend to listen to music a bit louder. Charging is easy thanks to the standard USB cord. Nothing proprietary like others.

Range is easily well beyond 30 feet. I wear these most of the day in my office and have been 40 feet away and around corners with walls. These are really amazing on that front.

Overall, very happy with these and something I can wear daily. If I was going into a full blown music listening mode and wanted better separation or soundstage, I would most likely not use these. But for every day use, these are my new go to headphone."
194,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've heard great things about Shure headphones, so I was really excited to try this pair out. But I have to say, I wasn't too blown away.

Pros:
- This does a solid job at isolating noise. It's not noise cancellation, but this actually does a really decent job for non-noise cancelling headphones.
- I found it pretty easy to find buds that fit comfortably in the ear.
- The battery life is okay (but not amazing).

Cons
- The sound is only decent. After everything I've heard about Shure headphones having awesome sound, I was kind of disappointed in these. They sound slightly tinny. The mid and high sounds are great and clear, but the bass is sorely lacking. Honestly, I have 30 dollar bluetooth Panasonic earbuds that sound a bit better than this.
- For some reason, I always have a bit of trouble connecting these to my iPhone. It's happened twice since I've had them, where I have to 'forget' the earbuds and then pair them again for it to work. These are the only bluetooth headphones that I have to do this with.

In the end, I was slightly disappointed by the Shure earbuds. While the noise isolation is superb, the sound is slightly lacking. I just don't think they're worth the price when you can get better sounding bluetooth headphones for cheaper (without the noise isolation, though). Oh, and the cord is extremely long."
195,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These wireless headphones are physically designed well and fit comfortably in my ears. I haven't had any issues with the cord getting in the way or the earbuds falling out of my ears. They fit in my ears pretty snug and I think that this helps contribute to the sound isolation. The battery life is pretty decent but doesn't seem to come even close to the 8 hours that Shure claims you're supposed to get. From my experience it seems closer to six hours max. My biggest issue of all is the quality of the sound. I don't know how other people feel, but if your looking for nice headphones then they should be able to get the most important thing right.....the sound. They seem to be very treble heavy and really lacking in the bass department; almost with a tinny sort of sound to them. At first I gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed they just needed to be broken in some more. But after more than 100 hours of use there is little improvement. So if you're looking for headphones that have a nice balance of bass and treble, or a lot bass, then you should probably look somewhere else. I expected the sound to be a lot better for headphones at this price point."
196,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure makes great earphones and these are no different. Sure, you won't be getting the highest quality fidelity, but come on, it's bluetooth, what do you expect? That said, the bass is a little weak on these, so if you are looking for some heavy beats in your ear, these aren't the ones for you. But otherwise, they sound great, even if a little light on the low end. Battery life is great. I got close enough to the 8 hours claimed life to count (I say close enough because I didn't have a timer on it, just in my normal day to day use). I love that it can stay connected to two devices at once, so you don't have to go fiddling around pairing/unpairing/pairing. While the cord on these is really long and that bump in the middle, they stay in my ears pretty well, even when being somewhat active (though if I was going for a run, I'd definitely utilize the clip to attach it to my shirt). Last bit, while these aren't active noise canceling, in ear monitors can get a very good seal on your ear canal and definitely block out a lot of outside noise very well."
197,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these wireless Shure earphones. In the morning when I go for my walkout with my dog, they are a staple with my attire and allow me to listen to my audio books without the hassle of wires connected to my iphone. Shure has been a staple to me since I was in my twenties (I actually used to be in a band and had Shure microphones), so I can testify to the quality of the Shure name (I like their sound quality better than my Bose headphones at about a third of the price). These are noise isolating and will work wonderfully for air travel as well.These would make a great Christmas gift for someone you love."
198,4.0 out of 5 stars,"PRO:
1- Easy to pair with all of my bluetooth devices - one of the most important features for any bluetooth device, in my book.
2- Rubber tips in 3 sizes - you should have no trouble finding a comfortable fit.
3- Noise isolation is darn good!
4- Uses the exact same button functionality as iPhone earbuds (i.e., for microphone, volume and playback controls)
5- Battery life is excellent.
6- Includes a clip to secure the cord to your collar (which is needed to due to long cord- see below)
7- Comes with a zippered case, with a carabiner clip, 3 sizes of rubber tips and a charging cord

Other Comments:
8- Sound quality is acceptable, but I find the treble a bit too bright and the bass too weak for my tastes.
9- The cord is a too long. One of the reasons i like “wireless” earphones is to reduce the chance of catching the cord on something when i am mobile. I prefer a cord that just fits around my neck. This cord is approx 30 inches long.
10- Packaging difficult to open. Lots of paperwork enclosed - most of which had nothing to do with using the earphones."
199,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had two pairs of these over the last 5 years. They did not experience hard, or even daily, use. Both pairs failed after about 18 months. The sound in one side started to be intermittent, and then stopped altogether. I gave these a second try after the first premature failure, hoping I'd gotten a lemon, but twice in a row tells me that they're just not a good product. Which is sad, because the sound on even this low end model is really good.

I have other earbuds that are 10 years old and still function perfectly after more use. For the price, I expect good durability in addition to quality sound, and these don't provide it."
200,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave these to my oldest daughter for review, and this is what she wrote:
So far I like the headphones. Good quality of sound, feels like the sound is in middle instead of on both sides. Not sure about the range of how far I can be from my phone. Left it upstairs at my grandparents and walked all over the house and it never went out of range. Only issues I have is that they are front heavy so the charging station pulls on the earpiece a little. I connected the clip to it and that made it a little better, but you have to make sure to look straight forward when clipping in or the clip can cause tension on shirt and still pull earpiece out. The other issue is the earpiece itself. I’m using the smallest one and it’s still a little large for my ears, I feel like I really have to shove it in my ear so they’ll stay."
201,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These in-ear phones are sturdy and they do a good job of blocking out environmental noise. You can insert them so that the cord loops back behind the ear, or so that it just hangs down from the ear. If you achieve a good seal (you need to choose the right size sleeve, and get the bud well into the ear canal), you will be rewarded with decent bass response, and the `phones will indeed attenuate extraneous sounds, like street noises or an airplane engine.

That said, this model does not provide the most sparkling high frequencies or the deepest bass that you can get from a pair of in-ear devices. To get better sound, you need to move up to the Shure SE215-K Live Sound Monitor, Black, a $99 item designed and marketed as an in-ear performance monitor for professional musicians.

I evaluated these phones by comparing their performance with two other models: the Klipsch Image S4i-II Black In-Ear Headphones in-ear phones that I often use for travel, and the PSB M4U 2 Active Noise Cancelling Headphones featuring Room Feel headphones that I got for Christmas 2013. The Klipsch phones are similar in price and performance to the Shure SE215-K, but they do not block out environmental noise very well. The PSBs are actual on-ear noise-cancelling headphones, with settings that provide a choice between ""passive"" performance (no noise-cancelling), battery-assisted performance (useful with low-powered sources like the iPod), and noise cancelling (active engagement of a microphone that captures environmental noise and generates a signal that counteracts the noise). So they don't provide a fair comparison with the SE112-GR's -- instead, they constitute a benchmark for excellent noise reduction and high fidelity.

While I would not use the SE112-GR for situations in which the strongest possible musical response was desirable, I would definitely use them for exercise or for a backup pair on a plane trip (I often use the PSBs on the plane, in spite of their size, because they do so well with noise cancellation). The SE112-GR is made with a rubberized surround on the part of the buds that you grip to insert and extract them from your ears -- so that is really useful when your hands or ears get wet from perspiration. Also, it probably strengthens the integrity of the bud and protects the equipment if you drop it, etc.

ADDENDUM, July 14 2014: Yesterday I had the opportunity to compare these earphones with $29 Apple EarPods, an entry-level product that first shipped with the iPhone 5 in 2012. In a brief test with a variety of musical material, the EarPods bested the Shure SE112 in every category except sound isolation. They are an easier load for headphone amps and computers, portable devices, etc. to drive, so they sound louder -- but even after adjusting the sound level, I found the EarPods produced a bigger sound, with richer harmonic detail, a wider frequency spectrum, and better imaging. This surprised me, and I feel compelled to lower my rating of the SE112 by one star. This makes it even more obvious that if you want good sound from a sound-isolating in-ear phone, you're going to need to get into the $100 to $200 price range. A number of excellent candidates are available there, including market leaders from Etymotic Research, HiFiMan, and RHA.

The one drawback that I've found to using all ""sound isolating"" earphones on a plane trip is that if you place them in your ears, creating a good seal, while the plane is ascending or descending, you'll experience discomfort in your ears as the cabin pressure changes, because the earphone seal prevents your ears from popping so as to adjust to the changes. You pretty much have to wait until you're at cruising altitude. Regardless of price or quality, that's a constant."
202,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like Most: They do isolate sound. I even turned down the volume and barely could hear my son (he had to yell). Easy to set up and use. I love the little bag and the extra items. The music did sound great too.
Like Least: It would not turn on if it states less than 6 hours of charge. It will turn on with more than 6 hours. I had to charge it twice before I could use them. They are a bit long but you are supposed to wrap them around your ears. Do not have control over what you are listening too. The ear pieces were pretty big."
203,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Good afternoon.
my sister bought this headphone for me and since he comes already with a defect, but as I do not live in the US, was hard to complain.
I'm going in June to Miami. Is there anywhere that I can change or fix the headphones?
Thank you."
204,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure Wireless Sound Isolating Bluetooth headphones are great quality at a good value. The earbuds fit good in the hear and the wire goes over the ear and helps keep the buds in. The sound is easier on the bass compared to other Bluetooth earbuds I own. Features on these buds that don't exist on my other Bluetooth earbuds include a microphone; 8 hours of runtime without charging, and a clip that helps the wire from flopping around. The sound quality is pretty good. Lots of value for the price."
205,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A minute or two on Amazon and you'll be able to find hundreds of earbuds. A trend in recent years has been to label them with a famous name--a producer, a hip-hop personality--and to tart them up with a designer look. Shure is the antithesis of that. They make simple gear that sounds good. Decades and decades in the transducer business give them the right to ignore all of that other stuff.

I placed these buds into a shootout with the only other earbuds that matter--my trusty Shures. My SE115s have been in use for a few years and they cost twice the price of the SE112s. It's not surprising they won the shootout. But the differences were subtle--a little more transparency, the edge of the violin bow, articulation on a tenor sax buried deep in a mix. The SE112s held up nicely. They're unforced, with a clear low end (not the thumping bass in the car next to you at the stoplight). You can listen to them for quite some time without fatigue.

The SE112s come with inserts of three different sizes. For my particular ears, this wasn't enough. The size that fit my ear canal best proved uncomfortable (coming quite close to the eardrum). The next size up doesn't seat securely. I compared these to the inserts from my older Shures and could see some differences in shape. It's quite true that ear canals are pretty personal, and these buds should fit most ears comfortably. But they don't fit mine. After a little rummaging around (this is why I never throw things away) I found inserts from another set of buds that fit more comfortably.

As you'd expect with Shure, construction is solid. If you take reasonable care of them, they'll hold up for years. Don't bother with junk. These are so much better."
206,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound good...the range of sound it provides is good enough to separate the instruments. the lows as with many in-ear monitors is OK. It is not over exaggerated and does not bleed into the mid sounds or high sounds. I think the major issue with them is that most people have a bit of trouble putting them on at first. The earbuds are bit hard at first but with use they become comfortable. Also on your first week of use they will fall off your ear from time to time, but you will become used to them and you will manage to set them in your ear correctly and they won't fall off. Over-all I think they sound good for $45. I will say they are 100% better than the EEM 6 PRO in sound."
207,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE these packs. They are the perfect size, made from safe material, dishwasher safe, perfect for putting homemade applesauce, yogurt, smoothies in. Less mess, kids have fun. They're perfect!"
208,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for the Kindle Fire Tablets and Laptop from which I play music. All in all, it holds on my ear ok, haven't had too much of problem slipping out. But, placing the hook over the year can be troublesome. But, for the music, doesn't sound great. I would expect that my music sound great.... for the price. It sounds tinny, just not something I want to have for listening to my music, youtube, etc."
209,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones are a far cut above what you normally get with most ipod and other devices. Build quality, extras, materials and a heavy duty cord set them apart. They compete well in their price range. I also own Shure's higher end earphones.

Packaging and extras are excellent. You receive extra rubber ear inserts in various sizes to get a tight fit which is essential in these type earphones. You also get a pouch and wax removal tool.

Build quality is excellent and up to Shure's standards as in their highly regarded and more expensive models. The cord is heavy duty and tangle resistant. The ear pieces are substantial. Many earphones fail in the cord connections and I just don't see that happening with these unless they are abused or accidently over-stressed. Connections are tight and substantial.

Sound is well balanced, full, and not overly accentuated in any particular frequency. I found it takes about 20 hours of use to break these in. Sound then, is somewhat warm, which means the mids and highs are not overly accentuated but well balanced. Bass is full but not overblown. If you like earphones which emphasize bass over other frequencies, look elsewhere. The sound is typical of Shure's excellent high end earphones, which is to say excellent for a single driver earphone.

Where I have troubles is in the fit. I prefer foam inserts and just can't find a good Shure rubber insert that doesn't cause me some pain and discomfort after about an hour of use. I use my Shure foam inserts in highend models for hours on end. Eerphones of this type require a good tight fit in the ear. I get that tight fit here but with some discomfort. I don't find this true of other earphones with rubber inserts I've used such as Sennheiser and Etymotic. Maybe it is just the way these fit.

If you don't have discomfort issues with the rubber inserts I highly recommend these earphones and would give them four stars. You simply won't find better sound and quality for the price."
210,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I tested these Shures using uncompressed sound tracks on my Macbook Pro, through a Sony PHA-2 headphone amp as a reference. For comparison I used Shure E5C earbuds and the results were predictable but on reflection very favorable. On the plus side, I appreciated the fit. The plugs come with several sizes of inserts for you to swap out depending on your individual needs. The mid size was affixed on unboxing but I found the small inserts to be a perfect fit. They're very comfortable and light and without that compression feeling some earbuds produce. The cord is slightly thicker than many products and seems to resist tangling. The earbuds are plastic, but have a nice fit and finish and don't look at all cheap. My impression is that the construction is relatively solid and should last a long time. The main concern for anyone is, of course, the sound. At first listen I felt a little disappointed. I listened to some Jonny Lang Blues, Some ZZ Top, and some Yo Yo Ma Cello. The much higher priced Shures were predictably bright, crisp, and lifelike and with booming base as well. These SE112's were flat and muted by comparison. Listening a little longer, I realized that that was not necessarily a bad thing. The sound was enjoyable especially with a relatively good base reproduction and sound in the vocals range, with a forced but enjoyable warmth. Highs seemed a little clipped, muted and flat. These are obviously not high end, but the user will be wearing them casually on the bus or in some public noisy place. In that environment, the sound and reproduction are actually ideal. They come with a small felt pouch with a draw string and clasp for storage. In terms of construction, a very comfortable fit, good sound isolation, relatively good base and warm strings and vocals, at this $50 price point I found them quite good. I'll also feel more comfortable carrying and using these in casual situations without the anxiety of theft or loss of earbuds costing over 10 times as much. I'm obviously not some audio authority, just a typical consumer, but if you're looking for an improvement over what comes with most cell phones and MP3 players without spending a fortune, you might find these a good fit.

UPDATE: I've been using these earbuds a few weeks now for music, but especially for watching movies on my Note 3 via Netflix, as well as Coursera lectures and have to say I'm liking them more and more. Fitted correctly in the ear canals, the sound isolation is excellent and the sound quality is really excellent. The wire insulating material and it's slightly thicker diameter do a great job at reducing tangles, so I've never needed to unravel an intertwined mess. I remove them from the pouch and they just sort of separate and you're good to go. Extremely happy with them."
211,3.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve owned a lot of shure headphones and these are typical great quality you expect from their phones and in ear monitors. Accurate and abundant sound that’s distortion free without the typically over emphacized bass. Likewise the sound isolation with their foam tips is nearly as good as most ear plugs. The these would be solid 9 out of 10’s.... except the battery life on my pair is averaging 4 hours. Only 50% of advertised 8 hours. First use I’d guess I got close to 8 but no longer. Maybe it’s an iPhone issue but if the problem sorts itself out I will update.
212,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overview: these phones represent a huge upgrade over any stock earphones. But, they are a distinct level below Shure's previous offerings. A good option for the price conscious, though serious audiophiles will want to look elsewhere.

This is my fourth pair of Shure headphones. With the exception of the Shure SCL4 Sound Isolating Earphone with High-Definition MicroSpeakers with Tuned BassPort, Black, which were stolen, I still own and use the others: Shure SE310 Sound Isolating Earphone - White and Shure E2 Sound Isolating Earphones.

Shure has always operated on the Ray Ban theory when it comes to pricing; very high list prices but periodic sales. I've always felt like the quality has been there with Shure headphones, but I never paid full price for them.

Now Shure has gone in a different direction with these phones, which are modestly priced and modestly equipped. Gone is the two staged cord, which could be separated depending on whether your listening device was in your shirt pocket. Also gone is the hard case to carry your headphones and the extensive set of ear pieces--though you get a few.

Curiously, unlike Shure's typical straight plug design, the cord of these phones has a 90 degree bend at the tip. This was probably done to make them sturdier, but will have the effect of complicating insertion into phones with deeply recessed cases. (I later noticed that my lower end E2s also have this 90 degree bend, whereas the SE310s do not.)

With that excessive preamble out of the way, let's evaluate the phones on what I think are the four most relevant factors in making your decision: sound, fit and comfort, sound isolation, and price.

Sound

Relative to the Shure E2 headphones, the listening experience is boomier and lacks a bit of clarity. A knock on Shure phones has always been that they deliver on the high and mid range, but they leave the rhythm section in the cold. To paraphrase, where's the bass? These phones have been engineered to counteract that criticism--they have solid, boomy bass. But, left on the cutting room floor is the superb clarity of previous Shure offerings in the high and mid.

Sound Isolation

Pretty good, but not the ""hear yourself thinking"" silence you get from Shure's higher end offerings. This isn't all bad, as they make for good city walkers where you want to hear a bit of ambient sound so you have a fighting chance of avoiding being run over by a deranged cabby.

Fit and Comfort

Although you don't get as many options as previous Shure products, unless you have seriously difficult ears you will find a decent fit. I was able to find a good fit pretty quickly. As far as comfort, these phones are perhaps the most comfortable in-earphones I've ever worn.

Price

These phones are very fairly priced in the market. Quality wise, they are superior to TDK's offering and equivalent to the comparably priced Sennheisers.

Overall, these are very decent, though not great headphones that are a good fit for someone looking for a modest upgrade over stock phones at a modest price."

NOISE ISOLATING NOT NOISE CANCELLING IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE
Per the info: “Sound Isolating design featuring comfortable sound isolating sleeves blocks up to 37 dB of ambient noise for extended listening, without distractions”. This means the sound isolation is mechanical, the way the headset fits in your ear. That is how the headset isolates the external sound. It is not electrical Noise Cancellation. I opted to get these thinking they were noise cancelling. I had a pair of Centrios noise cancelling ear phones that I traveled with. It was wonderful when I could not hear the jet noise. I would wear those even without music on.
That is NOT what this headset does. My mistake.

PAIRING AND INITIAL USAGE
Pairing is accomplished by holding down the center button of the controller for about 8 seconds. It was easy to do and I paired these headphones with both my phone and when I got into work my Mac Pro.

Using the headphones with music at home, I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary regarding the noise isolation. They had a good sound and it was nice not to have a cable running to my phone. I had considered wearing these to listen to my Calm app with Sleep stories (to help me fall asleep), but don’t think I can lay on my side with the way these earplugs stick out. Thought the noise isolation would help with my boyfriend's snoring.

Using the headphones at work there is a constant hum in my office that these headphones did not address, but it made conversations more muted."
214,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great and work well when sitting. They seem durable and well-built and the microphone / control works well. However, the cabling is very stiff and ungainly, often pushing on the buds in my ear or getting tangled up.

Personally, I need to use in-ear (in lieu of the Apple buds which fall out) and these don't seem to stay fit in-ear for long. After just a few minutes of walking, they work their way out. I'm testing different sizes of the cups, to see if that might help. I used to use Sony buds and they didn't have the cable issue, but didn't sound as well or last more than a few months at a time.

These come with a small carrying bag, which is nice to keep them clean."
215,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My reviewing perspective
*I'm using the Shure SE112 Earphones with a 4th generation iPod Touch and an iPad Mini that are loaded with music in MP3 and AAC formats.
*On my iDevices I mostly listen to rock and jazz. I don't like to hear a lot of bottom end, especially over headphones and earbuds.
*I'm not an especially demanding mobile listener because when I want to hear great sound or listen to classical music, I rely on my home stereo (yes, that's incredibly old school, I know).

What I like
*These earphones generate good sound. The high end, midrange, and low end are well balanced and clear, to my ears.
*The ear tips help ensure a good seal for blocking outside noise. Three sets of tips are included: large, medium, and small.
*The combination of a light weight and the soft tips make the SE112s very comfortable to wear for long periods.
*The Left and Right markings on the buds are large and easy to read.
*A velvet carrying pouch and cleaning tool are provided.

There is something important to keep in mind, though. As with anything that tightly seals up the ear canal, any movement in the earphones or cord translates into a distracting noise. Loud, busy songs can mask the movement sounds but they can be heard over most music.

Bottom line: The Shure SE112 Earphones are a fine way to listen to music. The big caveat, in my opinion, is that the movement noise makes these earphones unsuitable for workout or any other use that makes the cord swing around. If you can keep the cord still, though, the SE112s are a good replacement for cheap, stock earbuds. Four stars.

Update (October 2017): now also using with an iPhone 6s for listening to music (remember, these 'phones don't have a mic). No problems to report."
216,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered a pair in 2010. They sound great, when inserted properly, although it took me a while to get used to wearing them over the ear.

I didn't use them everyday but ultimately they suffered from the same problems as my previous pair of Shure in-ear headphones:

1) the cord starts splitting near any joints, exposing the wires. I was able to prolong the life by another year with Sugru patches.

2) the cord breaks internally near the angled plug, resulting in complete sound loss in one ear unless the cord is held at a certain angle, and even then, it's only a temporary solution.

If I buy Shure in-ear headphones again, it'll only be as a last resort."
217,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of these to keep as back-ups for a more expensive pair of in-ear monitors I use playing live. I then began using them almost daily, and can say these things are pretty much indestructible.

Mine have been dropped, thrown, kicked, stepped on in a gravel parking lot, left in cars both boiling hot and freezing cold, run through the washing machine and savagely attacked by a teething poodle, and they haven't missed a beat.

Sound wise, they cover the spectrum about as well as any single-driver ear bud can. They isolate outside noises well enough, and you can use a variety of tips to find a comfortable fit.

Overall, very good for the price."
218,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure SE112-GR Sound Isolating Earphones are good all around earphones, but nothing about them stand out as special. They are comfortable, and include a variety of different size ""sleeves"" for different sized ears. They do a good job of isolating ambient sound. The 50"" wire is a good length in my opinion. Sound quality is good all-around. I have earphones that sound better, but I also have some that are not as good. At this fairly low price point, the sound quality is more than acceptable. I listened to all different types of music to test these out, and the results were all for the most part positive. Shure advertises these to have ""Deep Bass"". I feel that is a little bit of a stretch. The bass isn't bad, but it was a little lacking for my tastes. The highs and mid-tones were all there though. All in all, they're just ""good"" all around. I wasn't blown away, but I wasn't disappointed either. In order to get the best sound and isolation, you have to make sure you have them inserted into your ears properly, using the correct size sleeve. If you're looking for earphones that won't break your bank, then I recommend the Shure SE112-GR Sound Isolating Earphones."
219,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Shure SE112-GR Sound Isolating Earphones are comfortable to wear, lightweight, and sound great. The earphones are supplied with 3 different sizes of sleeves; fortunately one of the sizes was a good fit, and provided the most external sound isolation. I tested the earphones with a ""pure"" 40 hz wave, this being fairly close to the stated limit of the frequency response. I did not sense any over-driving or distortion. In real-world use, a recording of a symphony orchestra sounded full in the bass and without attenuation at the upper frequencies. It may be that people accustomed to hearing exaggerated bass and treble might find the set slightly muted. However, the phones felt like they had plenty of reserve in terms of being able to handle louder volumes, i.e. in normal use I did not feel as if I was driving them to anywhere near their limit."
220,4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is very good and it tells you how much time you have on the battery. It took a little fiddling but once we got the right earbud on they were quite comfortable
221,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Shure makes solid audio equipment and I was excited to try these headphones out for running. They do sound great, but their comfort and fit is maddening.

The piece where the wire splits off into their respective earbud is made of slightly heavy plastic. That's a great design for strengthening an otherwise weak area, but it adds just enough weight that running (or even walking) gets it to bounce just enough and pull your headphones out. I tried putting it inside my shirt and the wires and/or separator would get caught with the same result. These need a clip and luckily I had a spare.

Once clipped, the earbuds never got tugged out by the weight of the cord but do work themselves out when running. I found myself readjusting them about every 30 seconds to 1 minute on my runs. It will slowly drive you insane, I promise.

In all, there are some better options out there. It's worth spending a little more and getting a much, much better set of earbuds both in quality and sound."
222,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My first thought when I got these earphones and I put them in without reading the instructions was....these are not very good....

But fortunately, I spent 60 seconds scanning the instructions and as it turns out, you have to insert these upside down (so the cord comes out on top). Magically as I rotated them in my ears 180 degrees, the sound came alive. There was a bit of presence to the music and finally some bass.

With that out of the way, my go-to ear buds for running are the Bose IE2 phones. However, these are almost half the price, and they're very similar sonically. Better, the cord is sturdy, and thicker, so it will not tangle, and I'd judge the build quality better overall.

What about the sound? It's full, the bass is there, and it's enjoyable to listen to music. They have sufficient volume from an iPod or other portable electronics, and feel very comfortable using them pretty much anywhere.

These are an excellent value and will be my new go-to earphones.

Pros:
Good sound if inserted correctly
iPod touch drives them very well
Sturdy
Excellent value
Multiple ear pieces provided for all ear sizes
Little velvet bad to hold them when not in use.

Cons:
I prefer the wire hanging straight down, not looped over my ears
The cord is a touch short. Another 4"" would be great"
223,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't decide if I was more pissed off at the designer or the manufacturer trying to run in these. Sitting still I didn't like them, but they were all I had to run in today and they are definitely not for cardio. I'd say best for killing long bus or plane rides, and even then, I don't enjoy the tight fit of the buds rubbing against ear bones and feeling my own pulse in order to get a little better range of sound in the music I CAN hear. Don't do it."

225,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Having purchased Shure headphones in the past, I was looking forward to checking out this new model from a very well respected company. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend these headphones. Compared with similarly priced SOL phones, these are tinny sounding at best. They have very little base and even the mid and high ranges were muffled and muddled. My music sounded like it was passing through a very thick panel of gauze. The Shure SE 112 is quite comfortable and fitted in my ears quite well, hence the two stars."
226,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an older model to the present Shure SE112 for 8 years now. It took some good beating but still works great. I've used them while sleeping to cancel out snoring when camping. I've stepped on them. I sport with them. At some point they even got little cracks around the housing of the monitors, but sound is still sweet as ever. I'm upgrading to the Shure 215's. No regrets! Worth every cent!"
227,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these earphones in December of 2011 and they have been working ever since. The sound quality is actually over my expectations for the price. The mids and highs are where these shine. They are loud and clear and even block out some of the noise. The bass is average I would say. Not too much but not too little where you can't hear it. The thing I love most about these earphones is the fact that I have put them through a lot of abuse and they still work perfectly. I work in a shop every summer and they have seen sparks, filler dust, and even a little heat from cutting torches and welding. Overall I'd say these earphones are a very good buy for the price. There are better options out there but as long as these have lasted they have fully surpassed my expectations."
228,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have owned 3 sets of Shure's extremely expensive models in the $600.00 +++ range. So I understand just how the very expensive models sound. What happens over the years is some of the previous high end technology reaches to the affordable introductory models - just like this model. Shure has included several sizes of ear foams for a comfortable set. The sound is very pleasant and gives a very pleasing range with a pleasing bass. I remember many years ago someone giving me their Walkman and telling me how great it sounded. I was polite and not impressed but we have come a long way and these are very good sounding and good value for someone looking for a reasonably priced upgrade.
229,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewing after having these for a year.
Complaints
1. Rubberized backs fell apart within 6 months
2. Wiring by the jack begins to lose signal within 6 months, forcing you to fiddle with the wire by bending and twisting to get a better audio signal.

Redeeming qualities
1. They make good passive noise canceling earbuds for when you're trying to sleep on a road trip or have some quiet in public transportation."
230,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good. I definitely think the sound these produce is way better than anything else in this price range. If you can though, spend $30-$40 more and get the Shure 215's. Your ears will thank you and if your cord ever breaks you can easily replace it without throwing out the earbuds... not something you can do with these SE112's.

As for taking calls with the mic, its OK, not great. Fine for the occasional call, but you wouldn't want to run a conference call on them. It picks up a lot of background noise and movement."
231,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Has good solid bass (not the overwhelming false bass that some cheap headphones do) and I especially like that high frequencies are well presented. comfortable for me. I also own some much more expensive headsets (which I don't want to take with me out of the house) and while they are better, the Shure SE112 really gives them a run for the money."
232,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these due to Shure's claims on their website that their headphones should work well in ""hostile"" environments such as sweat. Despite the claims, my headphones were horrible when used while exercising. Tried to run with them, but within 20 minutes of a summer run, sweat would cause the headphones to stop working completely. Shure's website claims, ""All of our earphones are tested in the presence of heat, humidity, and salt spray to make sure that they work in such a hostile environment. They are typically worn for hours at a time, and as you can imagine, the earphones are exposed to a lot of sweat."" I called Shure to complain and was told it wasn't unexpected that they wouldn't work well in sweaty conditions. When I pointed out that this was contradicted by their advertising, they were very nonplussed, and said they could try and repair them but that it was probably just going to happen again."
233,1.0 out of 5 stars,One of the ear buds went out and I've probably only worn them 10 times
234,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones seem to fit well in the ear and are better built then most of the competition in there price range. They seem to isolate extraneous outside noise and deliver a decent tonal range although in my opinion not as good as my older Senheiser phones which are superior in the higher tonal range. That said I must mention that the input pin on my older earphones has already failed because of its weaker construction. I also own older Koss Sportapro stereo phones that have passed the test of time and abuse and are still operative due to their sturdy construction. In summary these headphones deliver very good sound, are well built, and should last a long time. Hopefully their competitors will start designing better earphones and headsets using thicker wiring and sturdier connectors for longer lasting products."
235,4.0 out of 5 stars,Marvelous! I love Shure headphones. I've used them for years because they allow for better fit and comfort in my ear. Now with wireless option it has helped with freedom of movement.
236,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not saying I am an audiophile, but I have tried many of the best earphones of previous years. As with many of these products the Shure SE112 has delivered the crispest of sounds and has performed remarkably. It allows you to listen to every single detail in a song even from a low volume (3/15 on a Samsung Galaxy Note 2). As an added plus these headphones also add noise concealing so one can listen to music without any bother from the outside world.
The only drawback is the use of these earphones during a run. They are not perfect fit and tend to fall out. But they were made for enjoying music not exercise which is why I gave them a 5/5. Would definitely buy them again."
237,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these specifically to use with my phone on calls. The sound is good if nothing to write home about. They feel well maid and are comfortable during calls (Which is way more than I could say about the Apple earbuds that came with my iPhone).
238,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great. I use them on my frequent long bus rides and whenever I have 30 min to spare. I wanted great sound and something that would stand up the wear they endure during frequent use, these do that perfectly. The sound is balanced and a good value for the price. The cords are thick and seem well built. The sound isolation is great. I have used these on airplanes and noisy busses and all you hear is your music. Overall great earphones."
239,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have other sets of (more expensive) earphones, but have found that these often are better for outdoor use while walking or riding bus or trolley. Admittedly, I am a senior citizen whose hearing isn't what it used to be, but the sound is very good. Good spread of stereo separation, good balance of full range of sound for listening to classical music, along with a range of sizes of ear tips designed to fit and stay securely in the ear."
240,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am getting a bit puzzled... I own a lot of headphones, ranging from very cheap to my best: AKG K702 65th anniversary edition.
So the price ranges from about $5 to about $400...
Here comes the Shure SE112-GR for a starting price of $70... and it sounds very good!... I own already two other pairs of Shure: the SE-215 and the SE-530 and this one sounds somehow as good....

What I like:
- Maybe only 1 driver but it drives very well. The sound is full and not lacking at any frequency.
- Bass is present but not overwhelming.
- Sells for about $50 now.
- Shure is a very good brand.
- Fairly good separation or instruments.
- Solid non tangle cable (angled connector for better solidity).
- Tiny pouch for carrying case

What I like less:
- No remote
- No mic
- Cable goes around the ears... It may be good for working out but not as well for casual use (Need two hands to place).

Conclusion:

If you need a simple, no frills headset for casual use and workouts, this set may be the right one for you. You will get good sound, good bass.
If you need for a headset that can be multi-usages, you could try the Denon AH-C50 MA that sells for the same price but has less bass."
241,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Materials and build are decent at the price point.

Having fit them properly, I was deeply, deeply disappointed in the sound quality. Bass was very absent, mids were clear but lacking dynamics, and the treble was tinny and quite jarring. I ended up returning them and getting refurbished Klipsch R6 earbuds for $20 less, which sound great at this price point.

I would not recommend the Shure se112 if they were less than $10. They sound terrible."
242,1.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all these headphones sound bad, all high end, no low end. Secondly, they stopped connecting to my girlfriend's phone and consecutively my phone just after I was not able to return them... how convenient. DO NOT BUY THESE, THEY ARE GARBAGE, LITERALLY."

It has the elastic ear buds but I have some issues fitting into my ears for too long as they tend to fall off somehow, therefore I do not get the isolating effect from these earphones.

A relatively high quality pair of earphones good for travels in small places such as plane travels or cruises. Otherwise I prefer my headphones anytime."
244,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second Shure earbuds I recently used (the other being the SE315 model). In both cases I've gone thru the terrible experience in that one earbuds essrntially gives our (by losing volume) after little use. In the case of the SE112 it started out new so that's why it's especially disappointing. (For the other pair I had to at least give a benefit of doubt because I got it not in new condition though it was stated to be of minimal use, but I paid much more for it). I was hoping Shure would be a higher-end product I can use for home listening versus what I use when outdoors (currently a pair of JLab J5 which has lasted a long time). Unfortunately it turns out to not be the case. I won't be buying any more Shure products, that's for sure (some pun intended)."

246,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lovely sound quality and plenty of bass, but not overpowering. The sound canceling is great for a 50$ dollar pair of headphones. The pair comes with 3 different bud sizes, and when you get a good fit the sound comes alive. Listening to any music with them compared to the default iPhone ear-buds is a night and day difference. By far the best quality and value for ear-buds I have ever seen. Great highs and even better lows."
247,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am disappointed with these earphones. They are a great price and comfortable to wear, but the sound quality is awful. They are very tinny and have almost no bass. I purchased these because of the reputation Shure has for great audio products, but they fall short on the earphones in that respect. They are okay for talking, but awful for music. They earn the two stars for price and comfort. I will be sticking with better quality and more expensive earphones in the future and pass on the Shure brand."
248,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used Shure E2Cs for years, and have been quite happy with them. I was looking forward to trying a newer model of Shure's thinking things might have gotten even better. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. These earbuds have no bass whatsoever. The sound is very thin, and just not good at all. I tried multiple tips, and positioned them with the cable up, and the cable down, with no change in sound quality. Even at this price point, I cannot recommend these earphones."
249,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound (expected at the price-point), but they don't fit well at all. I have medium-sized ears (I am 6'3""), but these earbuds barely fit even when using the smallest inserts.

250,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent earphone. Brilliant sound and deep bass. The best for cost/benefit.
251,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a very diverse collection of speakers and headphones and earphones, and I rate these only slightly above the cheap Sonys that came with my iPod Classic. I have had a few earphones even cheaper than these that have a better sound, especially those made by Klipsch, while Yamaha makes vastly better earphones for just a little bit more money. I say this as someone who has owned Shure earphones before, and really loved what I had. My problem with these earphones are twofold.

First, they will not last. Over time I've realized that rubber coated wires are going to die sooner than you would wish. Especially if you live in a place like Chicago, where I lived for thirty years. One Chicago winter and these earphones would be dead.

Second, the sound is dense and muddy. A lot of earphones advertising a strong bass are trying to make you confuse a booming, muddy sounds with ""strong bass."" What you really should be looking for is a clear, strong tremble. Any set of earphones can produce something a ""strong bass,"" but I've found that the real challenge is finding earphones with anything even remotely approximating clarity and articulation. Instead of getting these rotten earphones for $50, go up to $95 and get yourself some lovely Yamaha EPH-100SL's. Your ears will thank you, as will the music you listen to one them.

Sound wise they are no better than the standard iPhone earbuds. The bass is terrible, everything sounds so ""thin"" and I have no idea why they thought it would be a good idea to make you put the cord behind your ear, you have to or they sound even worse, its really uncomfortable and just looks weird. Probably gonna return these and just get another pair of normal iPhone earbuds sadly."
257,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Would not work with Android devices. This is as much a criticism of the manufacturer as it is Amazon. If a product is not compatible with a major model of technology on the market (e.g. Android OS devices), then it would be best to make that as clear as possible to the consumer."
258,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is good, but...this is my fourth purchased pair of Shure earphones. None have failed, I broke one, and the others are still used in different places. Point is I used to like them. They employ an unusual wires-over-the-ear-wrap as they have before, but this version has wires so stiff they don't seem to 'want' to fit the plan of wrapping and more importantly staying there. I keep hoping the wires will break in but so far no luck. In addition, they used to come with a quality protective zippered case. Now just a cheap drawstring bag. Fortunately I kept the case from the set that I stepped on. As I mentioned, sound quality is good but otherwise a hassle thus far. Not impressed with this current cost-cutting version. Disappointed, in fact."
259,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did enjoy these earphones a lot, as the normal size buds were just the right size to tightly fit, and block most outside sources of noise. As it channels the sound towards your ear channel, when you start playing music, even at relatively low volumes, you get separated from the outer world nicely!
Even for those having issues with the buds, there`s the foam option, which I purchased for my wife, and those are not only even more effective, but are also more comfortable for those with smaller size ears.
There may be better ones, but these are definitely a great value. I`ve tried several earphones before, even with noise cancellation features, but this is way better than any of the others I tried."
260,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound great but are immensely uncomfortable and a pain to keep in your ears. The cable is supposed to go up and over the back of your ears, but keeping them there is near impossible if you move your head at all. Also, I'm using the smallest insert and I still get a headache fairly quickly. I never had any of these issues with my old sennheisers which were comparatively hassle free."

263,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Shure Sound Isolating Earphones. They are really good at isolating outside noise and stuff. However, the rubber on the earphones easily peels off so they are a little uncomfortable to wear. I have 2 sets of these earphones and both did the same thing. I cannot recommend these due to the cheapness of the rubber."
264,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used a ton of earbuds usually in the price range of $50-150 and these are decent with a few problems. My friends probably think I'm getting commission from Comply but I can't say enough, Comply earbud tips solve every ear seal problem, they are amazing and you can get solid bass from $3 earbuds with Comply tips. Always ignore any review of any earbud that says ""horrible bass"" because what they mean is ""horrible tips don't fit in my ears right."" As for these earbuds, the sound quality is pretty good. Great detail, bass isn't enhanced so it doesn't drown out the rest of the sounds but I bet with the stock tips it sounds like crap. Keep in mind that if you have an Android phone you won't be able to use the volume controls but I bought these mostly for my macbook at work. These things would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that they are designed to have the wire go ""over your ear"" but the wire is so thick that it falls off your ear if you are sitting as it doesn't want to bend. They should have heat-formed the wire to have a natural bend. I will probably do this on my own with a hair dryer. It is bad enough to lose it two stars as I've had to put the wire back over my ears twice while writing this review and I have fairly large dumbo ears that shouldn't have this problem."
265,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these at church to plug into a monitor system on stage while playing keyboard. They fit securely in your ear, provide superior sound, and truly cuts down on most of the background noise most earphones like this allow through. I usually only play with one plug in one ear, and leave the other one out, so I can hear the live sound as well."
266,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these headphones because I lost my beloved Sony earbuds. My previous buds had excellent sound quality and great isolation and Sony has usually been my go-to for earbuds. I thought After much research I thought I'd give the Shure's a shot and I'm not disappointed!

I tested every feature straight out of the box : Sound Quality and Clarity, Isolation and Comfort, Microphone and Remote functionality.

In terms of overall sound they were initially lacking. The highs and mids were not very crisp and the bass didn't quite ""punch."" They sounded like lower grade headphones. After about 45 listening I let these puppies burn in. I let them play all my music for about 3 hours around 40dB and it made a huge difference. The bass was really coming through and the sound was less thin. I re-listened with my usual playlist :
Main Theme - LA Noire Soundtrack (Andrew Hale)
Movie Theme - The Information (Beck)
All In - Until The Quiet Comes (Flying Lotus)
The Nightcaller - Until The Quiet Comes (Flying Lotus)
Fratres for Eight Cellos - Fratres (Arvo Part)
Digital Lion - Overgrown (James Blake)
Une barque sur l'ocean - Ravel Complete Works for Solo Piano (Jean-Yves Thibaudet)
When Did You Stop Loving Me - Marvin Gaye

In terms of isolation these are a great option for the price. They do lack drivers and rely on the tips and design to block out the noise but they succeed nonetheless. For safety it's probably best to wear these in more quiet areas and when you aren't trying to have a conversation with someone. After long periods of time they can become uncomfortable. They must remain quite tight in the ears to get the best out of the isolation and sound clarity. They can also be in different ways and not only with the cord over the top of the ear.

The microphone works well and the remote is responsive. I made a few phone calls and the people I spoke with had no trouble hearing me and said it was very clear. All of the remote's functions worked perfectly and that is the main reason why I chose this model. I was teetering between these and the 215s which most likely have a better sound but, disappointingly, lack the microphone and remote.

Overall the buds were a great buy for the price tag. If you're searching for a good sounding pair of in-ears with a microphone (sorry Android, iPhone only) then I'd highly recommend these."
267,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good build quality and near complete sound isolation. Very good sound quality and a value for the price. The instructions suggest that the ear buds can be worn with the wire wrapped around the ear, but I found the cable a bit to firm to stay around the ear. Luckily the buds are light enough to be comfortably worn directly."
268,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Yeh, well, this is ok stuff but do not listen to better and as for sound isolating, maybe 10 db. Wear on the bicycle is good, but does not cut noise well enough on a motorcycle with a full face helmet and no fairing/windshield over 30mph. Great in the tight, technical twisties at low speed, good, not great, bass."
269,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exceeds expectations. Rugged built, easy access to volume controls. Good frequency response and sound isolation. The dollar to performance pricing is right on. Shure has done it again along with classics such as the V-15 Type4 phono cartridge and the SM57/58. No hissing or spitting on the highs and some power on the lows with no rumble."
270,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have to say that to me the headphones are good enough. It isolates external noises pretty well and fits very well in my ears. The only thing that I don't like it's that while playing (I use them as my personal monitor), it seems the headphones are going to fall off. Besides that, I think they are very good."
271,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in love with these headphones. The quality is terrific, and I am impressed with the isolation such small buds provide."
272,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well-balanced sound quality - not too much bass, and it seems relatively flat, which is what I expected and wanted. They're a little bit large for my ears as compared to some previous earphones, but I get a good seal for the most part despite this. Construction seems very solid, and the remote/microphone is convenient. All around, I consider these a solid mid-range earphone and a huge upgrade over typical earbuds."
273,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of SE112 earphones, so I like the sound, but my left earbud has stopped working after only 5+ months of moderate use! My first pair still work well after years of use. I bought this new pair in February because of the straight jack - it connects better to my iPhone and my iPad when in their respective protective cases. I am bummed! Now I must figure out if and how I can replace this pair under warranty."
274,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use these on stage and the sound is great.
275,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These ear phones were fine while they were working. The sound quality was not great and I had to speak directly into the microphone on calls in order for it to work. The biggest problem though, was that they broke after just 3 months with sound only coming out of one ear."
276,5.0 out of 5 stars,These earphones are the least expensive of the high end ear buds. For the price they are excellent and provide good sound and excellent stereo separation. They seem to be constructed very well and I use them in bed with no problems. All in all they are hardy and provide excellent sound quality. I am very happy with them and would purchase them again if needed.
277,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Left side output is intermittent after about a dozen uses over a 2 month period. My stock iphone headset is more consistent than this. Left side went about 2/3 down in volume during a gig last weekend while using click track. Brought it home, worked OK once, then next use the left volume was down again. Can't use it for intended purpose... Verified issue with multiple devices."
278,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not as full in the audible sound spectrum as I had anticipated, but a novel idea in sturdier construction of the wires. Hopefully this is the beginning of less flimsy relatively inexpensive ear buds. They are comfortable in the ear."
279,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a long time Shure earphone user. I got these to go with my new iPhone as I wanted the Mic + remote control. The sound is very good given the price (yes the higher model Shure's sound better) and the remote works perfectly with my iPhone.
280,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These earbuds are quite honestly the best and most comfortable earbuds I've ever used. While the microphone/remote control falls short on how it works, I honestly love the pair. The only main problems I've encountered with these are that they seem to fall out pretty easily but it isn't that big of an issue. I would not use these earbuds for working out by any means. Along with that, it seems the only earbud tips you can replace these with are the ones which come with the pair you received."
281,2.0 out of 5 stars,"the android capabilities are limited to pause and unpause; the volume buttons don't do anything. If I had known that, i'd have saved myself a few bucks and got the version WITHOUT the non-functioning remote."
282,3.0 out of 5 stars,keep falling out
283,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Already had the shure se215's,and I purchased the se112's to see how much of a difference there is! The se112's are on par if not a little better than my $50 and under earbuds which I have now! Don't like the cheap felt case it came with! Found a small plastic case with a pouch to put the cleaning kit and earbuds in! As far as the se215's go,they've got an amazing sound that's a smaller version of an on ear in your ear! The se215's are the first earbuds that I ever had that blew me away! They have a decent soft case to put your earbuds,and pouch inside to put your cleaning case in! Don't buy the se112's,instead spend a few more dollars for the se215's, you'll thank me later! Mar1,2016 update: I'm warming up to these alot more after listening to them for a couple of days now! I like these alot now,but like I said,I'd still go ahead and pay the extra $50 for extra clarity and overall sound,but that being said I still like both! These are my first 2 pairs of shure earphones and hopefully I won't have cable issues like a good percentage of the people have!"
284,5.0 out of 5 stars,Have these hooked into my SENA SMH-10's earbud baseplate. They work great at keeping the excess wind noise out and sound awesome to boot. Makes carrying on HAM radio conversations at speed easy.
285,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited to write a review for the earphones as I wanted to see the performance over a longer period. It's been 11 months since I bought them .i bought two pairs, one for a friend. Both of us experienced the same issue .one of the earbuds stopped working (1 set after 8 months, 2 set After 11 months). I am not sure how long earphones usually last but less than a year should not be the norm. Apart from that, I thought the earphones were great ,had a great sound quality for the price. If you are a runner, you might want to consider other earphones as it kept falling of but not as frequently as my apple earphones."
286,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great earphones! I have used them daily for a few weeks now. I use them with Comply foam tips. The sound is nice and balanced. There is plenty of bass without it being overpowering. They also block most of the outside noise (great on the subway).
The cable and remote are solid. I wish they had memory cables for the over the ear portion, but they are very comfortable nevertheless."
287,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate it because the right ear bud stopped working after three months. I took good care of them, but there's not much you can do about a manufacturing problem. It's hard to like something that doesn't work. Oh, and conveniently, I can't return them after a month..."
288,2.0 out of 5 stars,this is my 3rd pair of Shure ear buds. These are the worst and would not recommend. The cords to the ear buds do not 'mold' around the ear and one earbud wire keeps flying off of my ear if I turn my head. The manufacture of this earbud is very disappointing.
289,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Grandson was very happy with the earbuds. He uses them for gaming and says that they really isolate the room noise well. They are not noise cancelling, but fit so well that they really keep the noise down."
290,5.0 out of 5 stars,"work great. i got these originally to use with an in-ear system, but ended up using them with a Roland SPD-SX electronic drum / sample pad and they are solid. good quality build and audio. can't complain"
291,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband loves them, he says they isolate him from all the surrounding noises very well while he is working."
292,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is excellent. It has three different sized earpieces but I am still struggling to find the right size that will stay in my ear while running. The earpiece is longer than my previous earphones and fits further into the ear than I like.
293,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Extraordinarily good sound for the price. Much better than your standard apple/skull candy/beats earbuds for the same price. Only complaint is that the cones that are included don't fit everybody's ears, so you may need to purchase third party cones. Once they fit right, the noice cancelation and sound is impeccable for the price."
294,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good sounding headphones. They do a good job of blocking out my employees when they are trying to complain to me. My only gripe is the clip broke shortley after getting them. I suppose it's to be expected with plastic though.
295,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound and hands free option from the most reputable company in consumer and professional audio products.
296,5.0 out of 5 stars,very handy & good pricepoint
297,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These earphones sound great... They really do. But the fit is awful no matter which sized ear piece I used. I found the instructions for how they are supposed to fit over the ear but the piece still falls off even when I'm just sitting in one spot. Even worse is using these at the gym or while running where they're impossible to keep in the ear, especially when you begin to sweat"
298,2.0 out of 5 stars,The audio quality could have been a bit better for the price point. I would have kept it had it not been defective. The controls only worked intermittently.
299,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First, let me say that I'm a huge fan of Shure. I have tried a number of their products, and in terms of build quality and a lot of times sound quality, they are hard to beat. Seeing that these are in a new (cheaper) category for Shure, they had to make some sacrifices. Those sacrifices come mainly in the sound department. That is not to say these sound bad, just under par for what one would expect from Shure.

Build

Like I said, it's hard to beat the build quality of these headphones. The cable is nice and thick, there is hefty strain relief at the points where it counts.The thick cable does a great job at keeping them untangled. This is the kind of headphone you will likely lose before they break. There are no detachable cables, as you would see on the higher end of the SE line, but at $50 it just doesn't pay to buy a new set of replacement cables for $30. However, you will likely not have any issues with the cable unless you are prone to slicing at your headphones with a knife. They also come with a small pouch, which will do the job, but isn't the most elegant solution out there.

Comfort

Personally, I really like the feel of these headphones. Although Shure says these are meant to be worn ear bud style, I would recommend getting used to wearing them behind your ear. If worn ear bud style, they just feel like they will fall out of your ears. Once you get used to putting the wire behind your ear, you will probably not go back. It provides a nice security, and helps reduce cable noise. One thing that is not often talked about is the ear buds themselves. The tips Shure provides are some of the best silicone tips I have ever used. They do a nice job at isolating sound, and just feel nice!

Sound Quality

They aren't bad, but they aren't the best in this price category. These have some nice mids, and decent highs, but they low end seems a bit muddy. They do have a similar warm tone to the SE215s, but you wont get the deep bass or some of the clear highs as found in some others at this price. They just don't have the kind of range you would expect from a Shure product. They do a great job at isolating sound, but not quite as good as the step above.

Overall

These are for someone who values build quality over sound quality. These won't WOW the audiophiles out there, but they will outlast almost any other offering at this price. If you want something with better highs, go for the M6 Pros. If you want something with better overall sound quality, go with the V Sonic VSD3S. If you want a pair that you can use and abuse with no worries, I would go for the SE112s. If you have the extra money to shell out, I would recommend going with the SE215s. The addition of detachable cables, the nicer zip case and the better sound make them well worth the extra money."
300,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for everyday use
301,5.0 out of 5 stars,Blocks out outside noise as well as awesome sound - watch out you might blow out your eardrums on a song you like. All in all well made and I'm happy with my purchase - - - so far only 1 day. But I also bought the protection plan just in case.
302,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked this earphones. I don't really know that much about acoustics, bass and that kind of stuff but I think they comply with the isolating function. What I didn't like that much was that the cable was too wide for what I am used to have but I hope that means more durability and I also didn't like that the mic and volume thing is too big if it were more little I would really liked them more but overall I think they are okay. I'm sure out there you can find a wide variety of earphones for a lower price."
303,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work perfectly
304,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously one of the best earphones I've heard at this price range. I can't speak highly enough about the absolute clarity of all ranges, including the bass. Just beautiful."
305,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed in these. There is NO bass and it is treble overload. I purchased because they said enhanced bass. I have an old pair of v-moda that sound way better.

Also, they will not stay in my ears. I have tried for about an hour but the way they have you put the cord over your ears is impossible and uncomfortable."
306,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality was quite good. I could never get them to stay in my ears very well, however. The reason for the negative review is because the right ear stopped working after about 8 months of light use. Really disappointing."
307,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I need to return them but havent had the chance, the right side keeps cutting out on me, when i jiggle the cord then it works."
308,4.0 out of 5 stars,Battery is good. Gives more than 6 hours in one charge. Charge pretty quickly as well. One problem is it is too long. So it hangs out a bit below neck. Not a terrible problem but it would be better if it was little shorter
309,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These sound much better than cheaper headphones and they last longer. The main cord is thicker than most similar headphones, which makes them more durable and harder to tangle. A small pouch is included, which makes it even less likely they will tangle. I have actually heard new layers in songs I have heard thousands of times before. My son went through 3 cheaper headphones and these were still good, so I bought him his own."
310,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is not as good as expected and the sound level is unsteady. Forward button does not work consistently. Have it for two weeks and going to retire it.
311,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fits great, blocks out almost all sounds (when listening to something), and I use them constantly on planes and in the office. Liked them so much that I bought another pair. Note: these replaces a pair of Klipsch Reference Series ear buds that I hated."
312,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First pair had gotten worn, but needed to update. Really good at isolating background noise. Comfortable in my ears too."
313,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best headphones out there on the market.
314,1.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I was happy with these headphones, but after 4 months they will no longer pair with my cell phone, so they are useless. Too much money for something that stopped working so quickly"
315,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product and great service!
316,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty fair earbuds, but I wasn't really enthused as the driver seemed to lack the deep rich sounds I have with other headphones"
317,5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely excellent earphones. They hold up well to near-constant use and do a great job blocking out exterior sound as well as just sounding great. I moved to these after a number of years using cheaper earbuds and have not looked back. Worth the investment!
