    ","Video review: Yes, they work with glasses!Decent bang for your buck. If you listen closely there's a bit of 'fuzz' noise, but that is drowned out once the music/video starts playing.These are the BEST headphones I've tested (and I've tested a lot) when it comes to latency--that is there's no delay when viewing a video on my iPhone and the audio that's playing.Note: There's quite a delay when pressing Siri. Like a good 3-4 seconds before she's 'activated.'",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Video review: Awesome bang for your buck. Folds up compact, decent quality, and they look awesome."

    ","Pros: comfortable on my large head. No headphone has ever covered my ears without hard places or sweaty or too tight. These are good for hours2. Battery seems to last many hours. Lost track3.

We'll see how they hold up to long daily useUpdate 9/30/2017  I wear these for several hours each day.  Holding up well.  Battery still holds good long charge.  I added moleskin to the earpads to make them a little more comfortable.  Ear holes could be a tad bigger for my head and ears.  Overall still the best headphones I have owned.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wear them Daily

    ",Fantastic head phones! They stay charged FOREVER! I had them fully charged and used them for an hour on average 6 times a week and did not need to charge them again for a month! The only complaints I have is when doing certain exercises they tend to slide off my head a little so I have to adjust them a few times.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase

    ",My wife took over my $300 head phones so I needed to find something that was ok and won't break the bank. These headphones sound just as good as my $300 set for the most part. They aren't as strong in the bass but they still hold their own as far as I'm concerned.They are very comfortable over my ears and are easly adjustable also the battery seems to last long enough for me before I need to recharge.They are not noise canceling but do block out enough outside sound that I can forget the world around me and enjoy my music.Now the only problem I have is she want's these and says I can have my old headphones back....go figure ;),5.0 out of 5 stars,great headphones for the price

    ","I've really enjoyed these MPow Bluetooth Headphones, especially for the price.  At an entry level price, you get good sound and long battery life.  It doesn't have the really deep bass like some other headphones do, but they offer decent balanced sound.  If you wear them for more than an hour, it could start to hurt your ears if you have larger ears.  If you use the bluetooth feature, make sure you either turn your headphones or phone volume all the way up to maximize your volume.  With one turned all the way up then you can control the volume with the other device.They pair really fast with an iPhone 6S Plus and they have audio cues to let you know what mode the headphones are in.Making a call was clear, but having my voice muffled by the over-the-ear style headphones isn't ideal for me, so I probably wouldn't use them for long calls.While they don't have active noise cancellation, they do a good job at keeping background noise out because of the style.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sound for Budget Headphones

    ","Need a nice value bluetooth headphones with durability, good sound quality, & can be wireless OR wired? This MPOW headphone is it!*Unit Operational Test*This is a pretty simple unit to test. I started with testing fitment / adjustment to my head using the sliders (stainless steel sliders, nicely done!) while also testing the ability for folding the headphones (worked great, very solid feeling). The memory foam ear cushions and along the inside of the headphone band where the top of your head will touch feel very comfortable with good spring in the foam. It is an attractive set of headphones, good use of contrast red, silver, and black. The device is touted to NOT be active noise canceling so we'll test passive noise reduction with the over-the-ears cushions.The device has user controls on one side (power, volume up, volume down, track forward, track reverse, play / pause) on the right-ear side. My Test: 1) Turn on the Headphones ... you'll heard a clear voice 'Power On' message. 2) Turn on Bluetooth on your phone and pair the MPOW headphones / connect. 3) Start up your preferred music or audio smartphone app. 4) Operate the headphones (connected and streaming from your BT-enabled phone) for 10 hours continuous streaming and wired mode (using the supplied 3.5mm audio cable) along with conducting a test phone call. Then power off the headphones.I used my primary phone, a new Nexus 6P as my initial test. I turned on the headphones (the headphones provide an initial""powering on"" along withe a ""not paired"" audio cue), then paired the device and connected by phone using Bluetooth (yet another audio cue ""phone 1 connected""). I next started up one of the music apps. Eureka, it works!. Sound quality is quite good especially at this price (little emphasis in the mid-band imo). I can confirm no active noise cancellation but with the nature of the ear cushions I did experience reduce ambient noise when the headphones were on and in use. Sound can get LOUD but yet clear (no distortion nor crackling), which is nice to see. You won't get thumping base or highs, but that's to be expected.I next disconnected from bluetooth and attempted to test wired connection using the supplied 3.5mm audio cable that was supplied by MPOW to connect to my phone's headphone jack. The MPOW worked well in wired mode! Very handle to have both wired and wireless modes. I lastly powered off the headphones (nice touch for an audio ""powered off"" confirmation cue).My next test was to make 2 phone calls (one to my home landline phone and one to my cellular voicemail). Calls were very clear and quite loud (with the headphone volume turned all the way up), and everyone could hear me fine using the built-in mic. This test completed successfully as well.*Recharging*The MPOW Bluetooth Headphones offers built-in rechargable battery (420 mAH) that is rated to last up to 13 hours of continuous music time or 15 hours of talking time. I've done a test with the headphones running while streaming music using bluetooth, my test ended after 10 hours and it was still running! That's more than enough run-time for me.I tested recharging as well using the micro-usb port (found on the same side as the user controls). You'll see a red led light come on.. It took me several hours for a full recharge after using for 10 hours straight in my music playback test.*Build Quality*Very solidly built device. Not in the same league materials-wise as Bose but also not in the same price range. Good use of sturdy plastics, memory foam as the ear cushion, stainless steel for the adjustable sliders. The unit's folding capability also worked well, very solid feeling along the hinges. Good fit and finish overall.*Conclusion*This MPOW Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear delivers in what they said this device could do. It connects seamlessly to your BT-enabled phone and can play streamed audio but also can accept a wired connection (no battery charge needed in wired mode!), the headphone design is foldable (great for travel & storage in general). It's a solidly-built and comfortable-to-wear device. Mpow offers a 45-day money back guarantee and a 18-month worry-free guarantee as well (I've not yet needed to take advantage on the other Mpow items I've bought in the past, all are working great). I would happily recommend these headphones to friends and family, especially for the value & flexibility to use in wireless or wired mode.Mpow Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear, Hi-Fi Stereo Wireless Headset, Foldable, Soft Memory-Protein Earmuffs, w/ Built-in Mic and Wired Mode for PC/ Cell Phones/ TV",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice value for bluetooth headphones (foldable / wired AND wireless / good build quality)

    ","Amazon reviews used to be helpful; I'm learning to start tempering them with a good dose of skepticism.  Apparently terms like ""fantastic"", ""amazing"", and ""phenomenal"" are used loosely and to cover a wide range of very average products.  First off, FOR THE MONEY these are decent headphones.  They aren't anywhere close to better headphones in sound quality or build quality, but they aren't close to the price either.My first and main issue with them is that there is noticeable lag between the show and the sound through these headphones.  Any lag in sound while watching a show makes them unusable in my opinion.  For music, not a big deal at all of course.Second, the sound through these headphones is very average.  There is no deep bass; I've used much smaller headphones (not over ear, and not earbuds) that have MUCH better low range.  I have a pair of over ear headphones I purchased on Amazon for under $100 that have fantastic (truly fantastic, not fantastic for $35) sound, clarity, and low range.  There is some noticeable fuzz/static while listening to shows, though not enough that it really bothers me.Let's stop giving 5 star, better than my Bose (not a fanboy), glowing reviews to average products.  It doesn't help anyone who needs honest opinions about products.Lastly, mine only came with an audio cable and a USB cable; it did not include a power adapter, which it sounded like it should from the manual when it tells me to insert the charger into a standard outlet.For $35, this is an OK set of headphones.  I wouldn't buy them again if the lag issue during shows is normal.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Lag when using these to watch shows, average sound"

    ","I waited over a month to write this review because I thought no way could these headphones actually be this good for the price.  But I use them all day everyday and I have never been more impressed with headphones under >$50... I have sensitive ears with headphones and am super picky but these are so comfortable I can sleep in them.  Noise reduction is great when something is playing, pretty crummy though when there's no audio. Fast charge, easy to pair Bluetooth or wire jack, play/pause and fwd/rwd buttons are handy.  Overall definitely worth the buy, highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,$30 is CHEAP for five stars *glory hands*

    ","As a certified audio professional who mainly listens to and composes rock music, I can say that at this price point you are not going to get Sennheiser, Bose or Beats audio quality out-of-the-box. However, for the price these are useable headphones that are more than capable of providing decent audio quality (once the right adjustments are made). They require a bit of frequency gain reduction between 60-250Hz to reduce boom and a boost at around 16kHz to establish clarity. Once you’ve done that you’ll have a more balanced sound from these headphones.The bluetooth volume controls, and battery status bar indicators of these headphones are natively supported on Android (but not on macOS.) In other words when you adjust the volume on your headphones it will directly adjust the volume control on your Android device. On the Mac the headphone’s volume is independent of macOS. Play/Pause and Skip buttons work natively on both platforms.There are no latency issues when watching video. Lips move in sync with audio.The MPOW 059 supports the SBC audio codec exclusively, which means no AAC or AptX is present. It would have been great to see support for AAC seeing as it is a superior codec to SBC but nonetheless sound quality is reasonable.macOS users will need to download the “Hardware IO Tools for Xcode” from Apple’s developer page in order to get the “Bluetooth Explorer” application. This application will allow you to increase the bitpool value from its default value of 40 to 53. This will dramatically improve the audio quality of these headphones and any other bluetooth headphones that rely solely on the SBC codec. For those who want specifics: a bit pool value of 53 is equal to a bitrate of 325 kbps. SBC at 325 kbps is the equivalent of MP3 at 256 kbps. When the you’ve downloaded “Hardware IO Tools for Xcode”  and have opened the Bluetooth Explorer app you will see the app’s name in your menubar. Go to “Tools > Audio Options” or “Command + Shift + A”. This will bring up the window for you to edit the SBC audio settings. Under “SBC Codec Options” Set all bitpool values to 53 and close the window. This will ensure that the audio quality remains optimal. Close the window and re-connect your Bluetooth headphones.Build quality seems reasonable, hinges are reinforced with metal. Only time will demonstrate the endurance of these headphones but superficially speaking the headphones appear to be quite sturdy. The ear-cups and headband are made of a soft synthetic leather which provides initial comfort but they are a bit shallow in depth and can place a bit of pressure on the ears when the headset is worn for an extended period of time. Battery life is reasonable. Accessories include a micro-usb cable for charging and a 3.5 mm audio cable which is handy for more critical listening and for events in which the battery has lost its charge. The velvet-like pouch is a great inclusion and provides protection against dust and scratches. These headphones are definitely worth the price and I doubt you’ll find better at this price point.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Pair of Bluetooth Headphones for the Price

    ","Really great headphones for the price! I had a pair of $60 headphones & I honestly prefer these. They were specifically bass heavy headphones but ended up being muffly sounding so I bought these instead & I can honestly say that the Mpow headphones are better overall, they are very crisp and clear BUT they do not have heavy bass at all. I listen to a lot of bass heavy dubstep & these headphones do not have strong bass in my opinion whatsoever. But on a plus note, as I said, the sound is very crisp & clear & the volume does get decently loud. If your phone/device is at full volume the headphones can still go louder which is great. Kind of wish it had a hard case instead of the sack but that’s not really a big deal. Super comfortable on your head, super soft pads! Also, these headphones are super simple to operate & connect to devices. I would recommend these for sure!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Quality For The Price

    ","I really liked these Headphones, the sound was good, the comfort was there, but here it is 2 months past being able to return them and they dont work.  I used them last night without issue, came in this morning charged them up like I always do before using them and now they will not turn on.  The red light does not come on when I try to charge them.  Now they will not work as Bluetooth headphones which is why I bought them.  I guess I can reach out to the company for a warranty repair.  Which is what I will probably do, but if these things only last a couple months then they will only get a 1 start review from me.Update:  I sent an e-mail about my issue and they said to mail the headphones back and that once they receive them they will ship back a new pair and pay me for shipping.  Today I received a brand new pair of headphones that work great.  Thank you very much, review has been updated to reflect their customer service, I will update in a couple months if these things are still working and I just got a bad pair.Thanks MPOW!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth stopped working after only a couple months - Received replacement promptly.

    ","I've had them for a week now and have used them just about everyday, I think I've got a good handle on them. These headphones aren't the worst I've ever used but they definitely aren't the best. I've got a pretty big head and they are able to be adjusted to fit my big dome quite comfortably. They feel like they're decently made. Some headphones that are this style feel like they'll break in half when you put them over your head, luckily these don't feel that flimsy - but I still don't want to toss them around too much.I wear them in 2 situations, 1 in which they perform exceptionally and another where they leave some to be desired. Situation 1 - around the house after work when I listen to podcasts, the perform very well. The voice of the podcasters are clear and rich. The ability to leave my phone stationary charging up and still use headphones is clutch. Situation 2 - at the gym, listening to music. The bass boost in these headphones is too much for my musical interests - mostly metal music. The low end of these headphones tends to muddy the guitars and midrange sounds. If you listen to EDM or something similar they tend to sound better with this style of music. If you listen to heavy metal, I'd pass on these. My last complaint is that these headphones keep my head hot while I'm at the gym because the ear coverings are so large. I'll get so hot that I'll have to take them off and wipe off my disgustingly sweaty head. So there's that.What else is included? There's a carrying bag that's made from a similar material as the Crown Royal bags, if you're familiar with those. There's a micro-USB cable and a 3.5mm audio cable, both about 4 feet long.I included a dollar in my pictures for scale.**UPDATE**After my review I was contacted by customer support regarding my displeasure with the headphones. They offered 3 potential solutions:1) send a different set of the same model,2) a similar model they suggested,3) or offered to send me a model of my choosing.I know some people like these poofy headphones but they've never impressed me so I went with option 3 and chose the MPOW Cheetah headphones and have been really impressed with them. I'd give them a solid 7/10 on audio quality. There are certainly limitations regarding audio quality when it comes to ear bud style headphones but these definitely play heavy metal in an extremely satisfactory way. Not too bassy, pretty clear highs and mids.I like that I'm able to turn the volume up beyond what my phone suggests because c'mon, there's a reason I can't hear in the first place (listening to my headphones too loud...#cantstopwontstop). The buttons feel solid and have already taken quite a bit of use, because I'm always skipping songs. I think everybody does though, so I'm good there. The only thing that's a little counterintuitive, at least to me, regarding the buttons is that to change to the next song you have to click the volume down button. That just takes some getting used to but is hardly a negative.Like most ear buds, after extended use they start to cause some discomfort in the ear. But that's not a negative as much as it's an indication to rejoin the rest of the world. If anything it's a feature.Overall I've been very impressed with the MPOW Cheetahs, I'd give them 5/5. I stopped using the original headphones entirely, actually. The battery lasts a couple of days before needing to be recharged, though, to be honest I'll usually proactively charge it after 3 or 4 days.It's been a while since I got these so I can't remember if it came with a micro-USB cable or not, I don't seem to have an extra anywhere though. Honestly I'm glad, I've got so many already I'm glad I don't have another. But it is a micro-USB slot.TL:DR Anyway, to wrap this up: I do not recommend the MPOW poofy over ear headphones initially reviewed. I highly recommend the MPOW Cheetahs, though, 5/5.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent

    ","Birthday gift for our 19 year old son who keeps either breaking the headphones or they crap out on him after a few months. He LOVES the bluetooth and that they are over the ear.....as do I. They fold up as well, although he hardly ever takes the time to do so during the few hours that he actually doesn't have them on.

So far, these have felt very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent. I was able to easily pair them with my Nexus 5. I'm still figuring out how to pair them with my Asus Chromebook.

    ","For what they cost, these do a pretty good job. The sound quality is fine but not great (these are by no stretch of the imagination Bose headphones!), and they occasionally cut out for a moment here and there when on bluetooth mode. I use them for commuting on public transportation, and it's really nice not to have to deal with tangling cords with my bag, etc.. I also use them occasionally at my desk at work, and was worried about sound carrying over as some folks have mentioned, but I asked my officemates and no one could hear anything. I think as long as the cup is well fitted around your ear, no sound should come out. They're definitely large and in charge, but I prefer over-ear to on-ear, so that's what you get. They've held a charge amazingly well so far--I've used them off and on for over a month now and haven't yet had to charge them after their initial charge. The buttons are a little cheap feeling, and the voice confirmation of settings (power on, power off, etc.) drive me nuts, but overall they're decent enough and do the job.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty decent for commuting.

    ",I received the item in a timely fashion. I unpacked it and read the user manual. Then I charged it. The red light came on and in a couple of minutes it went out. I thought maybe it had been charged and was still holding the charge. I was able to pair it with my iPad. I listened to two tunes and then a full half hour of a britcom on YouTube. Then the battery was done. I recharged it and had a similar experience. I just returned it for a refund. Be advised that you may or may not get one that works.The company contacted me and said they would like to send me a replacement. I received the replacement and charged it. It took about 3.5 to 4 hours to charge. I then paired it with my iPad. I listened to some of my music about two CDs worth. I then watched about three of my favorite Britcoms on you tube. The audio quality was outstanding. I listened to music or watched you tube tv shows and some music tutorials for the next week and a half. I even had them on for 7.5 hours one day. I planned to wait until they needed charging before i wrote the review. They are still going strong. The fit is good and very comfortable. Now about the sound. I already said that it was outstanding.  I compared them to my Sennheiser cable head set. I honestly could not tell the difference. I then compared them to Bose wireless there was a very slight difference but not much. Overall they are extremely good. If you have trouble with them contact the company and see what they can do. I love them and could not be happierRon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Replacement works great

    ","This is my second pair of over the ear Bluetooth headsets. I was looking for a comfortable fit with decent sound. Soft padding for ears and padding for top of the head comfort. My last over the ear headset would get uncomfortable after about 30 min.These met every aspect I was looking for. The sound quality for over the ear Bluetooth headphones really are above average for this price range in my opinion. Battery longetivity is superb for the amount of sound streaming for both speakers. Bluetooth  paring has been one of the best of any Bluetooth, device I've ever had the pleasure of oning. It can be paired with multible devices simultaneously. I have it paired with my 2011 iMac  🖥 , also my iPad Air 2, and iPhone 7 plus, with no connectivity issues. Can be hard wired to any device with cable provided, if battery power is lost. Control sound, pause or track both play, and reverse from the right side of the headset. I have'nt had the opportunity to use the microphone for phone conversations. I purchased them for music, nice feature in the future if I use it I will update my review. I don't dote on sound, as long as it's streaming clear sounding music I'm content 😌.

    ","These headphones are actually a little bit better than I thought when I decided to buy a pair. I wanted better quality in terms of hearing audio, but I'm not exactly someone who listens to music with devices all the time. This seemed to be the best choice, and I do think it's worth it. In terms of audio, it does sound crisp and clear...but at the same time can rock-out if you want to hear it full volume. The only real problem is one of the good features that it has, if you like to wear headphones for a long period of time it will feel slightly uncomfortable over the ears. But that gives superior sound, almost to the point where you could tune-out others around you.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Superior Quality

    ","I have Mpow 059 and Mpow H2 Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones, Mpow IPX7 Bluetooth Earbuds, Sennheiser wireless headphones, and Bose noise-canceling wired headphones.The Sennheiser, Bose, and Mpow earbuds are comfortable to wear for hours. The Mpow 059 headphones clamp my head and give me headaches. I hate wearing them. The Mpow H2 aren't any better.I took the rubber tips off the earbuds and they don't occlude my hearing, i.e., I can hear normally. The Mpow headphones block my hearing, but, unlike my Bose noise-cancelling headphones, the Mpow headphones don't actively reduce background noise. If I need to reduce background noise (e.g., on airplanes) then I'll wear my Bose headphones, not the Mpow headphones. Clamping headphones tightly onto your ears isn't a good way to reduce background noise.Lastly, I couldn't get the Mpow headphone controls to work properly. The problem may be that I can't see the headphones controls with the headphones on, but I can't hear the messages when I take the headphones off, so I hold the button down too long or not long enough, and it goes into pairing mode when I want to power off the headphones, etc. In contrast, with the Mpow earbuds I can remove the right earbud (with the controls) while leaving the left earbud in my ear. I can look at the controls on the right earbud and hold the correct button down until I hear the message in the left earbud, ""Power off"", etc. After a few hours I'm starting to manipulate the controls without removing the earbud from my ear. The Sennheiser headphones have separate switches and knobs for power, volume, and frequency, all of which are easy to use.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Uncomfortable, headaches, poor UI"

    ","This headphone is plastic construction.  It does fit an adult female with small ears rather snuggly and securely. It is NOT adjustable.  Due to plastic construction, this headset should be handled carefully as trying to over extend will most likely cause cracking or worse.  The interior padding on top of head makes it quite comfortable but by no means do I think it will prevent it from breakage if forced.  The ear pads are comfortable.  The bluetooth easily linked to my iPhone 6P.  It took a bit to connect to an iPod nano, but once connected it now easily pairs.  At local gym, it does connect to the bluetooth equipment but it can take some doing each time to pair.  The range is decent, 30-40 feet, but once out of range, it disconnects and must be paired again.  In terms of sound, using it for standard tv on gym equipment the sound is FAIR;  using it with my Apple device music the sound is GOOD.  It can feel and sound like being in a vacuum which probably is due to the headset being tight on the head/ears.  The max volume is not very loud, when pairing to phone, iPod and television each device itself must be set on the loudest setting.  On gym equipment, the volume is very low even with equipment at max volume and headset at max volume.  The volume control doesn't really seem to work.  I also own a Bose headset and the sound quality of Bose is amazing. MPOW is not amazing, not even close.  Again, this was purchased under $30 for the sole intention of being a headset to use at the gym.  It doesn't flop on head, is secure and serves the purpose it was intended for.  I would not recommend this for anyone that wants a headset to listen to music or surround sound television.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Used At the Gym

The sound is crystal clear and they're great at minimizing sound intrusion.  My neighbors were doing some serious construction the other day and I couldn't hear them with these headphones on.  These don't provide a massive bass experience but what you'll hear is the best I've experienced for headphones under $100FIT:  For starters, I'm 6'2"" and always have a hard time finding head-related gear (think sunglasses, hats) that fits properly.  I don't know why head stuff is so challenging for me.  Maybe I'm an alien, but these are too tight on my head.  The padding, both on the ears and on the top of the head, is great but I can still only stand wearing them for 15-20 minutes at a time before my ears can't take the pressure anymore.BONUS: I didn't realize from the picture but these fold down to a compact size really nicely.

    ","I have been shopping around for some good over the ear wireless headphones for a while, and decided on these. I looked at Bose Soundlink II, Beats Studio Wireless, SkullCandy Crusher Wireless, Sony Xtra Bass wireless, and more. I finally decided to get these, after realizing that $200+ was just too much for headphones. I have yet to be disappointed.These headphones are, most noticeably, built surprisingly well. They are a glossy black with red trim, and the red is a soft rubbery feeling. The sliding mechanism is stainless steel, and the folding has a tactile 'click' into place when opened.The audio is good. It's not mind blowing, nor is the bass, but it's fairly well rounded and a solid performance, especially for anything in this price range. For the price, they're amazing.I've used the mic for only one phone call, the other caller was unaware but did not complain and I never had to repeat myself, so I guess it works well enough though that's not why I bought them.The headphones pair easily enough with two devices, and can play from either one at a time. Powering off if slightly awkward, as it tries to go into pairing before finally shutting off (holding the power/call/pause/play button).These headphones come with an aux cable to connect them to a standard headphone jack, which was an absolute requirement for me, as I don't want to be reliant on a battery all of the time. They seem to sound slightly better when connected with the backup audio cable, but that might just be my prejudice. The wireless function, if already turned on, will silently deactivate/power off when the aux cable is connected saving the battery. However, because of that, you lose audio/talk controls when using the aux cable. Not a big deal, most wired headphones don't control the music.Battery life is rated at 12 hours, but I cannot accurately judge that as I usually use them wired. Projected battery life based on what I've used would seem that a 12 hour rating is probably pretty accurate, I havent drained them down past 80% according to my iphone's battery display (yes when paired with iphone it will give the headset's battery level)Overall, I am ecstatic with these headphones. They even come with a nice velvety drawstring bag to pack them in when not in use. Good sound, good comfort, good battery life, good features, great price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I have been shopping around for some good over the ear wireless headphones for a while

    ","I have always had earbuds and avoided earmuff style headphones like these because of their size, however I am planning on doing quite a bit of traveling in the next few months and wanted something to block out the drone of airplane engines.  I have always been told the sound quality in this type of headphones is exceptional compared to earbuds, and these headphones are highly rated so I thought I would give them a try. I was quite disapointed by the sound quality, I'm  not sure if it's this style of headphones not living up to the hype, or just these particular headphones but I have $5 earbuds that sound better. I originally gave two stars becuase I was actually pleasantly surprised by how well these headphones fit and how well they did blocking other noises in the room.I took one star back off for durability, after some limited use these headphones do not seem like they will hold up very well, maybe if you used them at your desk or something but to be portable I have some serious doubts about how well they will hold up... mine already have significantly more flex in them than they did a week ago and I'm afraid that means they're going to break any time now...",1.0 out of 5 stars,Good fit but sound quality and durability are lacking...

    ","I read a ton of reviews before buying this product and I was super excited to love them and use them daily. However, I ran into a bit of a snag...First, all of the things I love about the Mpow 059: - They sync with my devices very quickly. (quicker than my $300 headphones) - I love that they talk to me and tell me what commands I have given. (e.g. Push the power button and it will tell you ""powering on"" or if your headphones are already on it says ""pairing"" ""phone one paired"") - I love that I can feel the volume  and track forward and back buttons easily - I love the ear padding, it feels good on your ears as opposed to the cheap snap-crackle-pop you get with some of the other ear covers out there.Now for where things went wrong for me. - The reviews I read mentioned a long charging cord one even showed a 4 ft cord in the review video. My charging chord was a little over a foot and a half. Not a huge deal but certainly not helpful when I want to charge my headphones while wearing them in bed. - The biggest challenge with these headphones was size. I had the headphones set at the smallest setting and there was no tension to keep them on my ears so the band across the top of the earphones put a painful amount of pressure on the top of my head. I wore them for a couple of days, adjusting the band on top of my head forward or back to try and alleviate the pain but no luck.I love so much about these headphones, I wish they worked for me but I just can't take head pain.I hesitate sending them back, I'm not sure I want to deal with the hassle so I may just donate them to some lucky person (with a larger head).Just be warned, if you have a smaller head you may want to keep looking.

    ","These are the most badass pair of headphones. A friend of mine recommended the ear bud type headphones of this brand, but ear buds tend to fall out of my tiny ears. These had solid reviews and thankfully came in a color other than red/black, so I snatched them up! Awesome purchase. Sound quality is awesome. They fit over my ear, so they effectively cancel out noise unless someone were to come right up to me and speak. I don't think I could hear them if I had music playing. They also came with an AUX cord and charging cable but no wall plug. FYI And they came with a pretty sweet gray suede(?) carrying case! No complaints whatsoever.

    ","Nice headphones with good sound, but had to adjust them slightly to fit comfortably.When I first got them, they clamped too tightly on my head (which would be great for exercising, but I wear them for hours at a desk). To stretch them out, I put them around a box for a couple nights (the Amazon box they came in) and now they fit comfortably. I also noticed they are more comfortable for my head if I wear them backward (controls on the left side) so the ear pads don't rest on my jaw. They are heavier than headphones without Bluetooth, so my head will tire faster (but that comes with the territory).For reference: my head is about average for an adult female.My only other complaint is the buttons are a little loud when I click them while wearing the headphones, but not unbearable.All around happy with this purchase after breaking them in a bit.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, but need some breaking in."

I just received those today, and have been using them on and off for hours. No complaints whatsoever!!! I LOVE them! They sound just as great as the 059's and I feel zero discomfort! They're very soft against the ears and sound amazing.

    ","FINAL REVIEW 3/24/18:It took a month and a half and exactly 50 emails to get a simple warranty case resolved with Patozon's customer service team. They ended up refunding me the cost of the headphones, Mpow case, and return shipping, after the replacement set was lost in the mail and never reached me. The end result works just fine for me, but the complete headache and length of time it took for something that should have required 6-10 emails MAX.. and the fact that the manufacturing of the headphones is totally shoddy.. means there is no way I can recommend these headphones. My one star rating stands.UPDATE 3/10/18:While the customer service agents I have been in contact with started out perfectly nice, but have slowly progressed to unprofessional emails repeating the same questions (my address? my tracking number?) over and over again. This has been a painful, slow process which has involved 20 (+, still counting) back and forth emails for what should be an otherwise simple exchange. Still haven't received a replacement or a refund.. might as well have thrown the headset in the trash rather than try to use the warranty.ORIGINAL REVIEW 2/9/18I like the headphones, the sound is better than I expected, battery life is decent enough, and pairing is easy. I can't give them a high rating however, because after 3 months of infrequent use (maybe 7 hours of playtime), two of the buttons have stopped working. It should be noted that I kept them in the Mpow protective shell case whenever not in use. I contacted Mpow today about their warranty, so will provide an update once I hear back from them.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor manufacturing.. nearly impossible to communicate with customer service.

    ","For the money -- and even for MORE money -- these over the ear headphones are spectacular.I am picky. But these are spectacular.  Why?1.  They look more expensive than they are.  They are sturdy, stylish.2.  They are very comfortable.  I have a big head. These fit just fine, and are VERY comfortable. These are perhaps the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned, and I have owned dozens of them over the years.  They do not grip your head too tight, nor are they too loose.  The padding on the earpeices is soft and plush, but not overdone or mushy.  These are great to wear.3.  They sound really good.  Many Bluetooth headsets and earphone and heaphones at this price point have a whine or hum or static when no music is playing.  These do not -- they are absolutely silent.  The bass is deep and good.  They are pretty clear-sounding, not muddy.  Very very good sound.  You can pick out all of the crummy audio on YouTube, as compared to the cleaner audio from a service like Spotify or iTunes oor Amazon Music, which means that these can reproduce sound well enough for you to tell the difference.  I'd say that the headphones have a pretty neutral sound, with plenty of bass which does not overwhelm and is not too boomy, considering the price range.  You are never going to get 'best ever"" tight and accurate bass from bluetooth headphones in this price range, but the bass does not offend.  And as I said, I am rather picky, but I can apply a sliding scale based on price.  There are plenty of over-bassed, boomy headphones, and plenty of people who think that sounds good. Ugh.  With regular music, let's face it, you have Bluetooth compression, so it isn't ever going to be audiophile quality over Bluetooth.  But at home or going for a walk, I love these things.  They are so nice, I do not want to work out in them and ruin them or sweat them up. But I'll bet theyy'd be good for working out if you do not mind grody headphones. Lol.  They DO NOT feature active noise cancelling, but the ear cups block out most ambient noise.  Unless you are paying giant dollars, active noise cancellation merely kills battery life, adds noise and lower resolution sound.  Not necessary.  A doodad most do not need, and I do not miss it on these headphones.4.  Mechanics:  They connected via Bluetooth very easily.  When you power them on, they connect relatively quickly. Walking all around  my entire 1200 sqft condo, I never lost the signal, even though the phone was on one side of the condo and I was on the other. They charge via the ubiquitous  micro-USB found on Android phones, though there is a warning not to charge these on anything more than a 5w adapter. The controls are sparse and subtle -- they are not visually obvious so as to ruin the aesthetics of the headphones -- but the controls are easy to find and use.  One power/pairing/play/pause button in the middle; up and down volume and forward and back buttons.  They work great. The charging port is subtly located, adding to the style and class of these very well-though-out headphones.5.  Durability/longevity:  Hey I just bought them.  They seem to be of high quality but time will tell. I have 2 other MPOW products and have owned them for more than a year and they both still work fine, so MPOW seems to have their QC under control.You see things like this at this price point and you think ""Are they worth it?"" and ""will it sound like garbage"".

    ","So, I've had these for almost two months now, and figured I had to let others know what the real deal is.Pros:- Style. These look amazing! Seriously, I get compliments almost every day when I wear them out. People keep asking me if they're Beats. Clearly, they've never seen Beats before lol- Comfort. These are surprisingly comfortable. I have larger ears, and these fit very comfortably around them. Sure there's slight discomfort at times and some sweating, but that's to be expected with over ear. I can confidently say that I can wear these for 4 hours and not really need to take them off once.-Multi-device support. So convenient to connect my phone and my laptop to these at the same time so I don't have to keep switching back and forth.- Navigation. It's incredibly easy to use, and connecting is a breeze. Once you're connected, you never have to worry about it and can cycle through everything without touching what these are connected to. The clickable buttons are perfect for not guessing what button you're using.Cons:- Range. These are absolutely horrible sometimes with regards to range. I'll have my phone in my pocket, and sometimes the sound will go out while I'm walking. I had a pair of Bluedio Turbine's before this, and they enabled me to leave my phone in my bedroom and go to my kitchen without any problem (yes even with walls in the way), these however, can barely get through a song when I walk more than 7 feet away. Disgraceful.- Sound Quality. Let me start off by saying these aren't bad on sound persay. However, my personal tastes just weren't met. If you're a hip hop or r&b lover, these aren't the headphones for you. The bass on my Bluedio's wasn't the greatest but it did the trick, these however, sound like the bass is happening two rooms away from you. Very disappointing. I never tested quality with the aux cable, because let's be real, these are Bluetooth headphones, if I wanted wired headphones, I would've bought some.- Phone Calls. While everyone could hear me fine, there was always a strange clicking noise in the background according to those on the other side. Apparently it got really annoying at times. I never had trouble hearing other people. Otherwise, answering and hanging up we're a breeze.- Battery Life. I charged my Bluedio's maybe once every week. Granted, I'm a heavier than average user, but these headphones barely lasted two days. Really frustrating when I have to keep them plugged in all the time.Overall, you're getting what you pay for. However, compared to others of the same price, this sacrifices a lot just for minor improvements in aesthetics and comfort. If only these had more bass in them and a longer battery life, I think I'd be happier. For now, to the junk drawer you go.Update 03/2018:I have received extremely courteous and helpful customer service from this product's manufacturer, Patozon. They promptly contacted me after my review was posted, listened to my concerns, and provided me with a replacement product (Mpow H1). While the Mpow H1 was definitely better than the Mpow 059, it still had some similar issues while lacking the sleekness in design. All-in-all, I am extremely impressed with the customer service I received from Patozon, and will definitely consider them for my future purchases. However, as my original review was tied to the product and not the company, my stars remain the same.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Looks amazing, sounds meh."

    ","I've probably owned 25 different kinds of headphones over the years -- from cheap, cheap to multiple hundred dollars in cost. Expensive ones have broken; cheap ones have held up for a while.  But I still ended up needing a pair of inexpensive, bluetooth headphones to use when watching TV or listening to music while going to sleep.  These were cheap (about $35) but had good reviews so I decided to try them.What a surprise.  Decent sound quality (I'm older and my hearing isn't what it used to be, but they have reasonably solid bass and the frequency response seems smooth to me).  The sound quality isn't what you'll get from really high grade headphones but the build quality is good and it is, after all, being used with an iPhone playing mp3s.  And it is quite an upgrade from using earbuds.I'm pretty sure I could not have gotten a better value for the money.  They are solid and although I've only had for a couple months, I think they're going to hold up well over time.  Pairing is easy and they don't seem to require recharging too frequently.Anyone who has $40 or $50 expectations should be very pleasantly surprised with both the sound and the build quality on these.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Headphones for Low Cost Bluetooth Solution.

    ","I just returned some very overpriced, very defective Sony cans, and I'm happy to say that these far less expensive Mpow headphones have them beat in just about every way so far.They're still new, but they're comfy, they fold up for easy storage while still being adjustable in size, come with a nice bag to sleeve them in, and - most importantly - they sound great.....if you're connecting via the included 3.5mm headphone jack.The one place they fall short is in the same area a lot of Bluetooth headphones do.  Music sounds like garbage when dealing with Bluetooth audio compression, and unfortunately, they don't appear to have any tricks on hand to offset this issue.  The net result is that music sounds thin and hollow when playing over wireless.  The difference is huge between Bluetooth vs. 3.5mm connections.All in all, very happy with the purchase.

    ","This is my first experience with bluetooth wireless headphones and I am impress.  I have nightmares about getting my old bluetooth cell phone to pair with the audio in my 07 Camry, but these paired up to my iPhone 7+ immediately.  I also purchased the DayKit Mini USB Bluetooth CSR 4.0 Dual Mode (a steal at under 7 bucks) and the Mpow headphones paired up with my PC instantly.  The sound quality is decent although it won't blow you away with extremes of volume or bass.  For average listening though, they are more than adequate and they are wicked comfortable to wear.  Take them off every hour or so, so your ears can breathe though. .  The ONLY issue I've had, and it's not the fault of the Mpow people is that when I run iTunes on my  Win10 PC it gets way confused and I have to turn Bluetooth off, exit iTunes, then turn Bluetooth back on and restart iTunes.  Since I have other networked devices in the house, iTunes sees them on the network, but it doesn't show them as an option.  I have to select the ""My  Computer"" to get it to work.

I've tried making sure both headphones and transmitters were fully charged but it's a no-go. The headphones like one-night stands with my transmitters. It will work once or twice then never again. I can't tell you how many times I've tried pairing these with the two transmitters I have and it just doesn't work. Then eventually, I can't even get the headphones to pair at all! It goes from Power On to Power Off.Completely useless if I can't use the wireless option of these headphones. I'm very disappointed.Update: The company sent me a replacement and it's been working great! I'm able to pair it with no issues. The first pair has again began pairing with my computer's blue tooth but still won't pair with my bluetooth transmitters but that's okay since the new pair works fine.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped Pairing With Transmitters - Had them Less than A Month!

    ","Not going to lie... i only bought these to hold me off till Corsair makes a better version of the VOID with TRUE surround sound but it turns out these headphones are freaking amazing!! The price, style, colors and comfort are all a grand slam. The battery on this thing is fantastic and it baby sips on the juice. If i had to be critical of these and i don't want to be but i'd have to say the fact the headphones don't twist forwards like all the rest of the traditional headphones. These do fold into a more smaller and portable size which is great but i don't know... I'm really stretching here guys.Very happy with my purchase, Thank you Mpow. I'll gladly buy another pair from you guys.UPDATE: I realized there is no pictures in the reviews for the blue headphones.

The 55 series will not sync directly to the headphones (the 64 series will) so I purchased a Bluetooth adaptor which synced with the headphones easily.

Find your bluetooth driver on your computer, go to power management, and disable to setting ""Allow windows to turn off the device to save power"".

    ","THE BAD:  If you have a large head (7 3/4+ hat size), this item is NOT FOR YOU.  The muffs are comfy but the headband will most likely be too tight atop your head. The ample padding on the band (which is firm and not soft) the makes contact with the top of your head adds to the band being too tight.  Also...the controls (functions) for the headset are difficult to see. No matter which color headset ordered, the symbols/controls/markings blend in with the background of the headset. These should either be dimpled to distinguished by touch and/or be a contrasting color (i.e. red on black, green on black, white on black) instead of a very dull gray on black. Now, most of the time you'll use the controls when wearing the headset. But there will be times you'll use these functions when NOT wearing the headset (i.e. pairing, charging, volume control, putting sound on hold, etc).  Lastly, because you can't distinguish volume controls or channel selection by touch, you could accidentally change the station while meaning to minimize volume.THE GOOD (and this applies to 90%+ of the population): If the control issues I mentioned don't bother you, you'll like these headphones. They are comfy and has good sound (but NO NOISE CANCELLATION no matter how high you have the volume set to your favorite song or video).BOTTOM LINE: These headphones are going back to Amazon for the reasons I stated. But I think I'm in the minority. Most will like these headphones.  I will say that these are NOT GOOD to use when doing cardio. Perspiration accumulates quickly on your ears due to the muffs and also where the headband makes contact on your head; making it both frequent and sometimes difficult to wipe away sweat during a workout (earbuds are better).",3.0 out of 5 stars,Comfy with caveats....

    ","I really, really wanted to like this product, but sadly I cannot. Bought it as a present for my mom and was super excited. They're really pretty and she really likes pink. So perfect gift right? Wrong!When I opened the box, it looked good. It came with all the parts... and then I went to charge it. I actually bought another pair before this, but in blue as they didn't have the pink headphones at the time. And like the other ones... that I returned because it wouldn't charge, this wouldn't either! I first thought that, oh yes! It's charging, the lights came on, and then when I went to check on it a few minutes later, the lights were off and I thought, oh wow, that certainly charged quickly. Tried to turn it on, turned on for a second, and it powered on, then it immediately powered off. Thinking that it was possibly user error, I tried again. Same thing. So naturally I went to charge it again, this time using a different usb port, and then when that didn't work, used a wall charger.  The lights went on, and few minutes later, the lights went out again. IT WASN'T CHARGING!So I contacted the company, they were courteous, and they told me to try again, using different charging methods, which I already did... and then they told me to return it. They also said that they were willing to pay up to $6 in shipping and handling. Quite generous of them I thought, but then I found out that it was going to cost me significantly more to ship it back. I ended up returning it to Amazon, as that's free, and I really don't want to do anything with them anymore.Very disappointed, really wanted to like it, but.... well.And that's the end of my rant.Edit: 04/08/2018Due to excellent customer service, I received a new pair of headphones.

    ","In this day and time, it is refreshing to encounter a product that is not all cast plastic.  The construction of this headset is truly a work of art.. not obvious in the listing photos is the stainless steel inner headband, and the whole thing is put together with metal clasps and lovely machined screws (at least 12 visible).So, it is really a sensual joy to pick this up and place it on your head.  The construction almost feels like a finely jeweled watch.. so surprising for a $30 product.The ear cups seem to be very solidly attached to the band (yet in a way that they articulate to conform to your head), and the ear pads just look like they are going to hold up for a decent time period (granted, I've only had this baby for about 2 weeks)I've had bluetooth headsets in the past, and finally got away from them because it seems like you are always battling with getting the damned thing to pair up.  Not so with this unit.. When I first connected to my tablet, of course I had to go into my tablet bluetooth settings, but just one time.Ever since, even when the headset auto-powers-down from extended idle time, I just put them on, open my tablet, press the multifunction pairing/volume button on the headset, and, voila, beautiful sound.I use this headset almost exclusively with a single tablet.. I'm guessing pairing to multiple devices might add an additional degree of complexity to the process, but that's never an issue for me.My hearing isn't what it used to be, so I am used to cranking up the volume, but, man.. these babies are LOUD.. even my feeble ears can only tolerate about half volume.As far as sound quality, I won't say these produce true high fidelity sound, but that's not what I bought them for.. mostly watching movies and YouTube, where the sound quality and bass response is without criticism.A bonus is the plug-in cable that comes as an accessory, so I suppose if you had a non-bluetooth device just can just plug it right in and enjoy your sound.truly an astounding product for the price.

    ","These headphones are comfortable enough to wear for an hour or two, but not much longer - and though the sound quality leaves *much* to be desired, you get what you pay for where audio gear is concerned. Bluetooth connectivity works with no trouble, and the option of pairing with multiple devices is appreciated. The microphone is sufficient for voice chatting (1ch 16bit 8000hz, aka Telephone Quality)My main complaint with these headphones is the sound quality change that happens while you're using the mic. While using them as merely headphones, you can get readonably clear (2ch 16bit 44100hz, aka CD Quality) audio playback - the speakers themselves sound awfully tinny and weak, but at least the playback quality is acceptable. However, as soon as you activate the microphone, the quality drops significantly (to 1ch 16bit 8000hz, aka Telephone Quality, to match the microphone.) Imagine that instead of listening to your favorite track on a normal pair of headphones, you're listening to it through your phone speaker, transmitted from your friend who's holding their phone up to their laptop speakers - it's awful.Honestly, you're better off spending more money on better gear, if you have the option - but if you don't, just know that you can either use this set as mediocre headphones, or an adequate headset for voice chat - never both at the same time. If you like to listen to music while your game and wan to still leave your mic active, you should look for a different product.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"mediocre headphones OR an adequate headset, can't be both."

    ","Upside is they're fairly comfortable, build quality seems good, and bluetooth paired just fine. You can use them over bluetooth (or 3.5mm) while plugged in to charge, although there's an audible electrical hum from the charger. No need to turn them on/use battery if you plug in 3.5mm.The downside is that sound quality is incredibly poor. (I.e. iPhone earbuds and Panasonic ergofits provide much clearer sound, at the same price or less.) The mids are present, but treble and bass are seriously lacking. Sound is very muffled. I'm honestly not sure if the set I received was defective, or if these are just cheaply made. I'm returning them.Update: Mpow sent me an H2 set to try. These were better, but not great.

I'm an avid listener of music and with these it just seemed off and not pleasing in overall sound quality like i said before the cheaper not so good looking Mpows are a much better buy. and for the price i expected better sound quality than the cheaper Mpows I'm giving it two stars because of the build quality and the shear comfort they provide.

    ","Good crisp sound, not noise cancelling, but they do a good job of blocking exterior noise. I ride public transportation in Chicago daily, so they are definitely tested. The range is good, never gives out no matter where my phone is, even when it's in my backpack. Not a ton of bass, but not bad either. Comfortable and good battery life, I use them daily and only plug them in to charge every other day and they have never died on me.::update::The headphones have experienced their first true durability test. I went to put my hood on as I got off the bus and inadvertently knocked them off my head on to the hard cold concrete. I am six feet tall so it was a good drop, enough to scuff up the right earpiece and dislodge the plastic circle around the pairing button.

    ","I had a month of traveling and I tried to use ear buds on the plane on my first trip.  Ear buds were almost completely useless and I started looking for a set of noise cancelling earphones as soon as I got home.  I'm happy to say that these made my second trip much better.  These aren't miracle earphones, I was still aware that I was on an airplane, but I was able to listen to gentile meditation and relaxation music on the plane and I only heard a slight buzzing in the background from the plane engines.  When I took the headphones off the talk to the attendant, I was amazed how loud the plane cabin was outside these headphones.  They cut out a good 90% of the noise.They are comfortable enough for me, and the folding feature was handy.  They easily fit into my purse while going through airport security.  You'll need to read the instructions to get the hang of the controls.  Pretty much, you just hold down the power button until it turns on and pairs, and hold it again to turn off.  I can't speak to the phone features, I'm only interested in using these as traditional headphones.If you have an upcoming flight and are considering headphones, I can highly recommend these.

I wear them at work in my office job to drown out the distractions, as well as my side job--my lawn care business. They work very well to block out the loud engine noise and create a wonderful listening experience. I often listen to audiobook which are very easy to hear in a loud environment. These headphones have a rich and deep sound for music. As good as Beats, to me. A very long battery cycle is nice. I charge mine maybe once a week if even that. And that's listening for a couple hours at work, then 2-4 in the evenings. They adjust well and fit nicely. They don't feel cheap. To be honest the Thor model feels cheap and doesn't compare. On these, the controls are very nice and easy to use. The range is astonishing. I walk to the printer and forget to take my phone. No loss at all with many people and computers/smartphones/devices between. Mowing, I've left my phone on the mower and walked all the way around the house without loss or even a skip.Sorry for the length, but I want to make sure I cover it all. I have not a single complaint in several months of hard use. Buy them. Buy these over the Thor. Sorry MPOW to bash the Thor but these are far superior. Ordering a few more pairs soon.

It would be nice to have the buttons contoured in some manner to allow you to control without having to look.As a 20 year member of Amazon I rely on independent reviews when shopping and I will always try to be as honest and impartial as I can and will try to provide helpful insight into the product.

    ","These are the first Bluetooth over the ear headphones I have purchased so I don't have a basis for comparison with other brands or models. The price was good and the fit was fine for me. Wearing comfort was OK but I haven't worn them for an extended period of time due to my issue with the audio quality (below).Pairing was simple with  my smartphone. Operation with the buttons took a little getting used to but worked fine. I haven't used them enough to comment on battery life.My major complaint with these headphones is the quality of the sound. The audio was just dull sounding to me. Mids and highs were poor and almost sounded muffled. Bass was only OK. I played the same music with a set of recently purchased MPow Bluetooth earbuds and there was no comparison. The earbuds audio was bright and realistic even though they cost about 1/2 the price of the over the ear headphones.Edit 10/10/2017: My original review should have included the comment that for me the major complaint about the audio quality of these headphones is that vocals are coming through sounding muffled or dull and also seem to be at a lower level than the instrumentals on any track I listen to. Instrumental only tracks sound OK.I unfortunately have just missed my 45 day money back return option so I'm stuck with them.

    ","Believe I finally found a great set of headphones, at a very good price. They look super nice, quality seem sturdy (well made), and the fit is extreamly comfortable (I have yet to try them out at the gym, and wear them for a longer period of time), not to loose or tight. The sound is perfect for my use, meaning great quality for the gym (for super music enthusiast, I would go with more expensive brand). It would be nice if the volume could go a little higher, you will not get anything loud here, but the sound is good. Paring with both my Samsung S4 phone, and IPad 2 was very easy, as was charging. Walked 10meters away from my phone, and the music was still perfect. The sound is the same quality, wheather Bluetooth or direct cable connect. Next I need to pair it with my LG TV, hopefully that will go as smooth as everything else.All in all, I will recommend these headphones, they fold up easily, very comfortable and good sound, all for about $35.00.UPDATE: I have used the headphones at the gym, and they are truly comfortable, have had them on for 2 hours without a problem, almost forgot I had them on.

    ","Mpow is quickly becoming my go-to heat set for everything sound related. My first headset from them was just tiny wireless Bluetooth earbuds and I love them. I bought them about 2 years ago and they are still going strong and the battery still lasts forever which is incredible. Since I needed a new headset for my computer instead of my phone yet again I decided instead of the usual which is usually Turtle Beach and lasts about a year I would check out Mpow's offering.This is the headset I decided to get and I'm not disappointed with my first impressions. Comfortable, acceptable sound quality and they feel sturdy. They can be wired or wireless which is a huge plus for me since 50% of the time the wire breaking down on Turtle Beach is the problem and then the other is Turtle Beach just falls apart because it's cheap plastic. This has METAL in obvious strategic locations so I have a good feeling these are going to last awhile hopefully and if they break, metal is much easier to fix than cheap plastic. Overall perfect fit and I have a relatively big head so size matters here. I think they hit the perfect dimensions to accommodate our different sized cue balls so if Mpow keeps up the great work I doubt I'll buy anything other than Mpow for as long as they keep pushing out great headphones.Cons - a very slightly heavy but you don't notice it after you put them on and think awwwwww yyeeeeaaaahhh thems some comfortable ear cups. Honestly, it's not a big deal and just now I took them off and gave them a few bounces in my hand and they didn't seem heavy but my initial impression was they were a bit weighty so I'm sticking in on here anyway.

The pairing process was very easy with my iPhone X, and my Macbook Pro 15"" (Late 2016). The caveat here, is how MPow allows two connected devices at the same time. There have been times I've turned these on 50 feet away from my computer, expecting them to pair to my phone, only to have forgotten they were last connected to my computer. Wouldn't you know, these headphones connected to the computer. They stuttered a bit (50 feet was also through concrete walls...), but the connectivity distance is surprising on these. Make sure you only keep one thing paired to them at a time though.Durability:I list durability because I work in the construction industry, so everything is subject to destruction.

    ","Lets cut to the chase.Q. How do they sound?A. Excellent! In truth, they have very little character of their own, which is a good thing, a VERY good thing. The bass is not as extended as some much more expensive phones, but what's there is clean and not boomy as some have reported. What really impresses me is their ability to portray depth, which isn't easy for a sealed design. There is no upper midrange ""clarity bump,"" zippy highs or serious resonances. They compare very well with my much more expensive wireless Sennheisers in fact.I bought these for hearing protection while mowing the lawn, but their comfort, great sound and ease of use makes me think I'll be using them for indoor use, commuting and dogwalking as well.  In short, these cans are a superb deal. I have already recommended them to a few friends and will be buying more as Christmas presents.

They even sent me another component to try to pair with. All in all, though the headphones are good my overall experience was dissatisfying and these are now just lying around because the return window closed long back. Reducing another star due to the whole bad experience.--------------------------------I ordered these last week alongwith a Bluetooth dongle for my desktop. Getting the mic to work on applications like Discord, Skype etc has been a pain. Ultimately figured out I had to have the headphones paired (and turned ON) before the desktop booted. For some reason, the mic doesn't work and picks up garbled junk if I pair it later on.

    ","First, the good things about this headset.  It is very comfortable, I can wear it all day.  This is excellent for a noisy cube environment.  When it's setup properly the stereo headphones sound great.  The headset seems to work fine when you get it working.  The batteries do last all day, I've not had them run out on me yet and I leave the headset on all day while at work and plug it in to charge it up overnight when I leave for the day.  It's also great to be wireless!Now the negatives that are causing me to give this a 2 star review.  I have this connected to my windows 10 computer via bluetooth.  For some reason when you pair the headset to your computer it shows up as 2 devices, the stereo headphones and a hands free headset.  When one is activated the other doesn't work so when I want to use these to talk on my Jabber soft phone I have to go and change settings that effectively shut off the headphone features and enable the headset.  For some apps I have to go into the headset properties in Windows 10 and turn on ""listen to this device"" to get it so windows will hear the microphone.  The problem with this is it disables the headphones and I cannot listen to music while that option is enabled unless i listen through the ""hands free headset"" device which sounds horrible for music (mono and just doesn't sound good).  Maybe this is a windows issue, but USB headsets don't have all these configuration complications.I've been able to make it work but it's a pain, and continues to be a pain switching between hands free and headphone mode.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound and Comfortable but a Pain to Use

Pairing was a breeze, all buttons work just fine, and sound is pretty clear.

    ","First, these headphones are great. I bought them for a work trip that had me doing a lot of travel. They're comfortable, they block outside noise well, they fold down nice, the controls are easy to use, they sound good, the battery life is solid. They quickly became a part of my every day. I was using these things all the time and thrilled that they were so nice for such a reasonable price.Then the battery died. I hadn't even had them for 6 months and the battery died. What I should have done here is go through Amazon to deal with this, but I contacted MPow directly. They responded reasonably quickly and asked that I send the headphones back to them. They said they would check them and send back replacements. They even covered my shipping costs. At this point I was entirely satisfied with the process. Things break, parts die, I get it. But this is where it went south...After an extended wait, I received my replacement headphones. They were all scratched up, the hinges were loose, the ear padding was beat up, the play/pause button looked like someone had taken a thumb tack to it, and the line in jack was all beat up. They looked like hell. On top of that, one end of the line in cable was snapped off. I don't know if they worked, I never tried them. When I contacted MPow about it, they just said to send them back and they would issue a refund. That's fine, but what I wanted was a working pair of headphones. I've now spent several weeks dealing with this, and have a bad taste in my mouth about MPow. It's an acceptable outcome, I guess, but I'm really disappointed at how the whole interaction went.SO. These are really nice headphones. They had become essential gear for my everyday workflow. When they died, MPow basically shrugged.

I was contacted by Patozon company and they were concerned about my issues and wanted to make it a better experience for me. They sent over the new headphone replacement without extra cost. They arrived quickly then anticipated. Right out the box the replacements looked a lot better then the first pair. The build quality was nice and the hinges seemed to be better then the first pair.

But with my iPhone, I'm able to change the settings for the music and get something more desirable. Another great feature I like, is the battery status. on the iPhone, it displays how much charge is left on the headset. Not every headphones offer that feature. Overall this was a better headset then I thought. I also have to commend Patozon for their great customer service. They were patient and helpful and solved my issues swiftly.Thank you,Old review:They are a mediocre pair of headphones. They do the simple job of playing music.  The build quality is rather decent.

In other words if you listen to one device with another one occasionally activating.. well sound quality will noticeably drop when both devices playing sounds.- If you don't listen to constant stream of sounds for a while they have activation delay maybe half a second or so.

It is muffled, the sound is quieter, and overal just does not sound good. The mic is also not good according to my fiance. He only tends to complain about the quality of the call when i use these, compared to my old apple earbuds. I wouldnt know since i cant hear myself but since he complains even when i dont tell him im using them i assume it is infact the headphones. The headphones also tend to tell me they are at “max volume” but then i look at my device and i can CLEARLY see there is much more volume to go. Very disappointing.

The look and build quality are nice.  It's all plastic except for a few key parts, but they have a sturdy feel and I find them fairly stylish.  Controls are intuitive, with a typical 4-way circular rocker with a center button--up and down for volume and right and left for track is easy to remember.I almost took off one star for sound quality, but decided I was being too harsh.  Compared to a $300 pair of headphones, they are a bit lacking, with a sound that is not as crisp and punchy as I would like.  But compared to most under $50 headphones, they are outstanding.  The bass is sufficient and never overbearing and the mids and highs are pretty well balanced and open sounding, just not as 100% fresh as I would wish for.  That said, I think they sound better than a $120 pair of Sony Bluetooth phones I tried recently and returned.Overall, these are a great value and a very satisfactory product.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Almost perfect, and fabulous for the price"

If you’re getting these for the Bluetooth functionality specifically, look elsewhere as the Bluetooth function leaves much to be desired.

Trying to use them connected to my iPhone and iPad were much easier, but the connection dropped frequently. I finally gave up after several hours of troubleshooting and researching and resolved to the 1/8 by 1/8 aux cord option.If they last a couple months in this state; I’d say they were worth $40 (usb dongle not included...) also the driver the dongle came with was on a mini blue ray disk, and the instructions if you didn’t have access to a capable drive?

    ","I'm starting to suspect that virtually all Bluetooth headphone / earbud products in existence have flat frequency response, too much bass, and muddy highs. These cans certainly aren't doing anything to convince me otherwise. Passive noise isolation is almost nonexistent, like you'd expect from almost any very cheap cans; with the sound off, I can can run my fingernails lightly over the wall behind me and still hear it quite clearly.

    ","I purchased the Mpow 059 headset and originally submitted a 2 star review based mainly on the low volume issues.  However, I am submitting a new review and changing it to a 5 star rating based mostly on their customer service.When they saw my rating they offered to send me a different set of headphones and when I accepted, they sent me the Mpow H2 headphones.  Now, these new headphones have a very slightly higher volume and they are on-ear instead of over-ear, but the sound quality is better - more crisp.Like I said above, this is a little tricky since this 5 star rating is based primarily on their customer service and their desire to resolve the issue and not on the quality of their product.  I guess you get what you pay for and this is one of the pitfalls of buying on-line and not actually testing the products in person.I applaud Mpow for trying to make this right!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Re-Review - New Headphones

    ","I ordered a few headphones to compare sound, controls and connectivity. The good news is these have superior connectivity. They reconnect to your device or transmitter quickly. They have very good range and have no static. The downside are the controls. You can't feel them so you have to figure out how to find the buttons by ""touch memory"" which isn't easy. If they raised the buttons the problem would be solved. Otherwise you're left fiddling with finding the volume or power button. Not fun. The other problem is the sound quality. It's just ok but for this price, I expect better. When you compare them to other headphones that cost just 10 bucks more, the difference is profound.

    ","Very pleased with these headphones.  I didn't want to spend a fortune on wireless headphones, but wanted something comfortable and reasonably priced for using at the gym and also running.  Comfort is excellent.  Very pleased with how good they feel on my head and how they stay put while jogging.  Sound quality is also good.  Not great, a little on the muffled side and I wish there were more highs coming through, but still sounds very good and especially for this price I can't complain.  If you want high end sounding headphones spend $200 or more.  Battery life also seems to be very strong.  I've charged them the first day, and have been using them for over a week for at least an hour at the gym 6 days a week and still going strong.Controls are easy to use while on your head and buttons are laid out nicely that they are easy to find with your fingers while wearing.  Another feature I like is that although they are not noise cancelling headphones, they do an excellent job not allowing outside noise to leak in.  My other headphones I would still hear the background music at the gym bleeding through, not with these.  Time will tell how long they will last, but as far as first impressions, I haven't seen a better set around or even double the price of these.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality and features especially for the price!

    ","Ordered these headphones just a few days ago, and came in a bit earlier than expected.Based on what others have said (mostly the 3 star and below reviews), these were supposed to break within days/are supposed to be uncomfortable/have a bad mic/lousy sound, etc. I haven't experienced any of these issues.Sure, they don't have a really deep bass, but the sound quality is pretty good. I don't hear any static or the like, it doesn't sound any different than my gaming USB headset; overall, I don't have any complaints whatsoever about the sound, other than the bass. That, however, was easily overlooked as everything else was fine.I've also read of some battery life complaints. So far, I haven't had any issues with that either. I recharged the batteries the night my headphones came in and hadn't charged them since, using the bluetooth mode for over 7 hours. I'd say that's WAY more than decent. There's always the aux cord they came with if the batteries did die, which I was FULLY expecting to use 100% of the time, but I never needed to use the cord. Not yet anyway.I haven't tested it with a phone call, but I did use them for a Discord chat when my mic broke. I was actually surprised to have a mic. According to my friends, they mic wasn't that great and the sound from the call was worse, so I CAN'T recommend these headphones for any phone calls. However, I DO use them for music on my phone, as I said via bluetooth, and it paired up just fine.They definitely are the most comfortable pair I've had, next to my USB gaming headset, and they fit over my ears nicely. Kept my ears warm in cold weather too! I just don't know for sure if sound leaks out or not. I haven't had an opportunity where it would matter, but I would assume the sound doesn't leak out, provided you keep your headset AND your device at a decent volume (you read that right, the headphones keep their own volume as well. Pretty nifty!)Some reviews say they stop working after a few days, up to maybe a few months. I've only had mine for a few days and they still seem to work as intended. Then again, I'm not too worried as long as I have the cord it came with. If anything, I would say just be careful with them like you would with a PS4, a TV, a computer, your phone, or the like. Don't misuse your equipment and it won't break right away. Not to say other customers are too rough, more-so just fold them carefully and whatnot.So yeah, other than the lack of a real bass-feel with these headphones, I really like them and I'm glad I made the investment!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"No real bass, still no real problem!

    ","So far these headphones have been insane. I’ve used them for about a day now, and they’ve been nothing but excellent. I’ve taken phone calls, listened to music (everything from current bass-heavy pop to movie soundtracks), watched a podcast, and even watched a couple YouTube videos. The audio doesn’t delay for anything and always matches the video. The battery life so far has been excellent. Out of the box I had over 10+ hours of battery life, and they charged really quickly too. If I had two complaints, it would be that the mic quality is pretty poor on these headphones, and there is a blinking blue light every 5 or so seconds on the right ear which can be annoying if you’re listening while you sleep or in the dark. Other than those two minor things, these headphones are excellent and I would highly recommend them. I have a pair of Bose over the ear headphones and Beats in-ear earbuds and though these can’t match the sound quality of the Bose or the bass of the Beats, they are an excellent mid point and the price is far far below Bose or Beats. Overall, a truly excellent headset I will be using daily.Pros: Great sound quality (Heavy bass, nice mids, good highs). Great battery life and charges quickly. Excellent aesthetic (I got the blue and black and the contrast is great and looks sharp and sleek). Good price point, very inexpensive compared to a lot of similar quality competitors.Cons: Constant blinking blue light on the right headphone. Mic quality isn’t the greatest.GET THESE HEADPHONES, YOU WON’T BE DISAPPOINTED.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible sound, Excellent battery life. GET. THESE. HEADPHONES."

Having said that, the sound on the Mpow 059 headphones are acceptable, but while they're fairly clear they don't offer an audiophile-level of sound reproduction. This, however, is really not the reason to own Bluetooth headphones. These connect easily to my Apple laptop at work, and, if I use the included software, they work well on my Windows 10 PC at home. Using Windows' default Bluetooth settings, I suffered audio quality loss and difficulty connecting and reconnecting.

    ","In general, this is one of the most comfortable head phones I've used, and the folding capabilities make it nicer to transport than a lot of other options.  Coupled with the good battery life, and the awesome backup physical cord for those non-Bluetooth-enabled devices, I have an overall positive impression of these, particularly for the price point.I have noticed one minor con:  I occasionally notice an audio glitch while using them.  I suspect this might be due to the fact that I have these paired with multiple devices, and there's usually at least two in range at any given time.  I have been, perhaps, a wee bit too lazy to unpair those other devices to test that theory, so don't put too much stock in that.  Your experience may differ.UPDATE:  I have verified that the audio glitches are indeed caused by having more than one device connected at a time.  It can be quite maddening at times.  These are fantastic headphones if you are using it with a single device.  Be wary with multiple devices, particularly if the devices automatically connect.",4.0 out of 5 stars,this is one of the most comfortable head phones I've used

    ","I did quite a bit of research trying to find a decent over-the-ear budget bluetooth headphone. I settled on the Mpow 059. I purchased the silver model, and they arrived in two days with Amazon Prime shipping.I really wanted to like these headphones. They looked good out of the box, fit nicely on my head, and seemed pretty comfortable. The one issue I noted right away was how much sound leaked out of the headphones. I wanted to use them in an office environment, but to be honest, even at modest sound levels, the sound that leaked out would likely bother those sitting close to me. At the very least, even if they weren't bothered, they'd know what I was listening to.  That was strike one.The other issue I discovered was that there was no way to ""pause"" the music, which I would need to do when a co-worker approached, or to talk to others in the office.  The instructions say there is a ""Pause"" feature, and there even seems to be an icon to ""pause"" on the headset controls, but no matter what I tried I could not get the music to pause. So, I either had to turn the volumn all the way down, or turn off the headset, if I wanted to talk to a co-worker. Neither of these was an accepable option for me. So, being defective, I will be returning them.  Time to find a second choice for a good, budget, headphone.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"""Pause"" feature not working // Too much sound leaks out"

I hate that it says all it's updates out loud (""power on"", ""pairing"", ""your headset is disconnected"", ""phone 1 connected"", ""phone 2 connected"", ""power off"") and I wish there was some way to disable that. The visual design is pretty good for something this cheap, and it's nice to have the option to plug it in, but I rarely use it and the included cord is rather flimsy. The light always flashes when it is on, which is really unnecessary considering how big it is. When I use them in the dark, sometimes I think I see something but it's just that the headphones are flashing. They stay pretty well on my head, and I find them really comfortable most of the time. They aren't appropriate for use while running or exercising or anything like that. Again I'll mention that they sometimes give spotty audio and that's frustrating.

I'm coming from a perixx ax 3000 gaming headset and I would say the perixx sounded considerably better, that being said, I would much rather use this due to the freedom and comfort you get from a wireless headset.These are very comfortable to wear, as long as you have normal sized ears you should have no problem wearing these as over ear headphones. However I've also tested them as on ear headphones, the padding is very soft and the clamping force isn't too high at all.Cons:The microphone is pretty bad to be honest, I wouldn't recommend using them. the microphone from my old headset was way better and even the microphone on my logitech c310 webcam sounds considerably better. If you use this on a pc, like I do, I would recommend either getting a separate desktop mic or, like me, you can set your webcam mic to be default so you use that instead of the headsets mic.All in all even with the crappy mic that comes with it I would highly recommend this to anyone shopping for a budget wireless headset. The sound quality is perfectly good its just not as rich of a sound (either on the low or the high spectrum) as other good wired headsets but it is clear and for a wireless headset, considering the comfort and freedom you get with being wireless, its a damn good headset, and at this price its a bargain.

The controls take some getting used to but I have found the Bluetooth signal to be strong and clear, and the battery to last. Longer term I will be evaluating how well this item holds up.

Also will be evaluation to see how durable they are.- The manual is in a very tiny font and for these middle aged eyes impossible to read without magnification.

    ","I will rate these on several levels. First, as headphones. They are very good and very comfortable. I would consider them pretty flat and I mean that in a positive way. I mean that they are pretty realistic sounding and warm. I am comparing them side by side with several other headphones in the house and all dollar levels: my son's Beats, my corded Monster NTunes, my daughter's brand x headphones and I would say without question these are the most pleasant to listen to for an extended period of time. They do get a little warm on the ears after a while (an hour or so) as they are over the ear so that's pretty standard but I find them quite comfortable to wear, even with my glasses on. For certain types of music or if you like that Beats artificially boosted bass, these may not be for you unless you have an EQ to boost the bass but they sound really good for many different types of music and since they are slightly warmer and less bright compared to the Beats and others, I find I can wear them much longer without ear fatigue so I am actually listening to music while working far more, which is great. Also, from a noise limiting perspective, they are good; as are most well padded over the ear headphones.Next and why I really got them, I was looking for a good all in one jack of all trades headphone/headset combo for work and travel and am tired of earbuds. After a little trial and error I was able to get them to work in VOIP for WebEx on my laptop which is awesome for me. That and the fact that they can be wireless and wired is great. The mic only works wireless via Bluetooth but that's fine and people tell me it sounds great and they are surprised when I tell them it's Bluetooth over VOIP so that's a big win. Also, the Bluetooth range is great. If my laptop is in the middle of the house downstairs, I can travel through almost the entire house, even upstairs and not lose the connection at all.While I was troubleshooting the WebEx mic thing, I did reach out to their support team via email. While I solved the trouble without their help, and their help was pretty generic and not specific to my issue, their multiple responses were prompt. For the money, I think they are a very good product. I give it four stars because time will tell. My last Mpow earbuds had the battery stop charging after about a year so that was disappointing. Since they batteries are not replaceable, even at this price they are not something I want to be buying annually so if I can get a few years out the battery and they don't snap or fail in some other way in the coming months, I will consider them a five star purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Actually, Really Solid"

    ","I purchased this as a replacement for an old PC gaming headset/mic. I found that when it paired with my computer (Win10), it created two Bluetooth Playback devices, but only one corresponding Recording device.Playback: - MPOW-059 Hands-Free - MPOW-059 StereoRecording: - MPOW-059 Hands-FreeThe computer can only connect to one of these devices at a time (Hands-Free or Stereo). This means that when I want to hear Stereo audio on from my computer, my default audio device has to be set to the Stereo device. That's fine, until I want to communicate with someone in a game or (weirdly) dictate to my computer, because there is no Recording device associated with it.Using the Hands-Free device as my default is not ideal. Because this device was designed for phone calls, it doesn't output stereo. To me, it was the equivalent to talking to someone on an old public payphone. Absolutely zero stereo and altogether crappy sound.Just to try, I made my Stereo device the default Playback and the Hands-Free device the default Recording device, but, because the computer only connects to one device at a time, I could hear the computer audio, but not what was being picked up by the mic.Not advised for gaming.

The top is nicely padded, and I've worn them for up to 6 hours without discomfort. I do get a red mark on my balding head after wearing them for a couple hours or more.Sound is very good -- not audiophile quality, but these aren't $300 headphones, either.

    ","The sound on these headphones is great. It synced up with the Bluetooth feature on my computer with no problem. The volume controls are touch controlled on the outside of the ear pad on the right. Very easy to use. A USB charging cable is included as well as an audio connection cable if you need that. Comes with a neat draw-string pouch for storing. They are adjustable across the head bar. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because they are a little uncomfortable when I wear them over my glasses. After a while - like an hour or so - I get a little discomfort behind my ears. I'm a writer and will often spend hours listening to music as my muse while writing, so I'm using them almost daily. I can take my glasses off  and the discomfort resolves. I am hoping that they will loosen up a bit over time and resolve this problem on their own. If you're looking for an economical Bluetooth headset, you probably won't find much better for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very satisfied

However, when just walking into the park and going to the gym, I'm not comfortable taking the Bose headsets.  1) They can easily be misplaced, and 2) if you lay them down in such a hectic environment, they can easily be stolen.So I need some cheap headphones to use so I could listen to my music, while cycling (not doing any of that weight lifting stuff).  I purchased Jabra 100-980 Smart Wireless earbuds to solve the problem.  They work great, but unfortunately too much movement and the buds fall out of your ear, period!  So I use the earbuds to replace my car stereo, which is broken.  They let me hear music, but let in a lot of outside noise, so I can still hear the traffic and surroundings.Back to the Mpow's.  Well, they met the objective of having headphone that would stay put when I'm cycling or just walking in the park.  They do isolate enough, that I would NOT use these while driving.  Warning!  But for other things, they provide a really good sound.  No, not Bose like clarity, but if you have something with good mid-range and bass, they things will rock you.Two bad things, but, you can live with them.  Well, their microphone for making calls is weak, so folks will tell you to speak up and it has an echo sound.  Also, the ear cups, while soft, they do get irritating with pressure against your head after awhile.  So I have to periodically remove them for a few seconds.  They are also not comfortable just hanging around your neck, when you are not listening to them, either.  So only if I am using the, do I actually have them on my head.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect set of cheap blue-tooth headphones, that won't make you cry if you lose them."

I have the same results though when i hear them. I also find it difficult to see the usb port where its located.I gave the headset 3 stars for the reason of the bad.

I did a lot of reading and comparing before settling, so I hope they work out well for me.  So far I have had just a little time to use them but from my initial use I have found they are well worth the research.  I wasn't looking for the world's best but I wanted a good pair of headphones that both looked good but also sounded good.  I wear hearing aids so I wanted something that would fit over my ears and not on them.  I also wanted something that had good base, with highs and lows that would not torture my hearing aides and me. (Both blowing out my hearing aides or my hearing  as I am hard of hearing not deaf).Other than the bit of white noise you experience (and it is really minor and low) in between song, quiet time during gaming and TV they are really great.  So realistic and all in time with the transmitter.  They were very easy to pair up with my Transmitter (also a Mpow) for my TV and also my PC. All my music sounds as good as with my other headphones that connect.  I also used the wire and no difference between wired and non-wired.I keep these in the bag that came with them as I didn't opt to buy the hard cover (it was a separate.purchase) and I keep them in my home office. The controls are easy enough to keep in mind.... Volume up, down, skipping left or right....center on/off and phone calls. I also stayed with the basic color Red/Black as it was a bit cheaper but that is the color I was originally looking for. A bit sporty.  Everything is black anymore and hard to find so I wanted something that was color contrasting and easy to find/see.So I am hoping to use these for a long time.

The cord in the pictures is not the same one that came with it because I lost that one, to be completely honesy. I've had these for about a year now, and the plastic has cracked in some places, but the great thing is, they still hold up, and they still work fine. I had a tendency to fall asleep listening to music or watching something, and I'm not very heavy, but repeated pressure of surely rolling on them probably lead to that, and even though some of the cushion has cracked, that's just from wear.

I would highly reccommend upgrading to the hardshell case made for this headset if you want good protection.The sound is quite good on these and the over the ear muffs are very comfortable.

When no sound is playing there is a audible background static like noise when they're turned on,  but it's not much of an issue if you're going to be playing music or watching something.

You can touch the glossy finish with a dry knuckle and still leave a mark.  They’re comfortable on my big head and funny ears. Bluetooth connection was fairly easy. It was in sync with all the media displaying on my phone which is something I often worry about when dealing with bluetooth. These worked just fine. The sound quality was decent for the price, yes the bass isn’t the best like many other reviewers have said. No big deal I guess, it wasn’t terrible. I bet you’re wondering why I’m returning them. Well, my girlfriend came home while I was testing them out, and I asked her what she thinks. She instantly said she doesn’t like them, she can loudly hear everything I’m listening to while they’re on my head!  I said “No way!”.  I let her put them on and she was right. I could hear what she was listening to clearly. I could make out the lyrics and everything. Even if she turned down the volume to 50% it’s still sounds pretty loud and clear to me. I don’t travel much, but I have a trip in a couple weeks and I bought these for my plane ride. I would definitely be disturbing everyone around me if I’m on the plane listening to the tasteless low-class music I like to listen to sometimes. I’m surprised so much sound is able to escape like that because I even asked my girlfriend to yell at me while I had them on and I could barely hear her. So... they do a good job of keeping outside sound out, but a bad job of keeping inside sound in, and that’s a deal breaker for me. They’ll give me no privacy. I hope this helps.

Weight on the head is decent and not too heavy, but I wouldn't wear it if I was actively moving around as it won't stay put very well. Was easy to sync with other device. It's nice that it can sync with 2 devices at once. Cables that came along with it are high quality. Headset is decently made and looks great on.

It's also great to have the wired option if you did forget to charge it. Works great both way.One major complain (at least for me) is using it on calls (wireless mode only) with my Note8. It's horrible. Incurred a lot of static and hiccups so had to revert to my regular phone headset, BUT my main purpose when I bought this is for listening to music and to drown out surrounding noises. I'm aware that it doesn't have noise canceling which I'm fine with and actually helped me realize when someone was trying to talk to me, lol. The other minor complaint is the sporadic audio hiccups when in wireless mode. I'm guessing maybe it's the frequency interruptions with all the other wireless devices here at my work.

This is a *tad* confusing, and sometimes, depending on what devices are connected, the power-off sequence doesn't end with the typical, very useful ""Power Off"" voice output.Other than that, these earn every bit of 5 stars for the price. As others say, the battery life is very good. It re-connects instantly with my phone and quickly after that with my laptop every time I turn the headphones on.

I can barely hear the bass compared to other headphones I own that are the same price range. I even have some cheap earbuds that are way better sounding with deeper bass. I am disappointed also with how uncomfortable these are. I can only wear them for about 30 minutes and I have to take them off. They push in really hard and feel really tight on my ears. I guess that would be a good thing if you were outside jogging or doing yardwork or something, because they will definitely not come off easily. Otherwise they are just painful after about a half hour.

He said they could be used cordless with bluetooth, or with a cord, and that they were really good. I took a closer look. I liked what I saw, so I tried on his set. I really liked them. They were a little tighter on my head than the old pair, but I figured I could live with that.I did not plan on connecting these headphones to my phone and tablet with bluetooth, as I'm used to using a cable. But I did connect both eventually. Both devices connected quickly and easily. The sound with bluetooth was excellent, and I loved being able to walk around the kitchen listening to my messenger messages without having the phone in my pocket. But I did end up using them with my cable because I didn't want to turn them on and off all day. If you use the cord, you don't need to turn them on. The phones did not seem to be too tight, as I frequently forget to take them off when I finish using them.And I LOVE the lime green color!!They came with a removable cable, but it doesn't have a 90 degree plug for the end that connects to the devices. My old headphones had the 90 degree plug, so I'm using those. At least I will have a back up cord if my old one craps out.I love that they fold up for traveling.

    ","Pros: Sound quality, battery life, comfort, and price point.Cons: People with alot of hair may find the headband slightly tight on their head.Overall: I've had these headphones for about a week now and I've been running them for short and extended periods of time to test battery life, function of the mic as well as overall sound quality. For $39.99 I can't even lie.... I thought it was too good to be true. The build quality is amazing for $40. As an audio engineer, I'm really big on quality over volume. These offer pretty solid quality and the volume is almost too loud. Which is a great thing because I won't have to crank the volume up much. The mic works perfectly fine. The battery has been solid through 8 and 9 Hours of constant listening and talking. I haven't tested how long I can keep these going before they cut off but 10 to 15 hours Hours I think is the estimate... I think it might be up to 20 Hours. The build quality is better than the first batch of Beats By Dre's. Don't argue with me. I've owned them and the headband on the Studio and Solo (1st Generation) were freaking HORRIBLE and fragile.Buy them. Don't think about it. Just spend your money.Well worth the money and I'm buying another pair for my brother.",5.0 out of 5 stars,For $40 I was actually surprised at the sound quality and build quality!

    ","If used purely as wireless headphones I think these are probably a great deal.This device completely fails as a headset.  For some reason, whenever the mic is switched on, sound no longer comes out of the headphones channel.  While making calls, this means both the mic and audio devices must be set to ""HEADSET"" not ""HEADPHONES.""  During calls this means:1) god-awful audio quality2) you will not be able to hear audio out of any other program running, i.e. you will not be able to use these headsets to game with a friend unless you have another pair of speakers.People also complained about the audio quality of the mic.  This is probably just due to the seemingly limited bandwidth between the bluetooth receiver and the headphones.  I can tell you that call quality on my other pair of bluetooth headphones is about 10x better due to the limitation outlined above.Tested on Windows 10.I'll be returning these and buying something else.

    ","Had for a few weeks, first wouldn't connect to my computer, bought a bluetooth adapter (The computer has bluetooth already). After a few days, started noticing issues while gaming, has about a 3-4 second delay on games (Not a big deal on most things, but on games is absolutely killer when you're watching lips move and then the sound comes later like a bad dub.) The big kicker, is that recently, while playing games, they make voices sound about 3-4 octaves deeper than they should. Really disconcerting, and added with the rest of the issues, just not worth the hassle.Edit:Okay, using the Audio Render on the Volume controls instead of Hands Free Audio, and that seems to have fixed it.

169,"on February 24, 2018",,"For the price, these are decent headphones. The sound is not the greatest, but it's what you would expect in a low to mid-range Bluetooth set like these. It pairs easily, and I actually like the button commands once I got used to them. The drawback for this phone, in addition to it getting kind of loud for those around you when you turn up the volume, is --- as many people have stated --- the irritating blue pulsing light that shines every 7 seconds. Yes, most Bluetooth phones have this, but it's not so intrusive. The light is on one side of the phone, and encompasses the whole perimeter of the command button, which is pretty big. I was watching something on my tablet in the dark when I first tried them and the glare from the light is really distracting. I can't imagine if you wore them on a plane or bus that it wouldn't bother other people. It certainly irritated me. I, again like a lot of other people, covered it up with tape. You shouldn't really have to do this, though, which is why I gave it 3 stars only. I must have missed this fact while reading the reviews. I did check and most similar phones, and this model, don't allow you to turn the light off. Sennheiser makes a Bluetooth model that can do this, but they are a lot more expensive. I already have a pair of Sennheiser for my desktop computer (not Bluetooth), and I didn't really want to spend all that much money on this pair, which I just use with my phone and tablet. I would say if they either gave the option to turn it off (I know a lot of people like it as it let's them know the phones are still powered on) or put a small light in the BACK of the phones, it would make them a much better deal, especially for the price.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Work decently but the flashing blue light is really distracting

In my opinion, the voice clarity is very good, and the microphone appears to work quite well too, as I have not had any comments about not being understood by anyone I've called.

    ","In Quick Summary: These headphones on the outside look visually pleasing and look very professional. They drain out noise, but others can hear your music as well. They feel tight most of the time, which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it. On the inside, the sound quality is amazing and does not fail to shine, HOWEVER, do not expect to hear ANY bass at all. These headphones work great but have no bass whatsoever.Longer Explanation: I bought this product for the cheap price and great design. The product delivers on both aspects of that and in spades. They feel comfortable to wear but can feel rather tight no matter how you set them up. The quality of the product itself is excellent, it does not feel cheap and feels extremely well made. The headphones also fold which is a nice touch. The headphone control button is also interesting, where it's the main button that you use to play/pause, take phone calls, and holding it down for certain time periods turns on/off the headphones and pairs it to whatever device. Of course, this is no problem to me and at first seems complicated but gets easier the more you use it.The sound quality of this product is phenomenal. The sound is extremely crisp, and does not drop quality or quickly disconnects and reconnects from the Bluetooth device (or not at all if you use the provided AUX cord). The sound can be heard from others when played at max volume, so do not act surprised when you're in a quiet environment and everyone suddenly looks your way. My only problem with these headphones, which is my fault and not the headphones, is that there is no bass. If any, it is so weak you cannot feel it. For people who want bass, these headphones do not offer such an option which is disappointing but not surprising as it is not a selling point for these headphones.If you're looking for headphones with amazing sound and very little to no base, THESE ARE AN EXCELLENT PAIR FOR YOU. I'd give it 5 stars for physical design, 4 1/2 for sound. For now, 5 is the best I can do because 4.75 is not an option, and these headphones do not deserve a 4.0.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent headphones, excellent price, amazing sound quality, BUT DON'T EXPECT ANY BASS."

After purchasing one for myself, I used it for a couple days and loved the sound quality. However, after calling my brother we both agreed that the microphones were not good. Ringing sounds, metallic/tingy, and overall quality reminds me of a walkie talkie. In addition to the fact that neither of us can listen to more than 1 source of sound at a time! For example, I can not listen to spotify and a game at the same time.

Bluetooth was very easy to set up on iPhone.My daughter has a Beats set and the sound is nothing like Beats quality but....The sound quality is pretty good, not too much bass, not too much treble. Comfort is good, they fit over your entire ear. They seem very sturdy and easy to adjust on your head, they are cool looking. I bought the green ones. For the price you cannot pass it up. If you are looking for an inexpensive Bluetooth headset for yourself or your kids, these will do the job perfectly. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars (I would of given 4.5 stars) is because you can hear the music still from the outside. I put them on and had my daughter stand next to me, about 5 feet away. She can hear the music clearly and I had the volume only half way. The purpose of headphones is to make sure no one around you can hear the music.",4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good.

    ","I love these headphones, the sound quality, the comfortable fit, good strong bluetooth connection, a wired input option, and the apparent noise cancellation.  They look nice on my head.  One really bad design decision:  For some reason there is a medium press of the main button that activates pairing (with the unit already on) and a long press for powering down.  So every time you shut it off it goes into pairing mode (and announces it) for a second, then it shuts off as long as you keep pressing down.  Seems like that should be the opposite (most devices require a really long press for pairing).  Also the volume and navigation buttons are all on the same flat ring in a circle around the main button and everything is the same level with no tactile bumps or anything to help differentiate.  Other than those two issues, everything else about these headphones is great!",4.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones

A Bluetooth headset would serve my purposes better and all that.Pros:- Comfortable, assuming you have an average head and ear size. If not they'll have a more on-ear feel.- Seemingly durable. A good amount of metal for hinges instead of all plastic and won't let you fold them if you have the length pulled out, which seemed highly practical. (But I won't be time testing them.)- Easy to use. Honestly, just read the manual and you're good.The Con:Well, the sound quality is god awful, and that's what it really came down to for me. I sat listening to music for a good while, debating whether or not it was intolerable enough to want to go through a return. It is.For examples of sound quality I'm used to, I long-time favored the HD 202 II Sennheiser model, that unfortunately hasn't been available to buy in the past four months. Might have discontinued? But I digress.Favored the model for comfort and sound quality, along with the great price. (Sat between $24 and $30, depending on markdowns.) While there are certainly better headsets out there, what it sported was quality none the less.So yeah, this headset? Which normally sits at $70? Nah, horrible sound quality.

The build quality is good, they feel like a pillow on your head, and the Bluetooth is surprisingly not bad.

Worth a purchase if you want actual real over the ear bluetooth and don't want to pay $100.

I watched 3 movies in series without battery failing. Jack and short cable for 3.5 to 3.5 stereo M/M. I actually moved it to 3 stars after looking at my cheap headphone. The ear cup doesn't swivel far enough and pushes the ear cup away from your hear and thus flattens the top out making it uncomfortable.

My younger sister uses an older computer of my mom's, so it does not have bluetooth capability, so they were actually never even really turned on. Rather, she used an aux cord to connect them to the computer.No worries, I thought. I contacted the company asking if there was something they could do, seeing as it was just outside of the return window for Amazon. They asked me if I had tried charging the headphones, likely assuming they just died. When I told them that they were never actually turned on, and that they were only connected through the aux cord, I asked if I could get a replacement pair, or even send them in to be fixed. No answer. It has now been over 2 months, and I can safely say this is horrible customer service for a product that simply does not last for more than a month. It's a shame, I would have bought another pair of these for my brother because he liked them too, but I cannot do that for a product that breaks in a month and a company who does not care about their product nor their customers.Do not buy these headphones if you want a pair that will only last a month, and a company that will not answer you with concerns.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Were Amazing For 1 Month...

    ","Bought these for our 10 year old son as a Christmas present. He loves them for listening to music and watching Netflix from his phone. He was also really excited to find out that they work for phone calls (we’ve had no problems with connectivity or sound when on a call with him). He let me try them on and I found them to be super comfortable with good sound.  Nice padding and headphone cup covers the whole ear. No wires in the way is a plus, as is having the option to plug in in case of low battery.  Tempted to buy a pair for myself, but I’ll stick with earbuds as I’m a little too old to pull off the look :) great purchase, especially for the price point. Hoping they last.

I can't wear it more than 20 or 30 minutes before the pressure builds on my lower ear lobs and jaw that I have to take it off.

    ","When I ordered these headphones, I initially was primarily looking for a wired set. After seeing the price on this set and reading the reviews though, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. The MPOW-59s are a surprisingly decent set of headphones without spending a fortune. When I unboxed them, the first thing that stood out to me was the shiny black plastic on the exterior, which looks kind of cheap. Honestly, and this is strictly nitpicking as well as my own opinion, I think a matte finish would have looked much better and not clashed as bad with the matte red on the interior of the pair I ordered. Other than that small gripe which others may not even see as a negative, I have been extremely happy with the set thus far. They pair easy to a computer or phone, and they have a decent range to them as well. I tested how far away I could get in my admittedly small house by leaving my phone to stream Spotify to the headphones while I went in another room, closed the door, and even then they still managed to keep connected, albeit with drops in quality and some skipping. Audio quality seems to be nice even when connected via Bluetooth. I have not yet used the included cable to try them wired, but it's nice that they included it. The headphones are pretty comfortable, with generous sizing on the cups and a nice padding around them. They fit me just fine, and I feel like they would fit just about anybody as long as you don't have huge ears or a massive head.

The headphones stay securely on my head during low impact cardio and strength training.  They are quite comfortable (I cannot wear many headsets)and the sound quality is great for the price.Of course I sweat when wearing these as they fit securely next to my ears and one sweats when working out.

    ","These are good over the ear headphones. There is nothing flashy about these they work well but don't expect them to sound as good as a top end pair of headphones. Look they cost $35 not $350. You are not getting that deep base nor the highs. They fit well with glasses, they sound ok via Bluetooth or the included 3.5 mm cable. My Cowin 7's sound better and have a deeper base. They paired easy but turning them off requires pressing the button for about 8 seconds, they eventually will tell you they are powering down.

    ","Phenomenal price to quality ratio. I own a pair of Bose Quietcomfort 35 headphones as well (~$345) and there are two ways in which the Bose headphones are obviously superior, the noise cancellation and quite frankly the comfort for longer-term listening (hours at a time, such as for a transatlantic flight). But if we set those aside, I have to say, the Mpow headphones absolutely shocked me with the sound quality. I honestly expected nothing from these headphones (merely a good over-ear and wireless option to listen to ocean sounds while studying), but I found myself using them routinely to listen to music. The frequency response is somewhat limited to the midrange but I was surprised by the reach of the bass on some of my hip hop tracks; I had to throw on the equalizer on Spotify to accentuate some of the lower and higher frequencies to get a nice sound for myself, but still, not bad for a $35 pair of headphones. The build quality is actually excellent, waaaay better than I would expect for the price. Solid bluetooth connection, excellent wired option, and the multifunction buttons are well-placed and study. I also took them on a transatlantic flight just to see how they would fare, and quite honestly they did well. The airplane noise was not overwhelming them, the sound came through just fine (actually the highest volume setting was pretty loud), and they were relatively comfortable for long durations. Although they have a bit of a tight fit and can get uncomfortable around the ears if you wear glasses with thick side pieces, they were soft enough when they fit flush against the head when I was wearing contacts. Overall, not a bad option if you are in the market for a lower-end pair of headphones. I wouldn't even go with the ""you get what you pay for"" on this one; I'd say you'll get quite a bit more than you'd think. Although I'll be sticking to my Bose Quietcomforts for most of my actual music listening, these are still definitely worth it for a cheap backup pair.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent pair of headphones, highly recommend them."

The sound is great, though it is VERY audible to those around you if it's not fairly quiet, but that doesn't bother her since she doesn't listen to it loud anyway.

285,"on March 18, 2018",,"The headset is small and beautiful and comes with a little usb to micro-usb charger, the audio cable, a string baggy to store everything, and a tiny guide booklet. The sound quality is pretty good, and the ear pads are very soft and comfortable, cupping your ears and blocking out some sound. The Bluetooth set-up is pretty easy, but you have to make sure you read the booklet to figure out how the buttons on the headset work. Thankfully, the headset uses sound effects, voice, and colorful blinking lights around the buttons to tell you if it's powered on or charging and so on. The built-in microphone, unfortunately, makes me sound a little muffled. I've also had some strange connectivity issues with the Bluetooth with sound completely disappearing or videos buffering, and it turns out this depends on what programs are using the headset, so you have to make sure you play with those settings. Overall, however, wearing these was a big change from my last headset which had an extremely long cable that made it impossible to move comfortably or get up and dance. These feel so good and freeing and were a good purchase even though the microphone could be better!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: Good Sound and Comfortable Fit and Movement | Cons: Meh Mic, Weird Bluetooth Connectivity sometimes"

    ","These are very nice headphones. The sound is very good, they feel sturdy, and the padding mutes outside noise very well. I tried using them with my phone, and the mic worked well, but it was odd to speak on the phone with my own voice a bit muffled. For that reason, these seem better for listening to content without noise interference than for extended phone conversations, though I might get used to it over time. Only 2 negatives: (1) I had to hold the on/off/pair button for a while to make anything happen and had to try a few times to get the timing right for turning them on or off - this may just take practice; and (2) though they were generally comfortable, I found they squeezed sensitive spots around the jaw joint or above my ear, and when I adjusted the headpiece, the ears drooped a bit low. The issue may be my particular anatomy or maybe all headphones of this type fit this way.",4.0 out of 5 stars,These are very nice headphones. The sound is very good

    ","The Mpow Wireless Headphones and are bluetooth compatible, but also include a 3.5mm detachable cord for people you prefer wired headphones. These headphones are great they have a soft protein memory that is super gentle around the ears and on top of the head. These headphones have an amazing range of 33 feet and have an excellent driver of 40mm on each earmuff. The bass on these headphones is amazing it is like you have a subwoofer on your ears, when I was listening to a bass test I could feel it on the back of my neck. The only thing that I dislike of this headset is that the headband starts to slightly hurt after about two hours on your head. On Amazon these headphones are $34.99 and at Walmart they are $37.99. These headphones have amazing quality and are great for traveling, if you need to save space in your small bag these are great. Also if you like to use your headphones or earbuds for calls these are fully compatible for bluetooth calling and also if you prefer wired headphones these have a detachable cord. When you receive the package you will find the Mpow bluetooth headset, a 3.5mm detachable cord, travel bag, and a charging cable. Also these headphones have a battery life of 13 hours when fully charged and a 15 hour battery life when you use these headphones for calls, and have infinity hours when you use the wire. The headphones feel amazing they are super comfortable and plus I have a big head and these are a great fit without being uncomfortable on my head. I have dropped these headphones a few times and they are super durable I mean I obviously have not dropped them off a building and they are perfectly fine but just a few feet off of the ground without any damage. These headphones are probably directed more towards young adults like teens and adults that like to take calls with your headphones or just chilling and listens to your jams. These headphones I would definitely buy them again because they are super comfortable and are suitable to me style of living and listening to music.Also this product is worth the buy because they are amazing, they work perfectly the fit amazingly and they are fully compatible with any device that is able to connect with bluetooth items.",5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are great they have a soft protein memory that is super ...

I like the over-ear design.I'm not a sound connoisseur, so they sound just fine to me.

Mostly, I use them for long runs, and they stay where I put them... on my ears so I can hear my music, fitness tracker, and take phone calls. I’ve tried so many ear buds and they all eventually slip out or need adjusting especially once I’m sweaty.The sound quality is good, especially for what I’m doing.  I even use them when I mow my lawn...double as hearing protection(not official) and music.  No, they are not high-end studio or Bose; but for what you get in this headset for the price... I feel the customer profits more than the seller!By the way, it connects to my phone almost instantly when I power them on. No searching, no fumbling with the phone’s Bluetooth settings. Lace up, music playlist, headphones on, hit play... and go! Makes my running allot more enjoyable when not having to reposition or stop to fix my music.  Stays put when using a weight bench too.The buttons are easy to use, and conveniently organized with volume control, next song, last song, and Siri.Only confusing aspect, until I got to know my headset better, is when I go to power them off: you have to hold the button until the voice says it’s off.  It goes through a series of function when powering off that use the same “hold the button down” function. So don’t freak out and try to fix it like I did. Just hold the button until it performs the function you want.Also tried it with my Echo, Apple TV, and PS4... handled all with ease.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The tech far outways the price: A+

    ","You get what you pay for with these headphones. They're not an amazing deal for the price, but the build quality is solid and they're comfortable and durable. The sound quality is the biggest issue, and is simply not very good. There is a lot of reverb and the bass is *extremely* overbearing. The sound quality is a bit tinny as well. However, for the price you can't expect much better. The only other issue i've had with the headphones is that the cord they come with is very short. If you plan to use the bluetooth functionality, this isn't an issue, but if you prefer wired like me you'll need to replace the cord with your own. Luckily, I have a few male-to-male audio cables lying around. Unfortunately, the port on the headphones themselves is encased in plastic and is very small, so neither of my standard audio cables could fit - I had to take a knife to one to whittle down the protective rubber around it in order to get it to fit fully inside the jack. If you plan to use the headphone wire and want more than a foot or two of cable length, you'll probably need to invest in a male-to-female audio cable to extend the length, or a male-to-male cable with a low diameter audio jack. Just something to keep in mind.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good value, but some issues"

    ","I have had these headphones for a few days now and I will say that I am quite impressed with them for the price. However, there are some flaws. The battery charges super fast and seems to last for a very long time. I charged them for an hour when I got them(went to 100%) and it is now 5 days later and they are at about half. I have used them everyday, so I am happy with the battery life. Another pro is how comfortable they are. I have worn them for about 2 hours at a time and they never hurt my head.They are very nicely cushioned. My final pro is the sound. Honestly, they sound great. Very comparable to Beats Solo's. I use them for listening to music and videos, and the sound is perfect.Now on to some issues with them. First is more of a personal preference, and it may not bother some people.There is a flashing light on the power button that consistently flashes when the headphones are on. It's fine during the day, but if you use them at night it gets annoying. My second flaw is with the power/pairing button. It takes like 6 seconds of holding in the power button to turn them off. Which, personally, is a bit much. I think this is because when you hold the button to turn it off, it tries to pair a device before turning off. Again, not a huge deal. My third, and biggest issue, might be a technical flaw in my pair, I am not sure. Every so often, the sound goes out and gets very ""grainy"" or the sound will get ""stuck"" and repeat the same thing over and over. I know it is the headphones because once I turn them off, the sound is fine. I am not sure why it's happening but the headphones were only $23 so I'm not too mad about it.I wanted a cheap pair of headphones for traveling, and this is a great option.

It does not fit will with glasses unlike some others can and that is not a large problem just a small one due to the way the design is I don't have any marks or warping of the glasses so that is why i have given 4 stars .However the sound Quality  is worth 10 stars . The fit of the headphones even with glasses is breathtaking i truly enjoy wearing this productThe easy of connecting it to the laptop was fast and took no time . How ever the power button being 5 seconds to push is slightly annoyingBut I have other products that are like that and you get used to it . truly a great design with a MOST AMAZING PRICE THANK YOU.Thank you,4.0 out of 5 stars,I would buy this product many times over (have not used long term untested)

Which i dont mind. I dont need thumping headphonesSo overall the sound is great. very loud. This is only a con for some people that like headphones with a ton of Bass.Other than that these are THEE best headphones you can buy for the price hands down.They do not hurt or make your ear hole sore after extensive periods of wearing them.Would buy again if they ever broke.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy extremely happy

    ","I really like these! They easily connect to the Bluetooth on my phone and my laptop! They're not completely noise canceling but they certainly do a good job.My main criticism is that the power on / off/ pause/ play & connect to Bluetooth are literally all the same button. It all depends on how you push it.... I'm still figuring it out, but I haven't been able to turn it off via button yet. I think it just goes off eventually. And sometimes pausing the music will work but sometimes I have to go to my main device.Otherwise, turning it on and connecting to Bluetooth is super easy.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones

I have listened to audio books, music, you tube with no sound issues.  I have listened to a seminar online and skype on my notebook where the sound was muffled and low quality.

    ","They are much lighter than I thought they would be. That's a plus, as I was looking for a pair that wouldn't fall off my face every time I looked down.After wearing for a couple hours, I did feel a bit of discomfort on the top of my head, but it's nothing I couldn't put up with. About the not being over-ear part, they are over-ear; However, I have small ears, and the cups are a bit small for anyone with larger ears. I let my brother try them on, he has large ears, and he did say they didn't feel like over-ear headphones. So, keep that in mind.The cups themselves are on a free moving pivot and allow for more conformity, something I found helpful.The battery lasts as long as I need it to. Haven't had them die on me yet. I don't listen to music for extensive periods of time. They come in the box half charged as far as I could tell. You will need to charge them fully for first time use.The only thing that makes me worry is the micro-USB charge port in the right headphone. It seems precarious. It is tight on most cables I have and it might get pushed inside the plastic if you're not careful. There isn't much glue holding it there. If it becomes a problem later, I will update this review. I will most likely take the plastic off and superglue it if and when this happens.The manual is quite small, in order to fit in the box, but I could read it just fine. The text is small, but not unreadable to the naked eye. Maybe it is harder for older people to read. It has everything you could ask in it and I saw no typos or weird wording.As these are folding headphones, I was initially worried that the movement would chafe the cables inside the headband. I immediately checked this first. This does not seem to be a problem. The cables are held in place and hardly move when folding. There is no visible slack either. The hinges are made of metal, so I doubt they will easily break.The button ring on the side is not raised, so there is no tactile feedback, but the configuration is easy to remember. Top-volume up, Right-forward, Bottom-volume down, Left-back, Center-on, pair, off, accept calls, pause/play.I'm not a sound aficionado by any means, but I think they sound great. Not very intense bass if that's what you're looking for. Good for everyday casual use, but not for specialists.I hope this was helpful and I'll answer any questions you might have.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"A Good Pair of Headphones, Very Light"

    ","This is good headphones but there are some bad parts that I faced after having it on for a while that I noticed. There are three main things that I really thought these headphones can improve on which was starting with the sound equality which was good but I believe it could have been better. Another, was the static noise that I always heard when I either opened up my keyboard on iPhone and when music was playing (just annoying when typing and not listening music). Also, this might be my fault but there is a blue blue light that constantly flickers and it is very annoying at night. I read the manual it said couple of vague stuff about it like it was music, low battery, etc. I’ve done what I can to make it stop but it still exists. (Yes I fully charged it for 4 hours)The good thing I loved about the headphones was the design. The design is the best I like it SOO much. The material is best to be expected. They are comfortable.

    ","The main problem is the one button control to power on, pair, disconnect, and power down. You hold the button for a corresponding amount of time to do the desired task. For example, 3 second to turn on, 4 seconds to pair, 5 second to disconnect and 6 to turn off. This means getting them paired and not then immediately disconnected from your phone is challenging to say the least as the button is not quite sensitive enough and I constantly heard the ""paired"" command and then the ""disconnected"" command. Often I would accidentally turn them off when trying to pair. It's a very frustrating experience and I often just used the 3.5mm jack which defeats the purpose of the bluetooth.The sound is pretty tinny and uninspiring. You seems to get what you pay for. I got the blue color and in person it's quite light, very near baby blue.They are pretty comfortable to wear and the 3.5 jack is great for use on airlines in-seat entertainment systems.

    ","Great Bluetooth headphones-very sturdy materials, not cheap-better constructed than other “high end” brands  for sure.These are exactly what a $30 pair of good headphones sounds like. The fact that they’re over ear & blue tooth and  I’m not sure if they’re advertised as ANC, but I can’t hear a thing when I’m wearing them are all a huge plus.These are not $500 studio headphones for an audiophile.....but an audiophile should know this fact based off the excellent price. Have I heard clearer and more bass in other overear headphones? Yes, but for $400 more....for my needs, the extra bass and clarity does not justify the price of higher costing headphones.

    ","UPDATE: So after I posted this review, I was contacted by their customer service. They sent me another pair of headphones (the MPOW H2) and they are awesome. I transcribe a lot for work so i wear headphones for 5+ hours a day. The H2 fits great, I can wear them for much longer than before, and i like that the H2 had all the same features such as the option to be wireless or not, the easy to use buttons on the ear phone and the padding on the head band. The H2 are ""on ear"" and not ""over ear"", so theres no noise cancellation, but they do a great job of still playing music loud enough to quiet the world around me. The sound quality seems to be the same but the H2 had an option to change the EQ, which I really like. I was not expecting to be sent a whole new pair of headphones and I really appreciate the time and effort the company took to make sure I was satisfied. Thank You!These are awesome headphones but they are soooo tight on my head. I can't wear them for more than a few minutes before getting a headache. I'm hoping they will stretch out a little bit after some use, but if they don't, I'll have to return them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Updated review

    ",Had them about 3 months now and they stick work great for the price. They are not studio headphones by a long shot but they do work well corded or Bluetooth. Great  for watching videos or listening to music. My ears start to sweat and itch after about an hour and a half but every headphone I have ever owned did that so I can't hold that against them. They do a pretty good job as muffs too. I have to wear them off of one ear to be able to hear conversations in the room.,5.0 out of 5 stars,good value and work as advertised.

The first 50 times of turning it on and hearing  ""power on, phone 1 connected"" and then turning them off and hearing ""pairing ... your headset is disconnected ... power off"" were ok.  After two months now though I'm having buyers remorse.  Having some combination of quick beeps where the number of beeps indicate something you might have to look up would be much better.  The headphones say all this stuff, but after 50 times it becomes much more like nagging.  The blue light on the actual headphones also pulses about every 5 seconds.

I also like that there is a voice to tell you power on, power off, device paired, and maximum volume.  Some other headphone just beep different number of times and expect you to know what the beep means.One bad thing is that it cuts off right where my earring studs are and so it presses the earring rod into my face/neck so it is uncomfortable after a few minutes.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good buy!

I haven't used the cord to connect directly to the aircraft seat connection, so I can't give an opinion.

    ","I had a decent pair of on-ear Bluetooth phones that I bought at the big blue electronics store, and realized too late to return that they irritated the piercings in my ear cartilage to an intolerable degree. I gave those to a friend and took a chance on these for myself.These cost about half as much as my prior pair so I was a little skeptical, but the sound quality is just as good if not better. The circumaural cups are perfectly sized for me, but I think they wouldn't be for someone with large and/or protruding ears. For me, though, I find that the foam is thick and squishy enough to avoid contact with my piercings and also mold comfortably around my eyeglasses without significant sound leakage.My only significant gripes are with the on-board controls. The play/pause/power button seems to be kind of finicky on the timing (sometimes I hold it down for a while expecting to turn the phones on or off and nothing happens). Also, it's not very easy for me to feel the up/down forward/back controls since they're all on just one continuous ring. I think having a raised symbol or even just a little nub on each of those 4 spots would make it a lot easier to control.Bottom line, though, I'm very satisfied with these, especially for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Big enough to work with piercings and soft enough to work with glasses!

The on/off button doesn't work properly all the time. It sometimes takes a number of tries to press the button just right to turn it on/off.  Sometimes the button gets stuck.

448,"on April 11, 2018",,"I haven't seen the design of the ear cushions discussed in other reviews, so I thought I would describe them here.  When I first tried wearing these headphones, I just placed the ear cushions flat on my ears, and the cushions felt too small.  However, when I examined the cushions more closely, I noticed that the inside of the cushions did not go straight down to the speaker surface.  Instead, they curved inwards, so that there was more space near the bottom of the cushion than at the top.  So, instead of putting the headphones flat on my ears, I tried placing them halfway behind my ears, and then sliding them forward into place over my ears.  This allowed my ears to slide into the larger space at the bottom of the cushions, with the cushions cupping my ears rather than sitting on top of them.  This felt much better, and my ears had sufficient space.  I should note that the adjustment of the headband spacing is quite sensitive, and I had to tweak it repeatedly to find a spacing that didn't feel like my ears were being pulled up, nor having the weight of the headphones resting on the top of my ears instead of the top of my head.  Once I found the correct spacing, though, the headphones were very comfortable, with the only remaining issue being that my ears grew noticeably (but not uncomfortably) warm after an hour or so of wear.",4.0 out of 5 stars,About the fitted ear cushions

464,"on February 27, 2018",,"First of all, this pair of headphones looks fantastic. As a person who loves to wear fashionably on every-day basis, it's a great fashion choice with any casual fashion. Especially, I love those red strips on the head band and on the edges of the headphones.Secondly, the headphones are very comfortable to ""wear"" for a long time because of its great cushions on the parts that contacts the ears and the head. My ears are usually too large for ear cups of most headphones, so usually, it's really difficult for me to wear and use headphones for a long time as most of them apply a lot of pressure on my ears and hurt my ears after hours of use. However, the headphones have very large ear cups that completely cover over my ears fully without applying any pressure on either of my ears, allowing me to use the headphones without any pain on my ears. The bonus part is the extra soft cushion the headband part of the headphones, as this also reduces a lot of stress on my head. I have a pretty large and sensitive head, so any stress or pressure applied to my head for long time causes headache. But the headphones never caused a headache even after nearly a whole day of wearing it on my head.Third, the headphone Bluetooth connectivity is really great and cross-connects and transfers nearly flawlessly (I say nearly, since there are times I have to restart the headphones to connect both to my phone and my laptop, but usually connects automatically without restart). Also, I've seen that the headphones play music without any disturbance on its Bluetooth signal even when I am pretty far away from the device that I have connected the headphones to (by pretty far, I mean approximately 30 feet to 40 feet). I think the maximum distance that it connects to is like 50 feet (at the maximum, the signal starts to distort). The buttons are very responsive, and the microphone works pretty well (all over Bluetooth), too.Fourth, the sound quality of the headphones was exceptional for this price! I was surprised that the headphones gave a good bass while giving very clear crisp sound without any distortion (usually, if there is some emphasis on the bass, the high crisp sound gets little bit of distortion). And those qualities usually come with high-end headphones that would cost at least 100 bucks. So, when I got the headphones and started listening to my playlist with lots of different genre, I was really happy that I got the headphones.Finally, the battery power of this headphones is incredibly good. The headphones lasted on batteries for the entire day when I just charge it for may be two hours. I pretty much have this headphone on me all the time as long as I am awake, and it never gave me that low battery warning throughout the day. After a long day, I plug the headphones to the charger right before I go to bed, and when I wake up to go to school, the battery is fresh and goes on for another day. Moreover, if the battery ever does run out, you have that extra 3.5mm aux cable to use the headphones just like other normal wired headphones. If you use that cable, you can use the headphones without using its batteries. However, I never use this cable since the battery of this headphones seem to last pretty much forever. And what's the point of having Bluetooth headphones if you use it wired?So yeah, that was my first extensive Amazon review and I give thumbs-up if you are deciding to buy this product.I know it's long but that's because I really like the headphones and would like to recommend it to anyone who are looking for good Bluetooth headsets.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Look, Very Comfortable, Exceptional Sound Quality, Flawless Bluetooth Connection, Long-lasting Battery"

The headphone is so soft and make you feel very comfortable, you can also listen for a least one hour without notice that you are wering. The only thing not so good it's the noise rejection, even you listen with high-volume, you continue hearing outside,but the quality of the song is pretty good! Also,is easy to operate, you can pair with a computer or smartphone just using the singlecenter button. You can adjust the sound level or switch songs with buttons around the center one. And there is more, the foldable design is what I love most, which makes the head phone takes less room. Another flexible design is that you can easily switch between wired mode and wireless mode. As for the battery which people care about a lot, once after taking a while tocharge, it can works at least ten hours! The head phone cannot work while charging but it will not be a big problem because I don't use it all the time.For me,the thing that makes it even better, is the really fast shipping, it onlytook less than 24 hours to deliver to me!

The Bluetooth is very easy to connect, all you have to do is press and hold one button and the rest is done on its own.

537,"on February 25, 2018",,"-General-For it's price, these headphones are a steal! I've used them for months now and I am very pleased with the purchase. I use the headphones with my phone, laptop and through the audio jack connection at the controller, I use them with my PlayStation as well. I've never had an issue where the device didn't connect with another or drop a connection when it was established. Once the headphones are paired with the phone or laptop, connection is instantaneous when the power is turned on.-Battery-Overall, I'd say the battery lasts about a week. Athough it's a 10-15 days on a charge as the norm for me. When I use them to watch things on the PlayStation or my laptop, I usually use the aux-cord (it uses no juice that way) and connect wirelessly at school, while studying etcetera. Battery life is a non-issue with these headphones, you'll be amazed.-Size and Fit-They're a little bulky - I agree. However the size of the headphones is comparable with name brands (Bose even beats), to me there isn't much difference in size. The parts that go over the ear are quite comfortable. I have big ears as well and even if I have them on for a long duration, I don't feel any discomfort.-UI and Buttons-I had used another set of wireless headphones long before buying these and because the buttons were sticking out on the edge of the ear-piece towards the bottom left, they stopped functioning. The buttons on these are flushed on the flat surface of the right ear and they're sturdy! All of the functionality that comes with the buttons have worked with all my devices. Meaning, I can answer/reject calls with it, skip a song/go back to the previous one, adjust the volume and etcetera. I know, to mention this seems a little too redundant as the buttons are supposed to be functioning anyhow, but, the buttons function and they do so on all of the platforms (tried it on laptop/desktop, Samsung S8, S7 and iPhone 6s Plus and no problems so far)-Recommendations-1-) If you're someone like me, who bought four or five of the cheap earphones with pices ranging from $10 to $20 and want to stop wasting your money/time on backup after another then this is a frugal / worthwhile option.2-) Buy a case for it. I bought this one ---> https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LVVZYN4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_TXVKAbSD97XH7.It fits in my backpack, spacious enough for me to store other items such as the aux cord, my phone charger and so on.

I have even left them out overnight a few times in extreme humidity. Last Wednesday I RAN THESE OVER with an 8,000 pound skid steer. As expected with any headset, they were completely crushed and ruined. Come to find out THEY STILL WORK. I ordered another set within 10 minutes and received them that Friday! I cannot do without these! They make 12 hours a day on machines much more pleasurable. Plus, I know when I get a phone call or text message I actually know. And I can keep working while talking on the phone. It's such a huge time saver in my profession. Getting 5-10 calls a day can eat up time quick. People can still hear my and I can hear them while I work. The ONLY thing I would change about these is this. I think it would be neat if it had a button you could press that would tell you the time.

The bluetooth is very useful in that it allows us psychotic law students to run around the room/backyard without missing a beat.  One major issue I have is how loud the ""power off"" and ""phone is disconnected"" notifications are. Sometimes I fall asleep listening to something soothing on youtube and the screaming ""POWER OFF"" jerks me right out of sleep like a mean slap on the face.

    ","Update 4/15/2018: The seller/manufacturer sent me a replacement to try it out again. So I am updating my review to reflect that.1) Build quality: 5/5. For the price, I don't think you can find a better one out there. Its sturdy and doesn't look cheap. The updated headphones have better button quality and then the previous ones and I feel little more confident.2)Comfort: 5/5. The new ones are lot more comfortable and didn't require any break-in. My head is little smaller than my wife and they are little tight for her. So YMMV. Also, I mentioned earlier, if your ears are on the bigger side, then this might be on-ear instead of around-ear for you. They are perfect for me as my ears are on smaller side.3) Sound quality: 4/5. I think they serve the purpose for me. I was not expecting Bose or Sennheiser HD level quality but the sound is crisp (and may be a tad louder). Lot of people are complaining about bass etc but I think you can adjust that from your phone or computer. As long as you don't expect a $300 sound from a $35 headphone you will not be disappointed. Few people in my office have the same headphones for couple of months long, and they seem to happy about it.4) Charging: 5/5. Takes about couple of hours to charge but once charged, it holds the charge for a decent time. I am not a power user and have yet to recharge the headphones (after 2 days of use)but even if serves me 3 days without charging, I am good. The downside is the built-in battery. Once that starts goind bad, then this headphone would outlive its utility value. How long will it take? Thats any one's guess. For $35, if this lasts me a year, I will be happy.5 Customer Service: 5/5. The customer service from the seller has been fantastic. They didn't have to send a replacement, that too free of charge just to change my experience. I definitely appreciate good service when I get it, and this has been a revelation. I am not sure if there are many companies offering this level of service for a $35 product. I think just based on that, I would recommend giving this headphone a chance.I am leaving my previous review for reference. So my change in rating would make sense.===============================OLDER REVIEW:===============================I should have done some research before ordering the headphones. For sake of clarity, I will post a detailed review.1) Build quality - Build quality for the price is pretty good. They feel sturdy in your hand. Fit and finish is top-notch. The power/volume buttons do appear flimsy though. So not sure how they will withstand the test of time. My guess is - these will be the first one to go bad.2) Comfort - Looks like they do require some level of break-in. When I put them on my head directly from the box, they felt a bit tight. However, after few uses, they have loosened up a bit.  I have Bose QC25(wired) and they are extremely comfortable. I also own a cheap Panasonic RP-HTX7(wired) which are pretty good for everyday use(Surprisingly, the price for them have gone up since I bought them) This headphone is still tighter than those two (although both are wired and this one is wireless. I doubt that would be make any difference). I also bought Pioneer bluetooth phones and they were more bulky but just as tight. However, one big issue with this heaphones is that ear opening is bit narrow. The memory foam padding is pretty good and provides a good seal around your ear. My ears are on the smaller side and they fit just about right. If your ears are on the bigger side, then this might be on-ear instead of around-ear for you.3) Sound quality (Wired)- Pretty much what you would expect for the price. Surprisingly good bass response because the phones sit relatively tight around ears. Much better than Pioneer headphones (which are more than double the price). Tonality is flat but I do not expect much at this price. For casual office/home use , this would work fine. I have a bluetooth speaker in my office which I use when no one is around, but I wanted something that I can use in office hours. This would serve that purpose. They are still not as good as Panasonic RP-HTX7 (which I bought for $30 but now for some reason are double the price). Couldn't test sound quality in wireless mode. See below.4) Charging - This is where things start going down hill. The phones will not charge. When I first connected headphones to USB, the charging light turned on. I left it overnight to charge but when I checked in the morning they would not turn on. I connected again and again the charging light came on. I waited for few minutes and the light went off. I thought the charging was complete but phones still would not turn on. I figured my cable might be defective so I used the same cable to connect to a wall-port charger. There was marginal improvement. While connected to wall-charger the light came on and you could turn on the headphones but again the light went off in few minutes , which according to manual implies charging is complete. I tried turning them on - again no dice. At this point, I am quite frustrated and they are going back.The sole reason to get this headphone was to have the wireless mode. The fact that they do not hold charge or battery is defective is a bummer and a deal breaker. I should have done my research before ordering them. There are 12k reviews but most reviews are from people who have just 1 review which is this product. Take them with a pinch of salt. I would say stay away. There are other reviewers who have commented on charging issues and I would say those are the ones you should pay attention to.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Updated Review: Replacement works like a charm and is comfortable.

I sleep with my meditations on and for times that I need an alarm to wake up, it has helped with waking me up when I needed to be for medication schedules, which is nice since I am a bit of a hard sleeper.Honestly, I would absolutely buy these again and I do recommend them to anyone who is looking for a pair of bluetooth connect headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product and also a good alarm clock too.

594,"on March 25, 2018",,Just got these (two of them) but find them super frustrating. My other Bluetooth headphones I lost told me the battery status. Shortly after plugging them in the red light goes off so how do you know when they are fully charged or still charging? Left them charging over night just in case. Paired them to my phone just fine but couldn't figure out how to get them to pair to second device. Didn't really matter since 10 minutes later they just turn off. Both of them. Guessing the battery is dead already or maybe didn't charge? At first I thought they turned themselves off or asleep while I was trying to figure out adding the second device. But there's no indicator to tell you if they are off or on just the initial voice prompt. But no lights so must be dead. Who knows - tried again to get them charge no luck. They'll work for a few minutes that's it. USB Outlet works just fine with fully charging my phone so it's not the outlet. I don't find them very comfortable either. They are so heavy that there's no way to get the headband off your head & for me I just don't enjoy all the weight pressing against my head but that's just a personal preference.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Won't hold a charge

619,"on October 3, 2017",,"*UPDATE* March 2018: 1 starInitially, I really liked these headphones, but now after using them regularly over the past few months, my opinion has totally changed. (see original review below) For the first few months, they worked great, but now I regularly get these VERY loud interruptions to the audio I am listening to. Intermittently, the speakers will produce a VERY loud distortion sound that I can best describe as a combination of fuzzy static and a loud screech. It is always much much louder than whatever I am listening to which is completely jarring, and honestly quite frightening when listening to something quieter/gentler. (It is so unexpected and loud that it has made me physically jump). This is now happening more and more frequently, now occurring multiple times during a listening session (30min - 2hrs).This issue can't be caused by wear and tear because I have never even dropped my headphones or subjected them to any physical handing that would cause damage. They are either on my ears, or sitting on my desk.I also know that this issue can't be caused by a specific app or my phone, because it consistently occurs with multiple apps while using the headphones and has never occurred with any other bluetooth (or wired) device I have used with my phone.Overall, I am very disappointed with these, especially since I spent a lot of time shopping around and I thought I had finally found a reliable pair of bluetooth headphones.October 2017 Review: 5 starsWorks well.

When turning on the headphones the ""power on"" notification sound is pretty loud, but I just wait to put the phones on my head for a second and it is fine.The only drawback with these headphones was that it did not come with a charger. It came with a usb to micro usb cable, but no adapter. I didn't have a problem though because I have a lot of these adapters from other devices, so I gave it 5 stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I think these are a great pair of headphones

After long periods of wear the top of my head started to feel soar.  The ear padding was just fine though.I also wish it had a power switch instead of holding the middle button to turn it off and on.  Sometimes when I try to shut it off it first goes into pairing mode before finally turning off since both actions are performed via holding down the same button.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent sound quality

Plus the haedphones foam/padding is really hard making it really uncomfortable wearing them for long periods of time.

There simply is no denying the audible difference between bluetooth mode and plugging the wire in which is what I was primarily concerned about from the get-go.

    ","I was excited to use this product because of the amazing reviews I had seen on it. Unfortunately this product did not meet my expecations. Within one month of using it, the sound in one side stopped working. I was using the headphones with the wire they came with, so I figured maybe I damaged the wire by accident, so I bought a new wire. Unfortunately within 2 weeks of using the new wire, the sound again stopped working in one ear. At which point I realized the issue was not in the wire, but in the headphone. Really disappointed with this purchase, was hoping these would last longer.Update: The company sent me a replacement which I have been using for almost 2 months now. Everything was working well up till now. Unfortunately, the same issue is happening again, where the sound will stop working on one side/the sound will cut out. I tried using the headphone on my laptop and phone to make sure that it wasn't a device issue. But I found that regardless of what device I used the headphones with, the issue was still occuring. I appreciate the company for sending me a replacement, however, I wish that this defect is investigated and fixed so that I don't have to look into purchasing new headphones from elsewhere.

Thanks again!Bought these as a gift and they seems to like them but when I tried them on before I gifted them I found the sound to be muffled and not clear! Really dissapointed about that! They haven’t been used wirelessly yet but the wired part leaves a lot to be desired in terms of the sound. Still they’re built well, look very sleek and are pretty sturdy. We’ll see how well they hold up!",4.0 out of 5 stars,pretty great customer service

    ","I buy a lot from Amazon, and I enjoy most of my products and the savings I get, but rarely write a review because I'm fat and happy with it. However, I am amazed after several weeks with this product how well it serves my needs and gives a premium quality sound for the cheap throwaway price.Beats headphones and similar HD audio headphones may have a slightly clearer sound, but at $200 a pop versus $35 for 9.5/10 of equivalent experience, this is a much better buy, and the added features such as Controls on the headphones, and a microphone for phone calls, just adds even more value.Features:Comfort:The headphones are heavily padded as well the head piece. You can wear these for hours when uninterrupted.Wireless BT: They work perfectly with both my phone and computer. It is able to automatically connect with either immediately. So far the range has reached 35 feet (the end of my apartment) with no loss.Sound: It does contain surround sound. I am completely immersed in the audio, picking up quiet details I didn't receive from my monitor or TV. You will notice the Surround when gaming, footsteps for example tell you which direction sounds are emanating. I am able to blast my music/games and not disturb my girlfriend while she sleeps only a few feet away.Microphone: There is no directional stick on this set, but I am able to talk in a normal voice on phone calls without having to repeat myself.Controls: Very simple to program and use. It gives audio feedback when powering on/off or maxing internal volume. The start/stop and next/previous buttons are perfect for gaming while also listening to music. I can run media player in background and use custom soundtrack while playing a game.

One thing I wish they had included in the mold would be one or two bumps on the controls so it's much easier to adjust vol and take calls, the whole surface is smooth over multiple controls so you have to feel around for the small groove at the edge of the controls to know where you are.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall - good purchase.

    ","My least favorite thing about reading headphone reviews is when someone says they ""sound good for the price"".  What exactly does that mean? We primarily use headphones to play music.  Ideally, we want the music to sound like we are in the same room with the people making it.  Either headphones sound good or they do not.Some low cost headphones sound extremely clear and lifelike.  Others, sound like you're listening to music underwater, or in a room far away, or a tunnel, or with a wet towel wrapped around your head.  These headphones fall in the second category.  The music sounds muffled and flat.  Like you are listening to it trough a wall.  Have a few pair of in-ear Bluetooth headphones that sound at least twice as good as these.  Being larger, you'd expect them to have a lot more ability to make them sound better than earbuds.  Not the case here.  Besides the poor sound, they creak on your head and just feel cheap.Bottom line:  Unimpressive headphones all around.  Flat, muddy, muffled sound.  Cheap build quality.  Acceptable comfort and looks.  Unless they'll be used by kids or people who really don't care how their music sounds, I'd recommend saving a little more and getting better headphones.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Unimpressive sounding, low quality headphones"

No need to take them off and rest for any lengths. Given that they provide really good noise cancellation they do not raise the internal temperature around the ears for an uncomfortable experience. My only complaint is that I wish the buttons on the side of the headset worked on the PC.

    ","These headphones are very well made, very comfortable, sound quality excellent. However there is one glaring problem. The control is on the right earphone. It is very difficult to see the indicators such as up down right left. If you hold it just right and the light hits it you can figure out what the indicators are. But that would mean taking the headphones off to do even the simplest thing such as changing the volume.  The little booklet that came with the headphones is tiny. The print is barely readable with a magnifying glass. I went online to their website to find an online version of the instructions. I couldn't find that. But the website shows a different headset with a much more intuitive set of controls on off, volume increase and decrease. When you are wearing the headphones, it is very difficult to increase or decrease volume, or do other functions. Because the wheel that does everything has no tactile points to tell where you are. You are left to struggle with the tiny book with the tiny font. Too bad. If it weren't for this I would love these headphones. I want the one on their website.

    ","I bought these over-the-ear headphones, hoping they would be more comfortable than my existing on-ear headphones. Unfortunately, I was wrong. These headphones are SO uncomfortable that I couldn't even listen to a single CD without having to take them off. I thought that since the ear muffs surround the ear and don't press ON the ear, that this would be more comfortable than my other headphones, but, they are not. Also, the sound quality was quite poor. I turned off the bass on my boombox, but the sound still sounded rather muffled. Sadly, I will be going back to my old headphones that are on-ear, but do not surround the ear.

    ","Wanted a cheap headset to watch tv at night without disturbing the other half. Found these and looked okay. Impressed with the quality. These do not appear typical of cheapo Chinese goods. The assembly and finish is actually quite nice. They are comfortable to wear, at least for an hour or two. They seal up pretty well against my ears and the ear pads are very soft. If I continued use beyond two hours, I suspect my ears my become sore as other reviews have said.The sound quality is pretty good. They have some bass to them, more than enough for television. Didn't have much issue connecting to the Bluetooth transmitted which I also just bought. Took a couple minutes to get it worked out, and I had to go through the connection process again a few days later, but no biggie. The only thing I can complain about, and it's not really a fair complaint, is the squeaky smooth frame rubs against my pillow and echoes the sound through the headphones. So, I have to keep my head perfectly still if I don't want to hear the rubbing. Sorta sounds like when you rub your hand against a balloon...echoing in your ears.

    ","I just received these headphones. So I haven't had to much time with them. I can say so far they are pretty good, the material seems sturdy and ready for a long life. The padding is high quality and the sound is very good. They do not feel like a cheap pair of headphones.I brought these headphones for one specific reason. That is for my wife to use when she is watching TV at night while I am trying to sleep.We are cable cutters so I stream everything off of the amazon fire stick. I did a lot of reviews and asked a lot of questions about volume control independent of the headphones. I was told by others you can control the volume of the TV independent of the headphones. But this is not the case.Basically once you connect the headphones to the fire stick you loose volume control of the TV, you can only control the volume of the headphones. So if you are like us and watch TV together before going to bed but one of you wants to stay up late while the other sleeps than you will have to turn on the headphones and put them on.If you are hard of hearing and want to use these while watching TV with the family...tough luck you will be the only one with sound.(keep in mind I am only talking about the amazon fire stick with bluetooth connection, no the other optional methods)Connecting to the Amazon fire stick was very easy and straight forward.-You power on the headphones by holding the power button down for a few seconds and the headphones will tell you they are powered up-Than navigate to your bluetooth devices on the amazon fire stick and search for ""other devices"".-Push and hold the power button the headphones for 3 seconds, your headphones will tell you they are in pairing mode-You should see the headphones pop up on the fire stick, select what pops up.-and your done.The distances is pretty good. Our bed is about 15ft from the TV and they connect fine with no drop outs.A pleasant surprise is that you can control the video from the headphones. Not only can you adjust volume, but you can fast forward, rewind, play and pause the video! I wasn't expecting that.All in all I am happy with my purchase and would recommend.

    ","My first over the ear headphones. My third headphones from MPow. So far only had them a few hours, but really like them.ProsThis pair gives much better range in sound (bass, etc) than the earbud MPow models I've used. (Cheetah and Antelope) The build feels sturdy; I don't feel like they'll snap. Yet they're still quite lite.I've walked around my office with a lot of fluorescent lights, laptops, and metal, and gotten good range for Bluetooth.Right out of the box they had charge to pair and play. Charged them for a bit this morning, and they've been going strong for about an hour.ConsIt's hard to tell when you reach up to the controls what you're touching. It would be nice if there was a bump or something to give you a sense of what you were touching. Not worth dropping a star for.You do have to be careful placing them on your head to not put undue pressure, especially with glasses. That said, if I'm careful, I feel very little pressure, and no pinch points.Could use a little more bass, but it's good for Bluetooth on a budget.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great budget Bluetooth with good wireless and sound range

    ","I purchased these headphones a month ago to replace a pair of in ear headphones that broke and so far I'm happy with them. For the price, they are better than I expected. Sound quality is very good for both music and talk. So far, they work well for phone calls. They are comfortable on your ears but they are a little heavy so while they are good for short periods, they feel cumbersome on your head after a long period. They last long before needing to be charged. It was a little harder to get these to pair with my phone than my previous headphones and if you hold the button on the right hand side to power them off for too long, they'll start attempting to pair again. All minor inconveniences, but at less than $40, I don't expect perfection. They feel durable and I do believe I will get more than a year out of them which is more than I got out of my previous pair.

    ","11/9 update:Following the return of the second headphones and my review, Mpow sent a replacement and instructions for restoring to factor defaults. I have only had the replacement a couple weeks, but so far it is performing better for outdoor use than the two previous headphones. Indoor performance is decent, but not as good compared to the first set I bought. The headphones are more sensitive to interference from Wi-Fi and objects than I would prefer. For example, being near my laptop affects performance at times, causing momentary interruptions during page loads or downloads over Wi-Fi. In other situations not involving my laptop, performance may start fine but I hear more interruptions in playback over time. (I guess it could be interference from close neighbors networks or devices, but that's not something I would choose to spend much effort trying to avoid just for these headphones). Usually restoring solves the problems for a time. The improvement is enough that I have upgraded my rating from 2 to 3-3.5. I feel that if I had purchased this replacement I would feel comfortable keeping it, and it is nice to have responsive customer service.Original:I had to return two sets in the past couple months due to very poor bluetooth connection. The features and price seemed right for my purposes, so I wanted them to work. They looked fine, and the sound quality was okay. The cushions sat comfortably around my ears, not on ears, and there was no problem with my glasses. It was relatively easy to pair them to my phone and tablet, although I thought the controls were too hit or miss. I accidently powered off numerous times while pressing the button and trying to count the seconds and half seconds between options. I could leave my devices and walk around the house without dropping the connection. However, as soon as I got three or four steps from the house, with a device right on me, the connection turned horrible. Music would play for five seconds and cut out for two. The headphones would show up multiple times in the list of paired devices. I half suspected the headphones were trying to connect to other devices around the homes I passed by. Being a glutton for punishment and in disbelief about headphones that worked well indoors, I let this go on for 10 minutes or so. Then for no reason I could discern, they might play fine during the rest of my walk. I tried this a number of times, and the same thing happened every time. The wired connection is not an option for my phone and I really wanted something for outdoor use, so I could not keep the headphones. With the second set, they also worked great indoors. The connection problems outdoors were not as pronounced, though there were moments. What made me send those back was that the controls would stop responding at times - I could not repeat or advance tracks or stop playback at times. I never even got around to call handling with either set. I have to give these low marks for quality control.I just started wearing the Skullcandy Hesh2 headphones and don't have the problems with Bluetooth connection outdoors. I don't think the sound quality or comfort are any better than the Mpows for the money, but at least they work.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth problems...Updated

    ","*** UPDATE ***After posting the original review, and spending a couple of weeks sending feedback to the seller a couple of times they sent a new pair of headphones were shipped to me at no cost. It took about 10 days to arrive but I will try them out for a week and see how it goes.  But for now I can raise it from a 1 star to a 3 star review purely based on the customer service. They responded relatively quickly to my emails sent through amazon and that shows a dedication that makes them worth trying. Hopefully it was just a bad pair and everything will work out now.Further update pending. It's always good to know the product quality as well and perhaps more importantly the customer service quality. That is half of what you pay for with anything. Especially the blind purchase process of online shopping.***  ORIGINAL REVIEW ***Don't waste your money on these. The biggest problem seems to be the internal components on these headphones. The sound quality is adequate but missing a bit of bass in my opinion. They worked for the first 2-3 weeks just fine in bluetooth mode. Then  all of a sudden the bluetooth has become unreliable.I've only used these about 10 - 20 times when working out at the gym. Even when fully charged the headphones now disconnect nowand then they won't stay connected. My phone says they are fully charged but they seem to be turning themselves off. I then have to plug in the headphones jack. Really disappointed because there is no option to return it now after the first month.  Don't risk it. For $30+ this is not acceptable quality.  Bluetooth technology has been around long enough and battery tech has gotten so good that this should not be a problem. I think the internal components on these are just not under very stringent quality controls. I got a reply from the seller but they only want me to troubleshoot the problem which is a hassle via email.The problem is the bluetooth on these just doesn't work after a while. For average sound quality these are a very risky choice if you are reliing on them as bluetooth headsets like I do when I use them for working out at the gym where extra wires are just annoying.On the plus side. They are comfortable, very good at isolating sound and reducing the noise around you. The buttons on the side are not laid out in the most easy way to blindly raise volume and skip tracks.  Without a little ""braille"" style bump on things you find yourself fishing around for the right button to answer calls or adjust volume and often times you hit the wrong one. I could overlook the negatives if they would just be reliable as a bluetooth headset. Also the mic seems to work well. When I did get phone calls there were no complaints on the other end about the sound quality and not being able to hear me. Maybe they'll make a 2nd generation and they'll address the problems. At that point these will be worth the gamble... maybe.*** UPDATE 10/17/17 ***So within 2-4 weeks the replacement pair's a bluetooth wireless functionality became unreliable as well. I keep it as a 3star rating because when I contacted the seller they were very helpful and allowed me to return them. So the customer service makes these worth a try!  It could be my phone but all of my other bluetooth accessories seem to work just fine. Maye I just got 2 bad pairs.",3.0 out of 5 stars,UPDATED: Full review including a replacement pair.

    ","Probably my favorite headphones in a long time. I was skeptical in that I wasn't sure if I'd look like a tool at the gym with over-the-ear headphones. I was all over the little in-ear versions because I was adamant about sound and portability.  I'm over it.  These things look/feel like Beats headphones for a fraction of the cost.  In my opinion as you go above the $50-$80 range you get diminishing returns on sound quality.  Yes, these could sound better, but not enough that would push me into paying another $100.  They sound awesome (way better bass than ANY in-ear version, IMHO) stay on great, are sweatproof (so far) and the luxury of having the cord saves you from low battery moments or when exercise equipment is wired for sound.  TIP:  I put one of those Velcro wraps on the cord and have it attached to one side of the headphones (just in case I need it).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the $$$

    ","Extraordinarily good value...but the headphones suffer from one glaring problem and one potential safety issue.I really like the sound on these--mostly clear and crisp. There's some muddiness in the bass--other reviews mention this--but given the price, I don't expect a pair of Bose. I hear a clear separation of the different tones and I really enjoy the sound.The fit is good, maybe a little tight on my head. The right earpiece presses a bit against my ear and I need to reposition 'em off from time to time. (I may end up finding just the right way to hang them on my head. TIme'll tell.)I'm not used to the controls, located on the right earpiece. I wish the device had a little bump or ridge or something so I place my finger properly on the volume controls. If I miss, I end up turning the phones off. The headphones are very responsive to Bluetooth connection and they pair and connect easily.Here's my problem: there are voice prompts that announce each action you take. ""Power on."" ""Power off."" ""Your headphones are disconnected."" Etc. Problem is that the voice is loud and that's jarring and unpleasant. I sent an email to the company's customer service department and asked the question on what passes for a support page. Let's see if they respond and if I have any control of the prompts. If not, it's a complete buzzkill and I'll likely return these otherwise excellent headphones.The smaller concern, one that could be a bit of a hazard, is that where the headband separates from the earpieces in order to adjust the size of the headband, the plastic has a fairly sharp edge. Grab the thing just so, or in a hurry, or carelessly, and I believe that one could pick up a nice slice. Which I don't recommend.Well, if these were perfect, I'd give 'em 5 stars. If customer service responds and I can fix it, then I'll add a star.  I'm expecting a response, but if I don't hear back, I'll deduct two more stars.Overall, I heartily recommend these, as long as I can turn off the voice prompts.PS: The red color is just too too much for me.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound but one possible fatal flaw

    ",Great headphones. Highly recommend.Pros:-Excellent sound quality-Good battery life ( I wear mine to the gym 5 days a week and only need to charge it once a week. )-Easy to connect to phone via Bluetooth-Great price if your on a budget-Work even when covered in sweat ( again gym user)Cons-They are fairly big. If your looking for stealth or low profile look elsewhere ( compromise I'm willing to settle for because sound quality is so good)-LOUD. Which is great for the listener but not so much for the people around you. If you like to crank your tunes anyone within 10 feet of you will hear what you are listening to.- They do slide off my head a little when covered in sweat while I'm doing cardio. Fine while weight training but mobile with explosive movements.All in all I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely buy again.

    ","""Impressive sound quality"" as stated in the item description couldn't be farther from the truth. I have cheap ear buds that sound better than these headphones. Also, you know that deep bass you get with a high-quality stereo system? No? What about the bass you might get from an OK car stereo? Still no? One more try...you know the bass that little tiny speaker on your phone has? Yeah, that's the kind of bass you'll get with these headphones. None! The only reason I MIGHT not send these back is that they were only $34 and they might work well for listening to audio books while I clean my house. It would be disrespectful to any band you might listen to if you choose to listen to them on these headphones. Oh did I forget to mention the advertised 33-foot blue-tooth capability is not accurate? Try 20 feet. I'm not even going to try making a call to test the microphone because I would likely have to change the two-star rating to one and that just seems very negative.UPDATE:These are garbage and being returned.

    ","I've been using these only for about a week so these are just my initial impressions.Good:- The bluetooth synced with my Samsung s7 and my Windows 10 computer without any issues.- The headphones do a nice job of blocking out background noise. (They are not noise canceling, but the over ear design does a good job of blocking out sound.)- They seem solid and well made. The foam is nice and soft.- Can adjust volume using the buttons on the headphones rather than having to use the phone all the time.- You can plug them into your phone and keep listening even if you run out of battery for the bluetooth.- They fold up and fit in a nice little carry bag that it comes with for easy carrying.Not so good:- For me, these are not comfortable to use for more than about an hour or so. They squeeze your head and ears pretty tightly and after a while, it is too uncomfortable to wear. Despite the softness of the ear cups, my ears always start to hurt after wearing these for too long, so I still need to keep other headphones around to switch out. In all fairness, they do mention in the description that you should take them off every couple hours to give your ears time to rest. (For reference, I wear a size 7 3/8 inch fitted baseball hat. If you're a different size, they might be more comfortable for you.)- The sound is very bass heavy. Depending on the type of music you listen to, this may be a good thing. However, I listen to mostly audiobooks and podcasts and it does not sound great for this. The voices seem muffled and not sharp. This could likely be fixed by fiddling around with the EQ on my phone.- The sound quality is lower when streaming over bluetooth than when using the provided cable. I don't think this is a problem with the headphones themselves, just a fact of streaming the audio over bluetooth.Overall, for the price and considering the bluetooth works well, these are not too bad.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good headphones for the price

    ","I have had a decade long struggle finding headphones that don’t irritate my outer cartilage piercings and earbuds that stay in my ears and don’t irritate my inner cartilage piercings. After resigning to the fact that over the ear headphones will never be compact and not bulky, I decided to try a pair. These jumped out at me for the price and shear number of reviews that gave positive marks. I skimmed through the reviews and didn’t see any glaring cons, so I decided to give these a go.For the money I really do like these:- They sound great.- They are easy to use.- They are soft and comfortable on the head.- They do actually block out a fair bit of noise.- BIGGEST PLUS: They don’t irritate my piercings whatsoever. They cover my entire ear, industrial bar and all.In my review skimming I did miss two cons that I noticed right away:- Yeah, they block out noise, but damn do these leak noise like crazy. I had my boyfriend wear them and listen to music on medium volume. It sounded like I was standing outside of a concert venue. I could hear the song softer than if I was wearing the headphones, but it was clear as day. We were both surprised at how much these leaked noise.- Oh my god, the flashing blue light that indicates that it’s on. In normal lighting it’s totally fine. In a dark room I can see it flashing in my peripheral vision and it drove me absolutely crazy. Not only can I see it, but it’s really bright and shines through both the LED ring and some of the seams of the plastic on the whole right side speaker. I ended up painting over the LED ring with black nail polish to try and dim the light so I could at least not see it flashing in my peripheral view. If anyone is wondering, this solution worked pretty well. Not 100%, but improvement enough where I’m not as bothered.I would give these three stars because the cons are quite big for me, but they are just so comfortable and do sound quite nice that I have to give them a little more credit.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable but bright and noisy

    ","This pair of headphones is a great product for the price. They have decent sound, and decent build quality. The Bluetooth connectivity works very well, as it will go very far without disconnecting. They do not have too much bass, though, but this is to be expected from a $35 pair of headphones. I was pleasantly surprised at the build quality, and the color looks amazing. It has a very long battery life, and does not take too long to charge. Another upside is that they have a standard micro-usb port to charge them. My only other complaint is that the microphone is absolutely horrible, and it does not catch the sound very well. Even in a silent room, I have had people tell me on the phone that I sound like I am far away from the microphone. Even so, it still works OK. Overall, these headphones are a great value for the price, and I was pleasantly surprised when I got them.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great value!

Super comfortable. The soft leather around the ears never get gross and I forget they're on.3. Easy to pair, takes 2 seconds unless you use the Aux jack.4. Sound amazing. Loud, deep bass, real clear and cancel noise real well. I use them all the time on flights.5. Last forever. After 5 days of constant use and blasting music, FaceTime calls and movies, they finally died but charged up while I left them plugged in while I went to work.I was on the fence about headphones like these when the whole big heaphone craze struck a few years ago and couldn't talk myself into a pair.

    ","I have used these headphones for 10 days and can say that for under $40.00 dollars these are some very good full size Bluetooth headphones.The Good:No distortion on max volume - it’s definitely loud unless you’re very hard of hearing.  I can go into another room and it does not start losing connection until you get between 20 to 30 feet, so that is good.  Hi tones, mid ranges and low base are pretty good in my opinion.  Construction is very sturdy but if you don't treat it right you will break it.  Comfort is not bad and should fit just about anybody with a normal range size head and ears but if you do have very large ears it will be a tossup so then you will just have to try it out and if it doesn't work out send it back for a refund.  The battery life seem very good but I have not tested it till its drained completely - I charged it fully when I received it and have charged it once in the ten days that I have used it with about 2 hours a day usage.  I will not be using it for outside work since I personally think that it really is not designed for that but traveling, around the house, at the office and casual listing it would be ideal.  The headphones look really good to me but if you don't like the color red then you’re out of luck but I like it so no problem.  I have also used this headphone paired with my phone and it has a very good mic, the people I talked to said I was very clear and they were clear to me as well so that was a plus.  I have not tried it out for wired hook up but should have, then again my main purpose was Bluetooth only - I already have a nice wired headset.The Bad:Well there is not much really at this point (10 days) but for longevity - if it last then it will be a very good headphones and if it does stop working hopefully the warranty will be honored but at $40.00 dollars it might just be cheaper to buy a new one.  If I have anything to grip about would be that it is not totally silent on the outside after the volume is up half way, now don't get me wrong it's not really load but you can start to hear what is playing on the headphones if you are sitting close to the person wearing the headphones or if it is really quite where you’re at then people will slightly hear your music especially if you have the volume cranked up.  This does not really bother me but it might bother some people.I am really happy that I purchased these Bluetooth headphones and would recommend them for purchase.Will update if things change.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Mpow Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear

    ","Just received these today and honestly expected better, even at $33. The sound quality is not good. The highs are very static sounding. There isn't much bass either and even at the highest volume setting they do not get loud. I was optimistic after reading what seemed like many legit reviews, but these are a let down.Update: Someone reached out offering to replace these with another pair. The second gen version of these is unavailable, so they sent the MPOW H2 with equalizer. I can say the sound quality and overall performance is much better. It's what I originally expected. Seller earns back a couple of stars for good customer service.Update: After 2 months of very light use, the replacement headset has stopped working. They won’t take a charge at all. I don’t recommend that anyone waste money on this product regardless of how good the seller’s customer service is. I will be spending on a quality pair of name brand headphones after this experience.

    ","Ok, I like these bluetooth headphones for the price. I had no issues connecting them to the MPOW 2 in 1 receiver/transmitter so I could listen to my TV show and not disturb my husband. I did not get lag between picture and sound. They work for what I bought them for. Because they are not noise cancelling, I can hear the phone ring, or my husband calling for me. I have only one complaint, if you are binge watching TV and your ears are a bit larger than the 0.5 deep, 1.5 inch wide and 2.25 tall opening, you will experience some discomfort after an hour. My ears start out rubbing on the stitching. After an hour the cushioning was going flat (it does bounce back) and my ears started feeling the hard plastic edge the speakers are mounted to. To be fair I have a set of wireless Logitech G930's that I use for my computer for gaming, VOIP, and for music. At 1/3 of the price, I was not expecting anything to compare to those headphones for comfort and sound. But my Gaming headphones are not bluetooth and that is what I needed.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for price and my use

    ","These are decent headphones.  The build quality is quite nice.  Pairing wasn't too bad.  These ARE NOT noise cancelling, the title said they were but in the detailed description they stated that they are NOISE ISOLATING.  VERY different!  If the title didn't incorrectly state this, I would have given these 4 stars.  The headphones are comfortable and sturdy though.  I am not displeased with them but I am disappointed that they are not noise cancelling as they stated.  They have good audio range.  Highs and lows all sound good, nice and crisp.  Range was about 50' with my MSFT Surface.  Sometimes the play/pause button acts stupid with Spotify.  Not sure if it is the headphones or the laptop?  All in all, pretty good headphones but nothing spectacular.",3.0 out of 5 stars,NOT NOISE CANCELLING!  But good build quality!

    ","I'm very very very very surprised by the price and quality of this unit.  As a professional DJ for over 20 years I know a thing or two about headphones.  This purchase was not so much to plug to my mixer and play at a live gig but more for a my tv to watch at night without bothering my wife.  Let me start first with sound.  Not the best quality sound out there but for the price it's above average.  But, the best part about this unit is the quality and durability.  Most cheap headphones will have plastic extenders.  You slides those up and down few time and crack time to get a new one.  With that said I was impressed to see metal extenders and overall durability of the item.  I used this last night to pair to my Panasonic tv via bluetooth to watch a move and ya I love it.  I wouldn't have thought this would be anywhere near to the level it is.  I  highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressively Good !

    ","I’ve had these about two weeks. Sound is fine but Bluetooth connectivity sucks. Cuts out and disconnects constantly, with my iPad lying right next to me on the stand. Will probably be returning then next week. Currently using them with the included wire. Disappointing after reading all the good reviews.Edited 11/12/17: After my 2 star review and my returning this headset, I received and email from the Amazon Patagonia Store, saying they’d read my review and had sent me out a new headset. I’ve been using them now for nearly 2 weeks with no issues. They stay connected, not once disconnecting. They sound great and are comfortable to wear. Don’t be afraid to buy these. They seem like a great company. If you have a problem, they will take care of you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Revised to very happy with this headset!

    ",I probably wont ever understand why the rating for these is so high.  Thought I would give them a chance but after receiving I immediately knew these weren't going to be very good.  If you have a big head than these are not going to work for you.  The sound was down right awful even for the price.  Returned mine and would not recommendFollow up (05/25/17):  Patozon (MPOW) contacted me directly after I posted this review to appoligize for my bad experience with their headphones and wanted to make things better.  They offered me a different set of head phones (Mpow Muze Wireless) and asked if I would please give them a try.  I was very surprised by this great of customer service and decided that I would give them a try.  if you are looking for a better set of headphones you should try those instead (link below).  Overall these headphones weren't great but MPOW has great Customer Service and they have made things right by offering a different set of headphones that are more in line with what I was looking for.https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Wireless-Bluetooth-Stereo-Headphones/dp/B00O7Q4IBU,3.0 out of 5 stars,Dont understand why these have such a high rating

    ","REVISED REVIEWI initially posed the below review and gave the product two starts. However, after the seller reached out and I tweaked a few things with my use of the product, an updated review was warranted. Kudos to the seller for being responsive and addressing the issues I had quickly.After using the headphones a bit more, they are not bad for $37. The sound quality isn't what you might get in the $100+ range, but that is to be expected. I initially had some issues with the Bluetooth connection, but it appears to have been partially an issue on my end. I tried a new device and the connection is better, although still not perfect (occasional skip in the connection still noticeable).Same verdict for the unbalanced sound. This has been improved with using a different phone. However, there does still seem to be a slight difference in the sound coming from the right ear versus the left. This may be me being overly picky, but it does seem noticeable to me when using them.With these improvements, I would say they are not bad for the price. I'm still not sure they fit my needs. They are a bit larger than I anticipated (not the seller's fault by any means, just larger than I prefer for my intended use). I also realized I am looking for a bit better sound quality overall. Again, not something that is really the fault of the seller -- these are $37 Bluetooth headphones. But after listening to the nice pair of wired headphones I have again, I'm not sure these meet my expectations for their intended use.ORIGINAL REVIEWAfter using these a few times since they arrived I'm not a fan. The Bluetooth connection cuts in and out in a fairly regular basis. The right speaker is also noticeably louder than the left. Not sure if I received a defective unit or not.

    ","The only thing I liked about these headphones, unfortunately, was the black and red coloring and, that's it.These had to be the worst set of headphones I've ever darned my ears.  As far as sound quality well, there wasn't any.  A constant low bass feed back and, the severe lack of ability for the set to pick up speech clearly.As far as comfort, man!  I had to take them off within the first ten minutes and never wanted to retry them.  They were just kind of small around my ears and, they got uncomfortably warm, quickly!All the YouTube hipe  I saw prior to my purchase, those people HAD to have been paid off and or, associated with Mpow in some way.Sorry I couldn't have given a 4 or 5 star review.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to wear!!

    ","I'm not an audiophile who understands every nuance and detail of a speaker, so my perspective is one of a layman.  I bought these solely for mowing and trimming my acre-and-a-half yard (takes about 2 to 2.5 hours total).  These remain comfortable that entire time, and the battery will last for several mows.  The materials certainly don't feel like the most indestructible, I am content for the price.  Sweat doesn't seem to be an issue with these as the padding does a good job keeping it out of the ear/speaker.The only thing keeping me from giving them five stars is the lack of an actual on/off switch.  Turning it off is simply holding the play button down for a few moments and then releasing.  Unfortunately, this is also the way to pair a device.  I find that I turn them off on the first try about half of the time, with the other times waiting several moments for it to give up trying to pair.  It's annoying for me, but it may not be a concern for others.  Nonetheless, I'd buy these again without hesitation.",4.0 out of 5 stars,These remain comfortable that entire time

    ","New update:  the company has sent me a new set of headphones and this set is working very well.  The first set definitely had some sort of problem.  The only problem is that the headphones do hurt after wearing for awhile but it's still a very good value.  The headphones pair up very well with my bluetooth devices, everything is in sync, and the sound quality is phenomenal for this price point.  Very satisfied customer!Updated Review:  The customer service team has reached out to me and is sending me another set with no hassles.  This type of customer service is very rare these days.  Perhaps I received a defective unit.  Once I receive the new set of headphones, I will update my review.My main reason for purchasing these headphones was for the bluetooth function.  Well the bluetooth is worthless.  I've paired with two laptops and a mobile phone.  Each connection has been extremely choppy to the point where it's too annoying to even think about connecting with bluetooth.  Also the audio is delayed and is not in sync with the video.  The sound quality is about what you expect for $35 headphones.  I'm extremely disappointed.  If you plan on using this for the bluetooth, just know that I warned you.

    ","It's taken me this long to write a review because I was skeptical as to how in love with these headphones I was.They are short of perfect. Fit snug, which really enhances the great bass that these headphones have, and the battery charge lasts about 18 hours. I estimate this using the headphones daily including a gym session. Takes me 9 days on average before I need to charge them.Cons: Not much. The included aux cord could have a mic and control on it and if you want to wear a hood with these headphones it makes a large ring like something out of Star Wars. I tried the MPOW H4 thinking maybe they would be better... NOPE. Did not fit as snug and therefore had far less volume and bass.This is not just a bargain but an investment.

    ","I purchased these in May mainly to listen to music and TV without disturbing my spouse.  After 2 recharges they would no longer charge.i tried them again intermittently with no luck. The headphones were at that point past the warranty end date (I was traveling a lot and hadn't the desire to work on that particular problem just then). After posting a negative review I was contacted by the manufacturer who had already put a new pair of headphones in the mail to me.  I received them shortly after and have not had any problems charging this pair.  I have a larger head for a woman, and I find these comfortable even while wearing glasses.  I am happy with the sound quality while listening to music files of a higher bit rate as well as video sound.  Head phones cannot up the quality of thin audio so keep that in mind when critiquing. Cost does not equal sound quality in head phones.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and Customer Service

6829,"on July 26, 2017",,"Summary:The Good:-----------------+Long battery life+Look great!+Comfortable+Can be used as wired headphones+Fairly durable build+Easy to setup and use--------------------The Bad:----------------------Sound quality is not great. (yet not terrible)*Edit: pretty much 'louder music' like rock or metal, sounds TERRIBLE on these! my $20 bt headphones blow this out of the water.-Micro USB port feels a little flimsy-Charging while in wired mode makes a loud 'hissing'-Built in mic is worthless.-Foam ear pads cant be removed for cleaning.I really like the fact that these can be used wireless to save battery,The fact that if you use them (wired) while charging, produces a fairly noticeable hiss, is kinda annoying.But by far the most disappointment thing I found so far is the sound quality.It's by no means terrible, but I'd had $20 BT headphones that were half the size, and sounded twice as good.The overall sound is fairly flat. highs are a bit distorted, mids are okay, but lows sound fairly poor.This is my 4th pair of <$40 BT headphones, and the sound is probably the second worst.But again, they don't sound terrible. I'd consider it 'acceptable'.(Using your phones 'equalizer' can help a lot.  I was able to get much better  sound quality with a few seconds of tweaking.. But I'm reviewing these headphones on the default settings)Basically if you're not picky (AT ALL) about how your music sounds, or want to listen to audio books, these would be fine.And besides, they are very comfortable and convenient.As for the microphone, as the others said, it's almost completely unusable, you'd be much better off using speaker phone.It's fairly clear, but it EXTREMELY quiet, talking at normal volume sounds like whispers.---------Edit:-------------- I gave these a chance, and they are much worse than I though,I considered returning them and seeing if I just got a bad pair, but I've seen quite a few other reviews also mention issues with sound quality.I decided to listen to some other music styles, Louder music like classic rock, metal, and even some more modern rock sounds like TRASH on these headphones.I'm talking worse than some $20 bt heaphones I bought years ago, heck, even my $10 sony wired headphones sound MUCH better.Pop music sounds okay, and pretty much many other styles/songs that are mainly in the mid range. (still worse than most other $30 bt heaphones)But these were a huge disappointment.I'll be sending them back for a full refund monday.  I'm not playing the exchange lottery.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice headphones, comfortable, But the sound quality is by no means 'excellent' even for $30.."

    ","As with any headphones at entry pricing, one doesn't expect too much. But I decided on this pair because of the look and the price, and I will not hesitate to proclaim that it blew my expectations through the roof.The headphones feel very sturdy and look just like a pair of $300+ headphones. They feel comfortable on my ears, and only start to get uncomfortable on my ears after about four or so hours of use.The sound is very crisp, and it's a lovely experience. The bass is really good, and the highs and mods blend easily. As for volume, the phone can be at maximum volume, and you can still go louder if need be.The connecting experience is excellent. The last pair of headphones I bought required you to manually connect on your phone each time. These automatically connect after the first initial connection so long as you have bluetooth turned on on your phone. And it's so smooth and simple.As for any other attributes, the battery life is very good compared to a quick charge time, the amount of outside noise that it cancels out is very good (super loud noises will still get through), and all in all it's just a great headset and worth the buy.I'll be sure to update the review as I continue to use it as I've only had it for a few weeks now. If you do decide to buy, I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Headphones for a Great Price

    ","I bought these for three reasons:  1) price; 2) noise cancellation;  and 3) Bluetooth.  The product delivers on all three, but getting Bluetooth to work was difficult because the first set of headphones I was sent was defective (I think the problem was that it would not take a charge). With replacement headphones, I have since been able to get Bluetooth to work consistently, on several devices.  I did not give the product 5 stars because it lacks an indication of its level of charge. Also, the most aggravating aspect of the product is that there is no easy way to contact Tech Support.  Having said this, Mpow's Tech Support does read Amazon reviews and if there is a problem you will hear from them straight away.

    ","After dealing with a $150+ pair of headphones lasting 11.5 months and then their replacement lasting three and running out the warranty, I decided to fully embrace the era of disposable hardware and get the Mpow M3.Sound is better than I expected, though possibly too bassy for some kinds of music. I'm still not a huge fan of the style—especially the glossy plastic on the outside—but that's not a killer either. Bluetooth has been really good, supporting multipoint with my iPhone 6s Plus and my MacBook Pro with no issues. The controls are a bit awkward (particularly how the volume on the right cup doesn't control the phone volume, but a secondary range of headphone volume), but usable.All-in-all, though, for thirty-five bucks, and carrying an 18-month warranty? These feel like a steal. We'll see how long they last, but even if I had to buy a pair every year, I think I'd be happy.UPDATE: That secondary volume? Actually comes in really handy with my Samsung TV, which has no volume adjustment when in Bluetooth mode.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for the price

Mostly I use them with the JETech 2-in-1 Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Audio Receiver and Transmitter with 3.5mm Jack to watch TV/listen to music from TV.Here are the steps I take:1. Turn TV on.2. Hold down on/off until I hear ""Power On.""3. Hold down on/off button on the little JETech receiver/transmitter until flashing red light turns to solid blue.4. Plug JETech receiver/transmitter into headphone jack on my TV Roku remote. Wait a few seconds. Done! Start watching and listening! Yay!NOTE: The above steps are AFTER the first and only time you set up the pairing between the devices. Once paired, you never have to re-set again. Headphones and JETech ""remembers"" each device from then on.These headphones give me reception anywhere in my 750+ square-ft apartment and still hear anything I'm playing! The only ""con"" I can think of is that there is about a 2% ""feedback"" or ""buzzing"" only when the audio on the program playing pauses, such as when people stop speaking in the show. But, this is so negligible, that I debated whether to even mention it in this review, thus the product still deserves my five stars, in my opinion.I use these many hours a day, and they hold at least a 10 hour charge-amazing!

    ","I got these headphones for work. My computer's headphone jack is broken and fries any wired headphones I plug into it, so I thought I'd try a pair of wireless headphones. I guess I just got the wrong ones. These are so uncomfortable.I need to wear them all day at work and couldn't last half an hour before I had to take them off. They put too much pressure on my ears and gave me a massive headache. Maybe I've just got too big of a head for these. I'm not a fan.The sound quality wasn't great either.

    ","Update:  at the fourth time of using these headphones, they crapped out entirely.  Would not pair, although they had been paired and were working fine. All they would do is rapidly flash lights, and the operation was wildly inconsistent- at times I couldn't even make them power off.These are comfortable, the sound is very good, and there was no problem pairing them- I bought these and am using them exclusively to watch tv, and the sound quality and clarity is very good; I am amazed and at how much I never heard in terms of background sounds, and I now hear dialogue that I totally missed before.  However, there is one feature that is truly annoying, and this probably only matters if these are used to watch tv in a dark room: every two seconds a bright blue light flashes on the control side of the headset, and I can see it in my peripheral vision.  And by bright, I mean it took 6 layers of blue paper painters tape to cover the light so I couldn't see it.  I think these are a great value for the price, if you don't mind having to tape over the bright blue light (if that's even an issue); but for this one drawback, these headphones would get five stars from me.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Update:  total failure.

7870,"on May 1, 2017",,"When I initially received my order, I noticed the ear space seemed smaller than what was pictured on the site and thought perhaps I was sent the wrong item. I do think the photo is kind of misleading because, in person, the ear space doesn’t look that large. They did end up fitting over my ears but quite snuggly. Luckily, I have small ears but for anyone who has larger ears or a bigger head, these might be uncomfortable. The headphones are quite tight around my head and start to hurt after a while wearing them. I can’t wear them with earrings or my glasses because they literally only have JUST enough space for your ears.They are convenient and pair quickly with a Mac. If you step out of range of the bluetooth, whatever is playing on your device will disconnect and play out loud so beware of that.The play/pause and volume controls are a little hard to differentiate immediately because they are so close together and feel the same. I wish there was a bump or something so I can know which button I’m pressing. More color options would be nice but I do the like red.Overall, they are a pretty good product for the price but the tightness/ear space is too small and uncomfortable.Mpow Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear, Hi-Fi Stereo Wireless Headset, Foldable, Soft Memory-Protein Earmuffs, w/ Built-in Mic and Wired Mode for PC/ Cell Phones/ TV",4.0 out of 5 stars,Let’s hope you have small ears and don’t wear glasses

They work and sound good. They were super easy to set up for my iPod. They are comfortable enough (when wearing glasses I have had to adjust them from time to time...I fault the the thin eyeglass temple more than the headset for this). I wear a size 7 3/4 hat (mule head 😝) and these fit with no problem. About 30' is the range before you loose the signal for Bluetooth.

The controls on the right earpiece work well...skipping songs and such.

    ","So far I have no complaints other than the fact that they were a little larger than my previous set of bluetooth headphones. I had two pairs of Jam headphones that were smaller and more lightweight, and had great sound, but they had problems with reliability. After one year or so of using the Jam headphones, one pair had a wire that was intermittent and I could only hear sound out of the right side, On the other pair, the charging port basically went bad, so I couldn't charge them anymore, so it was time to switch brands.These Mpow bluetooth headphones are very comfortable and cover my ears completely. They also seem to be better quality as far as construction, but the sound quality is not as good as the Jams...but good enough for my use. These Mpow headphones are not noise cancelling headphones, but I did not want noise cancelling headphones, because I want to be able to hear someone if they are trying to get my attention. They do shut out quite a bit of outside sound though, compared to the Jam headphones. So I guess it's a matter of preference. I just hope these Mpows hold up longer than the Jam headphones did. For the price though, I guess if these go bad, it wouldn't break my bank account to get another pair. So far, I am very pleased!",5.0 out of 5 stars,I like them!

    ","Really solid headphones. The sound quality for calls is excellent, the mic is very good. Sound quality for music is also very good with strong bass. I just tried out some random odd stuff to see how it sounded (Zefside rap, Brass House, Emo Alternative, Some Liquid DnB, 70's prog rock, Parody Metal, and Japanese hard rock. Ya know, the usual) and everything sounded fantastic.Oddly the best feature for me has been the coverage.

    ","I've had these headphones for about three weeks now and I love them! Today was my first time to take them outside of the house (I mostly use them for laying on the couch and listening to music) and they worked just fine on the 20 minute walk to work. My ears did get a bit sweaty but that's any over the ear headphones I've ever used. I especially like that the ear cups(?) are soft and squishy, without the price tag that usually accompany that feature. No problems pairing once I read the instructions, I love that they fold up, and the little bag is nice but I honestly never use it.

8478,"on September 11, 2017",,"UPDATE 10/19: I noticed a small crack running across the headband a few weeks ago.  They still fit & seem to be holding up physically... However, they no longer charge.  I plug them in, the amber charging light comes on, but they just get hot.  They won't turn on anymore.  They were quite cheap, so I'm not terribly disappointed.  I had hoped to get at least 6 months of use out of them, though.The battery does indeed last for friggin ever, as others have noted. I definitely have to charge my phone more than my headphones.The sound quality is pretty much fine. You won't be blown away, but neither will you miss out your favorite parts of your favorite songs. It's a little lighter on the bass than I would prefer, but all told the sound is quite alright.Durability seems fine. I've never been particularly gentle with my things...I'm just clumsy. The hinges show no signs of wear, two months into daily use, and the fit is still the same. (They are on the snug/average size for bighead me. Larger heads might not be comfortable.)The headphones do indeed have a microphone, but it's not as sensitive as needed. I sometimes have to cup my hand between my mouth & the side of the headphones with the mic hole. It's not the end of the world, however. I only use them for calls occasionally.I take off one star because of the mic, and became I haven't yet been able to get them into ""listening"" mode, so that I can give voice commands.

    ",I've been looking for some wireless bluetooth headphones and after seeing the reviews on this product I had high hopes that these would be exactly what I'm looking for in terms of price/quality. Unfortunately it was too good to be true and the headphones arrived defective. The left ear piece produced no sound and there is a little jingling noise inside it like something loose is bouncing around. This has been a major disappointment and I've already submitted a request for a refund.[UPDATE] 6/9/2017I have been sent a replacement pair of headphones at no extra cost. This new pair works great and is everything I was hoping to get with my original purchase. The customer service is excellent and the product is great.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great price + great reviews?

The sound quality is good. The fit was solid. Mainly, I just didn't like the feel over time. They made my ears sweat, so long term use was out of the question.The only real knock I had on them is that they weren't usable with my macbook for conference calls. The mic just wasn't loud enough to work with the meetings I had. For music, they're great over short times. I'm sure others will be quite pleased with them. I have several Mpow products and this is a good one, just not for me.edit: Patozon reached out afterward and sent me an updated model (H2) that does have an improved phone mic. I bumped it to 4 stars because of this. The style is still not for me, but that's my taste, not a reflection of the quality of the product.

    ","The built-in microphone barely picks up any sound at all.  The sound quality over bluetooth has tons of static.  The earpieces are very small.

They may ease up a bit with use, but I'll never know since they are being returned immediately.I have to wonder if any of these reviews are real or if they were astroturfed by the manufacturer.

    ","Device functions fine for listening via 3.5mm and bluetooth, however the microphone is where the downfall is. It is recognized, but doesnt work. Tried it on a laptop with bluetooth, obviously sound works. Tried using it with sound recorder and I am not getting feedback. Voice settings were not muted at all.Glad I tried it out before I wasnt able to return it.Bass is decent.MPOW did send me out another headset the Thor. I find it more comfortable than these ones and the mic works wonderfully. It does seem a little lighter and cheap, but weight doesnt mean that it would work well.

I have had some expensive brands and never had this problem, not until they were close to being done forever. Out the box i got skips and cut outs. I went to them gym and got so mad bc these won't do the job. I was close to getting the MPOW smaller ones, the ones that look like the powerbeats- but now im so mad in writing this review before I got my post workout shower. Dont get these, spend the extra $ for the real deal. I did some good research before buying and these were top rated by Amazon, for what reason I dont know. I just had my beats go out on me after many years and wanted to try a cheaper alternative. Well I paid the cost here, now I got to dig in my dumpster for the box to mail these back. I will not recommend this brand nor endorse them at all.3/7/18 UPDATE : I did get a updated replacement pair from the vendor.

    ","I've had this for just over a week after losing a pair of bluetooth Sony on-ear headphones and having my in-ear earbuds fail on me. It looked great when I first opened the box. Construction feels solid (although I do worry about the durability of the hinge - where the cups bend, since that area does feel shaky). Connection to both my phone and laptop was easy and this device is truly multipoint. The sound quality was decent. Better than you would expect at this price point, but not quite up there with the best. But I'm a college student who's simply looking for some music while he's studying. In terms of comfort, this was solid. It's heavier than some of the headsets I've had in the past, but not by much. The padding on the cups and the top definitely feels nice. The only problem was that if I sweat, it accumulates around my ears, which can feel irritating, but that's not specific to this headphone. The battery life is also excellent. I use these often throughout the day with at around 8 hours being through the bluetooth feature and the battery has yet to run out. One thing to note, however, is that using a cord with these will disable the microphone feature, which can be an issue if you use that often, but it was not a big deal for me.So why only 3 stars? Well, although the headset is able to connect perfectly with my devices, it struggles to maintain a clear connection. More specifically, for example, there are many times when I put my phone into my jean pocket and the music would constantly cut off. It happens enough that it becomes frustrating. I would connect the headphone to my phone with ease and start playing music with no problems, but then I put my phone in my pocket, and it starts cutting off the music for 1-2 second periods. This doesn't happen on most of my past bluetooth headsets and the one it did wasn't nearly as bad. It's really the only glaring flaw of this headset. I think bluetooth headphones should be able  to maintain clear connections through a layer of clothing such as jeans. Maybe I have a defective one? I don't know.So in all, I would say these are a very decent pair of headphones from sound to battery, but there's something off about their connectivity. Would I recommend this? Probably, since I'm assuming mine might be defective. If you tend to hold your phone, use it only as wired headphones (wire provided),  or have it in such a way that there are absolutely 0 barriers between it and your device, then these are as good a bluetooth headphone as you will get for the price, but otherwise, it might be a good idea to check out some other alternatives.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent headphones - needs a more consistent connection

9799,"on May 5, 2017",,I just got these last week and i must say these look like really nice headphones. I got the red and black and right away i took notice to the glossy exterior which is beautiful. I also like the soft case it comes with to store my headphones and the wires to charge and use for non bluetooth connection. I do wish it came with a adapter to plug the wire to charge the headset with but luckily i have my samsung adapter so it ok for me. I charged them and i took about about 2-3 hours for the first full charge. I then tried to pair them to my samsung galaxy s7 and they paired with no issues. The fit pretty well for me but yes if you do have a big head it would think it would be a little snug and tight. Im actually listening to music as i right this review and i must say the sound is pretty awesome. Ive also used them at work and they do have some noise cancellation in them because i could barely hear a thing with these headphones on and i didnt have them loud at all. Now its been about a week and im sure the charge on these has lasted at least 10+ hours nonstop but overall so far these are worth the price and i wasnt expecting such great quality for $30 headphones. Money well spent :),5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice wire/wireless headphones

9842,"on November 30, 2017",,"love it! as someone who has never owned bluetooth headphones or earbuds, i've always found the cable quite irritating when i want to remove myself from my devices and get up and do something else, but still listen to music.  i can walk downstairs to my kitchen and grab a snack from the fridge and walk back upstairs without having the audio interrupted at all, which is amazing. I did hear the audio speed up slightly one time, but i turned it off and on and everything was fine. the pairing is just almost instantaneous and it's so easy to use + has such a long battery life! i feel like i can go a week without charging it, i charge it every night but that seems to be too much even if i use it for like 3 hours of listening to music. i also forgot to turn it off a few times when i fell asleep and woke up and the battery percentage on my phone still read near full battery. only complaint is that wearing earrings/piercings will hurt if you wear these over your ears, so take them off first, but that's obvious. i haven't taken these to the gym yet, but they're quite secure on my ears and probably would not fall off (although, since they are over-ear, they are quite large and bulky and would probably not be advised to bring while you're bouncing up and down on a treadmill). of course, these are not active noise-canceling, so they cannot drown out all the sound around you, but it still works great. after a while, your ears do hurt, but the seller even sent me an email reminding me how the headphones worked and to take them off after an hour or two to give your ears a break. i'd suggest buying earbuds along with this if you're not into that/want a lighter load when walking around outside your home.",5.0 out of 5 stars,in love! really great if you've been annoyed by cables all your life and frequently fall asleep without turning off your devices

    ","I was looking for an entry level bluetooth headphone for studying and going to the gym. I was using the sony MDR-7506 but was afraid that it would sooner or later break due to it being in my backpack and from all the books and stuff that goes in it. On top of that the SONY MR-7506 is not portable! It's absolutely huge!These MPOW Bluetooth headphones were perfect for me, for $40 you get comfortability, Bluetooth, and durable quality. I was impressed about the audio sound, didn't expect to much for such a cheap price! if you're trying to compare them to beats, it doesn't have as much base as the wireless beats, but it is on par when the aux cord is used. These are perfect for small ears, snugs right around em. I was also looking at another product from MPOW called MUZE, it's on their website but decided to go with these because of the price!No regrets, it's working fine and had no problems yet!  **Had them since 03/15/17MPOW HOOK ME UP WITH THE MPOW MUZE I would love to try them!",5.0 out of 5 stars,These MPOW Bluetooth headphones were perfect for me

10200,"on October 12, 2017",,"I received these headphone on 10/9/17 and today is 10/12/17 so I haven’t had them long to do a full review, but based on the reviews I read before my purchase they are worth all 5 stars. I charged them on the first day for a couple hours just to make sure the battery was full and I’ve used them everyday since without having to recharge. The sound is great so far. I can turn the volume all the way up on my phone then turn the volume up some more with the volume on the headphones. Pairing was really easy and it takes hardly any time to connect to my phone upon powering up. They are very comfortable and light weight, but people with bigger ears may not feel the same about the comfort; my ears are small/medium. I found that talking on the phone was seamless, I had no trouble hearing or with connectivity. I’m not sure what people are looking for when the topic of noise cancelling comes up, but I wore mine while cutting grass and I could hear the music just fine. If I just had to make a complaint of some sort... the material seems cheap and my ears get warm, but I’d imagine that being normal with something covering ears. However, this is the best 30 bucks I’ve spent in a while and I’d definitely refer these to a friend or family member not wanting to spend all that money on those other brands.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds good to me!

My only gripe is the volume and pairing buttons on the side of the headset, when you click them up and down they are VERY loud inside the unit. This is not really a issue to me personally.

Its a nice and newer tv that's the only thing I can think of. Also the company did reach out to me and had excellent customer service so I'm changing my rating because they do work with my one tv.Initial review: Unfortunately, while this does connect fine to my amazon fire stick so I can watch tv in my bedroom, the audio cuts in and out and my tv is maybe 12 feet away. I tested it the same evening by switching to watching the same thing on my phone and audio was fine. I am giving it one star because that is what I needed these for. I have worn them to workout and they were fine for the price but the buttons are definitely the biggest drawback, as I read in another review they feel cheap and there's no raised feature so you can feel what you're trying to control. The sound is fine. Bass is nothing like beats but for the price it's fine. I'll be giving these to my daughter who doesn't need them to watch tv so should be ok.",4.0 out of 5 stars,wifi distance is lacking and control buttons are cheap

    ","DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES IF YOU LIKE QUALITY SOUND IN MUSIC. I REPEAT.DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES IF YOU LIKE QUALITY SOUND IN MUSIC.CONS-First of all, if you don't know what ""EQ's"" are, then you don't know the elements of sound and what to even listen for in music to determine if it is high quality or not. I ordered this item because I saw it had wonderful reviews. I was really skeptical because the reviews made these headphones seem like they were award-winning or some shit.-Everything about this headphone soundwise is completely off. The bass is overpowering. The vocals are compressed under the instrumentals. The treble is weak. Everything is off.-The volume is significantly lower when you Bluetooth compared to when you're using a wire.-I knew that good sound was not guaranteed since they were cheap, but Jesus Christ these were terrible. The other headphones I bought for around the same price (Ailihen) were way better.PROS-They look really nice.-They were very comfortable.",1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES IF YOU LIKE QUALITY SOUND IN MUSIC

    ","I've had these for only about a week so far, so I can't speak to the durability or longevity of the product, but my first impressions of this are very high. For under $50 with bluetooth and being a lower tier brand, I was seriously expecting basic functionality with low to mid quality sound.I'm seriously impressed by the sound of these things. To put it bluntly: these are the best headphones I've ever had for under $100. Music sounds amazing on these. I put Spotify on (with high quality playback enabled) and took a tour through various styles including classical music, blues, jazz, and classic rock. I felt like I'd never listened to music before in my life. I felt like was transported to another place where I was standing in the middle of the band while they played all around me. I was surrounded by the music, with the various parts coming from different directions. Each instrument/vocal part could be individually distinguished from the others and sounded great. I heard things I'd never heard before from these songs. What you hear on the radio is just the tip of the iceberg for what is in these songs. I could hear background vocals, multiple different rhythm parts, the bass line, the violas and cellos distinct from the violins (in the classical music). It was incredible.The only other thing to say would be that they handled the full range of notes very well. From low basses to high notes I did not notice any points where they gave out. The basses sounded full and defined without just turning into a low growl, and the highs were clear without becoming tinny. And I didn't notice a difference in quality between being plugged in vs on Bluetooth. If anything, bluetooth may have performed better, but I'm not sure.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceeded my expectations: Great for Music

10724,"on January 6, 2018",, I really like them . I bought them for my man. I will update my review after a while of using them. The reason I put three stars is because my man charged them when he first got them. He said he used them for maybe an hr and they were dead.  I got home and put them back in the charger and we left for about an hr and the red light went off indicating they were fully charged. So right now as I type I'm listening to them to see how long the battery lasts. If they last like they're suppose to then I will change the review to 5 stars. Now for the price I really like them so far(even more if the battery lasts). The sound quality is actually better than I expected. Really loud and the base is actually pretty good. I called my man with then and over the phone surprisingly the mic sounds really good. On the phone end it didn't sound too bad either(sounds just like talking on wired headphone with a mic) Over all so far I love them. My man likes them as well. I do plan on ordering another pair for myself. Just hoping the battery actually lasts like it's suppose to.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is great but man says battery(music play)didnt even last an hour.

10811,"on September 20, 2017",,"love these headphones !I ordered a different type prior to these (wireless earbuds) but unfortunately they kept falling out of my ears even though they were highly rated. They also kept cutting out. So after 2 days I returned those and bought these Mpow.While these are bulkier, they are WAY better. Obviously, they do not fall out of my ears (or feel like they're going to fall out)  and the sound quality is MUCH better. They did, however, cut out a slightly during the last minute or so of my walk to the gym but once I got inside, it was fine. Walking back was also fine so i'm not sure why the connection wasn't good before. Maybe some sort of interference ?They are also pretty good at blocking out noises in my gym and they fit comfortably, for the most part, on my ears for the duration of my workout (no longer than 2 hrs).These are also good for running - no sliding around or having to readjust anything.would def recommend this product if you are looking for inexpensive wireless headphones",4.0 out of 5 stars,love these headphones

    ","I actually don't know where some of the praise comes from when other reviewers are comparing this headset with more high end headset because this headset sound quality doesn't even come close to my sony headset my dog, unfortunately, chewed up. I'm a VERY heavy music listener and I listen via Bluetooth. I don't know if its the bluetooth that the sound is coming in slightly muffled, and with 40% quality compared to my 5 year old sony headset, since I use the Amazon fire that they dumbed down the auxiliary port on where everything you plug in is muffled regardless of how expensive your headset is, so I can't see if its just the bluetooth that has the sound issues or just the headset in general. I'm going with the latter.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality doesn't compare to high end headset

Also, the bass frequencies are horribly distorted (for my taste) even at low volume levels. I guess you definitely get what you pay for. I'll be spending more money to get better fidelity and connection.Otherwise pairing was easy with Android, and if you don't care about sound quality, or use them for voice only, they may be worth it to you for the price.

    ","I was very disappointed with my experience with these headphones. I bought these headphones along with Mpow Bluetooth 4.1 Receiver & Transmitter to use on my TV in the hopes that I would reduce any pairing issues.I tried repeatedly to pair the two compatible devices several times and they would not pair even though it would indicate finding a device. I figured that I was doing something wrong even though the pairing is extremely straight-forward. I attempted to pair to my Computer & Cellphones hoping that I could rule out pairing issues and chalk it up to user error. Both my phones & computer was able to see the device, but when I would click to pair it would fail repeatedly. This is not rocket science and it should not have been this difficult in my opinion. I am assuming that it may be that the headphones were defective somehow and will attempt to exchange them for another and give it a second chance. I can't say much in the way of the transmitter as I was not able to fully use it, but I will exchange it as well just to be safe.That was my experience and not necessarily a Con, until I get the replacements and will update then.As for the Pro; These headphones are very comfortable and even while off they do a good job of reducing exterior noise with a good seal. They are very adjustable and my 10y.o. daughter & I both found them very comfortable & adjustable.UPDATE REVIEW 3/28/18I was contacted by Patozan about my poor rating review and I was issued a replacement. First of all I have to say that Patozan initiated the contact to address my poor findings and I applaud them for such professionalism, this is almost unheard of.I received my replacement headphones and immediately put them to charge to use them that very same day. I will admit that I was extremely surprised and how well they sounded. They have a great sound range and do very well Right to Left (Stereo or Staging) during usage. I opted to use Avantree transmitter https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077MXFJGQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 instead of MPow transmitter (apparently no link available) and used the Digital Optical connection for best signal & sound results. The pairing of Avantree with thee headphones is total harmony and went without a hitch. I have not yet attempted to make additional connections as this is not their intended use, but plan on doing so soon and will make an update should it warrant it.Pros, easy to pair, sounds great, very good stereo/sound stagingPlease read Cons carefully. . . . .Cons are personal to me and don't necessarily reflect on the headphone; I find that the earphone cup is slightly small for my ears, but I do have ears on the slightly large side, the headphones also press against my head and cause me some discomfort, but I'm a chronic migraine sufferer and I'm somewhat sensitive to having things pressed to my head (I don't wear hats/caps due to this).Side note, I get an interruption for a second on occasion and I can't say whether it is the headphones or the transmitter or if this is simply an expected attribute for using this method to hear.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unable to pair, replacing them with update to come.

    ","They work just fine and are great for the price. They don't have some of the features that higher end headphones have like a strong bass boost or different sound options, but they work great! Easy to use and metal joint construction (as opposed to cheap plastic which breaks on other headsets) which is the most important feature for me and I didn't even know these had that when I ordered, so I am pleasantly surprised! NOTE: If using windows 10 I would recommend NOT using the CSR Harmony disc at all included with these. Windows 10 will keep the video and audio in sync when there is lag but the CSR Harmony drivers will not. They get out of sync when bluetooth experiences lag so do NOT install anything from the disc (disc comes in the package) and you will be very happy with these!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Headphones at a Great Price.

They apparently stand behind their product.  The new set sounds much better and I can give them a five star now, both because they are great and because the company clearly wants to do what is right.  Thanks!!!Product is just OK.  The fit is nice, I like the padding at the top.  The sound is good but sounds muffled, which is why I gave it three stars.  I can't explain why it has a strange muffled sound but it is noticeable when listening to music.  For the price however, its still a good deal, especially if you are using it for audio books or something that doesn't require perfect sound.I have been wearing the headphones while mowing my grass and find the noise canceling good.  I have to keep the volume up a little bit but not much higher than when listening on my couch.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product and the company stands behind them!

    ","Don't expect its bluetooth compatible with Mac or iPad. I tried it numerous times to pair it with my Mac via bluetooth. I even followed their instructions, but it just does not work. Their technical support feedbacks are also extremely slow, i.e. response given after a week and not helpful in remedying your technical problems. The specs also promote its ability to pair with 2 devices simultaneously. It really does, but say if I play a youtube video on phone A and a soundtrack on phone B, it can only play either thing at one time. When you turn the electronic gadget's bluetooth off and then on again, you need to manually turn off the headphone in order to pair them up, it cannot automatically reconnect to the gadget itself. As per the specs, it is for sports use, but the wet cushion will create discomfort and dermal irritability probably after doing sports. The quality of sound is acceptable, at least it will not be some mp3 quality. If one treats this for leisure  use, this is acceptable. However, if you expect this to be comparable with Beats, I recommend you to purchase Beats straight.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't expect too much, you will be upset, I guarantee"

Drowning out the noises in my household is vital to my concentration. Well, due to the hurricane I had to wait almost two weeks to receive them. This was really upsetting. I ended up ordering another pair from Sony, so when these arrived much later, I ended up just giving them to my husband. He likes them a lot. He's been using them to connect to his PS4 controller, and now I don't complain about the volume being too loud. The price is decent and much less than the ones that I ended up getting, so they are a great buy.",4.0 out of 5 stars,I was excited to receive it because I wanted some nice earphones for when I'm writing

    ","Pros:Very nice, high-quality headphones. The sound quality is great. They work great for talking on the phone, no one that I spoke with noticed I was using the headphones, and some stated that I sounded more clear than usual. The battery life is exceptional. I got the headphones Friday when I got home from work and I haven't had to charge them this entire week (its Friday 7 days later now). I also used the headphones extensively to and from work (hour drive each way) and some when at home. It's very convenient to be able to answer the call by just pressing the button on the right headphone without having to look at your phone. Also you can skip to the next song or previous song with buttons on the side. They even come with a 3.5mm jack so you can use them that way without draining battery as well.Cons:This isn't really a con, but it is worth noting that if you are buying these for gaming on a PC, they need to be plugged in to work properly due to Bluetooth limitations. For example, while using Bluetooth the headphones can't use the mic and have stereo sound at the same time. If you're using the mic on PC, it will automatically switch to mono, which severely reduces sound quality.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"High-Quality Headphones, Great Price"

(call apple if you don't know how to get it). using the apple 10 band graphic equalizer i get the fat deepness and high percussion in a vast wide open musical image/as the music intended. i bought them with the blue tooth transmitter #BTADP-128 but i use that for ear buds for tv viewing. these headphones are the best thing i bought from amazon since i bought the AGPtEK HD 1080p video capture device w'remote.  when properly installed the device would capture hi def programs which could then be plugged into the computer using USB and watched with these superior headphones. can you tell i used to sell electronics?",5.0 out of 5 stars,ear buds cannot create this quality of sound

I have used these for conference calls at work and nobody has ever told me that my audio was poor quality and a few people I asked said the audio quality was great. When I use these to listen to audiobooks and podcasts on outdoor walks, I can hear remarkably well without having to put the volume high at all, even if I'm on a busy road with loud cars. On the same roads, I was not able to hear at all when I used ear buds or another Bluetooth device that goes in one ear only.Incredibly convenient having bluetooth. I can put my phone down in my apartment and listen to audio with these in most parts of my apartment without having to haul my phone around with me. Great for listening to audio when cooking because they are obviously cordless, especially when I cannot blast audio because my partner is studying nearby. Also, if she is listening to an audio lecture outloud practically right next to me, I can listen to my own audio without hearing her audio because these headphones effectively block external noise (even though they're not full noise-cancelling headphones).For those of us who like to listen to audiobooks and podcasts and many different situations, these are truly life changers!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing headphones - wonderful audio quality

    ","UPDATE: Now they blame there problem of sending me the wrong headphones on me!  If you are smart run away now. Junk headphones, junk service.NEWEST-Promised replacement- 20 days later I reminded them. Excuses was ""none in stock"" but now they sent them.  Arrived 2days ago and...WRONG HEADPHONES!  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICEPros: Look niceCons: Everything else.1st these ARE NOT OVER THE EAR HEADPHONES.  The only ears these can fit over are a small child's ears and even then you may have to fold the ears to get them into the headphones.  Most over the ear headphones are at least 2.5inches long (inner measurement), these are well short of that.2nd My headphone at least are not balanced correctly.  I can hear a lot more sound coming from the right ear than the left.  Does not happen with my other two headphones so its not my phone or av equipment.3rd THESE ARE ON THE EAR HEADPHONES.  Looking over the reviews (a bit late now) I notice that the company that sells them either doesn't understand what over the ear means, or does, but blames the fault on some outside manufacturer.  Since no one that complains that these are not over the ear ever comes back to say they got a new pair with bigger cans I can only assume that a manufacture problem is just an excuse for ""we made these wrong but we are going to keep selling them anyway.""4th These CAN NOT be used to make or take phone calls.  The mic must be too far away or it's just a cheap mic but even talking very loudly people can barely hear me when I talk.  My cheapo 20 on-ears are crystal clear compared to these higher priced monsters.They should just label them accurately and call them on the ear headphones, then I wouldn't have wasted my time buying, getting upset and wasting time writing this review, and now returning these lying headphones.",1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT OVER THE EAR - LIES!

The instructions are pretty basic, but sufficient for most things. There's a little more bass than I'm used to, but I think that's a case of me being more used to earbuds.

    ","I got these to walk around the house and yard and listen to TV or radio. Even though it says FM stereo, there is no radio receiver, and you have to buy a separate Bluetooth attachment to watch TV.  And even with that, the controls would be tricky.  Sent them back.

    ",When operated in wired mode and listening to music the quality is good. When used in blue tooth mode using their dongle the quality is poor. It is in the background and not clear or crisp. It's like listening to a radio in a tunnel. I've contact the manufacturer to see if something can be corrected. If not they are going back.The problem wound up being that the dongle was plugged into a hub. There should be a notice in the direction that the dongle needs to be plugged in to a primary USB port that is connected directly to the motherboard.,3.0 out of 5 stars,... wired mode and listening to music the quality is good.

They deliver great sound, have an excellent battery life and the controls are fairly easy to use. Unfortunately they don't keep out all that external noise, primarily I assume because they are not noise canceling: again they are cheap. Bottom line if you don't care about canceling out that train noise on the subway and only use them maybe an hour or so at a time these are right for you.

    ","I really wanted to believe these were great headphones. I read the reviews, did my research, etc. I only used them one time and had to send them back. I tried recharging, etc., but they still didn't work.I'm updating my initial review...Mpow staff saw my review and sent me another set of headphones. I am extremely pleased with the product/sound quality. I took a week testing them to make sure they'd work during chemotherapy, and they did. I bought wireless headsets for the convenience, and they were the perfect companion during my infusion. For whatever reason, I'm not always able to use one of my hands, and these headsets solved that problem.I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome...thanks, Mpow.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I Really Like Them!

You can be confident buying things from them and they will take good care of you if you have issues.  Therefore, I'm uping the stars.This headset feels heavy and uncomfortable to me.  I was testing it out by leaving a voicemail on a phone and when I went to check on the receiving device there was none so I'm guessing the mic is not working.  When I wear it to listen to music for awhile it makes my head feels hot so I can't stand having this on for more than 15 minutes.

I always have my headphones on while walking to and from class every day. It’s my way of drowning out the world around me. I wanted headphones that are Bluetooth since having a cord gets in the way when I have my phone in my pocket. I couldn’t afford Bluetooth Beats so I purchased these and I am highly satisfied. I personally think the sound quality is better, these are far more stylish, and I have never had a problem with Bluetooth connection.

They didn't hold a charge.  They are bluetooth headphones, implying that you should be able to listen to them without wires, right?  Well seeing as my pair didn't hold a charge, I couldn't very well use them wirelessly now could I?  I've since returned these for a pair of Cowin E7's.EDIT:Since posting this review, Mpow has been kind enough to send me a new pair of headphones, these ones seem to work as intended.  However, seeing as I have already purchased and grown accustomed to a new pair of headphones (as stated earlier, the Cowin E7's) I will not be using this pair that Mpow has sent me.  I will instead be giving them to someone as a Christmas/birthday gift.  As I stated earlier in the review, the headphones are great for the price, but the pair I ordered happened to be DOA.  This just goes to show how great Mpow's customer service is that I was able to receive a new pair of headphones despite the fact that I have already returned the DOA pair and received a refund from Amazon.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Read the edit at the end

    ","I was wondering how loud they would actually be for Bluetooth technology under $40.  They look cool for sure abs have gotten compliments at the gym but you will get some ear discomfort after 60-90min.  And not from 'pounding bass' I wish.  But they do hit on the lower end, but overall, as an old school D&B DJ they just don't have the volume I'm looking for...  You can't beat the price though.  On the plus side I've had zero issues with  performance due to perspiration.  I train hard in the FL sun and they stay functional while sweating.

12971,"on August 11, 2017",,"I was delighted to find the Mpow Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones after searching the grid for functional ones that would fit my budget. I've been using the headphones for about 2 weeks now with very few complaints. The sleek design looks very nice while wearing and the earpieces are comfortable. The headphones will fit all head lengths with the easily adjustable sides. They come with a carrying pouch, instructions, cable to listen wired, and charging cable. The sound quality is very good, but not amazing, as you can't hear all that much bass when listening to music. I felt that the lack of bass hasn't at all interfered with my listening experience, which is good. One complaint I have is regarding the Bluetooth connection. The instructions say how to connect the headphones with up to two devices at once, but whenever I try to do this and connect my iPad, my phone disconnects, and then I later have to reconnect it, which can be a tedious process, thus taking away a star. Overall, I really like this product and would recommend to those who are interested in affordable, high- quality headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars,A great find!!

    ","Overall, you're getting good quality for paying under $40. They're comfortable, but the headphones start to like pinch the ear after awhile, so it's hard to go over an hour without wanting to take them off for a small break. The buttons for the bluetooth work and the voice is handy, but the buttons do feel a little cheap and it worries me how long my power button will work. Also, when using bluetooth, there's definitely some pausing/lagging/whatever that goes on. It works well enough to be worth using, but it is a slight annoyance. The wired jack it comes with in case you don't want to use bluetooth or it's out of battery is really nice. I feel confident that even if the bluetooth function eventually fails me, I'll get a long lifespan using it wired.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good for the price

The headphones were in a bubble pocket that wasn't even sealed or taped, just folded over. They had no plastic covering on them. You know, the sticky plastic film that is on new electronics. Nothing. Just folded up and put in a loose bubble wrap . The box also contained the cabling in a little ziploc and the instructional manual. My wife was standing there when I opened it and even she commented about how ""That's how they packed it? This was obviously opened before."" I will be returning, and maybe looking at some of the competitors for the replacement. Not really sure if I want to go through the hassle of returning these and ordering a new pair and risking it has been opened before too.UPDATE:  For some reason Amazon won't accept my previous review.  No profanity or disrespect, so not sure why.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing product.  Didn't even try.

    ","Let me start by saying, for the money you pay these will do for any need.  They have decent sound and feel comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  The reason I gave 2 stars was because this seems to be yet another case of ""review grouping""!  What I mean by that is based off the many many reviews and star count this listing showed this product had, which I have a hard time believing are just for this product, I bought these.  I can't speak for anyone else but as an avid audiophile, I know of and actually posses better sounding headphones that are at the same price point.  Some of those product are still on Amazon and they don't have near as many reviews as this one had.  I don't like this practice as it can be very misleading for the consumer.  I'm sure it works wonders for the sellers. This is just a warning that you cannot rely on the number of reviews and high star value alone!Anyway, the bass is not great and the speakers tend to distort at around 75% or more for bass heavy music.  This may ruin your experience if you are a audiophile like me. The midrange is also too low which make the high scream.  This make the sound uneven and empty at times even when you back off the volume.  I'm sure Mpow has some headphones that will knock your socks off but these are not the ones!Update!  The customer service at Patozon is Great.  They recognized my frustration with these headphones and sent me a different pair that are a lot better.  These (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074R94LFQ) are more of what I would have expected with the high number of reviews these previous ones had.  These new ones have pretty good bass after you play with some of the EQ settings on your device.  I was able to get these to sound pretty good for the price.  Highs are very good and I had to find a preset EQ type to dial them back a little but I do like the clarity of the highs.  The midrange is decent and goes well with the total range of the the headphones.  The bass is punchy and only when turned all the way up, which is a lot, do they start to distort.  I like that you can turn them up when you really want to feel some vibration.  They seem very sturdy and the comfort is just as good as the previous ones.  You want to get these for the price instead of the MPBH059AG ones of this original review.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated: Classic case of ""Review grouping"" in my opinion!"

    ","I have had these headphones for a while now and have gotten to test them in several different environments (studying, movie watching on my laptop, and even at work when working on a project), and quite frankly I am a little disappointed. The display of them is actually quite stunning - coming with a nice carrying bag and auxiliary cable, however I can only wear them for a maximum of an hour before my ears start hurting and they tend to cut out every so often. There isn't much sound leakage that I've been made aware of, however I haven't necessarily listened to extremely loud music with them. The range on them isn't that good either to be honest.I want very badly to like these as they really do look nice, but with the bluetooth cutting out and the range being so poor, I honestly can't justify using them anymore sadly. I suppose you get what you pay for, and perhaps these are somehow defected and possibly fit others well and do not cause such discomfort, however as it stands I would not recommend these to a friend.**UPDATE 4-11-17**Upon hearing what I had to say Mpow reached out to me and very kindly offered to send me a replacement pair in hopes to have a better user experience. I have tested the new pair some through my daily use and find that the Bluetooth indeed does not cut out as did with my previous pair, however the range still does not seem that great on them and they are quite uncomfortable after about an hour of use, which is not ideal when studying for a long period of time. While I commend Mpow for their amazing customer service, if I could do it again I would most likely have gotten a pair from Avantree instead.**UPDATE 4-24-17**I have had time to use the replacement pair provided to me and while still extremely discomfortable after ~45minutes of use, they have also started going out. From full charge, after a maximum of 2 hours of use, the sound starts cutting in and out and is useless. I am contacting amazon in hopes for a refund and I am ordering a pair of avantree headphones.

    ","Crappy headphones aka waste of money. These headphones did not come with a mic to use with a cell phone in fact they never synced up with my phone to listen to music. they lasted about 40 minutes then died needed to be charged constantly. The adjustable head band seemed to catch my hair ever time I put it on my head  I had to wear a baseball cap to keep from it happening the ""fit and finish"" crude every corner felt rough. I purchased the blu tooth dongle it never worked with the head phones or any other device. I spent tons of money on these type of things in the past and can see these are horrible and still mediocre even if you don't know any better. I was suckered into buying them by the positive reviews.***Update, Mpow customer support sent me new headphones I didn't want!!!, Guess what if you think I'm gonna stick cheap crap on my ears again?Never!. The positive reviews were deceiving I would have spent more $$$ on something excellent- if only the reviews were totally honest. Here is my problem, I bought these for devices that were not blu tooth enabled, only to have the Tao Tronic dongle recalled.(why bother to try this again), it did not at any time sync up to a 2017 LG cell phone.IF it was a cool thing IF it's sick looking headset-IF the brief successful use rendered beautiful sound.  IF it did not pull or grab hair...Maybe ---NOT!*** Update just found out I have to make a special trip to the post office pay for shipping the horrible crap back..Just remember, never wanted to see this  excrement again now its effort.

    ","I purchased these headphones primarily for comfort. My usage is usually anywhere between 2 to 8 hours at a time. I’ve owned many headphones and I’ve found that (actual) over-the-ear headphones are the only kind that you can wear for these kinds of extended periods without pain or at least significant discomfort.Simply put, these are NOT over-the-ear headphones. Unless you are a stunted elf-child with unusually dainty ears, these headphones will fit ON-the-ear, not over.When I measured the opening where your ears actually go, rather than the outside of the padding, I found that the space for your ear is actually closer to 42mm wide and 53mm high, or 1.6 inches and 2.08 inches respectively.Even a stunted elf-child would have difficulty fitting his/her ears in such a small opening.I received these on a Saturday and used them with the attached audio cable three separate times, twice for about two (2) hours and once for about four (4). On all occasions I could feel my pulse on my ears after only an hour, and this was after adjusting the headphones to be as loose as possible while still staying in place. Also, on all occasions my ears would hurt after about two (2) hours.I awarded only one (1) star due to the clearly false advertising and discomfort I experienced after wearing them for less than two hours.I have not even paired them yet.Otherwise, the design of these headphones seems sturdy and well constructed. The padding around the ears seems firmly attached and the frame is both flexible and strong, while still being lightweight.I intend to return these and purchase *actual* over-the-ear headphones. Though I might give them one more try as I work tonight, and see if I can’t ‘fold’ my ear inside and see if they are comfortable ‘enough’.Sigh.",1.0 out of 5 stars,These are NOT over-the-ear as advertised.

    ","I am unfairly comparing these to a much more expensive pair of Bose QC15 headphones which I love, but these Mpows fall short for me in a couple of areas.First off, they are bulkier and heavier than I would like. I have worn my Bose headphones for hours at a time with no problems. But the weight of these and the fact that they clamp a bit tight to my head means that after 30 mins I need to shift them around or take a break. Second, the folding mechanism isn't that helpful. They are still boxy and take up a lot of space in my bag. The way that Bose pivots the ear cups to create more of a flat plane is a better solution for transport in a messenger bag / laptop bag.On the plus side, Mpow bluetooth connectivity is great in my experience. Both these and a separate in-ear set that I have connect quickly and rarely give me issues, and I love the audible notification for power/connect status. Also no complaints about the sound -- volume and clarity are great. I'll stick with Mpow, just not this particular pair.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Close, but not for me"

    ","I'm extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with these headphones. I did a TON of research on different *affordable* headphones on Amazon and these seemed to be the best as they have 4.6 stars and over 8,000 reviews. I was poorly mistaken... The advertisement for the headphones says ""Designed for an excellent listening experience, Mpow Bluetooth headset with CSR chip and around-ear cushion design can provide robust, immersive and Hi-fidelity sound"" which is all 100% true. The headphones provide pretty clear sound and provided enough bass for my liking. However, they also ""provide robust, immersive and Hi-fidelity sound"" FOR EVERYONE AROUND YOU. I can't listen to anything above a whisper without literally everyone sitting near me also hearing it. The whole point of wearing headphones is so that you can listen to music or podcasts or whatever you want to listen to without disturbing those around you. I bought these for work and they're basically useless to me now because I can't use them without other people also having to listen to whatever I'm playing. I might as well just strap a giant speaker on my head and call it a day.If, for some reason, you enjoy being a nuisance to your coworkers and friends, then these are the headphones for you. They completely surround your ear but are just okay in the comfort department for me. They are noticeably heavy and tight on the top of my head. I wear glasses and they definitely squeeze my frames and shift my glasses.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed

    ","Succinctly, I really don't like these headphones. I've had them for 15 minutes.I'm a college student and I wanted headphones to walk to class in and to play a really deep bass to help me find my rhythm when I run and to motivate me when I lift weights.They're light and they look cheap. I don't like that. I'd say it's the screws on the outside and the cheap plastic. It's the kind of plastic that looks mid price range when it's nicely polished and no one has touched it but looks like some terrible knockoff when you do touch it (which you will if you want to listen to music) because there are a million fingerprints on it and oil smudges from your skin. I've had these 15 minutes.It's not really comfortable on my ear. I have small ears objectively and the cheap cushion was shaped well but wasn't comfortable. It just outlined my ear shape rather than cushioning it if you know what I mean. But comfort is subjective. I moved them around a lot on my head and just didn't like the feel on my ear. The band adjusts alright though (I have big head by most standards).The music, however. I'm listening to music from Youtube on my laptop so if you were to play it, you'd know exactly the music quality I'm listening to.I listened to Beyonce's Sandcastles on Youtube from my laptop. It was fine. There's really nothing spectacular to me and I have been using the Skullcandy Hesh 2 Wireless for years up until a couple days ago. That's what I am comparing these headphones to. Sounded like loud Beyonce.Then I listened to Life Itself by Glass Animals which has some really interesting staccato drum sounds in its intro. There was no sense of hearing a real drum next to my ear. It was simply the song it always was. Just loud.Next was Trap Check by 2 Chainz. Also on Youtube. The bass sounds muted and a 'far away.' As I turned the music up it didn't help. There wasn't the feeling of hearing different elements of the sound from different locations around your head as I can get with some music. Just louder, everything but the bass which was so strangely muted. The musical change at time 2:37 which usually makes me hype was not only quieter but blurrier so that the complex rhythm just sounded muddled and less impactful.Then! I went to this website written by a professional sound designer to test the ranges of these headphones and find out whether or not it was the Youtube playback or the headphone quality.http://www.audiocheck.net/soundtests_headphones.phpWhen testing the bass Hz to see how low these went, there was only a definitive bass sound at about 45 Hz. Awful for someone who really likes bass.When testing the treble kHz (which was awful and unenjoyable) I found the horrible whining sound was at about 19.5 kHz for me. Great if you really like Meghan Trainor or Taylor Swift.I skipped down to quality testing and found that there was a literal parasitic rattle at the beginning and end of the sweep for 9 seconds at the beginning and 4 at the end. Poor I think.Just generally, they're cheap. I'm going to return them, because I don't like them.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Loves Bass Reviewed Song Quality and Audio Ranges

    ","My nephew uses headphones daily.  He wears them to school, walking home from school, in his room, when he is out--he wears them everywhere.  He can not tolerate the style that are ear buds.  He just doesn't like anything in his ears.  He has gone through SO many headphones, including the famous Beats kind.  I don't know if he is rough on them, or they just die from using them so much, but he has had many kinds.  He had a wired set and the connection was poor, so I got him a cheap BT pair and he liked them.  But then I got him this set, and he LOVED them.  He loved the look right out of the box.  His previous BT pair that he liked was also black and red, but the ear part was much, much thinner.  This whole headset is much larger, but in a good way.  They are light and he says very, very comfortable.  He loves the way they work and they connected to his phone instantly.  He loves that they fold, and liked the carrying case.  It's funny that he actually had told me he did not need or want to try new headphones, until these arrived and he saw them.  His eyes opened wide and he wanted to use them immediately.  He is a teenager, he listens to music all the time and he is no expert on headphones.  But he loves these, and I like him to be happy, so they are a hit for both of us.  The headphones seem to be sturdy, and he hasn't had a problem with them yet so I have high hopes that they are going to last for a while.  When he needs new ones again, I would buy this pair without hesitation.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Big hit with teenage music lover

Within a week or so, I received an e-mail from the vendor after they read my review. Without me asking, they offered to send me the 059's set of bluetooth headphones, at no charge, as a way of thanking me for being a customer as well as wanting me to be a happy customer. I gladly accepted, and got the 059's a few days later. I must admit, the 059's are more comfortable than the Thor's, as they have an oblong ear pad. I am also happy to report that I have had no phasing of the noise, or the buzzing that were present in the Thor's!!I want to give a big 5 Stars to Mpow's customer service. They recognized a problem WITHOUT me having to call them about it, reached out to me, and replaced the defective product with on that is working fine, and really sounds very good.

I know they are worth at least 4 stars, based on my listening experience so far. But, the customer service bumps that rating up another star, IMnsHO! That's part of what I pay for.

13381,"on September 19, 2017",,"I bought these headphones during ""Prime Day"" recently. I think they were slightly discounted. My main goal for these was to talk on my cell phone without having to hold the phone up to my ear. I am hearing impaired and many headphones just don't cut it for me as far as clarity and loudness. I hoped that this Mpow pair would.I liked that they could be used with Bluetooth but also corded. They are foldable and comfortable on my ears and they fit when I am wearing my hearing aids and when I am not. They paired almost instantly with my phone and computer and they sounded really good - when listening to music. However, when I listened to voices on the phone, they were muffled and I couldn't understand a lot of what was being said. That is not to say that these are bad headphones. They aren't. My ears are bad and only a choice few are clear and loud enough for me to use with voice calls. These, unfortunately were not. I was going to keep them for music and even watching videos online because the clarity for those activities was good. I decided though that I needed to keep looking for some Bluetooth headphones that served my original purpose so I did return these. I am still going with 4 stars because they were crisp and clear as well as comfortable when listening to online music and videos. My sons said they sounded plenty loud enough for their good ears when listening to voices on the phone. They did say though that some callers on the other end said that they sounded somewhat muffled or tinny.In all, these are good low priced headphones with the versatility of Bluetooth or corded use. They sound pretty good and feel good. They're foldable and easy to carry with you. They pair easily and they are easy to use as far as the commands. They just didn't work out for me. The only thing that was a con for my sons with normal hearing (besides them not having high end booming bass) was that callers said their voices were a little muffled or a bit distorted. Not enough to keep the caller from understanding them though. They are worth the cost if you want a decent pair of headphones that can be used two ways and that have good sound for the low price.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Lots of pros but I had to return these.

The ear pads actually cover the ear completely and comfortably. They didn't crush my head.The unit ""speaks"" as you're turning the device on, pairing, turning off and other functions. Bluetooth was fast to pair on my Samsung android phone.As for sound: My complaint on the first set I had was it sounded thin, had no low end and I had to eq the heck out of them to make them sound halfway acceptable. These are the exact opposite. If you like super heavy, congested, compressed bass - these headsets are for you. I can't seem to find an eq setting to make them sound acceptable to me. I shouldn't have to dramatically adjust my eq to get things sounding good. My Sennheiser HD202's (which are no longer available, and didn't cost much more than these) sound 100x better with a flat EQ. They sound open and honest.I am happy with Mpow's customer service and willingness to make me happy.

These also have really good noise isolation and allow me to watch video on my phone while other people are making a lot of noise in the same room.  I was also pretty impressed with the build quality.  The expansion parts of the band are made of metal and also slide into a metal guide.  After owning so many cheap headsets, I can tell you this is the place they normally break and these are built to last.  The only problem I have with these is that cosmetic plastic on the outside.  This hasn't been an issue for the pair my daughters use but on the pair I use the plastic has started cracking all over.  I assume this is due to my larger head and the plastic just not being able to flex well.  They would've done better to wrap the middle portion in a nice p-leather wrap that flexed over people's heads.  All-in-all a very good value.

13387,"on May 4, 2017",,"These are impressive for the price. Unlike the cheaper Mpows, the sound from these compare favorably with what I consider the gold standard for inexpensive over-ear headphones, the Sennheiser HD 202. The 202s have a slight edge in overall presence and clarity, but you have to really listen to them closely back-to-back to hear it. In everyday use (on the bus, for example), I have zero complaints about the sound quality while listening to music, podcasts, and TV shows.The primary downside to these is weight and fit—they're significantly heavier than the Mpow Thors, and I have to fiddle with the placement on my head so the back of my ears don't start to hurt after an hour or so of listening. I think I've got the placement right, but they're definitely not the most comfortable headphones I own. (This is an area where, obviously, every head is different, so if they fit you perfectly, you win.)Other notes:- When paired with my phone (LG G4), the sound is very bass-heavy with the phone volume all the way up and the headphone volume in the middle. It balances out with the phone volume around 50-60% and the headphone's volume one beep away from the top. (Again, YMMV, but if the sound isn't exactly to your liking, mess with your various volume options. The bass-treble balance when plugged in seems fine at all volume levels.)- Multipoint Bluetooth is a nice touch. Can go between laptop and phone without repairing.- The status LED blinks when it's connected. It's not noticeable outside, but in, say, a dark bedroom next to a sleeping spouse, this could be a problem. I either flip them around so the light faces away, or connect via a cable with the headphones powered off.- Yeah, they're kinda ugly. But the build quality seems very solid, especially considering the price.- They're not noise cancelling, but the earpads are substantial enough (and fit tight enough) to block out lots of outside noise. I have to take them off to hear other people talking to me.- I don't know how long the battery lasts, because I've never been able to run it down completely. I'm going to guess this is why they weigh so much. These run for a long time.(Disclosure: I received these from Patozon after posting a negative review of the Mpow Thor headphones. Kudos to their customer service team for reaching out and taking care of unhappy customers.

Despite the purchase feeling a bit rushed, overall I'm pretty satisfied with them.Pros: They feel hefty and of good construction, especially for the low price point. Bluetooth pairing was super easy. I'm no audiophile, but sound quality is plenty good for me. I haven't tested the longevity of the battery yet, but it's totally suitable for my needs (mostly when I'm on airplanes and out running). They're not designed for exercise, but I wear them when I go jogging, and so far they work great: no slipping off my head.Cons: Ear cups are comfy, but not terribly breathable, and my ears get a little warm after an hour or so. They're just a smidge bulkier than I'd like. Color isn't my taste, but whatevs. No active noise cancellation.Actually, that last item is my biggest gripe: at the time of my purchase, the headline and item description was just a little slimy. The seller didn't exactly promise *active* noise cancellation, but they were sure to point out ""noise-cancelling"" as a feature several times. Given the price point, I sort of expected that this was all just mildly deceitful marketing for keyword purposes, and by ""noise-cancelling"" they actually just meant ""over-ear."" I decided to pull the trigger and order these guys anyway, but I decided I'd be pleasantly surprised if there actually was active noise cancellation on these things.I wasn't surprised. No noise-cancelling technology. I notice that the headline and item description has since been updated to be much more honest about that, and kudos to the seller for being more upfront. I wish things had been a bit more honest when I decided to buy them, but I'm not too disappointed. For the price point, these things are totally serviceable.

I have 4 different devices I connect these to. A Samsung smart tv, A Samsung Galaxy Note 4 phone, A Samsung galaxy tab 4, and an iPod Touch Gen 5. These paired up super easy and fast to all my devices. I love listening to my tv through them late at night without disturbing anyone else. I've used them for hours at a time and they just keep going. The ear part is extremely soft leather feeling material and are super comfortable. The only tiny con, is they are pretty big and heavy. I lay in bed on my back and listen to them so it's not usually an issue. I can also get up and go to other rooms and they stay connected. I highly recommend them.

On the rare occasion my battery runs out the AUX cable backup works very well, and works with any standard AUX cable in case you lose the original.They do occasionally experience interference, moreso that some more expensive bluetooth headphones I have had.

The bass could be a little better, very weak in that area. Connectivity is great and the ability to connect two things is awesome, I connected my phone and my laptop and can switch between them easily.

These are taller than they are wide and do not do that. These I can sit in for hours. They are too warm to work out in, but I have had no issues pairing them with either a Windows 10 computer using a universal bluetooth dongle, or my Google Pixel phone. They only took a couple hours to charge via 3.0 usb to my computer at work the first time I had to charge them. I've had them about 2 weeks and used them a dozen times.

There is a small hum when there is no audio connected but it's no biggie it goes away as soon as you start playing something.-The controls are simple and work great. The playback button works with Youtube, mp3 player, media players, etc. VERY impressive.-The looks are cool. The whole black/red combo looks slick.-Comfortable. They feel great and the weight is distributed very evenly. So you can wear them for an extended amount of time.-OVER THE EAR FIT. I have big/ thick ears. So a lot of over the ear headphones don't really work for me. I usually have to bend my ears to get them to fit and it limits the time I can wear them. These fit GREAT. So all you folks worried about it not fitting over your ear, rest easy. These will fit over your ears just fine.Cons:-The only thing I can think of is the limits in volume. Don't get me wrong it gets loud, but I kinda like listening to the point of going deaf. This is more of a personal preference thing though.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy. Read on for details.

13395,"on February 12, 2018",,"I bought the pink version and I love it and it gets the job done! I have Bose headphones and was looking for a cord free version that was budget friendly.Look:The pink is opaque and has an ever so slight shimmer when the light hits at a certain angle but it is not a shimmery/pearlescent product by any means. When worn, these look fairly large over the head but that doesn't bother me. Hopefully this will deter people from talking to me as I wear them.Feel:These headphones have a good weight to them and feel sturdy, even at the bend where they fold in half. They fold easily without resistance for easy transportation. They are over the ear and feel comfortable after long hours of wear. The cushions are very soft. Not so comfortable when you wear them in bed, laying down, as you watch Netflix as your BF is sleeping next to you but it still does the job.It comes with a microfiber/velvet (?) pouch. Very soft on the outside and will help carry these for now unless you want to get a hard case for them.Function:Press once to turn on (will flash blue). Press again (and hold) to pair (will flash blue and red). Press and hold to disconnect. And press and hold to turn off. All modes will have a voice that comes on and tells you if you're connected, pairing or turning off.Without reading the instructions it was very easy and seamless to pair with my Bluetooth items like my cellphone and iPad. It comes up as Mpow 059. Sound is clear. You can turn up/down the volume on the headphone itself or on your Bluetooth device. Fast forward, back, pause, play all work seamless with your Bluetooth device.This also comes with a wire in case your charge dies. So it can be used wired or wireless.Charging:I believe there is some amount of charge when you get this. Not sure how much but you can use it for a while. Comes with a (very short) USB charging cord. I used my iPhone charging unit, plugged it in and a it charges. A red light comes on when charging and no light when it's fully charged.I am not sure how long it takes to charge as I plug it in overnight.Sound:I am not an audiophile and I haven't tried Beats or other expensive high tech headphone products. My main concerns were cord free/Bluetooth and budget friendly. This hits everything I want. Clear audio, no scratchy sounds. Goes about 30 ft or so before connection skips. Very pleased with being able to listen to my devices and walk into another room without interruption.Making a phone call:I've only done this once and it works. The caller could clearly hear me and I could hear them, clear but they sounded distant. I've only made a call once so I can't speak extensively other than it does work and you can hear and be heardOverall very very pleased with this product. The pink colour is so cute, feels sturdy, sound is clear and I love that it's cord free. No more forgetting about the wire and getting it snagged on something as you're walking around! A great buy!Additionally I ordered this on a random Tues night at 11pm and got it the next morning, even though I was expecting a Friday delivery!Enjoy the pictures, there's not enough of the pink version, so hope these are helpful for anyone contemplating the pink ones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cord free and budget friendly!
13396,"on December 30, 2017",,"I originally bought the Mpow on-the-ear 40-mm driver bluetooth headphones. They did not fit me well and put a lot of pressure on my ears because there was no front-to-back swiveling of the earcups. The company responded to my less than enthusiastic review and sent me these to try out. These are larger headphones (so less packable) but since I don't travel with large headphones that isn't a concern for me. Comfort and sound quality are my top priorities. These fit over my ears nicely and have just enough front-to-back swivel that they adjust to fit my head well. The smallest adjustment might still be a little bit large for kids or adults with small heads, but they should fit most people nicely. I haven't tried out the microphone yet for bluetooth phone calls, but the sound quality is good.

It doesn't feel like something that would break easily.There are only two complaints that I would have about these headphones.  The buttons (play/pause, volume, forward, back) all kind of blend together.  When I'm feeling around for the play/pause button I can't tell the difference between where that button ends and the outer ring of buttons begins.  I've used other headphones where these buttons have a ridge between them so you know where one ends and the other begins.  Maybe I'll get more used to it over time.  Finally, the bass is decent, but I've used other headphones for the same price that had better bass.  I used a couple pairs side by side and the Mpows definitely had less bass than the other pair.Overall I really enjoy the fit and feel of the Mpows.  I wish it was easier to distinguish the buttons on the ear, and the bass could be a bit better.

13407,"on January 18, 2018",,"These are a nice pair of headphones that I bought on a whim. Part of me wishes I should've thought through it a bit more, but literally I was looking for a decent pair of headphones so I went on Amazon, searched headphones and filtered by top ratings, and the Mpow was one of them. With over 9,000 reviews, I bought them. I bought the green ones (my fav color) and had them for about 6 months now. Here are some of my thoughts on this gear:- For the price of the headphones, sound quality is above average. The bass is good, but the highs and mids are quite suppressed, but if you are just a regular music listener that's not picky about sound, you probably couldn't even tell. If you mainly listen to bass-y music, these are fine esp if you're under a tight budget. You will miss the vibrant full sound however, but then again, you probably couldn't tell if you aren't an audiophile.- These headphones are heavy. I noticed as I use them to listen to music at work. After about an hour of listening, the top of your head begins to slightly hurt due to the weight of the headphones. These aren't the lightest (quite bulky actually) and might be a bit uncomfortable carrying these around for travels. It does come with a pouch for storage and the headphones are foldable.- I've had these for 6 months and use them about 3x per week, and so far, no wear or tear. Very durable product. I don't foresee it breaking down any time soon.- If you are trying to purchase these for heavy bluetooth usage, I would advise not to purchase these. I think the bluetooth is weak on these. I tried pairing it with my PC and my IPhone, and indeed the connection is there, but the quality of sound was lacking.Overall, would I purchase these again? No, I wouldn't because I enjoy high quality sound and this interest of mine is something that I got into recently. Not saying these Mpows have terrible sound. These are actually pretty great for the price of it. But now, I rather pay more for better build and sound. These are my first headphones I've purchased, and I use it as a baseline to other audio gear purchases.",4.0 out of 5 stars,These are a nice pair of headphones that I bought on a whim

As other reviewers have mentioned, if you wear these headphones more more than an hour or two at a time, it gets a little uncomfortable on the ears. That being said, it does provide a little bit of sound blocking which helps a little bit on airplanes but doesn't compare to the qc line from Bose if that's what you're looking for.At this price point, this product cannot be beat!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great pair of BT headphones for $30!

However, when I use them with my laptop, they manage to lag and miss the beat of whatever I'm listening to, wether its videos on youtube or my friends' voices when on skype. There are a couple videos on youtube to stop it from doing things like totally collapsing when getting a skype call, which happens due to the fact that these can be used for phone calls, but besides that, it still lags from now and then.The battery life is acceptable. I would go ahead and say its actually very good, but since I'm a heavy user, it runs out in just a couple days, so it depends on your usage of it. No problems when charging them thought, they do it in four hours, which is also acceptable.Now, I said these can be used for phonecalls, but don't, since their microphone is terrible, and I mean, appallingly bad. In a room where you are alone, trying to call your family, they are good, any other less ideal place is a horrible choice, especially if you are calling someone who knows what good quality sounds like; I called my mom using them and, since she is not too demanding on these regards, she was happy with just being able to listen to me. Let me add, if you have a laptop and use skype, you can chance the settings so you can use your laptop's microphone instead of your headphones'. If you have a desktop, sorry then, because you'll have your listeners abhorred.Ok, I just told you everything wrong/kind of messy with these, all other aspect of it is great. Good sound quality, practicality, portability, etc. Totally worth the price. Don't go in for a top notch feel, bacause it's less than forty dollars; go in however for a big, fat smile for the bargain you are getting with these.Cheers",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Headphones, but do read my three preoccupations"

    ","For me, price good, wireless connect good, I play a computer game for few hours and have no any problem with the battery. The reason I can't give the product 5 stars because:  * I think the sound lower than I expect even I set the volume to max.  * It's hurt my ear when I use for a long time, about 2 hours and more.  * I can't hear the bass, low note and high note very clear.Anyway, to compare with other product from Beat or Bose, the price is acceptable and good quality. After 2 weeks I use it, I think it ok and recommend buy it if you don't ready spend more than $100 for something you think better.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"price good, wireless connect good"

Then a voice says ""headset disconnected"". Then I push the power button for another 15-20 seconds and a voice says ""Powering off"". Then I have to push the power button again for 15-20 seconds and the voice says ""Phone one connected"".

You can use them, but be prepared to annoy everyone working next to you, sitting next to you, or anywhere near you. It's odd because a friend's pair didn't seem to have this problem.
