    ","Left my old lightweight folding headphones on a plane, so decided to try these, my first Bluetooth pair.  Initial reaction is they are great, no real complaints for a headset at this price point.They are reasonably lightweight, adjust properly to fit my head, the earmuffs cover my ears fairly comfortably and give very good outside noise attenuation. Like all over-the-ear headsets, you have to put up with the pressure and the need to occasionally shift things to relieve an uncomfortable spot.Can't complain about the sound.  At age 79 I don't have ""audiophile ears"" any more and can't accurately judge high frequency response, but for me the overall sound is clean & very well balanced.  Vocals come through clearly, bass is just right to my taste (79 year olds don't go for vibrate your skull bass).  Max volume on Bluetooth exhibits a little distortion but that is a level well over what I would listen at.  Mid volume is just right.  This is all on Bluetooth, I haven't tried them driven via direct plug-in from a known clean source with more power.Bluetooth performance is impressive.  They paired quickly with my iPhone,and range is outstanding, I left the phone on our dining room table and walked throughout the house with only a hint of dropout at the most distant room, which was about 35-40 feet and through 3 interior walls.Physical construction appears good if not super-rugged, but after all they have to be lightweight.  They fold into a nice package & a cloth bag is provided, along with the charger & a direct-connect audio cable.  Charging is standard 5V viat the flat micro USB connector now common on most cellphones, so you may not have to carry an extra cable when traveling.  No experience yet on battery life.If there is any real ""con"" to mention, it's that I can see wearing them around in public might not be the fashion statement you want to project; they're pretty bulky looking & I'm not keen on the red trim, which draws even more attention.  On the other hand, so what?",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Sound & Noise Attenuation, Great Bluetooth Performance, Good Value"

    ","Just received these, but after the first few hours of ownership I am impressed. For the price I expected really poor build quality and overly bassy sound that's trying to cover up crummy mids and highs. I know reviews are good for these and it's predecessor, yet I somehow didn't believe them. Colour me surprised!Comfortable and light with medium clamping force. I wear glasses and they feel decent, although I'll probably stretch em out a tad.Sound isn't flat (sorry audiophiles). Great signature imo- not overly harsh in any regard, but juuust right. Metallica and Fleetwood Mac both sound fantastic!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Colour me surprised. Great headphones!

    ","WOW! Was not expecting these to produce very good audio quality, but man was I wrong. The audio is honestly comparable to MUCH higher quality headphones. When I first paired them and played music, it sounded almost like my Sony Producer headphones. I've tried comparing the two and have found very minor differences. The sound on these is very crisp and, while they are not noise-cancelling, they do a very good job at drowning out ambient noise. I work in an open office and, while playing music, these headphones always drown out the constant bustle of the office. They are also super comfortable allowing me to wear them for extended periods of time.The only downside is the built in microphone. It's basically garbage. Yeah, it works, but it doesn't work well. If you buy these, don't expect to use them for talking because the mic is just not very good quality.All-in-all, these are, in my opinion, the BEST bang-for-your-buck you can get for a pair of headphones. They're stylish, comfortable, and provide superior audio quality of >= $200 headphones. If you're looking for a pair of headphones, but don't want to break the bank, GET THESE!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"AMAZING Audio quality and EXTREMELY comfortable, but don't expect to use the microphone."

    ","I got these as a surprise for my boyfriend because his favorite (more expensive) ones had recently broken. I'd checked out the earlier version of these, but decided to get this model, as it is only a few dollars more. He's had a pair of Bose noise canceling headphones as well as Senheiser, so I was a little apprehensive about how he would feel about the sound quality. Fortunately, he loves them! He's super happy about the look, the sound quality, and the competitive pricing.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price! Great sound! Great product!

    ","This is a review from NerdTechy. Sometimes you need an extra boost from your audio gear without sacrificing style, durability or convenience. However, finding a pair of headphones that can successfully bridge the gap between looking cool and delivering quality sound is no easy task. There are hundreds of listening options on the market and each one comes with its own design and unique features. Even though there are plenty of quality choices in audio gear, matching the right device to your specific needs is integral to long-term satisfaction. Whether you’re someone who produces music, or the kind of person who just has a very sensitive ear when it comes to sound quality, it pays to be picky when choosing your headphones.In this review I'm going to be taking an in-depth look at the Mpow H1 Bluetooth Headphones. I'm going to be checking out the design, comfort, special features and sound quality in order to give you a fully-comprehensive idea of just what these headphones can really do.First ImpressionsAt first glance we thought that Mpow H1 Headphones had an intense, edgy look with some very cozy looking earpieces. The headband was covered in red and black leather that had some really intricate stitching along the edges, and the plastic earpieces were black with a thin red trim. We liked the color scheme, but thought that, for some, it might be a little intense. We would have liked to see a lighter, more relaxed color choice, just to make the H1 more versatile in their style.The ear cushions were surprisingly thick and lightweight. Just from looking at the cushions we could tell they would easily block out environmental noise, while also being comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time. This is crucial, especially if you’re the kind of person who may want to wear these headphones during a long workday, or in a situation that requires you to be plugged in for a few hours or moreThe Mpow H1 is also lighter than some of its predecessors like the Mpow 059. They weigh in at just 7.5 ounces and measure 6.5 x 5.9 inches, making them the kind of device you truly can wear all day. They are big enough to notice you have them on, but aren’t going to put your neck under any strain while you use them.Both earpieces are adjustable as well as foldable, and are fastened to the leather headband with plastic sliders on a sturdy gunmetal black connector. It’s pretty easy to find the right fit, and we found that once we adjusted them, they stayed snug.On the left earpiece we found the Mpow logo printed in sleek, red lettering, and on the right we found a play and pause button, as well as skip forward and skip backward buttons. We were also able to locate a line in jack and a small opening for a microphoneThe headphones are a true wireless model and connect to smartphones and tablets via Bluetooth 4.1. We were pretty pleased to see that the only wires on the unit were hidden by the leather, and were almost not even noticeable when we took it out of the box.In our opinion, these headphones aren’t best suited for those with very active lifestyles or people who may want a portable listening device to throw in their gym bag. They’re on the larger side and, while they are adjustable, they seem like they could easily slide off during a hard workout. That being said, their larger size and thick ear cushions did make us think that they were comfortable enough to wear around the house or in an office for long periods of time. The bigger size of the earpieces also gave us some pretty high hopes for the sound quality.Our initial feeling is that the Mpow H1 would be best used by busy professionals, musicians or those who are looking for a fully-immersive listening experience. Just be sure to note that the H1 is mainly going to deliver comfort and audio-quality over convenience and portability.Features and AccessoriesWhen you open the box to the Mpow H1 you’ll find some basic accessories. You’ll get the headphones themselves, a 3.5mm audio cable, a USB charging cable, a carrying bag and the user manual. It doesn’t seem like much, but these accessories are actually pretty nifty. By including the 3.5mm cable, it tipped us off to the fact that these headphones could also be used in a home audio system if need be or as a wired device for a smartphone or tablet. The carrying bag was made of soft, protective material and is strong enough to protect the headphones if you choose to take them traveling or to work. While there aren’t a lot of dazzling accessories included in the box, the H1 does have some cool features.First and foremost, they are completely wireless and you can synch them to any Bluetooth enabled device with Bluetooth 4.1. This includes phones, tablets, laptops and even Bluetooth enabled televisions. We were especially pleased to find that there were absolutely no loose wires coming off of the headphones, unlike some other similar wireless headphones. The wires we did see were neatly tucked under the leather of the headband, and didn’t create a distraction while we used the H1.The H1 also allows you to take calls totally hands free. With the built-in microphone, all you have to do to answer an incoming call is use the buttons on the right earpiece, and do the same when you’re ready to end the call. The music will automatically stop when you answer a call, and resume when you hang up. We found the clarity during calls to be clear, and the Bluetooth connection held up extremely well with almost no interruptions. However, this feature is only available when the H1 is being used in wireless mode. While using the auxiliary cable, you won’t able to take calls.The headphones also had a very impressive battery life. From a three hour charge, the H1 will yield fifteen hours of either play or talk time. Also with the included auxiliary cable, we found that you could continue to use them as a wired device, even if the battery is completely drained. We found this to be a very useful feature, especially for those that may find themselves traveling for long periods of time.Sound QualityThe sound capabilities of the H1 are probably the biggest selling point of this piece of audio gear. The 40mm stereo driver and the thick over-the-ear pads made for a truly private listening experience that blocked out almost all background noise. The ear pads were excellent for noise-canceling because of both the fit and the material, and we started to feel the overall experience was less inhibited by the large size. Once we turned them on and started listening, we knew why they had to be on the bigger side.The bass was impressive and came through very clearly during play, and even speaking voices in things like audiobooks and podcasts came in crisp and clear. While the bass was outstanding, it’s not the kind of feel you might expect from a home speaker or subwoofer. Since these are still only a pair of headphones, the sound was limited to the size of the 40mm drivers. However, for a pair of headphones, the power and quality still blew us away.One thing we did notice was that, at high volumes, there was a slight vibration in the earpieces. It wasn’t a huge problem, but was definitely noticeable enough to be a little distracting at certain times.The H1 performed well at both low and high volumes, and while playing a variety of different types of audio. We found the sound to be evenly balanced and that the H1 made for a fully immersive listening experience.Final ThoughtsOverall, we really liked the Mpow H1 Bluetooth Headphones, but felt that they were more for those who were concerned with sound quality over convenience and portability. They are on the bigger side and cover the entire ear, but the foldable earpieces did make them somewhat easy to transport if necessary. We also thought the leather around the headband was a good way to bridge the gap between style and quality.The fact that they are truly wireless, lightweight and comfortable were also huge selling points, and we were also impressed with the crystal-clear Bluetooth signal. The option to plug in the included auxiliary cable was also a big bonus because it made the headphones usable even when they ran out of battery.Above all else, the sound quality is the most attractive part of the H1. For a personal listening device, we were really impressed with the fullness and noise-canceling capabilities of each earpiece. The H1 is not a pair of headphones for those looking for a personal listening device to wear during strenuous activity, but is definitely a good choice for someone traveling who is also in need of high-quality sound in an affordable package.",5.0 out of 5 stars,MPOW H1 Review

    ","I am (so far) surprised with these headphones considering the price.  I will first say that I’ve never owned over-ear headphones before so maybe my expectations are lower than someone that’s had some Bose or Beats. That said these are great for what I’m using them for. Music sounds great, bass hits hard and mids/highs are perfect for the metal and old school hip hop I like.I work in an open office (loud) environment and am up and down and walking around all day. I was tired of having to remove my old headphones every time I got up plus when on conference calls it was often difficult to hear with all the background noise. Problem solved with the Mpow set! I listen to music at least 5 hrs/day plus an hour or 2 of calls. On a full charge they last 4 days, takes about 3 hrs to charge full from dead. 30 mins of charge from dead gets me 1.5 days.Microphone works well, listeners tell me they hear a bit more background noise but not anything hugely noticeable. Bluetooth works great!! I walk 30-40 ft down the hall and into other rooms/offices and no connection issues-sheetrock and metal framed building. Re-connects automatically soon as I get back in range.Very comfortable on my head, firm sliding size adjustment-don’t have to constantly re-adjust during the day. For $35 you can’t lose. Great bang for your buck!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth works up to 40ft away! Great value

    ",Though they may not be true Bose cancelling headphones they sure do sound like them. The bass is awesome and the music is crisp. They connect immediately to your phone or tablet and they are loud as f. Amazing headphones i hope they last as long as possible. Will add a follow up review after a month of using.Follow upYou'd be hard-pressed to find better sounding headphones than these. These headphones are the best that I've ever owned so far. They have work well for me and are very very loud. Don't have these on while driving. Thank you kind officer for the ticket.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bang for the buck

    ","I like these but they don't fold the same as the older H1 models. They don't fit in the suggested case due to the 2 pieces that point out when folded so I'm returning the case. I almost returned the headphones instead to get the older model, but I need the headphones first. I bought these to tune out my coworkers.I am using them now at a comfortable volume and it's great. They're very soft and comfortable, charges in 2-3 hours (doesn't come with a wall charger so I need to charge them through computer via the provided USB cord), and pretty easy to sync up with your phone. I wish there were separate volume and track buttons though. Sometimes I'm trying to do one and the other happens due to poor reaction time. But once you get the hang of it it's okay. The cloth case it comes with fits the headphones REALLY SNUG, almost annoying to put them in.

    ","I have to say that I really wanted to like these, and in some ways they are fantastic, but there are just a few drawbacks I can't get past.Pros: For starters, the sound quality is VERY good.  If you are after great sound at a cheap price and that's all that matters, these are pretty great.  They are also pretty comfortable; not as comfortable as my sennheiser's, but lets be fair...those cost over triple the price.  The earpads fit completely over my ears (just barely) but enough that they were reasonably comfortable for the 30-60 minute listening sessions I typically use them for.  Bluetooth range seemed good, pairing was easy, and I only had one or two random cutouts.  The mic was also passable, but not great.Cons:I only had two major issues with this headset.  The first is the size.  It's hard to tell from the product pictures, but these stick WAY out from you head, much more than it appears.  I don't know if it is a result of the design or what, but they appear enormous when (laterally) when worn on the head.  So much so that I'm not entirely comfortable wearing them outside the house.  This is subjective, but a problem for me.  The other big problem and the deal breaker for me, is the buttons.  Mpow only used 3 buttons on this model, which means many buttons pull double duty.  The worst of which is the power button.  The power button is also the pairing button.  This is not new, my other Mpow products use the power button as the pairing button too, but this set works differently.  With this pair, holding the power button (when off) turns the headset on...and continuing to hold it enters pairing mode.  This is pretty standard.  The problem is turning them OFF.  When already on, if you hold the power button in, it enters pairing mode AGAIN, and you have to hold the power button AGAIN to turn it off.  With my other pairs, the headset is intelligent enough to know that when the headset is already on, if you hold the power button in you want to turn it off.  There is no entering pairing mode twice and holding the power button twice.  This was so annoying to me and so frustrating that I'm probably returning these.  It's just too annoying to have to enter pairing mode every time before turning the headset off; a major design flaw.In conclusion, I really wanted to like this headset, and in a lot of ways its pretty great, but the bulky size and the obnoxious power button were too much for me.  If you can look past those flaws then you have a great sound pair of headphones waiting for you.**UPDATE** (added 2 stars)After reading my review, the seller contacted me letting me know that they were sorry to hear that I was unsatisfied with their product.  I informed them that I appreciated their concern, but had already returned the headphones.  They actually offered and sent to me a different version (the 059 bluetooth headphones) to see if I preferred those at no cost!!  Incredible customer service, and honestly...a company that stands behind their products with customer service like that deserves 5 stars.  It definitely seems that if you have an issue the seller will do whatever they can do to make it right!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So close, but not quite"

    ","Overall I really like these headphones.  They are very large ""studio"" headphones which I actually like.  I find the sound superior.  The cushions are super silky soft.  The battery life is awesome, I've warn them for 3 days at work without charging (turning off at night).The buttons do take a bit to get used to.  Make sure you read the manual to understand them.  The power button is tricky, but once you get the hang of how it works it's fine.  For example when turning off it will verbally announce ""disconnected"", ""pairing"", ""power off"".  It's important NOT to let off until it toggles to the command you want (hold through all 3 announcements & let off after ""power off"" to turn off).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Buttons

    ","These are super headsets. I've collected six headsets over several years, but these are the best, and terrific. The larger H1 earpad is more comfortable than any, and the sound is fabulous. Connection was easy. The price is very reasonable, too; I considered several others at much higher price, with less features.As a Christmas present, my wife liked them but said they were too heavy for her; she retreated to earbuds. So I've now got them for my own use, and I'm happy -- the best I've ever had. I haven't tried the phone feature yet, but if it didn't work at all I'd still rate these 5 stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headsets I've ever had.

    ","Very comfortable. Extremely loud. Great sound. Only a few minor complaints and personal preferences that I have with them. One is that the sound leaks out pretty bad but I didn't buy them to not annoy my neighbor in a close quarter, I bought them for loud stereo sound, it just would have put these over the top and made me comfortable blasting my music that others might look down on me for listening to. Next thing is I've had multiple Bluetooth devices (a couple from mpow) that were for one ear where volume up/down buttons were long pressed to track up/down. It's reversed on this headset. Long press increases and decreases volume while the first press of the positive/negative buttons changes the track. Personal preference of mine i know but I understand these are designed to be used for listening to music and secondarily used for calls unlike the other ones I've had. Lastly the pair mode is a 4 sec long hold of the phone button but so is power off. So every time I want to power down I hold it until it says ""disconnected"", ""pairing"", and after another two or three seconds ""power off"". I really think pair mode should be long press + and - together for 4 seconds. It would eliminate that annoyance entirely and take some commands off of the phone key. Those minor complaints are more to improve future models if the company reads these. Would absolutely purchase again.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headset, nitpicky complaints"

    ","These headphones by Mpow are amazing! I was extremely shocked. I lost my headphones at the gym thanks to the New Year rush and was on the fence about buying the Bluetooth Apple headphones or Beats but couldn’t bring myself to spend so much money no matter how much I tried to justify I needed them. I did some digging online and found these decent reviews compared to others. I’ve gotten compliments on them because they are extremely stylish. It’s also really cold in NY right now so when I wear these it feels like I’m wearing earmuffs because they block out the cold. They also have a sort of noise blocking effect so you don’t hear all of the chatter or background noise so sometimes I wear these at work when everyone is being loud. I love how easy it is to connect to my phone because I’m not super tech savvy and I think the sound quality is great. If you’re really into that loud thumping bass these might not be for you because you definitely don’t get that big boom you would like a more expensive brand, which doesn’t bother me because I still think my music sounds good. Another reason these are great is the cushion. I don’t love earbuds because I get ear infections a lot because I have chronic sinus issues so the cushion helps so my ear isn’t as irritated. I find the large ‘old school’ headphones without the cushion so the speaker is still straight on your ear hurts my ear so all in all I am happy with this purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,An Affordable Choice

    ","These have quickly become my favorite way to listen to music. I have a pair at work and at home. They are very light and comfortable and sound great. I did have an issue initially with my computer, but it had to do with the codec for Bluetooth on my Apple computer. I enabled AAC and AptX and now they sound great. I knew it was not the headphones as they sounded great on my iPhone X and when using the provided cable. The Bluetooth range is longer than other headphones. I can listen throughout my house even if my phone is stationary. The controls are simple, just 3 buttons on the right side. The middle one powers the headphones on/off, pauses music, and pairs Bluetooth. The right one, turns the volume up when held down for a few seconds or skips the track if pressed once. The left button turns the volume down (pressing for a few seconds) or goes back a track with a single press. The headphones also have audio voice feedback which is very helpful in a lovely British voice. (Power on, Pairing, Power off, etc.) While they are not noise cancelling, they do block out ambient noise which is great in a noisy office environment, but may not be safe if walking outside. These Mpow headphones are well made and designed. For $36, they are a bargain.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, comfortable and sound great"

    ","For me they are better then two others I have, Sennheiser RS120 and an Amazon Basics set.  The RS120 set has had a lot of popping and cracking noises in it from day one and the Amazon Basics have an annoying habit of cutting out for about 1sec once ever couple minutes.  These headphones have no similar issues and I love them.  I am not an audiophile by any means, at 73yrs young my hearing is nothing compared to younger years but I can tell that these phones have great sound and to my hearing sound better than the other two.I gave it 5 stars anyway but on the con side there is a minor issue with the bluetooth connection.  Everytime I power them on I get the voice saying ""Power On"" then it says ""Connected"" and then it says ""Disconnected"" But the thing is, it does not connect until it says ""Disconnected"", only then does the sound come through??  I suppose it could have something to do with the BT transmitter but in any case it is a minor issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Much better than my previous 2 sets.

    ","UPDATE on April 2, 2018:  Patozon has TERRIFIC customer service. They sent me a new set of headphones that arrived today.  I did not even know they were sending them to me. What a surprise! Terrific service, and a company that monitors it's social media and customer reviews as well. Great job Mpow!Patozon Customer Service:  Please advise as to the following problem:  NOTE:  One problem has showed up with the headphones. The ""Next Song"" and ""Volume Up"" buttons are integrated into one button. One short click changes to the next song, while ""Press and Hold"" increases the volume. Same thing, but in reverse, for the ""Volume Down"" and ""Last Song"" button.  At first it was hard to increase the volue without simply moving one song ahead, but I thought I solved that problem by pressing and holding the button for several seconds (during which time I heard the volume increase by several levels).  However, after only a couple days it's almost impossible now to change the volumn without the song advancing, even after I press and hold.  The song advances after the volume raises and after I reelase the button.So I have removed two stars for this issue. Really disappointed as, other than that, these are great headphones as noted in my full review below.----Over the past week I have tried three different headphones. The first was the Mpow 059. To be honest, they seemed pretty ""basic"". I would have been satisified with them, but the pause button did not work, so I returned them in favor of a pair of Ausdom ANC8. I liked those much better than the Mpow 059. However, there was no charging cord in the box, so I opted to return them as well.Today the Mpow H1 arrived. When I opened the box I knew they were going to be great. They ae so light that I thought perhaps the box was empty, but they were inside! They are incredibly light. After using the other two sets earlier this week, I was very pleased with how little they weigh and how it's almost hard to tell they are on your head. In addtion,In addition, they are gorgeous. A bit retro, with the wire sliders exposed on the side for adjustment, but I think it's a really nice look. The adjust easily and fit nicely on the head. The ear cups are oval shaped rather than round, so they cover the ear nicely (most ears are higher than they are wide, so I never quite understood how round ear cups were a good engineering choice).  I purchased the black pair with the grey padding under the headpiece, as well as a subtle grey colored trim piece around the exterior of the ear cups. Very attractive looking.Then, I turned them on. Amazing. I was shocked at the quality.  Good bass, but sharp and true mid and high notes as well. The vocals jump out of the ear cups. Terrific quality music. I was amazed. I could not be more pleased. And, let me tell you, these suckers can get *loud*.  Much more so than either of the two headphone sets I had to return this week. Knock your socks off loud, with no apparent loss of fidelity.In addtion, I noticed that the earcups block out much more exterior sound than either of the others I used this week. Very sound deadening.  A quick test showed they leaeked less sound out than the other two models, too.These headphones blew me away. I would spend several times more money for this quality. At $38.99 they are an incredible value.So:  1) They look great  2) They are lightweight and comfortable  3) The sound rivals headphones that cost hundreds of dollars more.No brainer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"(With One Problem) Wow - Amazing quality, great looks, lightweight.

    ","Disclaimer: I am no audiophile, a little hard of hearing most likely due to youth and lifestyle. I also have done a considerable amount of reading/research on the best/most comfortable/durable economical wireless headphones (TMI) and purchased these after being very disappointed in a highly rated pair of a major name brand.Other than a decent sound range I was most interested in comfort, being able to wear the phones for several hours at a time.I was impressed with these out of the box. They appear well made have a good range of motion and adjustability on the head and are very comfortable. The ear cups are soft , supple, and well padded as is the headband which is very flexible and appears will fit most any size head.I used these with a Avantree Priva lll transmitter on a Samsung TV and although these are not aptX LL there was no out of sync (lag) between the video and sound to the headphones(a huge plus).I use headphones every day for several hours and have for years and can say although not the quality of sound they are as or possibly more comfortable as a pair of Bose I have that cost a couple hundred $$.For $38 I consider these a key buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Low $$ High Quality

    ","As soon as I opened the package, I was happy. Solid, soft, light, and comfortable are the words that come to mind. You just feel quality right away. The controls are intuitive and getting them to connect to my TV and my phone was easy. They sound amazing. My one initial concern was that they did not sound loud enough, even with my phone turned up all the way. Reading the manual I learned that the plus and minus signs do double duty. quick press changes the song, long press changes the volume, and not just on the source device like some Bluetooth devices. These seem to have their own volume control beyond that of the source device and I could make them louder than was comfortable, so they certainly get the job done.I cannot yet speak to battery life or how they hold up to long term use, but 18 hours after I unboxed them, I am amazed they were less than $40. I have not been this happy with a purchase in a long time. Also, I have not yet tried to use them for a phone call as that is not why I bought them. My primary use is with my new 4K TV after my wife goes to bed.

On that note there is some sound leakage for me because I have a small head and small ears (but that's a very common thing for me with over the ear headphones.) There is no recognizable static (wireless) and they manage to sound even better wired. The wireless connection length is truly 33 feet (maybe even a little further, better than any Bluetooth headphones I've ever owned at any price point!)

    ","These are an incredible value. I have Beats Studio II's and my wife wanted some over-ear headphones without spending an arm and a leg. So, we got her these. I tried them on an was immediately impressed with the sounds quality. So, I decided to compare side-by-side. My conclusion is that these are about 95% of the sound quality for 10% of the price. The biggest difference was in how clearly some sounds ""clipped on/off"" (if that makes sense).While not active noise cancelling, they do a great job of blocking out sound. Again, probably like 90-95% worth. And the biggest PRO (outside of price), by far, is that I can plug them in with a cord and they don't need a charged battery.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing value!

    ","This is my first foray into over ear headphones so I don't have much for comparison, but on their own, I'd say these are pretty great headphones. While I enjoy in-ear headphones, I'd been looking for something with more punch that could also stay in my ears easier than those rubber-in-ear headphones. This so far checks all the boxes. My ears are a little on the larger side and these cover them perfectly. There isn't much room for them to breathe outside of that though and for that reason it can get warm pretty quickly, but if you're taking a break every so often, it shouldn't be an issue. Additionally, pairing works easily as well, but can cause issues if you have it connected to multiple things. I tried connecting them to my computer and they automatically paired to my iPhone as well. Not an issue in terms of sound, but you could accidentally burn some battery and not be fully aware of it. The padding on time is sufficient. It's not the most comfortable thing, but it's not gonna hinder wearing them either. If I have one issue with these, it's that of sound bleeding. While I haven't tested it with another person, when pushing the headphones against one and other to cover the cups fully, you can hear the sound leaking through at about 50% volume. If you're jamming out on your own then no issue, but if you're trying to listen to music on public transportation, you could be disturbing a neighbor. Just something to look out for. Another small problem is that they don't pair extremely well with glasses. Mine keep getting adjusted even when just putting on the headphones and it can't be fully fixed without removing the headphones and rearranging everything. I say this is a small problem because I've tested many on-ear/over ear headphones (these are just my first purchased of the over ear kind) and they always mess with my glasses. Just something us visually impaired people gotta deal with. Otherwise, I have no other issues with these and would fully recommend them.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"A few issues, but nothing that can't be overlooked. GREAT HEADPHONES."

One is for power (in the middle) and the two outside buttons move tracks forward or backward. If you want to adjust for volume, the solution I go with is to tweak it on my phone. But the function for it on the ear is to hold down longer on one of the outer buttons to bump it down or up. But that is kinda hard to do while running.

Then again, I bought it for the bluetooth capabilities, so I'm not too concerned about it.Build/Appearance: I'm really picky with how my headphones look, and I have to say that these ones look great. It doesn't look or feel cheap. Of course, I wouldn't throw it around haphazardly, but if I were to drop it, I don't think it would break. Be aware that the matte finish does make it easy for scratches and smudges to show up, so if that really bothers you, just beware.Range: I can leave my laptop/phone downstairs and walk upstairs with no breaks or static in connection. My pair of bluetooth earbuds (which I've had for quite a while) do cut out and sometimes disconnect and that has always bothered me. I do expect the connectivity strength to decay after a while, but I won't be owning them long enough to test that out, unfortunately.Oh and connecting to my laptop and phone was extremely fast and easy, so that's a plus.--------Then falling into the 'meh' range, is the sound quality.It's alright. It's nothing to write home about. It's definitely not awful per say, but I've had cheaper headsets sound better. I can't say I would call myself an audiophile or anything, but I am picky about headphones. The best way I can really describe it is that the music sounds very distant. I feel the need to really turn up the volume to get a more immersive feel. (which is something I'll address in my cons).These perform best in the mid ranges. Don't expect great bass, and the high ranges can sound well...just off.-----Cons:Noise cancelling: Alright so, I probably should've checked more before I purchased it but, these headphones offer almost no passive noise cancelling capabilities. It's bothersome since if I'm in the kitchen, I can still hear the hum of my refrigerator fairly clearly. To drown out noise, I need to turn up the volume, and therein lies my next problem.Sound leaking: Oh boy do these cans leak noise. I don't know if its just me, but really don't like the noise leaking from my headset. I don't like bothering people and I don't want people overhearing what I'm listening to. But when I need to have the volume up to get a better sound quality and to block out some of the outside noise, the music leaks quite a bit. I've tested it. I'd say with the volume on my phone a third up, someone sitting near me in the library would be able to notice.I might be too picky on this, but it's something that really bothers me. I don't enjoy feeling worry that my music might be bothering the people around me, even if the leak isn't as bad as I think it is. And since I'm a student, I'm often using them outside rather than in the comfort of my own home. It might just not be a good fit for someone like me. I would skip on this pair if you're planning to listen to some hard rock.Strangely, the higher reviews mention how well the passive noise cancelling are on these cans, and I don't know, maybe it's just me. I know different people like listening to their music at different volumes. My roommate has her volume usually set the lowest and I can barely hear it when I tried to listen to something she was showing me. But honestly, if you don't go into these reviews knowing that people experience audio differently, then I don't know what to say.------A summary if reading all that is too much work:If you're looking for an average pair of headphones that looks good, works fine, and the sound quality is alright, I would say go for it.But if you're looking at these with some higher expectations, I would maybe look around some more and consider spending a bit more for a pair that better suits your needs. I've gone through dozens of headphones looking for a good pair and If there's anything I've learned, it's that trial and error is a good way to find out what you're really looking for.These pair of headphones are by no means bad, and I would recommend them to someone who doesn't care too much about the cons that I thought were dealbreakers. I am by no means an expert or anything, I'm just your average college student who just wants a nice pair of headphones to enjoy music in my downtime. And I might be pickier than most....I was dancing between giving this review  2 or 3 stars. I settled on 3 stars to take into consideration how others might perceive my review. Personally it's more of a 2 stars for me since I can say that I don't like it and that I won't be using it. Although if you took the time to read through it all, you could rate it 3 stars or even 4 stars if the cons I listed aren't things that bother you at all. If anything I hope this helps you better than a review just saying 'its bad don't buy it.'(Although seeing that at this time I did splurge and buy myself a pair of higher end headphones, my review might be a bit more bias at this time since it's hard not to unintentionally compare the quality when I'm testing out both of them at the same time.)",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Mediocre, but alright for price if you're not picky at all."

The only real downside, as mentioned in previous reviews, isthat the +/- volume switches are combined with the skip/backtrack functions. It took a lot of practice to hold the keys down long enough to change the volume without changing the song, and this feature still gives the user a lot less control over how much they want to turn the volume up or down. On a more personal note, I also found that while the over-ear design is very comfortable, it created a lot of pressure which led to severe migraines within just a couple of weeks of use.

    ","Tried these 3 times at the gym and they are simply too heavy. These are LARGE over ear phones better suited to a recliner for watching TV, listening to music or related activities. Trying to decide it I should keep them or send them back. I really wanted to like these phones but as I said, for the gym, they are simply a no-go due to weight.Too bad because setup is simple, instructions are intuitive and the phones pair quickly with an iPhone 7 plus. The three buttons/controls are located on the right side of the phones for easy access and they work well for volume and track changes but take a little practice to get right. There is no ""fast forwarding"" on tracks.Sound quality is very good - surprising bass balanced with a solid mid range while lacking the ""tinny"" sound of most in-earbuds that I've used for years. These aren't going to top $300 Beats Solo 3 phones but for $30, I was pleasantly surprised but could not bear the weight at the gym - these bounce around a lot with any activity.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Simple to pair and use, intuitive controls, good sound, excellent battery life but too bulky and heavy for gym use"

    ","Just received this product. Fully charged and the left speaker doesn’t work.  Sucks!  They seem decent quality but apparently not.  Now I need to print off a label, drive to UPS store across town and ship back.  Wait on the money to be put back into my account. Kinda annoying.UPDATE 3/17/18.Company reached out to me about my previous review.  They sent me a replacement at no expense to insure that I am a satisfied customer.The free replacement is much appreciated and I am currently trying them out and plan to give a review after an extensive time wearing them.  I work 12 hour shifts on nights and listen to podcast basically the full duration of my shift.  I also work around loud equipment and noise cancellation is import.  As of now the headphones are working properly and are sastifactory.  The sound quality is decent especially for he price.  They do get a little rattle sound when a song has heavy base.The noise cancellation is really good considering they don’t fit super right against your head.My biggest complaint is the controls.  I hate the skip forward or backward when you tap the up or down arrow.  I’m sure I’ll get use to the controls but unless you hold the sound volume button for a at least two seconds it will skip track.Another plus is the comfort level.  I haven’t had any issue with pressure points or fatigue from headphones.I’ll do a finale review when I get a few more days or weeks with these.As of now I prefer my Skull Candy Hesh 2.  Although they cost twice as much and aren’t as comfortable on my ears.  Skull Candy Hesh 2 has outstanding battery life and the controls are superior.I’ll be back with more.Just wanted to say thinks for sending out a free pair to make me happy.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Speaker doesn’t work.

    ","Well I ordered these headphones are reading many many good reviews about these being a reasonably priced pair of headphones with decent quality. So onto what my thoughts are, the headphones seem to squeeze my head and ears too much making them quite uncomfortable after extended use. I have been using them now for about 2 hours continuously and my ears are very warm! I am not sure what to do with them whether I should send them back or if I should just stick it out and keep them. The sound is really good, crisp vocals and decent bass. I really wish these we're more comfortable!!!!Overall it is tough to recommend these headphones due to the fact that they are not comfortable because of the pressure it puts on my ears!I am going to try them out for a day or 2 I suppose to see  if maybe they will become more comfortable! Will update review if they do!The build quality seems pretty good and they were very easy to pair with my pixel 2xl!

Like the top and the bottom are completely disconnected from each other, two tracks playing at the same time but not related.My only upside so far??

May be I got defective item. For music listening this device is acceptable and works as expected.Update: I contacted seller because the item had possible defect. While headphones had very good sound, the microphone produced some humming sound when used with cell phone, so other people had difficulty to hear me. I was not sure if it is a defect or ""normal"" for product in this price range. The seller immediately contacted me and sent replacement item, which works much better.

    ","These are incredible headphones and even more amazing that they are only 37.99. I purchased these based on the reviews left on this pair of headphones and the similar Mpow 059s and I'm extremely glad I did. The sound quality is incredible. I'm listening to music that I've owned for almost 20 years and hearing them in a completely new way. It's like I'm listening to a completely new song for the first time. With this headset, you become immersed in the sound without hurting the ear. (I also use these while playing WoW, a game that I've played for years, and have never heard the game so crisply). The headphones themselves are also very nice quality, for the price, and sit on the head and ear comfortably, providing hours of listening without discomfort. The battery charge so far seems to be as advertised but have not fully tested it. In the end, I highly recommend this pair of headphones to anyone who is searching for high-end headphones and thinking they have to spend ALOT more to get this good of quality.P.S. Shipping was also fast and prompt. Very satisfied.",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are incredible headphones and even more amazing that they are only 37
681,"on March 5, 2018",,"These are fantastic headphones! One of my work peers found these, after noticing me working comfortably with a different brand of wireless headphones. I'm old school, in that I didn't believe a previously unheard of brand such as Mpow could offer a decent product like this at such a low price, but I'm pleased to say that I was very wrong. When his pair arrived he let me try them out, and I was impressed instantly by the soft, comfortable ear pads, the overall nice build and feel of the unit and, finally, by the quality of sound.Sound is clear throughout the audible spectrum, with the exception of a slight drop around the vocal midrange (2-4K). Don't let this detract you; these are fantastic phones, and your iTunes or other media will sound wonderful on them. This model does not have active noise cancelling, if you intend to use on planes or in other noisy spaces, but the ear pads enclose your ears so well and block so much ambient noise that I doubt you'll need it in most cases. If active noise canceling is a must, Mpow offers a version with noise canceling for only a few dollars more.The ear pads are very comfortable, and the head band accommodates wider heads like mine so that ear cups don't have to be stretched out to their extremes to fit. The phones I was using prior to these had, in fact, broken on one side because they had been stressed so much, and when I wore them they pressed against my head so hard that I couldn't wear for a long time before they began to hurt. These fit like a glove, and if they last a year or longer before the plastic/rubber padding starts to fleck away as tends to happen with other headphones, it will not be a problem for me to order a new pair to replace them. Unless, of course, they offer replacement pads.These have a built-in microphone which requires no protruding mouthpiece. Sound quality is clear and good, maybe not quite as good as you can get from a good mouthpiece-type microphone, but there's a huge convenience factor to having the microphone built-in, if you want to use as your headset at work. Teleconference calls go smoothly with these, although you can't hear yourself speak through the phones (no feedback loop like we're used to with old wall/POTS phones), so you might have to check your voice level and learn to limit how loudly you speak. This hasn't been a problem at all so far.Battery life is incredible. You can go from zero to fully charged in about an hour on a high-current USB charger (10W+), and you'll be able to listen to them for days before you have to recharge--somewhere between 15 and 20 hours.A 3.5mm cable is included to connect the phones directly, for example, when on an airplane or when the battery on the phones is dead. This is a nice bonus, however, you should know that the built-in microphone is not connected through the cable, so you won't be able to use it when tethered to a device such as a smartphone or laptop. The cable included has a standard 3-conductor 3.5mm plug on both ends. I tried a 4-conductor cable, which would support pass-thru of a microphone in addition to stereo audio, but the jack on the phones isn't wired to the microphone. Neither my iPhone nor my MacBook would recognize the mic through the 4-conductor cable. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to have this, so that you could make full use of these in wired mode.I do recommend listening to audio via the cable, to compare to the fidelity you get through Bluetooth. As much as the Bluetooth spec has evolved over the years, it still does not support the bandwidth required for uncompressed stereo audio, and you can hear artifacts of compression when you listen to audio over Bluetooth that you will not hear when you connect via cable. Bluetooth 5 will finally address this when the specification is finalized later this year, but this device will not be able to take advantage of it, since it predates the new spec.I haven't been this excited about a pair of headphones since I purchased a pair of Sony MDR-V6's over a decade ago, and while these Mpow phones don't quite compare to the Sony's, they're also 1/3 as expensive AND they're wireless. I don't think you can go wrong with these, especially for the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny and then some

    ","Great headphones for the price. I bought these after returning another pair (different brand) that sounded terrible and was a little more expensive.  I guess I am somewhat of an audiophile.  I am a sound tech for a church and enjoy good sound.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the sound quality.  The lows, midrange and highs were very  well balanced. I am a child of the 70s and 80s classic rock era so I like my music hard driving and loud.  These headphones do not dissapoint in that area also.  They are lightweight and comfortable to wear.  I workout with them, work around the house, and use them at church when I remotely adjust individual band members on our mixing board via an Mpow Bluetooth transmitter.I basically wanted a cheaper pair of multipurpose headphones and these more than fit the bill.  Overall an excellent product for the price that I would highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Sound, Lightweight"

686,"on March 6, 2018",,"Never owned bluetooth (wireless) headphones before so I don't have much frame of reference to what brand sounds the best or how different these sound compared to $300 producer headphones, but after reading dozens of reviews, scouring Amazon for the most affordable headphones that sounded good, longevity, and they also gotta look good cuz I'm a taurus in all. I stumbled across these and was only hesitant on the 400+ reviews for this one vs. the 3,000 or 4,000+ reviews for the little more expensive ones that look exactly the same. I was torn for a while and kept searching. I wanted the best bang for my buck.So I kept coming back to the MPOW H1. Never heard of it, just seemed like the best for the price and was curious what memory protein foam felt like on the hears and they're indeed very comfy by the way. Maybe it's because I wear glasses that makes me notice the gradual discomfort of the ear muffs, but that's what it is with all over-the-ear headphones. From the reviews it seemed like a low risk that I'd get a defective product, making me lose interest to hassle with all the returning and whatna. So far I'm loving these headphones. They sound great! They do the job and nothing less.If there's one common annoyance I've noticed with Amazon reviews is the vague one star posters who are butt-hurt over a bad experience rather than a crappy product. These are not bad headphones. Please refrain from giving a low rating just because the delivery took too long or whatever that had nothing to do with the actual product. Don't write an angry single sentence biased review because of the 2% or 12% chance of getting a defective product you can easily return and get another one since many people are happy with these headphones for example. It happens to the best of us, oh well. So don't let the negative reviews scare you off, these are great wireless headphones phones for the price.It hasn't been a week yet since got these so I don't have much to say yet, but so far I'm happy. No real concerns.Pros:-Lightweight-Strong clear bluetooth signal-Well built, not flimsy-Sound quality is crisp loud and perfect, better than expected-The Matte finish is really nice-The memory protein earmuffs-The wireless freedom is really... freeingCons so far-It's not tight enough around my head. I guess my head is big I dunno. I'm a scrawny and tall.-Wish it was easier to turn up the volume without changing the next track. More buttons wouldn't hurt but its no big deal-Not long enough cables. I like long cables.-Bluetooth signal weakens through walls at long distances (is that normal i dunno?)-Doesn't always sync well to videos, depends what it is I suppose.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't let the negative reviews scare you off, These are great wireless headphones"

    ",I was not expecting much. I have tried around 10 Bluetooth headphone in the past month from low end to Bose QC35 which costs 10 times of this one. I landed on this headphone because of the comfort. I have relatively big head and massive ears. This headphone is the only one that does not hurt my ears and my head top. The sound quality is not comparable to Bose but for me comfirt is the most important factor. After that I consider sound quality etc.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptionally good!
688,"on March 18, 2018",,"I compose and mix for a living and have had my ears opened by Sonarworks software by getting my speakers and headphones to a flatter more accurate eq curve. I got the H1's for more ease of use when composing ideas on my iphone and ipad. When I put them on and played a few of my usual reference tracks (Andrew Belle, M83, Coldplay), I was pretty disappointed. A little silly of me to expect anything close to my Sonarworks calibrated Hifiman's / JBL monitors (with treated room).But then I remembered that there are different eq curve settings in my iphone's settings (Settings - Music - EQ). I thought - doesn't hurt to try. I went through all of them and they were all either the same or worse except for one golden, golden curve - ""Lounge"". The lounge setting flattens these out to a MUCH more accurate listening experience. They went from sounding like crappy $30 dollar headphones to really nice sounding $100 dollar headphones. Still nowhere near my Hifiman's as far as listening experience, response, fullness, but as far as the general eq curve - surprisingly not too far off. I'm pretty pumped.3 IMPORTANT things to note though - 1. When switching between lounge and flat you have to turn the volume one click up when you switch to lounge and one click down when switching to Flat for a more accurate, volume matched comparison. 2. If you've already been listening to these for any amount of time - your ears have already adjusted to how they sound - so I'd suggest switching to lounge and listening to some of your favorite music for a good 15 or 20 minutes. When you go back to ""Flat"" - you'll notice overhyped highs and lows. (Don't forget the volume click when comparing) 3. If you're a bass head and prefer more bass than how the music was intended to be heard by the people who wrote, mixed, and mastered it - that's totally fine - you just might not prefer this tip.I'm so pumped on how fantastic these sound now haha.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pro Tip for iPhone / iPad users to make these sound about 10 times better WITH ONE CLICK
