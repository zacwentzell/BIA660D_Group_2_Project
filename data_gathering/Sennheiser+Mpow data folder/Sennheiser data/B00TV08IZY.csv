    ","I upgraded to these from the RS 140's that I purchased over 10 years ago.  Technology has definitely changed for the better.  Definitely set these up using the optical (Toslink) connection so you are getting digital sound.  The frequency response is quite amazing, the quiet parts are dead silent no hiss no hum like on analog TV headphones.  With the bass boost the sound is thunderous!  Range is not quite as far as I would have expected but then again I'm moving from room to room and not within direct line of sight to the transmitter...none the less from one end of the house to the other with few drop outs.  I also bought the HDR 175 Accessory headphone and was concerned about being able to charge only one headphone at a time...so far has not been a problem the charges seem to last a long time (many days) and just rotate the headphones on the charger.  Still order Panasonic Eneloop rechargeable batteries just in case...they are the best longest lasting rechargables available...be sure to check these out.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Technology has definitely changed for the better.

    ","Let's see...16hr battery life, a rechargeable station, and I swear they have some noise-cancelling technology despite what Sennheiser says.  I can wear these all day long.  They are comfortable, the controls are easy to reach and are notched so you can feel them, and they provide solid sound.  I can't speak about the quality of the sound other than to say the bass is there, the treble is there, and I have zero complaints about sound.The headset has some nice padding on top to prevent headaches or strains on your head.  The earcups are padded and cover the entire ear.I took off one star only because it is VERY easy to snap the plastic notches that hold the earcups in place when replacing batteries.  However, there are three of those plastic notches so breaking one won't result in a loose earcup.These headphones are so good, I bought a second set just to have one set charging while I wear the other set.Also, Sennheiser says you can't mix and match these headsets and wireless receivers.  The HDR175 only works with the RF175 and not other units.  Be careful when you're shopping.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The all-day wireless headphones

    ","We have downsized our living quarters temporarily and loud sound is not an option. I purchased these headphones to replace our stereo system for the time being. They replace a 5.1 surround system that has served us faithfully for years. I have to say the sound quality, ease-of-use, and overall end result has been a surprise and a blessing. It has taken a bit of mucking around in the tv/ device/ headphone settings to get the overall stereo effect as accurate as we could, but that was expected. The Bass is rich and relatively tight, the mids are clear, and the high end is superb. We get sound all the way out to the kitchen 30ft away with no problem (yes, snack runs during commercials). I purchased a second pair of headphones for my wife and we have been loving them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,We have downsized our living quarters temporarily and loud sound ...

    ","Recently purchased two units so that I can enjoy movies late night without waking anyone up. Out of the box once I turned one on it didn't register any sound right away. However, upon further inspection I suspect that it was searching for a channel so don't be discouraged if it doesn't have any sound right away. It is well constructed and sturdy.Pros:-Nice sleek design.-Buttons easily accessible on the headset.-ComfortableCons:-uses AAA batteries( and even I don't think this is a huge issue)-can only charge one headset at a time unless you buy another receiver.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Recently purchased two units so that I can enjoy movies late night without waking anyone up

    ","These are great headphones for use with music: I'm using them for watching movies.  They're not surround but they have tremendous bass response and clear mid range and treble response as well.  I like the ability to control the volume right from the headset, control the surround mode, and bass-boost, and with the 2nd set of headphones that works from the main unit I can have a guest wear a headset as well.  Great for late night movie watching when you don;'t want to disturb the neighbors.",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones for use with music

    ","I bought these accessory headphones for my wife. I liked the original set that came with the Sennheiser 175 transmitter, and wanted my wife to be able to enjoy the sound they produce, especially for movies streamed on TV. These are a duplicate of the same headphones that come with the 175 set of headphones and a transmitter. They are great!The single transmitter supports 2 sets of headphones without loss of sound quality to either set.If you have difficulty hearing the dialogue when you play movies, this seems to be the perfect solution. 5 STARS in my opinion.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I liked the original set that came with the Sennheiser 175 ...
6,"on April 7, 2018",,"LOVE these.  I had one pair for my husband, who needs the TV louder than me and who stays up later than me.  But when we would watch some of the British shows, Masterpiece and the like, I missed some of the dialogue or didn't understand accents and slang.  When I used his headphones, I could hear everything so much clearer.  Like going from analog TV to HD digital, you can see so much more detail.  This was the audio equivalent for me.  So we got another set of headphones that worked with the same transceiver he used.  Now we can both wear headphones whenever we like.  Sometimes just him, sometimes just me, and many times both of us are wearing them.  We connected the transceiver to the digital optical out jack on the TV, so we can use the headphones for our live OTA TV, the Firestick streaming TV, and the DVD player audio. Definitely worth the money, we did get them on sale.",5.0 out of 5 stars,No more blaring TV sound!

One American station, I had to try to lip read as the back ground noise interfered with the words.  The Sennheiser head phones have solved our dilemma.

8,"on January 27, 2018",,"A second set of headphones for the Sennheiser 175. They are interchangeable with the pair that come with the transmitter/charger.  You can only charge one pair at a time, so you need to keep track of which ones have been recently charged.  They seem to last 2 or 3 days after charging, depending on how much you use them.  A small gripe, and why I didn't give them 5 stars, is that there's no way to check the remaining charge without putting them back on the charger.  They do give you warning beeps if the charge is getting low, but I'd like to be able to check myself.  When removing them from the charger, it tells you, by 1 to 4 flashes of an LED, how much charge they have, but I'd love to be able to check from my easy chair.

    ",I purchased the RS 175 for my wife and because it would support two headsets I opted to purchase an additional headset for me.  The charging contacts are of a proprietary nature and it appears that Sennheiser does not have a stand alone charger only available.  So my options are to either share the base unit/charge with my wife or purchase a little third party charger and remove the batteries after using the headset and recharge them.So my beef is that purchasing a second headset I would think that Sennheiser would have a charge available for it. Maybe even throw in a charger since the headphones are not cheap at 170 bucks.I will review the RS 175 later when it's up and running. This is only a comment on a lack of stand alone charger.,2.0 out of 5 stars,What! No charger or cradle???

    ","The 175 system is great, but jeeze - why not include with the accessory headphones a way to charge them at the same time as the main set???  You have 2 headsets and have to decide which ones to put on the base station to charge. If you're away for a couple of weeks one set is always not fully charged when you get back, and you have to remember to switch them out before you need them. Seems like a pretty obvious and essential accessory that Sennheiser has overlooked.

    ","The sound through these headphones is wonderful.  My husband is hard of hearing and had real problems listening to the TV so is very happy now with his headphones.  If there are negatives, they would be that the set up was not quite as easy as the paperwork makes it seem (or we are just not very techie!) but we eventually figured out that the transmitter had to be plugged in to our DVR vs the TV, and we found the setting on the TV that allows us to go back in forth between sound through the TV or the headphones.  Also, the headphones fit very tight on the head so it start hurting after a short time of wearing them.

    ","Not going into much detail, but these are EXACTLY what I was looking for.

Got a cheap $30 dollar pair a while back, but the sound was pure crap.So I finally pulled the trigger on these.  A little price at over $200, but after only a week I've realized that price is worth every penny and more.  The sound is phenomenal.  Love the bass boost (which is REALLY strong, even too strong at times) especially when i'm listening to music (mostly on youtube or iheartradio app on the TV).  I'm actually typing this review as I'm back in my bedroom listening to them, the range on these is incredible.  Completely opposite ends of the house (granted i do have a small house).Incredibly easy installation.  I highly recommend using the optical cord connection for best sound.  It comes with RCA inputs which I'll never use i'm sure.  I've read other reviews on here that say the sound from RCA is vastly inferior.The volume controls and virtual surround and bass boost buttons only took me a couple of uses to really get comfortable with, and are very convenient.The batteries take a looooong time to charge (especially initially).  I wanted to try them out so bad when I got home from work the day they were delivered, but didn't want to mess with their initial charge.  The next day I realized I could've just put in two other AAA batteries, but oh well (I also ordered at 36 pack of triple A's from Amazon for about 11 bucks so if they go out while using them, i'll just pop some other cheap batteries in until I get the rechargables going again.Only complaint I have is that the price lowered 12 bucks they day after I placed my order hahagreat product, thinking about getting my wife a pair for her birthday (which is also another great feature.  I can buy another head set for about 170 and it will sync in with the charging dock too).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser:  Shut up and take my money!

    ",Sound very good. Worked perfect after the initial charging session. No problem pairing with the RS175 with or without an additional set of headphones connected. Both fiber optic and RCA settings sound great. Still playing around with the surround and bass settings.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound very good. Worked perfect after the initial charging session

    ","Pairs instantly with base.  Batteries had a charge out of the box so could use it immediately.  Comfortable after long use, not too heavy and very enveloping with passive noise cancellation.  Now I can understand the movies I watch without waking up the kids.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable after long use

    ","Awesome sound quality!!  Very comfortable.  We have 2 headsets running off of the same base and it's great.  And the fact that the product transmits on radio frequency means that I don't have to have the base in direct line with the head sets when in use.  I can put the base out of site.  In fact, my husband can put the trash out on the curb and still hear TV dialog!!!  Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound quality

    ","This Sennheiser 175 is a set of wireless headphones intended for home use that offer excellent range and thunderous bass.PROSPowerful wireless audio output. Digital and analog inputs. Bass mode increases low-end dramatically, but can be disabled. Excellent transmission—never stuttered during testing, even through walls.CONSSound signature is quite sculpted. Can distort in Bass mode on deep bass tracks at high volumes. Not portable; only for home use.A good compare would be this version that is a bit pricier but offers fuller Sennheiser features: http://amzn.to/1jCJgN5",4.0 out of 5 stars,++ Intended for home use but offers excellent range and thunderous bass ++
