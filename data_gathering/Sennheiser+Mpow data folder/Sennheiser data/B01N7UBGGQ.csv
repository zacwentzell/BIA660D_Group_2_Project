    ","This is easily the best pair of headphones I've ever owned. However, with Bluetooth, every review should include, front-and-center, which devices you tested them with. Bluetooth compatibility can be very fickle, and using sub-optimal codecs can lead to inferior results, which are not the fault of the headphones.So I'm writing this review based on my experience with them on two devices: the Verizon/Samsung Galaxy Note 4 running Android 5.0.1; and the Avantree Saturn Pro bluetooth adapter connected by 3.5mm to my Windows 8.1 desktop.As of 5/13/15, there is currently a bug on Android where any bluetooth device will occasionally ""click"" and ""pop"" during playback if the screen is off. This is NOT the fault of these headphones, so don't return them if you experience this. Instead, look for workarounds or updates to your device. You will find that these headphones do not exhibit that behavior on iPhones, Windows desktops, or almost anything else besides an Android device running 4.4.x or 5.0.x. This is an Android problem, plain and simple. I will not be faulting these headphones in my review for an Android problem.I will echo most other reviewers in saying that, physically, these are some awesome-feeling headphones. Very comfortable to wear, very sturdy, very portable. The battery life is fantastic. The tactile feedback on the controls is great.Pairing them is simple and reliable, with all the devices I tested them with.Now, for sound quality, the most controversial aspect. Personally, I think these headphones sound amazing, and I can't tell the difference between music played through these headphones and the music played back through my wired Sennheiser HD-25 II cans, which are high-end studio monitoring headphones.The most important thing you need to know is that, if your Bluetooth device does not support *both* Bluetooth 4.0 *and* the apt-X codec, you are not going to receive the best experience. Unless you can positively determine that your Bluetooth device supports both of these, do not expect the top-end sound quality to be available. If your device connects via Bluetooth 2.1 or 3.0, or does not use the apt-X codec, do not expect good audio quality; it just won't happen. You will be disappointed. You will want to blame the headphones for it. It's not their fault.Now that you've gone out and bought a phone or mp3 player that supports apt-X and Bluetooth 4.0, you may now rejoice in the fantastic sound quality that these 'phones provide. The bass isn't overdriven; the treble is well-defined and nuanced; the dynamic range is excellent. I've listened to genres from pop to classical to electronica to guitar-and-vocal solos, and everything sounds absolutely great to my ears.As far as value, I am sure I will get my money's worth by using these headphones over the course of several years, but at the same time, the price is VERY steep compared to some other headphones that deliver close to, but not quite the same level of quality as these. If you want to save a few hundred bucks, you can easily pick up a very good pair of Bluetooth headphones from a company like Meelectronics. That said, since these cans are a high-end product, you are simply not getting as good of a ""value proposition"" out of them: the extra features, physical stability and sound quality you get from them is not ""worth"" the $250 or so extra you're paying for them over and above an already very good pair of headphones. Only get them if you really feel you need that top-end sound and excellent noise cancellation quality.In conclusion, here are the ""sub-ratings"" that my 5-star overall is based on:1. Physical ruggedness: 5/52. Physical ""feel"" and appearance: 5/53. Portability: 5/54. Ease of use of the controls: 5/55. Noise cancellation quality: 5/56. Battery life: 4.5/5 (there are headphones out there that last longer, but these last more than long enough to go a whole day on a full charge.)7. Sound quality: 4.5/5 with a device supporting Bluetooth 4.0 and apt-X (and NOT Android 4.4/5.0 devices unless you keep the screen on to prevent the ""clicks and pops"" bug in Android itself)8. Comfort on ears: 5/59. Compatibility: 3/5 (you will NOT enjoy the quality of the sound if your playback device does not support apt-X and Bluetooth 4.0, and the wired jack doesn't directly support 3.5mm TRRS plugs like I expected it to)10. Sound volume range: 5/5 (you can adjust the volume to be very quiet and still listenable and high quality, or blast your eardrums out if you so please)P.S. I've had the headphones and have been using them daily for five weeks at the time of posting this review.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect, if your device has the chops to drive them"

    ","Wow.That's about all I can really say. These are my 3rd pair of noise-cancelling headphones and likely my last for many years. I don't think there's really much room for improvement.I've checked out the different options at my local big electronics store, including the Bose QC35 II and the new Sony ANC 'phones. And they're nice. But when I saw the Sennheiser HD1 on sale, I couldn't resist and I bought a set as a holiday gift to myself.First, the noise-cancelling. I have 2 other sets, and they both work well. But with these on my morning commute, I absolutely cannot hear anything on the noisy train. Nor can I hear anything in the loud train station in the city center with thousands of people walking through.Second, the sound quality. I should preface this by saying I have a phone which offers aptX support, which I take advantage of. But really, you already know the sound quality will be great. I've been using Sennheiser products for 15 years and not one has been disappointing. Sennheiser is easily among the top audio brands, which is why I keep coming back. But these headphones are above and beyond. Even with a Bluetooth connection, they manage to sound as great as my wired headset, if not better. They let you hear the details that get washed out by lesser-quality headphones, and everything sounds crisp and spot-on. There's solid bass and soaring highs, and everything in between is perfect. This is how music is meant to sound. I'm by no means an audiophile, but I appreciate the sound quality.Third, build quality and packaging. The packaging included a nice semi-rigid carry case, a 3.5mm audio cable, airplane converter, and charging cable. The case is well-made and fits the 'phones snuggly. The only gripe I have is with the 3.5mm cable, because it's a little bit challenging to get it plugged in correctly, especially with the headphones on your head. Minor gripe, honestly. The build quality is very solid. I'm a little bit afraid the exposed cables could snag something and rip or otherwise be broken, but I'm pretty careful with them and it seems an outside chance that anything will happen. The size adjustment is different but works well. There's a good amount of pressure when wearing these headphones, but it doesn't bother me. I feel that it would not be a good idea to wear glasses with these, though.In all, I highly recommend these headphones. If you're looking for active noise-cancelling headphones that are both quality headphones and block out the world around you, there is no better option.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow

    ","These were an impulse buy. I wanted something Wireless and easy to carry and fold. I have the V-Moda's XS but those aren't wireless. The XS's sound superb don't get me wrong. But, Sennheiser got me with these wireless cans that are almost the same foot print as the V-Modas XS. Both are over the ears and small enough to lug around. I'm not a fan of huge cans that cover half your head. I look ridiculous with bigger cans. These on ear Momentum's are amazing. The sound is superb for a Bluetooth headphone. I have really no complaints. When I want wired, I'll go to my V-Moda's XS but when I want freedom I stick with these Sennheiser's. I have to add though, there is a huge difference going from wired to wireless but these can keep up. That's what surprised me. It's like I am wearing wired headphones instead of wireless. There is very little distinction. The noise cancellation is also a plus with these. They are not 100%. I'd say they cancel out about 75 to 80% of outside noise but they do the job. I mean whats not to like? You get great sound from a wireless on-ear headset, great look and feel. Well build and sturdy. You can use either Bluetooth profile or NFC. You can remove the soft ear cushions to replace them and or clean them. You get a soft carry bag and a nice zippered pouch as well. If your headphones battery drains you can use a snap on cord which comes with it. The battery lasts 22 HR's. Collapsible design. You can pair up to 9 different devices to it. It will play from the last device it was connected to. There is a European woman that gives you verbal notifications when you turn on and off the headphones. The controls on the headset is simple as pie. Small footprint as I already mentioned. I mean...Really!",5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm still in shock!!!

    ","I've been in love with their HD25-1 II for almost a decade.What is the best with HD25-1? Detail. It clearly separates sounds and it doesn't boost any particular sound too much like others, so you can hear and track all the lines in music even when you play it on iPhone. I'm a big fan of Battles (if you know how much sounds they put into a song), and HD25-1 has been the best option available for me to enjoy their music (if you could let me know better one, it'd be appreciate so much btw!).But the only down side with it was the cable. I wear it at work, and the cable always bugs me. Since iPhone is now too huge to fit in my pockets, it has to be somewhere else, then every time I stand up, the cable pulls me.So I decided to give another try to wireless headphones even though I've never been satisfied with them at all anytime I tried in the last 5 years.But, wow, this headphones, is amazing. Of course it's not as exactly clear as wired ones, but it's clear enough and you can still enjoy as much detail!Those wireless headphones used to sound like music being played in the next room, but now, it's like I'm listening with a single layer of Kleenex between my ears and headphones.Plus, design is simple, classic (I'd say), and beautiful, material is great, battery lasts like 2 full-days, control is straightforward, nothing is confusing for me. It is expensive, but it's worth the price. (I briefly tried a BOSE at the similar price range, but I prefer this one for less boosted bass and high tone.)Only thing you may want to know before purchase is you can't expect much on its noise cancelling. You can definitely hear everyone chatting around you. It's more like this: when you cover your ears, you should hear muffled noise, and the headphones will cancel the noise so you hear what you hear when you don't cover. Actually it's a bit better than that but you should expect only that much.Oh, one more thing, if you put this around your neck and run to catch the next train, speakers will hit your collarbone badly. It's light, but it's heavy enough to hurt.",5.0 out of 5 stars,It's just awesome

    ","The sound quality of this Sennheiser HD1 is very good indeed.  I want this on the ear instead of the over the ear for 2 reasons.  The first one is that I sometimes take my headphone with me when travelling.  I need the compact size.  The other is that, while my Bose AE2W is comfortable, it is hot.  I do not like to have my whole ears covered during summer.  Another reason that I picked Sennheiser is that Sennheiser uses high quality material.  This Sennheiser uses Alacantra for covering material on the ear pads.  As much as I like my Bose AE2W, I hate the fake leather covering ear pads.  I have to replace them when the ear pads flicked off black pieces all over the place. If Mercedes would use Alacantra as an option for their car seats, you can tell Alacantra would hold up very well.The Active Noise Cancellation comes as a bonus.  I thought since this is an on the ear pair, the Active Noise Cancellation would not be effective but I was wrong.  I live in a condo and a neighbor was remodeling.  Some worker broke a line on the fire extinguishers.  The alarm on the whole complex was on for about 40 minutes.  It was a loud high-pitched piercing sound that drove everyone crazy.  All my fire alarms in my unit were triggered.  I grabbed the Sennheiser and turned it on.  It worked, while I could still hear the alarm but the sound was reduced to a level that I could live with.  I ended up pumping music with my iPod to the Sennheiser.  Instant Bliss!I have no problem pairing at all.  It would pair two devices at the same time.  Since I use BT mouse on my MBP, my Sennheiser would pair to my MBP as soon as I turn it on as long as my MBP is powered on.  I have to manually disconnect the MBP connection.  Otherwise, pressing the buttons on the side would turn on my iTunes on the MBP whether I want to or not.  The controls on the right ear cup is simple, there is only two buttons.  There are different and easily accessible.  I have no issue with the controls.The carrying case that comes with this Headphone is well made.  There is a dust bag, a charging wire and a connecting wire if you do not want to use BT.  There is a two-prong plug for use on a plane but unless you are flying on a very old commercial plane, you will not need this two-prong plug.After a few weeks of breaking in, this pair of Sennheiser is more comfortable to wear.  It is heavier than my AE2W but the reason is that the Sennheiser is built with Stainless steel headband and thick plastic ear cups. The headband was only tight at the beginning, flexing it is the trick to loosen the tension. It could use a little bit more padding on the headband though.  Due to the weight, this is not a pair of Headphones you would take to the gym or go jogging.  For sport activity, I use my Beats 2 earbuds.  The Beats 2 works great and will stay on with the help of ear loops.Yes, I would recommend this pair of Headphone.  I am glad that I picked it up when it was on sale.",5.0 out of 5 stars,This Pair of Sennheiser Saved My Ears

    ","I bought this set mainly for the wireless and microphone availability.  I have purchased Sennheiser products in the past, and knew the sound quality would be great which it was.  Very clear Audio, very comfortable, and it looks great without looking too flashy.  headphones has a bluetooth connection with a power button and volume buttons within reach.  Headphones are on-the-ear  instead of over.  They fit very comfortably with 3 hours being the most I've worn them in one sitting without discomfort.  Removed a star due to the microphone.  I do not know why, but there is a ""can you hear me, now"" moment when you first come on the line or when you switch mute off.  An additional nitpick is tied to the echoing I can hear when I am on the phone.  So as I am on the phone, and tapping my finger on the keyboard or desk, I can hear it echoing in my headset.  Other than that, it is very seamless, with listeners stating they do not hear any deterioration in my voice and could be mistake for a landline.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Sound, Nit Pick with the microphone."
6,"on March 12, 2018",,"The consensus that seems to be emerging in these reviews of the Sennheiser HD1 On Ear headphones is both accurate and useful in helping to understand the HD1. But I still have a few nits to pick. First, don't hesitate to try them; he sound quality is absolutely fabulous. You could spend many times the cost of these and gain very little in sound quality.  But other aspects of the design fall far behind what I expect from these.  My complaints relate primarily to usability and documentation.  There was no user manual with my HD1, and what I could find on-line is for a different headphone. But there are very few controls to access. Basically there is volume and power on/off. The volume control works well and is easily understood after a few uses. The power control is impossible, requiring the user to find a button that is about the size of the head of a pin. Eventually I learned how to find it and use it. But the other controls are equally tedious and  difficult to use. Each time I start the HD1 up I have to go  to my system preferences, select the device, and then connect to the Bluetooth controls (separate from the system preferences) to verify which devices are connected and reconnect others as needed.  Make no mistake, the sound is glorious, but the tedium makes it a high price. These may play nicer with other computers, but my Mac seems to be unable to get along with the HD1. Too bad such a fine piece of electronics is so weakly supported.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound worth tedious operation?
7,"on February 3, 2018",,"The sound quality is very good, and the noise cancelation works fine, too.  Out of the box, the ear cups are uncomfortable, but I've used other Sennheiser supra-aural headphones that take a while to break-in, so I expect them to get better over time.  The headband, however, doesn't have any real padding.  It's okay if you keep it flat on your head, but sometimes I need one ear off which puts the band at an angle with only one edge pressing into my head, and it gets very uncomfortable.Another thing I don't like about this model is that they only have one switch/button thing for controlling volume, play/pause, and skip/seek.  Pressing the button multiple times, or press some number of times and hold: it's not intuitive at all, and it's easier to just pull my phone out.  My old Sony headphones had separate controls that were very easy to use.The last thing that I don't like about these is that the volume control only changes the volume setting on the device they're connected to, rather than controlling the headphones independently.  I know most Bluetooth headphones are going that way now, but it gives you less fine-grained control of the volume, and like many BT headphones, the minimum volume setting on an iPhone is too loud with these.Other than the above, they're good headphones and the battery life is very good.  I had no problem pairing them with my computer, iPhone, Chromebook, and Samsung TV.  I got a good deal when they were on sale before the end of the year, but even at that price I don't think I'd buy them again.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is very good, and the noise cancelation works fine"

    ","Good looking headphones, and reasonable NC.  Sound quality is good, but not ""wowing"" as I was expecting from other reviews.  The earphones can get slightly uncomfortable (due to pressure) after a few hours, but the material of the cuffs is actually pretty nice/comfortable overall.  Very portable and come in a nice case with room for the included wires.  Of note, the audio cable is proprietary - you cant just use a normal 3.5mm audio cable.  However the necessary audio cable is included with the headphones.  If you have a large head or large ears, you'd probably be better off spending the extra money to get the Over/Around ears version instead of this on-ear version.  I paid $200 for this item (Ivory).",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall nice, very portable for travel."

    ","I was so looking forward to these headphones. I've owned the Momentum wired on-ear headphones for a year now and have enjoyed them tremendously for their portability, light-weight, comfort and very reasonably good sound. They sit front and center in my messenger bag whenever I'm traveling anywhere and are a lot of fun for both music and movies on the tablet. Given that I got them at a very attractive discount to MSRP, they have been a keeper.But. Whenever I use my fitness bluetooth earphones, I always enjoy not having the cord. As a result, and despite the pretty high price, I decided to give the Sennheiser Momentum wireless on-ear headphones a try. Long story short, they are average, plain and simple. Here's the rundown:Form.They are beautiful. Period. The quality of construction is superb and while they are heavier, they are not THAT much heavier than the wired versions. Perhaps just a bit top heavy because of some of the reinforcement under the headband (antenna? battery? who knows.) Considering the bluetooth, battery and noice cancellation hardware, that's pretty great. The felt earcups are very comfortable and I didn't have any problems with heat or pressure while listening to them for up to an hour. Further, I love that they have hinged the headset. Now, the headphones fit even more sleekly into bags and jackets. Don't know why they didn't do that on the wired version. If there is one complaint, I'd actually have preferred a slightly tigher headband so the headphones feel more stable if I should quickly swing my head. Nevertheless, the metallic construction and plastic finishes all feel top notch and are what I've come to expect from Sennheiser.Function.I'll keep this section short since it's subjective but the controls are decent...maybe above average but not class leading. Power is pretty straight forward: one press and long hold until powered on. And on that note, let me add that I do NOT like the English-accented female voice they chose. Way too fake aristocratic for me. Can't we just have a nice and clean midwestern accent? (And I'm from the northeast.) The control button is multi-capable: one click for play-pause or answering/hanging u calls, two clicks to skip track, three clicks to go to previous track, tilt up for higher volume and tilt down for lower volume. It functions pretty well but the controller feels a bit flimsy. It's easy to raise or lower volume but multi-clicking is not a consistent experience. I wish it had a more tactile feel. Anyway, like I said, it's splitting hairs and pretty much gets the job done though it just doesn't live up to the awesome form factor. It detracts a star. Also, I did experience some crackling and connection yips via Bluetooth as others have mentioned around the web. It wasn't all the time (and it could usually be resolved by unpairing and repairing) but it was annoying.Sound.And here's the only thing that really matters at the end of the day. How do they sound? AVERAGE. It really pains me to write this because I LOVE Sennheiser headphones. For my part, they usually have the perfect balance of mid and treble with a delicate punch out of the lows. Unfortunately, the Momentum wireless on-ear just couldn't remote achieve this high bar. It's probably the bluetooth, but even with the option wired cable, it still was way off. So how so? Bass. The bass was just way too overloaded. I can't even imagine how the Urban wireless will sound if they are supposed to be for bassheads. It was just too disappointing. The bass just overwhelms the entire listening experience. Mid range horns and vocals just get lost under it and the treble has to work overtime to offer any resonance whatsoever. In time, my ears sort of got accustomed to it but what results is just muted mids and highs that are not crisp, soothing, jubilant or sparkling. As a result of the bass, they are just muted and hoarse. Perhaps if you love rap or techno, they will fit the bill, but they came up sorely lacking for jazz and rock. Seriously, I had to strain to hear solid vocals and delicate cimbals. Instead, the thump of the drums and the over-vibratto of bass guitars far and away took center stage. If that's your flavor, have at these.A word on noice cancellation.It was actually perfect. Not so overwhelming that I felt dizzy or disoriented inside the cans but strong enough to seriously muffle the goings-on around me strolling around NYC. I've read that some wish that Sennheiser had boosted the NC further but count me in the very happy camp. I don't like when the NC leaves the music feeling stark and naked in a wave of blackness. In those cases, the quiet gets SO quiet that you can almost hear it...if you know what I mean. Here, I think that the Momentum wireless version of NC is ideal and the most balanced implementation that I've ever heard. Good stuff that.Conclusion.So, what to do? Alas, they are going back. I'll try the over-ear version (despite the larger footprint) and see if they can better represent the source audio. If not, there's always the new Beoplay bluetooths to test out as well. Failing both of those, I guess it's back to carrying a wire around and just dealing with it. I'm not yet ready to give up that much sound quality for wireless comfort.Notes.All music played via Android OS on HTC One M8 smartphone and Google Nexus 9 table.",3.0 out of 5 stars,So close but so far away

    ","I was torn spending this much money on headphones. Not a giant audio geek, and mainly needed to get a good noise canceling setup with bluetooth. I love these headphones and have zero remorse. The noise canceling is  really good, the battery lasts forever, and the sound quality is excellent.For those who haven't used noise canceling headphones, they aren't a magic bullet. Basically they can mute things outside to a dull roar from really annoying. I have tried most of the major brands either in stores or using coworker's briefly and the canceling on these is solid. It shuts out most of the noise of the notoriously loud public transport trains where I live and takes my commute from slightly painful in parts to not a thing. And in the office doesn't shut out so much I can't realize someone is trying to talk to me, but mutes everything enough that nothing is distracting either. One feature of noise canceling on these is that when you are on a call it actually pipes in your voice and a little of the background sound to the headphones so you aren't accidentally yelling at who you are talking to, which is nice.They are fairly easy to bend a little to get the right fit, which I have to do to pretty much every set of headphones, and the cups rotate a little in all directions on gimbals to make sure you can get a good seal to your ear. These aren't super tight fitting headphones tho. So if you are looking for secure headphones for really active stuff these aren't what you want. I don't mind doing easy commute biking in them, but wouldn't use them for running or a really challenging ride.For the first few hours I was wondering if I should have sprung the extra money for the over ear model, and I am still not sure. These are more comfortable than any on ear headphones  I have owned and I have worn them for 6 hours straight without much of a problem and really don't find them any less comfortable in practice than my over ear wired gaming headphones. But if I had it to do over I might get the over ear model. These are slightly more portable when folded and since I got them mainly for throwing in a bag for my commute and office work, it's a wash.I doubted the battery life claims on these before I used them, but if anything it is low. I have had these headphones still working more than 24 hours after charging with about 6 hours of active use in there and being on and paired the whole time.I am not an audiophile, so my ear for high end sound quality isn't well trained, but the sound quality here is as high as I can judge. The only problem I was having with them was occasional glitching pops with an android 4 based phone, which was a known issue with the android bluetooth audio drivers and a thing for a number of models of bluetooth headphones, with android 5 that went away and the sound is crystal clear with plenty of range.Have been using these daily for six weeks and not regretted the purchase for a minute.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are excellent headphones.

    ","Just bought these about a week ago, have listened to them every day and I'm a big believer! Using an iPhone 6s, no problems with Bluetooth connectivity at all and the sound is great! Battery life is really good so far, especially considering the active noise cancellation. I recently returned a Wearhaus Arc with manufacturer's defects and it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The Momentum OEBT is a much better set in design and sound quality, and worthy of the price tag. I have a narrow, horse-like face and the headphones fit pretty snugly, but well worth it for the sound and near silence from exterior noises. I wish the active noise cancellation could be toggled on/off for times when exterior noise isn't an issue and thereby squeeze a little more clarity out of the cans, but overall I'm super excited about these!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, design, and easy setup out of the box!"

    ","Spent a good amount of time researching the right pair of headphones for me. I had trouble finding these and other higher end options in a store to try. I ended up just buying a few different ones from amazon to try. The other headset, based on specs I was comparing them to were the Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless (although these were over-ear). My criteria (not in order of importance) were sound quality, Bluetooth compatibility, travel friendly, noise cancellation & mic, battery and finally cost.Sound quality - from a sound quality perspective these are some of the best sounding headphones I have used. I listen to a lot of hip hop and R&B and while I appreciate bass as much as the next person the bass is really natural and not punchy (especially compared to some of the more heavy bass brands on the market). The range really is fantastic and really crisp.Bluetooth compatibility - has been great on my iPhone. It has been a bit of an issue with my computer. This is primarily because I have more than one device connected to the headphones at once (phone and PC). If I am listening to music on my PC and I get a call, when the call ends my PC isn't reconnecting back to my headphones. The issue really stems from my computer, so I can't fault the headphones. Just a warning to folks that if you are using multiple devices (including a PC) that you may incur challenges keeping multiple devices synced. Windows 10 in case anyone was wondering.Travel friendly - while not the most compact headphones on the market these fit nicely in the travel case, include a wired connection, adapters for airplanes, and fold fairly easily into the case. The only issue i've incurred is on planes. I travel quite a bit and having these earphones on for extended periods of time (3+ hrs) can put a lot of pressure on your ears. I read that from a couple of reviewers so I was not surprised, but looking back I may reconsider the over ear version of these headphones. On long flights I have to take off every few hours to relieve the pressure.Noise Cancellation & Mic - I love the noise cancellation. Others have mentioned but they don't have as strong of noise cancellation as Bose. For some that's a disadvantage, but the hollowness and deafness that Bose's noise cancellation creates actually bothers me. To each his or her own, but I don't mind that I can still faintly hear if someone is yelling to me. The real reason I took down from a 5 to a 4 star review is the mic. I know that seems petty for a set of headphones, but since I use these so frequently for my phone I get calls often. I get a lot of complaints from the other end of the call on the hollowness of how my voice sounds. I'm not a big fan of the mic and for a work call will always have to disconnect and just use the phone.Battery - I haven't actually tried to test how long I can get out of these headphones. I've been on 14 hour flights and used 80% of the time and had no issues whatsoever. IMO battery life is great. My barometer is whether it can last across my longest flight. Check.Cost - not the most expensive headphones on the market, but definitely not an affordable pair. I've been extremely happy with them overall for the sheer quality, build, sound, battery life and style. They do look great. All that being said they're still pricey. If you're looking for a deal, these aren't necessarily the ones I'd recommend.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sounding headphones with a few issues

    ","I really like my HD 280 headphones, but between the really long cable and large around-the-ear muffs, they aren't all that portable; I can't hang the 280s around my neck when talking with someone, since I have to hold my chip up to clear the large muffs.  The 280s also don't breathe very well.I got the on-ear momentum 2.0's so that I would have a smaller, lighter, and more breathable solution.  And they work great!  I have an LG G4 and a Samsung Galaxy S7 and a bunch of lossless FLAC copies of my music CDs, so I can take advantage of the lossless aptX bluetooth codec feature.  The 22-hour battery life is incredible too (much longer than any tiny bluetooth earbuds can manage.)The active noise cancellation beats the passive attenuation on the HD 280s hands-down.

    ",These are great headphones. The best I have ever owned personally. I have used them for everything from listening to music on my phone to running a Skype communication at a science symposium for my organization. You can hear everything. Other than music I usually use them with my desk phone and an in line Bluetooth headset base. They work as advertised connecting to multiple devices. They seem to give precedence to whatever played a sound last. I disconnected them from my work cell since the key clicks would come through while I was listening to music on my personal cell. The only issue I have had is when my phone is in my pants pocket away from them with my body in the way it brakes up from time to time. I move the phone to my coat pocket and it works well again. Otherwise people on calls can hear me fine and music sounds wonderful. I occasionally use the cord that comes with it to listen to music. It does not have an inline mic or controls so can't use it to make wired calls. Maybe with a different cable? I like the way the cable locks into the headphones my friend is always complaining about his expensive headphones that the cord bounces when he wears them. These don't have that problem at all. I would recommend these headphones to anyone.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best I Have Owned

    ","I fly numerous times a year both for business and pleasure, and I've been looking for the ideal travel headphones. After using Bluetooth headphones in the past while traveling, I knew bluetooth was a necessity, active noise canceling for the plane was as well.A little background on the headphones I've tried in the past:1) Phiaton Chord MS 530 - cheap feeling, muffled sound at times, very poor noise canceling, but decent battery life.2) Backbeat Pro (original) - great sound, excellent Bluetooth range, phenomenal battery life. However, they were just so unbelievably large and heavy, and one of the earcups/drivers developed a rattle.3) Sennheiser momentum wireless over ear - great sound, great battery life, good to great noise canceling.  Just a little too big for travel both on head and in bag.4) Parrot Zik 2 - great noise canceling, adjustable sound profile was great, but a bit large for travel. This was the leading candidate but the battery life is the worst. At most 6 hours per charge and that's being generous. Most flights don't last that long, but sitting in the airport and waiting during other parts of traveling can leave you without any music. Also, the constant worrying over the battery is a real bummer.Sennheiser moment on ear wireless - perfect size on head and in bag. Noise canceling was surprisingly effective for on ear headphones. Sound was boomy/bassy at first, but I found this to be an ideal sound profile for traveling. You really appreciate the emphasized bass when in the air and in crowded airports. I was able to fall asleep for hours with this on and really enjoyed listening to music when I was awake.This is a keeper!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best portable headphones, especially for travel."

Didn't think of it because Sennheiser is known for their quality. Very disappointed.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Shoddy craftsmanship

    ","I've now owned three versions of the momentum, finally caving and getting the noise cancelling version before a recent trip. These are really fantastic considering the limitations of the on-ear form factor. I have noticed a number of complaints about a couple things I wanted to address:Comfort - if these are hurting your ears after long periods of listening particularly the upper part of your ears or if you wear glasses, try adjusting them so the cups are a bit lower on your ears. The drivers should be fairly in line with your ear canals. The noise cancelling version is a bit pickier because you also want the best possible isolation for best results, so don't be afraid to play with it. Also, after a few months of wear, the pads soften which improves comfort and reduces pressure a fair bit. They still may not be for everyone, but I see a lot of people wearing headphones way too high on their ears, and it's no surprise in some cases why they would have discomfort.Noise cancelling - These are not as effective at noise cancellation as the around-ear model, but they are surprisingly effective. The cancellation is most effective for mid-range white noise such as fans, engine noise, humming noises, etc. Some people seem to think the cancellation is minor but when you A/B it in a noisy environment, you should notice a significant difference in how clear and understandable your audio is It's hard to describe but the difference is even more noticeable when audio is playing. Be careful as a pedestrian, you might not hear cars sneaking up behind you, even when just listening to podcasts. Like any noise cancelling headphones, it will not kill the human voice, but it does muffle it somewhat. Because of other background noise being cancelled out you may notice that you can actually make out some voices clearer when nothing is playing, but they drift off into the background when something is. This is normal.Now for the audio quality. I absolutely love these headphones on the go. Having had a chance to compare them with the more expensive around-ear model, I actually like the sound of these better. The around-ear is closer to what people consider classic Sennheiser sound - more laid back, pronounced mid-bass that is a bit loose at times. The on-ears are brighter, have tighter bass, and I think are better all around for travel. Bass can be a bit heavy if you like ""neutral"" sound, depending on your source (cabled, more on that in a second), but this I have always found works out for the best when in properly noisy environments like mass transit or on a plane. Even with the noise cancellation, the bass helps overcome the lower frequency background noises and equals out to your ears.Here's the weird part though - I HIGHLY recommend using these headphones with a cable. It comes with one, though I use my older android-compatible cable from the previous generation with the cable mic and controls. If your phone/laptop has a decent headphone output, the quality is significantly better than Bluetooth. But there is an added benefit - while plugging in disables the wireless, turning on noise cancelling still works *and* turns on the headphones' built in amplifier. This sounds like a minor thing, but it makes these headphones a worthy upgrade over their normal wired counterparts. It tightens up the bass significantly and just sounds better all-around. I wasn't expecting that and it was a very pleasant surprise. I wouldn't go back to the old model after using these.I know, many people would think it's silly to buy a wireless pair of headphones and use them wired, but trust me, these are still worth it. If you disregard the wireless, it's like having a portable, rechargeable amplifier like a FiiO built into your headphones, plus the great noise cancellation. Also, cabled you get better battery life for both devices, and can still use the headphones if the battery dies. And with a wire, there is less concern of someone snatching them off your head or crashing to the ground if you have the cable secure in your jacket. Regardless, these are heavy enough I would not recommend them as exercise headphones.All around, a great pair of travel headphones, just be sure to buy them at the discounted price - Sennheiser MSRP is a joke. ;) And remember the HD1 is identical to the Momentum 2.0, don't buy that model until the price is adjusted accordingly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are really fantastic considering the limitations of the on-ear form factor

    ","My review got partially deleted before posting so I'll summarize the most important points. They are beautiful and physically well-made, but the negatives were so bad I had to return them:1. Extremely difficult to pairI could only get these to pair with my phone because of the NFC. I tried for several hours across multiple days to get them to pair with my other bluetooth devices, and had no luck.  It isn't the devices, as my old bluetooth headphones (Bose Soundlink) connected to each in seconds.2. Terrible connectivityI suspect good reviews are from those who use these indoors. I use my headphones on my daily commute via both bus and walking, and the signal cut out every couple of seconds. And further, I could barely get any signal at all if I put my phone in my pocket. cannot emphasize enough how terrible the connecion was.I really wanted to love these headphones. I'd wanted Momentums since the 1st gen and was excited when I heard they'd fixed the bluetooth issues for the 2nd. This is not the case. Unless used with NFC indoors all the time, they are useless. For $400 there should be that many caveats",1.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful but ultimately useless

It works well on the street in the suburbs but is basically useless once you get to the city.  People on the other end of the call say that it actually amplifies background noise compared to the standard Apple headphones.  It's useless on the train where low level background noises overwhelm your voice.  In high background noise environments these headphones make the caller sound like they're underwater while everything in the background is heard clearly.So much for these improving my commute.

    ","UPDATE: Connected using bluetooth to my work PC easily (using Sennheiser BTD800 USB). Sound is great. Also works well with Skype for Business too. An added bonus.Still makes one of my ears ache though after 3 hours because of the pressure against it and my glasses. Decided to put on the headphones first and then the glasses ""over"" the headphones.---------------------------The sounds using apt-X is great when both phone and headphones have this codec. Not so good through bluetooth when connected to my PC which does not have apt-X. Wired is the way to go in this case.I bought a dongle for both work and home PC's for these headphones. Just cheap ones but that had apt-X (supposedly). They did not work. In the end, after a couple of tickets to Sennheiser, they suggested I buy the Sennheiser BTD800 USB, which, reluctantly (due to the cost), I did. I managed to get it working at home after much chagrin. Will probably end up using them wired because it's just easier.As for comfort, they're grippier on my ears than my old Sennheiser HD25SP, which I wanted to replace. As such, these ""On-Ear"" headphones press on my ears, which is not a problem, unless, like me you wear glasses. It could cause your ears to ache where the headphones push on your ear which pushes on your glasses.Great headphones. Great sound.

    ","I purchased these elsewhere but wanted to put in a review here. They are that good.To preface this I own the Bose wireless QC35, Beats Solo2 Wireless, and these of course.First off the build quality is out of this world good. Everything from the earpads to the foldable hinge is top notch. Even the button response is incredible. I have yet to find a flaw with the build quality of these headphones.Sound:  These shine here with the pristine sound far beyond the Bose or Beats. The base, the highs, and the mids are as near perfect as you can obtain within a wireless headset that I have ever heard. If you use these with a Mac make sure to google how to enable AptX codec with a Mac. You will need this for higher quality audio codec.Wireless:  These are superb. It's the experience I want with a wireless headphone. Once I have paired it with a device it just pairs FAST. The only headphones that pair as quickly as my Jabra headset, seem instant. And it can remember up to 8 devices (8!). The Bose have a small 1up here in that they tell you what they have paired with, however, I am not concerned so much with a long name honestly. The beats, well, just have beeps and have a hard time with pairing more than 1 device. The winner here to me is the SennHeiser's by a small margin than the Bose, but still better.Noise Cancelation:  The Sennheisers do an excellent job of noise canceling in my honest opinion. They are very slightly less good then the QC35. My colleges at work normally have to throw something at me to get me to hear them. And 18-22 hours of battery life on one charge for all this in a small form factor is incredible! The winner here is Bose, but just barely, and I would take sound quality over that any day.Really though these are just stunning to me and for $225 right now you will have an impossible time of finding all these things for this price. My goodness the sound is amazing. Do yourself a favor and buy them. I feel like I should need a DAC to get this sound out of a wired headphone much less wireless over AptX. I don't even have the over ear version, but I wish I did as the passive noise canceling would be even better I would imagine. Those however are not $225 ;-)Well done Sennheiser, well done.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 On-Ear Wireless

    ","I'm a semi-pro musician with a good set of ears, not an alleged golden-eared audiophile.In recent years, I have been very impressed with the sound quality and comfort of earbud headphones, both wired and more recently wireless.So I was interested to find out -- courtesy of the Amazon Vine Program -- if the sound quality of an expensive pair of on-ear cans like these Sennheisers was worth the high cost and bulky form factor.In the beginning, I thought the answer was NO -- until I got a Bluetooth dongle for my computer that supports the AptX sound system.  But let me report my initial impressions first.Basically I put these Sennheisers up against a few earbud sets I have on hand: Sennheiser's own wired noise-canceling CXC 700's; the wireless Sol Republic Shadows; and the wireless Jabra SPORT PACE earhook buds.  (I didn't test the phone capabilities of the Momentums; I am concerned only with their use listening to music.)For listening material, I chose selections from three beautifully recorded albums: Louis Lane and the Atlanta Symphony's digital recording of Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man and Rodeo; Bucky Pizzarelli's ""Pizzarelli Party""; and J.D. McPherson's ""Let the Good Times Roll"" (which I heard him play live in concert a few months back at Webster Hall here in NYC).I tried my best to equalize the volume among the four contending earsets, although I had to do this by ear, not sound meter.Basically it was pretty much a four-way tie.  All the headsets sounded great, and I would have been hard-pressed to say which one I was listening to at any time, except for the obvious clues of form factor (on-ear, earhook, in-ear).Actually, the primary distinguishing factor was the noise isolation of the different devices.  The wired Sennheiser earbuds gave the most noise isolation, followed by these Sennheiser Momentums, followed by the deep-insertion Shadow earbuds, trailed by the Jabras.I was surprised that the active noise cancellation of the Momentums didn't equal that of the CXC 700's.  I have a fan-driven air filter on the job in my living room.  The CXC 700's made that sound disappear completely; I could still hear a slight whir through the Momentums.But then I got the PC dongle that supports AptX and listened to some music.  Now it seemed that the Momentums had deeper, richer bass than before.  So if you have a music source that supports AptX -- and you like deep bass -- wearing these expensive cans may actually be worth it for  you.Another factor in favor of the on-ear Momentums is the complete absence of any microphonics -- that's the annoying sound you hear when earbud cords rustle against your shirt collar, for example.But $400 is a high price to pay to eliminate that problem, when the Jabras' earhook design provide a solution for just $70 a pair.Other positives in favor of the Momentums are excellent rejection of the interference that plagues many Bluetooth earphones when you're walking the streets of NYC, especially at intersections for some reason.  The Momentums and Jabras are almost entirely free of interference; the Shadows and Motorola Buds I also have on hand are far more susceptible.The Momentums also paired up and reconnect quickly with my Philips GoGear Ariaz mp3 player, LG Sunset Android phone, and Windows 7 PC.  No problems there.A nice storage case and travel pouch are included with the Momentums, along with miniplug and charging cables and an in-flight adapter gizmo.Given their bulk, would you want to take the Momentums traveling?  The long battery life (22 hours after a 3-hour charge) and noise cancellation say YES, but the size and weight compared to earbuds might say NO.Two minor negatives I encountered with the Momentums were: difficulty accurately pushing in the multi-function toggle volume switch, to pause music or skip forward or back; and the lack of a full user's manual in the package.  A less-than-useful Quick Start Guide is included, but I had to ask Sennheiser by email about the manual.To their credit, Sennheiser got back to me by email within a day with a PDF of the manual and said there was a link to it on their website's product page, which I hadn't been able to find the day before.In summary, then, the Momentum on-ear Bluetooth headphones offer great sound at a premium price.  In my opinion, however, there are a number of Bluetooth earbuds offering sound very nearly as good for much less money and with a more compact and comfortable form factor.PROS:* Excellent sound, especially with an AptX-enabled source.* Very good (but not excellent) noise cancellation.* Superior freedom from Bluetooth interference.* 22-hour battery life on a 3-hour charge.* Comes with nice storage case and carrying pouch.* Earpieces fold inwards for traveling.CONS:* Very high price compared to Bluetooth earbuds of comparable sound quality.* No instruction manual in package.* Multi-function toggle switch fussy in operation.* Not sweat- or moisture-proof.* Not as comfortable to wear as earbuds.UPDATE: I must report that I find these headphones somewhat uncomfortable to wear after several hours -- the ear pads squish my ears.  I guess this discomfort is inherent in any on-ear headphone design, so if you expect to wear a pair of cans for long periods of time, you may want to pop for Sennheiser's over-the-ear design instead.  Or go for a pair of BT earbuds, which sound quite excellent these days as well...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great with AptX Sources

    ","I already have two models of noise cancelling headphones, both corded, the Sennheiser PXC 250 II and the Bose QuietComfort 15. The PXC 250 and the Momentum are on-the-ear models. This Bose is over-the-ear.Key review points:- Sound: The Momentum 2.0 has a better sound then the PXC 250 and the QuietComfort 15. The highs are nice and clear without vibrations and the lows seem to give that nice reverberation a good base unit should give. This is of course all subjective, but I do love them from a pure sound quality perspective.- Comfort while sitting: The Momentum is extremely comfortable to wear for several hours straight, but after 3-4 hours they do start to pinch my ears a bit. This is much better than the PXC 250, which I can only wear for a few hours tops. The Bose on the other hand I can wear much longer, like for the entire 7-8 hour flight to Europe.- Comfort while trying to sleep: The Momentum is the worst of the lot if you try to sleep sideways with your head as I tend to do. The metal side studs that hold the ear pieces in place just crunch wrong. The Bose is again the best to sleep on, and the PXC 250 starts hurting really quickly.- Connectivity: Since both the PX 250 and QuietComfort are wired models, this is where the Momentum shines. It is very easy to connect with Bluetooth or NFC, no wires that get entangled or when I have to get out of my seat. In addition you can also wire the set which even if the battery is down, keeps the headphones working!! This is an ENOURMAS plus, since both other models have no sound.- Noise cancelling: I thought the Momentum is better than either the QuietComfort or the PXC 250. This could be because they feel snugger on my ears.- Size collapsed: The PXC 250 is the smallest and fits in your coat pocket if needed, but it is not a fair comparison since they are in a very different class then the QuietComfort and the Momentum. Between the Bose and the Momentum, the Momentum is smaller, and the case gives a little which makes it easier to tuck away. The case also has some space for the extra USB wire, similar to the other two units.- Charging/battery: For Android users, the benefit of the Momentum is that you can re-use the same micro USB wire from your phone. The Bose and PXC 250 use AAA batteries, so they can be switched out easily. As mentioned before both the PXC 250 are dead in the water unless you have battery juice. The Momentum can keep playing music (without noise cancelling).Overall, I will keep using the Momentum on any short distance flight. On intercontinental flights, I will bring the Bose since I really need to be able to tilt my head to the side if I want to sleep. I should have gotten the over the ear model, since I do like the sound and freedom of the Momentum more.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sounds headphones with ultimate freedom

You could clip to your carry on with the loops that are the zipper pulls but this caused them to fray and break.

    ","I have now bought and tested the Bose QC35, Bower and Wilkins P7, and these the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 ""on ear"" wireless headphones. I did not receive a discount on any of these products. I first received the Bose, positives they were REALLY comfortable and the noice cancellation was excellent, maybe a bit too excellent. Which brings me to the sound, for lack of a better were these headphones sound muted. I don't know if the internal feedback microphones dampens the sound, but the sound was not to my liking at all. It was just muddled and no clear treble bass or mid-tones.The Bower and Wilkins have excellent full sound and are on par with the excellent sound of the Sennheiser. The sound of the two were different. The Senn's had a crisp clear sound for all levels, I was hearing instruments never heard before with other headphones, but the ""on Ear' are REALLY uncomfortable.  It brought me back to my high school wrestling headgear. The pressure on my ears was too much to use for even a 1/2 hour.The Bower and Wilkins are the ones I have kept of all three. They are also uncomfortable but in a different way. These are actually slightly tilted which puts the bottom back part of head phones resting behind my jaw, pushing on my glands behind the ears.I have just purchased the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 ""OVER EAR"" version which will be here tomorrow, and hopefully they will have the great sound of the Bower and Wilkins, and other Sennheiser with a better fit and comfort level.

    ","I've only used these for about 15 minutes, so I can't comment on comfort or durability. However these headphones are very loud with volume setting around 60% using an iPhone 6s. The sound is excellent, they are very well balanced with excellent bass, mids and highs. I'm playing a mix of 70's - 2000's rock and it handles all very well.I will comment (if Amazon allows, they don't always add my updates) further as I have more time to test.UPDATE 1:  I've used the Momentums for several days now and I can say without a doubt they sound awesome!  However I have a problem with them.  The left ear pad KILLS my left ear.  I'm very good at problem resolution however I cannot resolve why it hurts my left ear.  So in my problem resolution, I turned the headphones around (left pad on right ear and vice versa) and the pain goes away.  Don't understand why this is.  I've even spent considerable time making sure the headphones are on each ear exactly (as close as possible) and yet it hurts my left ear.  Looks like I will end up returning these to Amazon, which I hate because other than that they are perfect in my eyes (and ears).Update 2: after having a chance to view someone else getting their M2's and unboxing them, I realize that mine were not new but used. I noticed some covers on the ear cups had been peeled back and then placed back on. The airplane plug bag had been cut open since the bag was cut sideways and taped back. The cable bag had double sided tape holding it together. And the charging cable was not sealed in a plastic bag like the new one I saw being opened for the first time. I understand that things have to be resold for a profit but it makes me wonder if the other person returned them for the same reason I did and maybe they are defective? I might order them again to see if I can get a new pair, these are really nice headphones, that sound excellent.Update 3: I just purchased it again. I really like the sound/look/quality of these. Hopefully Amazon will send me a new one this time. If not, I'm giving up on purchasing Bluetooth headphones for now, just not having any luck with them.Final Update: I'm keeping these unless something happens to them before the return window expires.  This pair appears brand new where the other pair was questionable.  They. sound, look and feel excellent.As for the left ear pain I had on the last ones, I had it again on these.  However, I stood in front of the mirror, analyzed what was happening and corrected it. My ears stick out ever so slightly but not to the point of my friends teasing me about it, maybe they are normal?  What I found out was, the cartilage in my ears near the back stuck out slightly and that's what caused me pain. The cushions on the ear pads pressed into that cartilage so I just moved the headphones towards the back of my ear, while still sealing off the front and the pain went away. Basically it put the cartilage inside the ear pads thus eliminating the pressure on the cartilidge.These are keepers!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent....but

    ","I wanted to write a review about the great sound, the effective noise cancellation, the easy-to-use controls, and the nice look and feel...Instead, I need to focus on the sub-par Bluetooth connectivity.  I'm frustrated that flaky Bluetooth ruins otherwise good headphones.  Some notes:* Initial pairing with a device does not always work: With my Samsung Galaxy S6, I needed to attempt the pairing multiple times before the connection was made.  After repeatedly turning the headphones off and on, finally the connection was made.* Once paired, there were still connectivity issues.  Here's what should happen when turning on the headphones: a pleasant voice will say ""Power On...Connected"".  Here is what actually did happen: ""Power On..."" then, wait...and wait...and wait.  And the connection never occurs.  Turn the power off, and back on again, and after a couple attempts, the devices were connected.  But even then, for the first ten seconds or so of audio (tested using Spotify), the connection was still breaking up.  One time (here, it was with my iPad), the voice on the headphones said ""Connected"" three times in succession, suggesting that I was quickly losing and regaining connection.* The multifunction button (for volume, pausing, and track selection) became unresponsive.  I suspect this is also a Bluetooth issue.  After turning off the headphones, and then turning them back on, I was able to get the button to work again.It's all very frustrating.  The sound, as other reviewers have noted, is very good.  The active noise cancellation works well for me (it nicely blocks the sound of my furnace).  When it works, the multifunction button is very easy to use.  But the Bluetooth issues make it difficult for me to recommend these headphones.These are quite costly headphones, and so it seems reasonable to expect that Bluetooth just works, right out of the box.  Unfortunately, this has not been my experience.  It is fair to note that there are many glowing reviews here, some of which make no mention of the Bluetooth issues.  So, perhaps my set was buggy.  Perhaps they work well for almost everyone but me.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth issues ruin otherwise great headphones

    ","the price tag was really a bit high when i bought it and the highs could be a bit better for the price,  therefore 4 out of 5. Soundstage of course not as good as 40mm membranes. but still good, design, quality etc.A very good product. High quality.Has a well pronounced bass, but still not too much. The quantity of the bass matches close my taste.Personally, I do not find the sound overall better than the in ears Samsung Level U pro. The Sennheiser has a bit shrill higher mids and high (judge the highs with cembalo and violin here: [...] ) The sound of the Level U pros is more real. The Sennheiser has a bit added fun ""bass"".But my taste likes both the sound of the somewhat bassier Sennheiser and the Level u pros. I like the bit punchy more bass property. The upper mids and highs however, are better from the Level U pro.At the end it is a question of taste and also a question of what music or sound (nature films etc.) somebody listens. For nature films every rustling is good, for older classical recording high trebles could be nerving.Advantages from on ears are the slightly less weight, somewhat less sweeting and in contrast to in ears you can listen longer without getting tired or damaging your ears.By time the on ears might press too much on your ears. But for me it works to replace the hearers 0.5-1 centimeters after some listening time.I like the physical concept because there is less plastic, the weight also is lower compared with some other headphones and I prefer mechanical controls in contrast to touch (as the important things in airplanes are controlled manually too).I would say that the price of 274 chf is justified considering the quality and sound. It's still a bit high but maybe the price will drop.This is not a long term test but only one of 14 days (!).When comes the direct contender to the level u pros from Sennheiser (bluetooth, optional 3.5mm jack, U neck form, silicon as well as memory foam tips, adjustable bass like the IE 80 and leather or wood surface instead of plastic)??????tx2bt vs. shb5900 (shb5850 in us)the tx2bt have a little more bass. the shb's possess already a good amount but orchestra sound it might be a bit too less.it's a question of the price, the tx2bt are more expensive. the shb buds are very small so that somebody can lie on the side ofhead.the tx2bt have some more room that the level u pro but are not more detailed (a bit less). the high's of philips can sound somewhat harshat higher volume levels.the formfactor for the shb5900 is good with small oval buds, lightweight cord... u can even lie in your bed on the back or side of your head, with bigger sized memory foams they won't fall out. A trick for the shb's and tx2bt's is, not to hang the cord down the neck but to draw the cord over your head then the ends of the cord behind the ears before plugging in the buds. With a bit tension it will hold with freedom of movement.since i possess the tx2bt's these are my favourites and fidelio's when cord is desired. at home i often listen with the on pros or level pro u's.The tx2bt are my favorites. The U design from the level u pros has the advantage that the buds do not fall out when turning the heat. However, the tx2bt have more bass and more room. The level u pros somewhat more detail and the shb 5900 have not much less bass. The tx2bt and shb5900 can get somewhat harsh at higher volume levels (eg. violin).Philips tx2bt or tx2 vs fidelios s2the tx2 have more bass and roomfeeling. the fidelios maybe a bit more detail. but i recommend the tx2 over the fidelios.Personal ranking:1. Samsung on's pro: the on's clearly have the biggest soundstage, therefore 1st place (differentiation to 2nd place headphones: the tx2bt and shb5900 are very clear, good balanced, havea bit more depth than the level pro's and have good but a bit harsh highs at bigger volume levels).2. Samsung Level U Pro, (EXCELLENT, had no bluetooth connection problems as others reported), better defined than these below, have very good upper mids, treble, Level On Pro has a bit more soundstage and pretty good ANC... / Philips Fidelio s2 with headphone jack (can be set not so loud like the level u’s or the Philips tx2bt (bluetooth) / Philips tx2bt are a bit less detailed than the fidelios but can be set louder, for some folks favorable because they have not the plastic U of the samsung, however can fall out when turning head , / Philips SHB5900 bluetooth the Level on & U pro are a bit more detailed. i like that the philips are well balanced (through all frequencies (!)), lightweight and they have a cord without the U plastic that I like, however can more easily fall out of the ear when turning head3. Sennheiser momentum on ear wireless, they are not better than the Level U Pro, have a bit more bass, upper mids and treble less well defined than level U pro (it's a question of taste, music and habituation) / H.ear in NC, sony should offer more for the price... / MDR-XB650BTpretty good for the price, less realistic than samsung pros, for some people already a bit too much bass but the other frequencies good also highs, less soundstage than Samsung pros,better highs than Sennheiser's, very lightweight and comfortable, long battery lifetime, negative: u can't fold them, no anc / Genuine Samsung S5 (EHS330) earbuds (they are very good earbuds for the price). Better highs than these below. Only slightly better than xb90ex / Sony xb90ex / mdr 7506 very good sound stage, but somewhat artificial, neutral and not too much bass...4. sony h1 (have distortion, the S5 don't and have better highs / sony xba-c10 (xba-c10 have better mids, highs but less bass than H1) / sony btn 200 bluetooth a bit more muddy than these above, but not too bad actually / Yamaha EPH 100 (very closed in)5. panasonic 120k / Brainwavz Deltas6.

    ","These headphones are amazing in almost every way. Their one design flaw is the metal guides employed to hold and adjust the size of the headphones. I have a large head, and in order to make these fit, I need to shove the earphones into their highest (ie, smallest) position. This means that I have the metal guides dangling several millimeters below the earphones.Sounds like a minor issue, right? That's what I thought, until those small metal overhangs began to rub against the collars of my oxford shirts and any jacket, every time I turn my head.The scraping sound is amplified of course, and it's like fingernails on a chalkboard.Who are the giant headed people purchasing these? I've got a large head, so this whole avoidable issue makes no sense to me.A good example of engineers not working with customer service reps and marketers during the design process. For $400 I expect near perfection.",3.0 out of 5 stars,One design flaw
118,"on January 29, 2016",,"These are the best sounding headphones I have ever owned, although that's not saying much. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone that listens to solely classical or all natural instrumental music. These do have a slight bassy lower end, although it is still very crisp.I listen to mostly electronic or more modern rock music that has intentionally exaggerated bass to begin with.Also, I'm no audiophile and the most expensive headphones I have owned before these are the Bose in ear IE1 and IE2. These blow them away in sound quality in all the ranges. The Bose sounded very crisp but these Sennheisers take it to the next level.An example of the sound quality:I was listening to a song by one of my favorite artists and I never heard the way the singer fluctuated his vovals before because it would get rounded off and muddled together with everything else.These are a great set of headphones for someone with a decent budget and want the Sennheiser quality but something more trendy. Although I wish I would have spent the extra $100 to get the around ear headphones for comfort reasons.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great! Hearing my music for the first time all over again.

120,"on December 9, 2017",,I got these for Christmas last year. These headphones sound amazing and have great battery life. They’re also very comfortable. The down side for me is I have had these for less than a year and the plastic piece that held the left speaker at the preferred height on the slider broke and so now that side doesn’t hold the height I need it at. For such an expensive headphone I’m surprised and disappointed how fragile that was as I only use these for when I’m commuting on the bus or sitting at my desk at work.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, hardware quality is ok."

    ","Edit:-The headphones have weak to moderate sound cancellation, poor for the price range.-The headphones do not work well with macs. The Bluetooth signal is unsteady and crackles A LOT.-The alcantara cushions are smooth but not soft enough for long term use. Your ears will hurt if you don't rest them a bit after prolonged use.-Over all, they are quite expensive for what they actually offer and DO WELL outside of great sound quality.There are wireless headphones, there are portable headphones and there are noise canceling headphones. There are even headphones with combinations of two out of those three, but you will NOT find a pair of headphones with all three of those features (WIRELESS, PORTABLE, NOISE CANCELLING). Even better, it sounds pretty good.This review tells you how it is based on first impressions. Whether it is a good or bad thing is highly subjective and solely based on what you would like in a pair of headphones. You can interpret each point as a positive or a negative depending on your preferences.Sound: Sounds very good. Clear crisp vocals. Deep controlled bass more on the high than than low end. Volume gets loud enough; same volume as with a cable. Sound leakage is moderate in a quiet room, so using in a noisier environment should reduce detectable leakage.Portability: It folds up nicely. The hard case is a bit large so will probably be better to use the pouch instead if portability is of paramount importance.Accessories: comes with an airplane adapter and a USB cable. Also comes with a 2.5mm to 3.5mm headphone jack. No controls on the cable. Hard case and soft pouch also included.Features: noise cancellation does have a minimal hiss, undetectable with music.EarPads definitely need breaking in due to stiffness from lack of use. Headband is flexible with little to no cushion.Buttons minimalistic, ergonomic and straight forward. Light pair of headphones.These are first impressions. I will test the microphone for calls and perform further tests on noise isolation as well as the noise cancellation.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Only pair of wireless headphones with Noise cancellation and Portability.

    ","I just purchased both the Momentum 2.0 Wireless (on-ear) and the BeoPlay H8.  The Sennheiser has Bluetooth problems!  The BeoPlay does not, and they both cost about the same - $499 for the H8 (on-ear) and $399 for the Momentum 2.0 On-Ear.  I am unable to connect at all to a PC with the Bluetooth on the Sennheiser while the BeoPlay connects effortlessly to both my PC and my cell phone at the same time.  This dual and effortless connection capability of the H8 is great since I can use my PC while receiving phone calls.  I was surprised at the great fit of the BeoPlay H8 while the Momentum 2.0 starts hurting my head from the pressure within 15 minutes.  For this much money, the Momentum 2.0 should be perfect, especially for a version 2 after years of feedback from the first Momentum headsets.  I am very disappointed given the great luck I have had with the Sennheiser Bluetooth phone ear-sets.  What make matters worse is that Sennheiser is even selling the On-Ear model since hey know they have a Bluetooth problem and have stopped production of the $499 Over-the-ear model.  I would recommend all wait to see how the fix works before spending this much money. I am returning my new Momentum 2.0 after one day of use.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do Non Buy the Momentum 2.0 (any wireless model) Until AFTER Sennheiser Resumes Production to Solve Problems

    ","These are really attractive headphones.  However, they have some problems.  The reason I purchased them was to block out noise at work (office environment with cubicles).  The headphones are not effective at blocking the noise, and at times I think they actually amplify certain noises such as music.  Also, they make my ears sore if I have them on over 30 minutes.  I have a smaller head and purchased the on-ear style because they are less bulky.  I wear reading glasses and have to dangle them above my ear so the temples do not squeeze.  And finally, I thought that playing some of my own music (soft spa-type music) through the headphones might help drown out the other noises, but you can't lower the headphones' volume to a soft level.  I don't want music played loudly this close to my ears.  I can't even listen to my own music privately now.  I should have returned them.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Sorry I bought them for three reasons
