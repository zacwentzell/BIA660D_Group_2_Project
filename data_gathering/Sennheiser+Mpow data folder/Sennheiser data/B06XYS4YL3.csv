    ","The sound is excellent for me especially with the added Speech Intelligibility feature active.  The rating would be a 5 except for two things:(1) the stethoscope style headphone is very heavy and uncomfortable suspended in the ear.  Some of the adjustments are on the base module, not on the headset (annoying) which, I assume, was to reduce the weight of the device.  I find myself lifting the headphones slightly off my chest to relieve the pressure in my ears or I use one hand to hold them pointed directly upward toward the ceiling to relieve the pressure and fit the ear buds further into the ear canal (see 2 below) .(2)  The earphones do not fit securely in the ear canal with either of the padded fittings provided so there is a significant amount of external sound bleed. That  is, although the TV sound is much improved using this set,  I hear the TV ""twice"" with a millisecond delay between the signals.  I find myself pressing the earbuds further into my ear canal to reduce the external sound. An additional set of full earphones placed over the headset also eliminates the sound bleed but adds to the discomfort.In summary, this rating would be a 5 except for weight of the headset and the incomplete fit of the ear buds.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Heavy headset and sound ""bleed"" resulting in double signal with delay"

    ","These wireless headphones produce excellent sound. I am of an age when my wife keeps telling me to turn the TV sound down. This unit hooked up easily to the optical sound output on my LG TV. (You could also hook it up to the headphone jack - but you get better quality sound with the optical output) So, now my TV has a sound bar fed from the headphone jack and the headphones fed from the optical output - and I just use my TV's remote to switch from one output to the other.The design is very sleek and the base station also functions as a charging cradle for the headphones. The transmitter has enough range and I was two rooms away before it cut out.Here are the things I do not particularly like.1) When you are wearing the headphones, the volume controls are up against your chest instead of being on the side away from your chest.2) I would have preferred that more control buttons were on the headphones and fewer on the base station3) At my age I find it hard to see black buttons on black plastic - how about a little color on those buttons?

Maybe it was the TV or box connection. To check, I hooked my old Sennheiser up to the same equipment and, voila!, everything worked as usual. So, back the 5000 goes. I'll get another 840 instead.

    ","Works better than advertised.  I purchased this to supplement my hearing aids.  I don't hear lower volume speaking from typical cable TV shows and movies.  These wireless headphones definitely improved my hearing experience on most shows and movies.  Depending on what I am hearing,  I adjust my sound bar for treble and bass and I adjust the headphones for type of sound.  The headphones fit well with or without my hearing aids  although sometimes I get a  slight echo which I can pretty much adjust out by increasing the headphone volume. I think this is a minor latency issue between the sound bar and the headphones.  These headphones allow one to listen at the volume they want without affecting the sound level for every one else.  When wearing the headphones without hearing aids and with the ear buds well sealed this headphone provides excellent sound.  I did run into a small problem with the limited audio inputs from the TV to the base unit for the headphones.  That was mainly due to the fact that I have a sound bar connected to one of audio inputs and I had to get different audio cable to connect up the headphone base.  This was fairly easy to work out and in my mind did not affect the number of stars score.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great supplement for my hearing aids.

    ","The promise of these headphones is to help people whose hearing has degraded due to age. The Speech Intelligibility function on the headphones help filter out the sounds within the TV show (noise, music) to help clarify dialog--a very smart touch. However, if you don't can't use the headphones effectively and comfortably, it negates all the good stuff.First of all, you can easily see that these headphones wear like a stethoscope. They are clunky. They are ugly. They are heavy. They aren't particularly comfortable on the ear even though they claim to have pressure-free wearing comfort. If they aren't comfortable, people not going to use them. Simple.Second, the different sound modes (including the Speech Intelligibility function) are set on the BASE, not on the big, clunky headset. So you have to set and change the sound modes at the base, vs on the headset. With that big, clunky headset...why would you do that? And changing those modes are not intuitive at all. The settings are remarkably hard to see and the user guide is cryptic at times. If you're targeting an audience of seniors, wouldn't you want to make these functions clear and easy? Puzzling.Third, the volume controls on the headset are hard to see. Again, you're talking about a specialty product that is geared towards people who are experiencing age-related hearing loss. Wouldn't you also want to design for the needs of those people? Big, easy-to-see buttons? One easy button to change modes?I'm puzzled at the lack of understanding and accommodations for seniors who are the very target for this product. The sound is good, but the product leaves a lot to be desired.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds great, but the design leaves a LOT to be desired"

    ","As a long time music lover, I have acquired and become accustomed to very good, high-end and expensive audio gear, including speakers and headphones, so I have rather high standards when it comes to music listening.  As for television, however, I've never really cared or even paid attention to how it sounded as long as I could hear the words.  My hearing is still OK but its harder to make out some dialogs and I've noticed how often I now turn on the subtitles.Hence, the RS5000 - for me, a novelty.  It is wireless, not so expensive, and designed specifically (but not exclusively) for television audio.  Lacking experience in this area, I wasn't expecting much.  Happily, I was surprised - but only after several days of ""getting to know you"".The conception and design of the RS5000 is both unique and ingenious, and the concept behind the design has a specific purpose:  to maximize the perception of speech from various kinds of TV programs, such as movies, sports, and news broadcasts, especially those in which dialog is coupled with intrusive background noises and/or loud music, etc.  The functions and options of this device also address those with significant hearing impairment, which is all too common.Aside from the DC power supply, the system consists of a ""transmitter with charging station"" and a  ""stethoset  receiver with built-in rechargeable battery"" (the wireless headphones). The transmitter is the heart of the RS5000 and, apart from the power supply connector, there are 2 audio inputs - an optical socket for digital data streams, and a 3.5 mm jack for analog input (cables for each are supplied).The digital connection, as usual, is recommended, but this is possible only if one or more of your audio sources (TV, AV receiver, DVD Player) has an optical output for digital audio.  In my set-up, the only such source was the Direct TV satellite receiver, but it didn't seem to work when connected with the RS5000.  Days later I discovered why: a conflict of incompatible digital formats.  The RS5000 supports only PCM audio (the industry standard for 2-track uncompressed audio), whereas Direct TV, I thought, only supported MP3 files and Dolby Digital (5.1 surround audio).  Given the popularity of PCM, this seemed odd, so I dug a little deeper and found that if Dolby digital is turned off in the Audio Settings, then the surround audio is down-mixed to 2-channel PCM.  Success!The point here is that the initial set-up of this device will not necessarily be a walk in the park, especially for those who are techno-challenged and haven't kept up, or those with older, or bottom-line newer gear with a minimum of connections.  I'm guilty on all counts, and furthermore, every device in my system is manufactured by a different company - which may or may not be problematic.  Even so, many, perhaps most, buyers will find the set-up to be easy enough and straightforward.The ""stethoset"" receiver is so-called because it both looks and functions like a doctor's stethoscope.  Each are hearing devices that fit over or in the ears and remain in place due to the slight inwards pressure.  As far as I know, the stethoset is unique in two important ways:1) when the arms are not pulled apart, the two earpads are closed together and touching each other, which also turns the stethoset ""off"".  When the two arms (or ""bows"") are pulled apart (outwards), the stethoset turns ""on"".  In other words, putting the receiver on to listen turns it on, and taking the receiver off turns it off.2)  The stethoset's earpads are not equivalent to the very familiar earbuds (which are pushed into the opening of the ear canal where they expand and create the pressure that keeps them in place). The earpads, to a lesser degree, do adapt to your ear form, but they should not be pushed into the canal.  Instead they are positioned just in front of the canal so that the stethoset ""hangs freely from your ears and  [the lower part, or ""fob""] rests lightly on your chest).Sorry for all the detail here, but if you want to evaluate the sound quality of this wireless headset, you would do well to first discover the best placement of the ear pads so that you will actually hear the best that the RS5000 has to offer.  The optimum positioning of the pads relative to the ear canal and to the size and shape of the physical ear really does make a big difference in both quality and volume.  The important thing is to experiment with placement for the best result before judging the quality of sound.The first step, however, is to decide which of the two provided earpad sizes will work best for your ears - big or small - remembering that the intended fit is ""loose"" rather than ""snug"".  Various other sizes are available from Sennhauser.  Be careful with this choice, for the criteria concerning earpads has little to do with the criteria for selecting the more familiar earbuds.  My initial decision to use the small pads was based on my experience with earbuds, and was too hasty.  Later on I discovered that the large pads actually worked better, which helped to explain why the stethoset is shipped with the large pads installed.Given a proper set-up and the correct positioning of the earpads, a subjective evaluation of the sound quality can be made that reflects the actual potential of the RS5000.  In my opinion its value for music alone and for TV audio is not the same, nor should it be, for this device was designed for TV listening.  Nevertheless I was surprised by its competence in music reproduction, which was quite good and deserving of, say, 4 stars.  Apparently, the RS5000 has well-designed circuitry and a decent DAC (digital to analog converter), but it certainly can't compete with my Grado headphones coupled with OPPO's HA-2 amplifier (with its professional USB - Ess Sabre DAC).  Still, the stethoset system doesn't disappoint when it is properly used.When it comes to TV audio the RS5000 really shines, and does so for the normal hearing as well as for those with various impairments.  It addresses hearing problems (as well as incompetent mixing of source material) in a systematic way that works, and for this alone it deserves a high rating.  Given the scope, effectiveness, and elegance of its solutions, I can only respond with a solid and unapologetic 5 stars.A brief run-down of the approach and its operation should be useful to many hard-of-hearing, potential buyers.  Volume control and balance (left/right) adjustments, of course, are fundamental for everyone.  The volume control is on the stethoset receiver (+ and - buttons on its lower part, or fob""), whereas the balance is changed by two buttons (L and R) on the transmitter.  The only other control on the receiver, which is also intended for everyone , is the ""speech intelligibility function"" - an on/off button located on the side of the ""fob"".  This function ""...detects and reduces annoying background noise.  The audio signal is ...analyzed and adjusted...so speech is foregrounded and easier to understand"". The manual recommends this function for TV movies and series, audio books, and sportscasts;  it should be deactivated for music (no speech).Specifically designed for substandard hearing (problematic impairment), there are three ""hearing profiles for sound enhancement"" which are located in and controlled from the transmitter.  These three (especially 2 & 3) are ""enhancements"" only from an impaired hearing point of view; for normal hearing they are more like ""radically modified destructions"",  featuring heavy compression (leveling) and the boosting or reduction of specific frequency ranges.  The profiles sound more-or-less terrible, but for the hearing impaired and many seniors, they could be godsends. Incidentally, a more complex ""enhancement"" that might be helpful for some is mentioned in the manual:  ""The speech intelligibility function can also be used in addition to one of the hearing profiles 1-3"".  Well.. that's good, more options!  But I really don't want to know what that sounds like.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for Music & Better for TV Audio & Hearing Impairments.

    ","I tested these out with my parents, who have some hearing issues when we watch tv, and this has made a HUGE difference!First off, setup wasn't bad at all, and once the power and audio stuff is connected, it is SUPER easy to use. No crappy pairing process, as is usually the case with bluetooth. These are paired to the base already, so to turn them on, you basically just wear them. When you take them off, sound stops coming out. To charge them, you just put them back on the base. No re-pairing, loss of signal, etc.Also, the range is great! We have a big house, but you can walk pretty much anywhere and keep the signal going. It's nice because if you have a show on and need to do something by the kitchen or in the garden, you can keep listening as if you were in the same room--no problem!The sound quality is perfect for TV. I know some people aren't thrilled about it for music, and while that's totally valid, these are more for tv/movies anyway. For that, the clarity of sound is great, and you can go to pretty high volume. Also, you can adjust the volume differently for EACH EAR. So if you have hearing loss on one side but not the other, you don't have to harm your good ear and only hear quietly from the other--it has easy adjustments for this!Comfort: Great news: these hook into your ears and hang down comfortably, and they do NOT have to go over your head. Why does this matter? Because you can wear them with glasses without interfering or squishing the glasses into the side of your head. The pressure is strong-ish (so they don't slip off) so if you are sensitive or prone to headaches from pressure, you might not want to wear them all the time, but for most people, it should be fine for a few hours at a time.Difference between the 2000 and the 5000 model? 50 feet range difference, and 3 hours less time on a full charge for the 2000. Sound quality seems the same, and functionality is pretty much the same.Awesome solution for those with so-so hearing, or people sharing space and not wanting to bother neighbors or other residents.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy use, great sound/volume, comfortable"

    ","I got these as a replacement to my other Sennheiser headphone the Sennheiser Infra Red IS410 Wireless Ultra-lightweight Assistive Listening Stereo Headphone System which can be a bit temperamental and the IR technology requires ""line of sight"".  We own two pair of the lightweight version - the IS410 - and while THOSE are good for hearing impaired people (like myself and my Mom - we are both double hearing aid wearers) they are fussy and require ""line of sight"" to be right-on in order to maintaint a strong, clear signal.  There is always a little bit of fussing required to get them aligned JUST right.  And given that ... you better maintain that position to keep the signal strong and clear.  We own two sets of the IS410's and were happy to see this other version - the RS 5000.  The form factor is completely different and welcomed.I wanted to set these up to take the optical connection.  These actually favor that connection best.  Unfortunately, my LG Plasma (a 2014 model) did not seem to work even when I turned on the DTS option in my audio settings.  This seems to be a requirement.  Fortunately, I was able to use the regular analog connection instead.  One thing to note, the headphones did not come with the full cable and adapter for analog output ... I had to use part of the cable (3.5mm headphone input) from my other pair of older Sennheiser IS410 headphones to make this work for my configuration.  This may or may not be an issue for you - but I wanted to mention it.  Had I not had that extra connector, I would have had to buy something to make it work.Honestly, I have yet to delve into some of the various sound profiles and the like .... to me, they seemed pretty fine right out of the box.Of note, if you are a hearing aid wearer (for Mom and I we have the RIC open fit aids) you will want to take them out while wearing these.

    ",The best money I ever spent. My wife said I didn't have to get her a Christmas gift because this was it. Now I can hear the tv perfectly and the tv volume is low. I also wake up in the middle of the night and like to watch tv for a while; with this no problem. BONUS: I can go to the bathroom 3 rooms away and I still hear the audio fine.

Truly the best money I've ever spent.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works exactly as advertised. The Sennheiser name is well known for high end audio.
31,"on July 16, 2017",,"First, I have to add that there are few brands I have more loyalty to than Sennheiser. While in college way back in 1974, just a couple of years after, I believe, the company debuted in the US, a clerk in a stereo store convinced me to spend my precious money on a  pair of headphones made by a company I had never heard of before, and for over 30 years those headphones, until they were accidentally damaged, provided the sound for nearly all the great music I listened to in my life. So trust me, it always hurts if I have to say a negative word any pair of Sennheiser headphones. But these are simply not very good. They provide somewhat adequate wireless sound for watching TV when I don't want to disturb others.But I have to confess that I do not find them at all comfortable and I do not care for the sound. Perhaps because I had my hearing somewhat impaired when I was 12, one thing that I have always insisted in my headphones or earphones is not merely that they provide me with sound, but that they provide me with enhanced, close to perfect sound. I'll spend more money on a good pair of headphones than I will for a good set of speakers (though that isn't literally true; I gradually invested in a wonderful set of Martin Logan 7.1 speakers, but until then I was more of a headphone guy). The point is, the sound is really substandard on these headphones. If you are the kind of person who will buy an iPod and use the earphones that come with them, you might find these to be OK. But if you always insist on upgrading to get first rate sound, you will probably hate these. There is just no depth or detail to the earphones. And I also do not find them to be very comfortable. Instead of resting on top of your head, they dangle from your ears, and I find that they irritate my ear canal after listening for a while. On top of all this, I have a different pair of Sennheiser wireless headphones that rest on top of my head that I find to be both more comfortable and that provides vastly better sound. The best that I can say about these headphones is that they are simple to set up and are better than absolutely nothing. They don't mar the Sennheiser name, but they certainly do not enhance it.",2.0 out of 5 stars,An intensely disappointing produce from the headphone company I have most loved in my life
