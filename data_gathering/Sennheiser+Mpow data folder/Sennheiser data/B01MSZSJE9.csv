    ","I was officially eager to get the Sennheiser HD 4.40BT headphones. After trying out several headphones and accidentally coming across the HD 4.40s during a web search I thought, this is it. Finally, the pair I’ve been looking for. Some reviews say they sound great. They do. Some reviews say that their phone voice quality is good. It’s okay. And, for me, which is a critical issue, the reviews say that the HD 4.40 prevent sound leakage very well. That one is very true. So initially, I thought that I found the nearly perfect pair of headphones. But it turns out there are some disappointments especially when referring to my secondary list of “must haves”. Not critical, deal-breaker features, but ones that I find very convenient and in some cases essential, I started to find the shortcomings of the HD 4.40BT.But first, let me comment on their sound quality. I’ve tried the Bose QC35, Sony MDR-1000Xs, Sony MDR-XB950BTs, Skullcandy Crusher Wireless, and the Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2. These headphones perform stellar in the sound quality department. Clear crisp highs, full mids, and plenty of bass. But the most fun I have with these their sound stage. With the HD 4.40BT, you get a broad sound stage with great separation. If you’re looking for a great sounding pair of headphones at $150, you’ve found them. These are the least expensive of the lineup I’ve tried and yield a sound quality on par or better than all of the headphones I’ve tried at more than twice the price.The phone call quality is okay on the Sennheiser HD 4.40BT. Sometimes I get callers telling me that I sound fantastic and sometimes that I have digital “reverby” artifacts. Unfortunately, I can’t get consistent results. I do know that when I switch to my phone during those complaint calls, I get good responses. So it’s definitely in the headset. It may be a futile effort to find a great sounding pair of headphones that has excellent call quality but I’m trying. For now, the search continues.The noise isolation capability is not that great. I can clearly here ambient sound, voices, and the like while listening to music, even somewhat loudly. Fortunately, however, these do not leak much sound which is a huge bonus. Due to the less-than-ideal noise isolation, I may try out the Sennheiser HD 4.50BT instead. Since those feature noise cancelling.The HD 4.40BTs fold for compact storage, which is very nice. I wish the ear cans also rotated flat as with other headphones I’ve tried. But I mostly like the rotated ear cans for comfortably wearing the headphones around your neck when you need to temporarily have them removed. Fortunately, the HD 4.40s are very comfortable around the neck without this option. I think it’s their wide headband that accounts for this. Overall the foldability is nice. These come with a soft pouch so you’re not going to get any protection from a case with the HD 4.40BTs, but at their price-point, the company had to skimp somewhere.The controls are okay. And if you’re familiar with Sony MDR-XB950BT controls, you’ll find these pretty similar. There is one significant difference however, the Sony’s feature a multi-function button that is pretty tall, which makes it easy to accidentally skip or rewind your music instead of pausing. This is due to the leverage that their button height has. This potential issue is not an issue on the HD 4.40s because the multi-function button has a very low profile. Consequently, the buttons low profile makes it a bit more difficult to find and press for phone calls and pausing music, especially since the bezel around the ear cup that has nearly the same height as the low profile multi-function button. The volume rocker is placed low on the ear can which I find a little too low. I think an improvement to the design would be to move the power button to the front of the can and allow more spacing and better positioning of the volume rocker and play/pause multi-function button. Overall, they’re a solid set of buttons that work well to control calls and music.The ear pads, as mentioned in other reviews, have small openings and while I don’t have very large ears, the ear pad openings do press on either the top or the bottom of my ear depending on how I position them. This is in contrast to the Bose QC35s which have a large opening that fit my ears comfortably without touching. Despite this issue, the ear pads on the Sennheisers are soft and the headsets light enough to make them comfortable. However, I find myself having to tweak the fit ever time I use them. The comfort tolerance is so tight that you have to really fuss with the fit to get them where you can wear them for hours without some discomfort. It’s possible to find the sweet spot, but you need narrow ears, a narrow head, and a bunch of finicky trials to make them fit nicely comfy. There is a noticeable amount of ear pressure after wearing these for over an hour so they’re not the most comfortable headphones you can find. I wish Sennheiser would have made the ear openings bigger because the suppleness of the ear pads is great. There is minimal padding in the headband which will apply pressure to the crown of your head after about an hour of wearing these. In summary, larger ear pad openings and a more heavily padded headband cushion would make these extremely comfortable. As designed, they’re not.The LED light on these does not illuminate when the headphones are on. While I thought this would be a bonus, especially when using them in a dark room, believe it or not, I miss a flashing or glowing LED. Glowing LED lights help let you know if a device is on, which may help you avoid unnecessary battery drain. With the HD 4.40s you’ll have to either look at your device to confirm whether they’re on or not, or you’ll have to simply try to play audio through them to test if they’re on.One last little disappointment is the 2.5 to 3.5 mm headphone cable. I have a few standard 3.5mm cables lying around and would like to keep those in different places for convenient use with my headphones. One in the computer bag, one at the office, one at home, etc. Unfortunately, you need a special cable with the HD 4.40BTs.If you’re looking for a good pair of headphones that sound great, have decent comfort, prevent sound leakage for using them in work environments, and have adequate voice call quality the Sennheiser HD 4.40BT may give you everything you want. Overall, feature and sound-wise these headphones top the Bose QC35, Sony MDR-1000X, Sony 950BT, the Plantronics Backbeat Pro 2, and the Skullcandy Crushers. While they're not perfect, they do have some solid performance in the features they offer.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Some fantastic features. Some disappointments too.

    ","I've wanted to buy another Sennhesier headset for awhile, I've used my wired Momentums and my older hd558s for years and loved them for different reasons. I also have a pair of Bose Soundsport pulse Bluetooth headphones, Bose Soundtrue 2, and a cheaper pair of Bluetooth headphones called Taotronics an earbud design that I bought on Amazon for around 30 bucks. These headphones are on par with the comfort of my Bose Soundtrue 2 which were my most comfortable until these came along. Now that I've used high end Bluetooth earbuds from Bose I wanted to try a Sennhesier Bluetooth option and these just came out and I saw them at CES.What you expect first and foremost from Sennheiser is great sound quality and the HD4.40s certainly do not disappoint. Clear crisp high and mid with punchier bass than in my other Sennhieser headphones, hd558s are open back so bass isn't expected. These are warm I truly love the sound for listening to music of any type and they serve well for podcast as well.The build quality is solid and not the most premium but for the price it's expected and they do feel and look good and are strong, Sennhieser typically uses premium materials and the surfaces all feel great just not a lot of metal or leather. Although the leather earcups are better than my Bose and Sennhieser Momentums. I do like how they fold up to easily fit in my bag.Wireless is the main reason I bought these because I wanted a great sounding over ear headphone and I knew Sennhieser wouldn't let me down and they've blow me away. Range is great and the battery lasts for days with 24hr use advertised. If you are using them for bursts they are gonna last along time which is huge for me.I'd tell you to go buy these if you want a very nice sounding over ear Bluetooth headphone I can't see how these would let anyone down. I'll update if anything changes.UPDATE: So I fully charged the headphones when I first got them and I've used them for over 8 hours of use with days in standby and I'm not kidding the batter is still at 97%. Really incredible battery life, amazing sound for the price. They sound much better than my Bose Soundtrue 2 and those cost more and aren't Bluetooth although the Bose are more compact. I'm so impressed with the battery life his far. Will update further in a few weeks.UPDATE 3/27/2017:One negative thing that has happened is that the Sennhesier brandin in the top band has completely worn off. It isn't scratched there, no damage it just wore off over time. Pretty sad even though it's not a big deal. I won't take a star off for it I but I think Sennhesier overlooked what they used to print that branding with.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful, comfortable, amazing battery life."

    ","I'm not an Audiophile, but I find the audio quality to be good with Clear mids & highs.. I'm a not bass-head, but I don't think bass is as heavy as a real bass-head would expect.. It is entirely plastic, but doesn't look cheap..I feel that the ear cups are bulky, but the ear pads (inner dimensions) are a little narrow. Look at the pics in which I've shown the comparison with the ear pads of Momentum2.0 and RS 160. I personally like the ear pads to be more roomy for comfortable listening for longer periods. These narrow ear pads may cause discomfort to those having medium and large ears. This is perhaps the only drawback.All in all this is a good value for money product since it is very competitively priced.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for money product

    ","If you want a ""top-brand"" pair of bluetooth headphones under $100 and do NOT want something with OVERKILLING BASS  like the Sony xb950bt or some Skullcandys, get these! The thing is, those headphones do not truly portrate sound; they just over expose your ears to extreme bass levels, do not get me wrong I like bass, we all do, but keeping things a little bit balanced is key and these headphones do that.PROS:★SOUND: The Sennheiser signature sound is there and it is superb (great soundstage too),  with a some extra bass to make things more interesting for the average consumer, but nothing overwheming.★BATTERY: 25 hours. Enough said.★DESIGN: They are (nearly) all-black, minimalist and sleek.★CONNECTIVITY: NFC and bluetooth with aptx, awesome.★BUILD: Yes they are plastic-made, but they feel very sturdy,flexible and durable.MIXED:- Sound changes a little (almost unnoticable) when the headphones are connected via bluetooth vs wired (but this is very common).-COMFORT: Over-ear for small and medium ears (like mine). On-ear for large ears (depends on how you snug them). The earpads are fluffy. Used them for long sessions without problems. Do not use the headband too tight to your head, it can get very unconfortable up there.CON:- CONTROLS: The buttons and slider to control your music on your right earcup only work when you are using your headphones via bluetooth.

    ","Let me preface this review by saying this: I've been a long time Sennheiser fanatic. I love seeing what new things they come out with, and always dream about getting stuff from them I could never afford. My background of Sennheiser consists of HD 280 Pro's, HD 380 Pros, HD 558's, and HD 569. I've absolutely loved every one of them, and a need for some good wireless cans for shop use arose. Research beyond research led me to these for their comfort, sound quality, and overall being good headphones. This is where my story begins.The good:Sound Quality/battery life:OK, let me get this out of the way first. They sound fantastic, just like every other Sennheiser's I've owned. The sound is clear, full, and never harsh. It is the sound I've grown to love as being able to listen to it all day long and never get fatigued. Bluetooth quality with aptX is good, though regular bluetooth is just as bad as always. Battery life also got me through a full 8 hour workday while pumping out the volume. By these two standards alone, they met my expectation...but....The bad:Everything else: Comfort, noise isolation, build quality....First, by biggest gripe, the comfort. Compared to all the other Sennheiser's I've owned, these are NO WHERE near the same level. On the top of the head where the band rests, there is NO padding, and with the way the headphones are designed, that leaves a very narrow contact area with the top of your head. This is a very bad thing, as it acts as a pressure point, and quickly becomes sore. On top of that, the actual ear cups are WAY smaller than the rest of the line I've tried, and act more of on-the-ear headphones that are incorrectly sized. Compared to the other HD series where the openings are large enough to only touch your head with no contact to your ear, these are much smaller are make contact with the outside of your ear, again creating pressure points that quickly get sore. Everyone I gave them to that tried them on had the exact same complaints, and did not want to wear them that long because of how uncomfortable they were.While I had no complaints with the clamping force, what surprised me was how LITTLE noise these blocked out. Now I know, they are not noise canceling headphones like the HD 4.50's, but again, compared to my HD 280 Pro's and HD 380's which have NO noise cancellation, these seem to do a VERY poor job of blocking outside noise. Even the HD 569's, which have a fabric-type of ear-muff and very low clamping force, blocked out more noise than these. It actually was almost laughable how BAD these were in comparison.Finally..build quality. Oh Sennheiser, how you have fallen. Now, obviously coming from my previous cans, I have no problem with plastic, but these were REALLY cheaply made. The adjustable band that literally holds the headphones together is REALLY thin, at maybe less than half the thickness of the bands of the other HD series.  You could literally feel how thin the plastic was, and I actually started to get worried about them breaking very quickly. Everything about them just scream cheaply made, and I honestly believe you would be better off buying something off Monoprice for less than half the cost, and would get a better quality headphone. It actually breaks my heart a little to say that, but it sadly is the truth.Seriously, if you want Sennheiser quality, need to block out the noise, and don't mind a cable, get the HD 380 Pro's. If you want affordable Bluetooth, you are better off with Monoprice. If you want quality, then spend the extra money for the Sennheiser PXC 550, Bose QC35, or Sony MDR1000X.",2.0 out of 5 stars,This was a difficult review to write

    ","They look pretty good.They are very comfortable!(my ears are 2.25"" tall and 1.1"" wide and though the inner dimensions look small, they got my ears well.I'm fine with the clamping force, my wife isn't, so I guess that's subjective.The weight of the headphones is not an issue either)The price is right!They sound well balanced and to my liking.(I'm not a bass head. So I prefer a balanced sound. If you're looking for bass, grow up and get in to listening to good quality audio files or just get another bassy headset)Sound isolation is good. But insufficient for the NYC subways, unfortunately.The Bluetooth connection is reliable.The call audio quality is great!And the battery life took me by surprise. (I know the box says 25 hours, but I've been listening to them for ~14 hours and actually ended up putting in a tech support ticket with Sennheiser to ask why my Pixel2 and iPhone7 showed 100% battery even after 11 hours of playing music. I expected an issue with the headphones. It looks like they report battery life on blocks of 10%. At the listening volumes I use, I got 14 hours of listening by using 10% of the battery. I don't expect this to be linear or sustain over time, but this is a great start).The packaging is nice too (if you're in to that)I, for one an impressed!Good job Sennheiser!Update 2/1/2018:I ended up replacing the ones I got before. They never reported the battery accurately to my Pixel2 or iPhone 7.Not that the build quality was in question for me, but the new ones seem to have a better swivel mechanism. Same great sound.The battery never dropped below 90% and yet, the headphones played a message suggesting that the battery life was about 50%. So on the new ones, Battery reporting still to be seen. I'll find out in a few days I suppose.I might drop another star in case battery reporting over Bluetooth seems to be a systemic issue with these headphones. After all, visually, that's the only battery indicator I have.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sennheiser Sound with amazing battery life!

    ","I've had these for about a week now. I love them, with a caveat for those folks with larger heads.First, sound: I'm not an audiophile but have several pairs of midrange headphones. My favorites are Beyerdynamic 880s for reference.For wireless Bluetooth headphones, these things rock. I would compare them with my Senn HD 598s. They just sound right to me. I listen to a lot of punk and these seem great for that genre. These aren't bass-heavy so if that's your cup of tea, you may want to look elsewhere.Fit: I have a large head. 7 3/4 big. The clamping force on these is a bit painful. My 880s are super comfortable as are the 598s. I think it's due to the fact that although these are supposed to be over the ear, they actually sit on my ears. Sometimes I'll maneuver them a bit to sort of fit my ears within the cups, but that does little to allieviate the pain. It's not ridiculous like the Beyerdynamic DT 1330s but it gets uncomfortable after an hour or so. On the positive side, a quick break/adjustment and I'm good to go. The earcups are extremely cushy.These aren't noise canceling but due to the size of the earcups and how they sit on your head, they block out a fair amount of noise. I suspect they will be great for commutes, on planes, and etc. I normally use them in a coffee shop that often plays ridiculously loud music and I don't have any problems.Bluetooth: no connectivity problems with my iPhone, PC, or Mac. I can switch between them with little effort.Battery life: seems great. Haven't had to charge them yet but they've held up for several long writing sessions.Portability: these fold up quite compactly. They come with a cloth bag that I don't use. I just shove them into my bag and forget them. If you're concerned about breakage, you'll prolly have to buy an hardcase from somewhere else.Extras: there's a micro USB charging cable as well as a 3.5mm connector.Price: you really can't beat the $150 price tag--at the time of review obvi. I looked at Sony MDR-1000x & Bose QC 35 as well. With the durability questions surrounding the Sony and the price tag of the QC 35, I figured ANC isn't a feature I *need* and certainly not worth (for me) the additional $200 for the Bose. Your calculus will obvi be different.For my money, I couldn't be happier with the purchase. I normally just used my 598s as my everyday headphones but, since they don't fold and have that wire, I wanted wireless. I'm glad I bought these.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Affordable Wireless On/Over Ear Headphones

    ","I’m not exactly an audiophile; I am a 30 year-old professional singer who spends a lot of time listening to music (predominantly historically informed Baroque, hip-hop, and prog metal), and recently I’ve started trying to improve my listening experiences with higher quality equipment, on a typical musician’s limited budget. When I bought the Audioengine A2 speakers for my computer a couple years ago, *everything* instantly sounded better, more detailed, richer; music that I already knew well came to life in new ways.So, that experience definitely got me hooked on how good equipment can make music sound better, and I was hoping to replicate that magic when I bought these Sennheiser 4.40bt headphones. I prefer Bluetooth headphones because I usually wear my headphones when I’m out and about in the city or on the subway, and I just can’t be bothered with a cord – if there is a sacrifice in the audio quality versus corded headphones these days, I think it’s too small for me to really discern, and the freedom of having no cord is fantastic. On the other hand, it does mean you’re going to pay more for something decent: I did extensive research before settling on this model (on sale for $100), and I also considered the 4.50btc (same cans but with ANC for $150), the PXC 550 (Sennheiser’s top-of-the-line Bluetooth ANC cans for $300), the Bose Quietcomfort 35 (which everybody seems to agree are the best around, $350), and the many, many over-ear headphones by weird no-name Chinese companies that you can find on Amazon in the $60-70 range, all of which have hundreds of suspicious 5-star reviews, and many of which also seem to have ANC. (If you google for a real review, not on Amazon, of any of these popular headphones, you will get the lowdown on what they're really like.) The temptation to go for something in this category was strong because I just didn’t have $300 to drop on headphones, but in the end I am very glad that I swallowed my pride and got a more entry-level product by a reputable company. After some initial disappointment and some software tweaking and getting to know them, I’m very happy with the Sennheiser 4.40bt.My first listening experience was a letdown. I tried them on, listened to representative favorite albums from several genres, and came away with the same complaint in each. I’m not well equipped to provide verbal descriptions of my complaints, but I would say that everything sounded tinny, two-dimensional, and, surprisingly, not even really loud enough. I would have to crank the volume up all the way to the top to be able to listen to anything classical in the subway, and I worried that maybe I’d made a mistake not going for the noise-canceling model.Sennheiser suggests that you use their proprietary equalizer app, Captune, with these headphones, so I decided to give that a shot, and it certainly did improve my experience. The presets for classical and rock alone pretty much made everything sound completely different (i.e. better) regardless of genre. But Captune is an annoying, finicky app – I’m a Tidal subscriber and I was excited that Captune allegedly plays nice with Tidal, but even this turned out to be a disappointment: you end up having to navigate your Tidal library through the Captune interface, which is unintuitive and doesn’t allow you to access your offline albums. And if there’s a way that you can make your Captune EQ settings apply to all the sound on your phone instead of just what you play through the Captune player app, I wasn’t able to figure it out.This led me to find a third-party equalizer app, of which there are many. I paid $1.99 for an app called Equalizer FX Pro on the Google Play store, and this provided me with all the benefits I’d experienced with Captune, but also with the ability to use the equalizer when you’re using whatever app to play music (in my case Tidal), plus a loudness enhancer which has solved my aforementioned “not loud enough” problem. Basically, with the addition of this app, the 4.40bt have become a set of headphones that I feel very good about having paid $100 for. Certainly, I wish that no additional software were necessary for that to be the case, but at this point I’ll take it.Other things: battery life of the headphones is great, they last much longer than the cheap Archeer over-ear Bluetooth cans I was replacing. Pairing etc. is easy. I do have a complaint about the comfort of wearing them: the band doesn’t feel great on the top of my head, perhaps because it isn’t padded thickly enough. This has become less of an issue as I’ve played around with different ways to position that band, but they could be more comfortable. The pads over the ears are great, no complaint with how those feel.Pros: at $100, great value for audiophile quality (some work with an equalizer required) that most of the premium Bluetooth headphones will charge $300+ for. Block out noise pretty well without noise canceling. Comfortable fit over the ears. Conservative but attractive style. Nice build quality. Don’t turn on by accident in my bag and drain the battery like the ones I used to use.Cons: I found that in order to get great sound you have to use an equalizer, which adds an extra step to the listening experience but is worth it. Band a little uncomfortable on the top of my head.Four stars. Are my standards too high? Debatable. Obviously all the cheapo headphones in the $60-70 range do not deserve to have so many five star ratings, but they get them either because they’re fake reviews or because people who buy those headphones end up being pleasantly surprised by how much bang they got for their buck. Fair enough. Maybe I’m a little disappointed that I didn’t get something perfect when I spent my hard-earned $100, and maybe that is an unrealistic expectation. Maybe in a few years I’ll be in a place where I can drop $300 and get “the best.” If and when that happens, I would consider Sennheiser as a valid rival to Bose, but I would like to try them out first… hopefully by then they will have sorted out their equalizer problems (meaning either you won’t need an equalizer to make things sound good, or the Captune will become some effortless thing that automatically makes them sound like they should regardless of what media player you’re using).",4.0 out of 5 stars,Best option at the $100 price point; some work required...

    ","I love the sound, the range, and battery life of these headphones. There is a slight problem though; they sit at an unusual angle on my head. I can't remove a star because of my own genetic head wobble though. As others have said too, the ear pads are a little small and can become uncomfortable if you don't adjust them just right (again, could be my misshapen cranium). These are not sound cancelation headphones, but I can't hear a dаmn thing outside of them while at work or home. They also use side tone (you hear yourself speak and EVERYTHING around you when you have the microphone active). This annoyed me at first then I realized it kept me from yelling like an idiot into my headphones. Anyway, got these on black Friday for thirty less than normal, and I would have paid full price for them.

    ","This is an amazing headphone. I'm already used to Sennheiser ear buds, and I always loved them. So when I decided to buy a budget friendly bluetooth headphone it was a no brainer picking them up.I have a pair of bose QuiteComfort, which to me is the best you can get on it's class, and I should say that for my untrained ears, I could barely see any difference in the sound/bass.The only issue so far (and reason for not giving it 5 stars) is the mic. I tested it on a videoconference and the feedback and noise from environment was too much.If you are shopping for an affordable headphone, go for it you won't regret it.Updated after one month of use:Ok, after one month of use I had to remove one star from this product. A few more issues that have shown in the past weeks:1. Mic still horrible, can't get it to work2. Sync issues, many times I have to unpair/pair it again, I know bluetooth devices are usually notorious for pairing issues, but this one is pushing the limits3. Audio Sync: A few times I had visible audio delay between video and audio when using on my laptop or apple TV, kinda annoying. Usually requires a unpair/pair procedure",3.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing cost/benefit
16,"on March 31, 2018",,"I wanted two pairs of phones to use as both wired, and blue tooth for the TV. The reviews were good, so I pulled the trigger on both sets. They arrived well packed, safe from abuse thus not damaged. They are made of a sturdy plastic and look no-nonsense 'get the job done"". I was dismayed the included get started booklet was sparse, and no help at all. I thought of doing a return. I called Senn and they led me to a web page with large, clear, concise directions. I plugged them in and was floored by the intense quality of these headphones. Wide soundstage, precise and clear, each instrument clear and independent from the other instruments...the sound was a solid presence. The base had tight punch but not ghetto box in a silly way. Hights were rounded as to not be in your face tinny sounding. Now, I have had M50 Audio Tech and these make them look and sound like a Cracker Jack prize in the box. That in your face V sound, all treble and harsh, and thumpy base, now in the past. These phones are staid and sophisticated. I did both classical and rock and clear as a magic bell. They cost 99 dollars and were also better than my Shure 440s, and Barrodynamic 800 series phones which the left earpiece stopped working long ago after I bought them, These phones sound full and detailed and recessed. At this point, the blue tooth function is an added plus second thought. These were and are so much superior to just for TV or bang around phones. I was truly shocked. Next month, I will order the Senn 595 Special Edition headphones for a more refined experience that requires NO HEADPHONE AMP as I cannot be bothered with all that debris. And following that, a pair of Shure 1440 using both of these sets for extremely high end listening. Yes, one would say get the A.K.G. 702 and or Senn 600 but these do require a headphone amp, and I am dead against buying something else to complicate and bother with, so these Senn and Shure will be just fine. Now, I will tell you, this Senn 440 is one heck of a great phone. The sound is as good as what I have heard in some 300 dollar sets. Beats, no candle held, Bose, these totally shut them down. My JBL phones left in the dust, and the M50, I gave them away. Let me end saying I have played pro for over 40 years, and know what to listen for. These are far beyond in quality for this price point. Now the Blue Tooth Part. I charged them. Held down the on button two seconds. Bue and red light blinks. Open the panel of B.T. on my computer. Half the left side of the phone close, and bang. Solid link up. Now, in BT mode, the quality I raved about when I was on wired was cut by somewhat... Phones loud enough, sure, but all that presence and separation, all that was diminished a bit... In this mode, they function well for TV, very well, crisp, loud, easy to drive them. Phone calls, and non-critical music listening.In truth, I would buy these phones just to use as wired because hands down, they blew both the M50 Audio Tech and Shure 440 and Sony Pro studio model I paid 100 for right out of the water...no contest. The BT is only the frosting on the delicious cake. BT about the same as any other BT set up I have heard in both power with more crisp clarity, but the phones used wired? Wow. These phones are so underrated. The reviews focus on BT but there is so much, much more. BT was very easy to set up. My phones charged quickly and the battery life is really off the map on these. I originally thought I would use these phones for TV and guest watching movies in BT but when I fired them up in stereo,  a triple home run with a backflip or two, and I am milk bone happy. I will use my NON BT for some refined listening, those being the Shure 1440 and my trusted Senn 599's. Hope I helped you folks pull the trigger.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Shocking Quality well Beyond the Price Point. These are Astonishing and Shut down many others 3 times the cost.
17,"on March 27, 2018",,"Doing some research i wanted a good pair of headphones with bluetooth capabilities, since my last ones where the Sennheiser HD 429 (old model) i decided to keep loyal to the brand. I really liked the old pair but cable was super long and had no buttons to control my music. I used them in a moderate way just to use around the house, a few trips on the plane, etc. The ear pads started to peel and i said i think is time to buy a new pair. I like the sound quality Sennheiser provides. I bought a first pair and it came totally defective due it was an used product. I had the chance to try them before i return them and i was impressed with the sound quality the HD 4.40 offers. I was a little skeptical switching from cord to bluetooth, still thinking the cord gives me better sound quality. Well with the HD 4.40 change my mind. This headphones sound great, i love that punchy rich bass when i play my songs, i can't believe the quality of sound using the bluetooth capabilities. Pairing super easy using an Iphone. Battery lasts a long time. Comfort is good for the most part sometimes it hurts on the top of my head even the arch is well padded. They can be hot for time to time. A plus is the ear pads have some kind of noise cancelling even they don't have the feature like the 4.50s, i didn't wanted to pay the extra 50 bucks. It is gonna be great to use them in a long flight or on a long commute. Connection with my Iphone is excellent never had a device that never chops even if i get a few meters away from my phone. Something i didn't like was the connection to the cable. I love that you have the option to switch but it seems harsh to plug the cable in and out, i took me a while to connect it properly. Since i plan to use them for bluetooth purposes, it doesn't bother me that much. Other minus is that you can't control the device while using the cable, just only on bluetooth mode. Material is plastic but makes them lighter and time will tell if they break or not. Overall great headphones for $99.99. I recommend this product.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound and bluetooth are amazing.

It's decent for $99 but the price has already gone up. The sound quality in the old Sony MDRX is superior (although, those headphones have their own issues). I definitely wouldn't consider the sound to be terrible, just average.The build is not something you would want at all if you are the type of person buying these for one of those purposes. You will pick up the light plastic flexible build and probably be immediately disappointed.

You can even hear people around you cough while listening to music on high volume.For these purposes, I would rate these 3 stars.NOTE: The aux cable port on these headphones is the smaller 2.5mm which people don't typically have or use. So if you're expecting to use your standard 3.5mm aux cable with these headphones you will be annoyed and disappointed.It does come with it's own 2.5mm aux cable, but it is relatively short.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly great for exercise/working-out.

These are excellent cans for those looking for balanced, true sound with just a bit of rich bass. Bassheads and woofer-thumpers can move on -- this is NOT your headphone. Great battery life, too. My only two quibbles are build quality and fit. These cans are all plastic and feel a bit flimsy. I guess that's the price you pay for excellent sound at a reasonable price. But I'm worried about the power button, as it already feels sticky after just a week. Lousy design. Finally, as others have noted here, the ear openings on these headphones are tight.

    ","Bought these headphones to use for my desk work and used them for about a week. They are truly meant to be used with phones for shorter periods of time and with music. They pressed on the sides very hard and the top cushion was very stiff, the ear muffs were very small and barely fit my ears inside them. With bluetooth the audio quality is decent, however there is a distinct buzz from all three devices I tested with (phone, usb bluetooth transmitter and chromebook) that is especially noticeable when listening to people talking or quiet parts of music, there is also some popping with mid sounds.  The mic part was horrible for computer use at least (never used it for a phone call) was terrible quality one side audio when used with the microphone. The included charging cord is pretty cheap and short and the optional 3.5mm wired option was a joke. The headphones require a locking mechanism to use them wired which makes other 3.5mm cords almost useless with them and the included cable with it is very short, cheaply made, is a right angle connector (horrible for putting in your pocket) and one side arrived bent. However I couldn't even get the wired connection to work out of my computer through either the motherboard output or my audio interface. If you are buying to wear on your commute, this might be the option for you, but if good quality, long use is what your after, this product fails to deliver comfort or quality.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Very poor comfort and audio quality (bluetooth)

I even downloaded a few 3rd party EQ apps I've trusted in the past and got no reaction change at ALL. Not just bass, I could not control the EQ of the headphones in ANY way.That said, I still occasionally listen to music on them.

    ","So, I wanted a pair of wireless headphones after constantly jerking off my wired ones...which also had openbacked cups so they lacked noise cancelling on noisy field trip buses. The sound of my wired sennheiser pair was excellent as well as the sennheiser earbuds I have (If it isn't obvious enough, I like Sennheiser).  So, I went for these because the price was pretty good for the quality the review videos stated. They also stated that the ear padding was rather tight, and I have rather large ears, but I decided to take a risk and buy them anyway. When I put them on, I was pleasantly surprised. I had to jiggle them a little, but then my ears comfortably slid into the cups. The sound quality is fantastic. A friend with a pair of $300 Beats Studio Pro 3 wireless headphones agreed with me that they sound better. The sound quality really is amazing. On all points, highs, lows, mids, and bass, the sounds are crisp and clear. The controls on the right ear cup are convenient and are small so I never accidentally bump them. The wire that they come with is useful for when I am watching shows on netflix and don't want to worry about the battery life, which is 25 hours total. I usually only have to charge them every 2 weeks because I almost exclusively use the cable when I watch things. The folding ability is also very nice, so they fit in my backpack very nicely. I actually liked them enough that I bought my mom a pair for christmas, and she loves them too. The call quality is...meh. When calling with them via discord, people say that I don't sound very good. When I receive calls from my actual phone call app, the person on the other end usually says I sound fine. They are also pretty comfortable with glasses on too, though I don't usually have mine on when I use them. I highly recommend these.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Headphones Ever

A general sound picture is not vibrant, lacks ""wow"" effect and I found highs are kinda hissing.I'm going to play with 4.40 for few more days, try different inputs and EQ settings but am pretty certain I will return headphones.  I think it's a very good headphone for this money ($115 on Amazon) with great comfort and functionality but I personally need much better sound.  I am by no means a headphones expert and have tried only those and Bose QC, which are better but also lacks sound clarity for my taste and I don't need active noise cancellation (actually this feature only distorts sound in my opinion).** UPDATE **Unfortunately, I had to return them. What I found after a testing with different setups (wired/wireless) and sound sources  (Spotify, Tidal HIFI, local lossless files) — the problem was with a wireless connection. I loved the sound of 4.40 when they are wired to my S8+ and would give a solid 8.5 out of 10 (and 9.9 would be wired Detroit Shinola studio headphones with an expensive amplifier and HiRes audio source). When they are connected via BT — it's just completely different headphones — muffed mids, distorted highs and who cares about a bass than?!

    ","I have limited experience with headphones, but I really like these. I hear some people say the earcups are too small, but mine fit perfectly and its very comfortable.Bass when paired with my phone is good. When I use the captune app and set it to hip hop, it reminds me of my system in my car bass wise. Of course you cant feel it in your body like a real sub... I have a 12"" alpine subwoofer, but i have it lowered a little since i dont like bass drowning out everything. Same with these, i dont turn on the bass boost feature in the app. It increases the bass alot, but drowns out everything. Without the bass boost on, everything is clear and still decent bass.So far my only negative is in the captune app. You can only use it with tidal, but when you do your functionality in the app is limited. For example when you go in the app normally you can search an artist and there is a little button you can press that creates a radio station with that artist and other similar artists. However you cant do this when in captune. You cant just go into tidal, because the EQ doesnt work.. have to use captune. I guess ill have to find a way to use another equalizer. Or they can just make the captune app work for any source going into the headphones.All around good headphones and they are also good for watching movies and games. However, if all you want is headphones to listen to music with ridiculous bass and dont plan to use them for other things, maybe get something else. I know some people are like this. Not really sure how they compare to other bass heavy headphones though...One more negative actually. While the headphones are comfortable, your ears get kind of hot after an hour or so and I have to take it off for a couple mins then its ok.Update: I guess its not fair to take a star off because of the app...

I initially was expecting them to be at least as comfortable as the Sony MDR XB950BT’s, but they are far from it. As for the sound, it’s what you would expect from a company that specialize in it. It’s pretty great, not to bass heavy nor it is lacking it. It’s pretty balanced. Something that’s annoying to me is the lady’s voice notifying when the headphones are on, when they get connected, and when it disconnects. Why can’t they just have simple tones assigned like every other brand, literally no one asked for this. Anyway if you can deal with these issues then go right ahead, but if it were up to me again, I’d pass and go for the Sony XB950BT’s again.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound; comfort, not so much"

    ","First off, I'm not what you'd call an audiophile, but I am really picky about audio quality and I'm a huge music fan.  These are an absolute pleasure to listen to and it's actually hard to believe that these can be had for such a fair price. The sound stage is good, the bass is excellent (but not overpowering like Beats), and they have a really nice warm sound that really brings your music to life. Pairing with NFC was a breeze on my Pixel XL and bluetooth range seems to be really good. Can't comment on battery life since I've only had these a couple hours. They are a mostly plastic construction, but feel really well made and high quality. I think they are really nice looking and love the clean minimal design that isn't too flashy or bulky. The clamping force is fairly strong and is good enough to keep them securely on your head even when bending down or moving around a lot. The ear pads are super comfy and my ears (which are pretty average size) fit inside the ear cups just fine. My one complaint is that the wired connection uses what I think is a 2.5mm jack with a proprietary locking mechanism on the end that connects to the headphone so you can't just use any standard cable with 3.5mm jacks on both ends. Bottom line; If you're picky about audio quality and want good Bluetooth headphones with decent bass, these are the absolute best you're going to find under $200.",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the Bluetooth headphones to get!

They kill the more expensive bose and beats headphones in sound quality and I tried the sony xb series and those were too base heavy and sounded lower quality overall.

So with these you get pay for pure audio quality and even though they aren't hyped as much as bose and beats through social vanity, anybody who knows audio can agree that these sound much better.

I'm not exaggerating when I say that I've gotten tension headaches from these before.- If these are connected via BT, there is an obnoxiously soft beeping sound that goes off any time you change the song, increase the volume, switch apps on your phone, lock/unlock your phone screen, breathe, etc. and, sometimes, the headphones feel as if they haven't beeped enough so the beeping will go off, continuously, at random times when the phone isn't in use nor will there be any incoming activity (no, this is not from the battery being low, as there is a completely different type of beeping that goes off obnoxiously for that too)There is no way to turn off this feature, which I hate. Based on some reviews, it seems that turning off the VoiceOver feature in your phone aids this, but mine was never on in the first place (I even tried turning it on/off to mitigate this issue to no luck).Sennheiser, in my experience, makes some of the best quality sound equipment but they definitely slipped with the HD 4.40 BT headphones here. I'm honestly a bit disappointed in myself for spending as much as I did on these.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Unless these are on sale for $50, do not invest in them!"

    ","I love the sound of these headphones. Only problem I have is the ear cups are too small despite having very comfortable soft padding. You can fortunately still find a nice sweet spot with a bit of fiddling around thanks to the lovely inch thick cushioned pleather though. Bluetooth automatically picked up by laptop and downloaded straight away. Really in my opinion one of the best sounding $150 bluetooth headphones on the market, just needs a couple of tweaks with the can size. I spent a lot of time researching and I definitely made the right choice in regards to performance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Trusty Sennheiser - no need to look elsewhere.

I wear these while working out so will be stressing the cushion surfaces with sweat, but so far so good.  I could wish there was a power on/power off led. Instead, there is an audible ""power on"" and ""power off"" statement - but you have to have the headphones on to hear it.  But that nit aside, I'm really happy with these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds great!

    ","I can't imagine getting much more for what I paid. The sound quality is great for me. I do have two minor gripes. Changing the volume makes a beep, and I can't figure out how to turn it off. On my touch devices with a smooth slider it goes ""beep beep beep beep beep beep"" as I slide it. A little annoying. If someone knows how to turn this off, post a reply to this and I'll bump this up a star :).

43,"on April 8, 2018",,"these are great headphones. granted i am no audio nerd, but i do listen to podcasts and music for most of the day while working.the battery life is astounding for BT. i used them wired a majority of the time because i've had so many headphones die on me within a day or two of not charging. these, depending on how long you use them and how loud you're listening, could easily last a 4-5 days without a charge. when you combine using BT with the aux cord, it could be weeks or a month even.the only downsides, it does rest on the crown of my head, which hurts after a while. some people have suggested buying pads, but i think just being conscious of the fact that they will make your head sore and adjusting where they rest on your head every once and a while works as well.additionally, when using the aux cord, the controls on the headphones don't seem to work. more likely i'm just stupid and am doing something wrong, but it is a little annoying having to pull out my phone for volume control instead of being able to just use the headphones.anyway!! these are good and the price seems to fluctuate between $100-$149. i suggest keeping an eye on the price for a few weeks before buying so you can get them at a good price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,amazing BT battery life

    ","I *really* wanted to like these headphones.

    ","So, I like these headphones, but man are these reviews misleading.The bass is NOT as heavy as everyone claims.  It definitely has a punch, but nothing close to Beats or other headphones I own (Munitio Pro40s and Monster Adidas).  I used the EQ on the app for the headset to adjust the sound, including just turning literally everything all the way up, and it still doesn't sound as heavy as a lot of these other reviews claim.  Let me just add that the music I usually listen to is Metalcore, Thrash, Rap, R&B, etc. (A nice little mix).The headset is SUPER lightweight, and the clamping force is not bad at all (I have a gigantic head, so this was a major concern for me).  Light enough that it doesn't need to be too firm to stay on.Pairing is as easy as everyone says it is, takes seconds through Bluetooth (didn't try NFC).My only issue was (and this may just be me) that there were moments where depending on where I was walking, the connection would cut off a bit, and it just made the music sound like a CD player from the 90s, where skip protection was a premium feature.I don't know if that's just something that happens from time to time and I was just expecting a lot more since I didn't have any experience with bluetooth headphones before this, but it was a bit frustrating.Other than that, they work exactly as expected. They sound as good as you expect Sennheisers to sound, which is pretty freaking good.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Solid Headphones for the Price.  Bass is NOT as heavy as people claim.

    ","I wanted to wait a month before writing this as I know it is easy to write a honest but less meaningful review withing a day of receiving something and I wanted to make sure I actually really do like them first :) I previously had BOSE QC15s for like 8 years that finally quit on me.  I do still live bose but I knew the competition has come a long way in recent years and I didnt want to spend top dollar.  Also, after owning fancy noise cancelling headphones...It is not as special/important as the companies make it sound.  Is it bad, no, does it really make a huge difference, I dont think so at least when you are listening to music anyway.  I can see if you fly a lot and dont want music but still want outside noises muted, it does help (it does not eliminate).  Anyway, getting back the HDs, they have great sound (I am not an audio snob but I do know a bit).  Some people complain about the volume being too low, these do not get as loud as cheap headphones and earbuds but they do get plenty loud.  I really love music and if they were louder, it would be hard to hear and appreciate the quality of the sound and all of the different aspects of the music.  The volume is only an issue if you just really want to JAM and dont care about quality at the moment (I get that way to at times and want to wreck my ears just for fun too).  The battery life is awesome and the pockets for the ears are smaller but after breaking them in for a week or two they really soften up and get comfortable.  There are plenty other reviewers that know a lot more about tech audio so Ill leave that for them.  Overall these are well worth the money, if you want something fancier get ready to pay the twice the price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the money

    ","Good sound quality, good Bluetooth connection, loud volume, optional audio cable provided has a locking mechanism, the bass response is solid without overtaking or muddying the music. The price is accessible, the headphones fold up nicely and are compact enough to pack. The battery life is long and a good plus, and the charging time is not bad at all. You're getting a good brand for a good price, and the headphones still work perfectly after being chewed to pieces by my dog, which speaks volumes to me about build quality.Having said all that, I would not give this headphone 5 stars. They are really not very comfortable, especially for long listening sessions. I would imagine the smaller your ears, the better and more comfortable the fit will be, but I have an average ear size and I have to really try to make the ear cup completely surround my ears. Also, the buttons are easily reachable and easy to get used to, but not very intuitive at first and lack good feedback, which makes them harder to use. They also have a bit of a lag, but that is expected when dealing with Bluetooth devices.Keep in mind you won't be getting any sort of microphone with this as far as I could find, but that could be remedied with a third party audio cable, as far as I'm aware. Also there is no noise cancelling, and you must likely will not be getting a good seal around your ear.Overall I would still strongly recommend these headphones, they just have some flaws that every individual should keep in mind to determine whether they are worth it. But you can find these for $100, they really have no real competition in their price point.PS Be aware when connecting and removing the audio cable to the headphone, as the locking mechanism is plastic ridges that follow a determined pathway. Forcing it in or out will easily break said ridges, which will not affect performance, but it is something to keep in mind.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great entry point for Sennheiser if you want something that can also be taken on the go easily, but sort of umcomfortable"

They seem just a little to light on the base, but I personally would rather they be a little light on the base than a little to heavy on the base and I can boost the base with the EQ with the app I use on my phone for listening to music. Battery life is more then sufficient for me.  The longest I've tried using it before recharging it is a total of 4 hours on 2 notches below max volume.  It didn't run out of power, I just didn't want to chance that happening. Very comfortable on the ears. The top center of the headband could use a little padding, but I'll figure something out for that. As far as sound quality I can compare it to for what I own is my corded BOSE SoundSport IE headset.

164,"on March 17, 2018",,"This set of headphones was a disappointment.  I use HD650 for online listening and the HD180 for the television.  I purchased this because I upgraded the television to a Samsung Q6F and my ears are getting older from when I originally picked up the listed Sennheiser headsets.  My thought process was, my ears are older so I might not notice.  That was wrong.The ear cups are too small for my ears and my ears are what I consider to be normal sized ears.  After a short while, the edges of my ears began to hurt and the headphones needed to be repositioned.  I can use the headphones but in a normal listening position, they're far from comfortable.  If the headband wasn't so tight, I'm sure the ear cups would be much more comfortable.This headset has a sort of hollow sound, poor bass and the sound field is very narrow.  The HD 4.40 BTs are budget friendly headphones and in my opinion, should be purchased with the above thoughts in mind.  My opinion, one is best advised, step up to better.The reception in front of the television is excellent and they're clear sounding in the kitchen.  Clear and precise; no added noise.  But the overall sound quality is middle grade.  If wanting full, quality sound, step up a couple of classes to a $350.00, PXC 550 Wireless headset.  If you want budget friendly cans that are echoey, a bit flat with bass that lacks punch with ear cups that are too small and hurt the ears, these will do fine.To all, sorry I can't give a positive review.

    ","Sound quality is great; slightly bass heavy, AptX does wonders. Connectivity is also great, I could walk around the house without any break in the sound (this also depends on source device). Dealbreaker? Its labeled as around-ear headphones, but its actually an on-ear headphone. It clamps hard and gets uncomfortable after a short time, especially if you are used to around-ear headphones. After about 2 hours, it literally started to hurt. My head isn't that big tbh, I can wear anything around-ear like my QC35s and MDR XB950BTs for many hours.",3.0 out of 5 stars,NOT AROUND-EAR.

    ","Comfort: I have to agree with a lot of reviews stating how uncomfortable the headphones are; I have smaller/middle sized ears and it still feels uncomfortable with the narrow openings on the earmuffs. Within 20 minutes it starts to hurt with constantly wearing them for me.Sound: the quality is pretty good for the price range; It was clear crisp using the bluetooth option (I never used it with the supplied wired cable) because the main thing I wanted to test was the bluetooth range. A lot of reviewers complained of it lacking bass (I'm not much of a sound connoisseur) but, I thought I could hear songs from spotify app, youtube, and even calls from the other end really well. I may be biased cause I could care less about having a lot of bass in my music. Theres very little sound leaks that I noticed unless the volume is set to max than people sitting next to you can pick up on.Battery life: I was able to get a 24 hours from a single charge so that was pretty close to what the box suggested. It took a little under 2 hours to fully charge with the supplied cable.Phone call quality: This was my biggest gripe with the product; every call I made the person on the other line could hear me fairly well but, sounded like I was a foot away or more from phone so it wasn't as loud. When I switched over to just using my iphone 6S for calls the call quality was much louder.Controls: the controls are all on the back that are easy to reach; the only downside is the power off/on button doesn't blink blue (meaning connected) throughout so sometimes I forget that my headset is still on and using its battery.Overall it is a decent pair of headphones to buy for the price; but for me it just wasn't a good fit. I'm looking for a pair of over the ear headphones where I can receive and make calls with good quality and with this I didn't get that so I ended up returning it.",2.0 out of 5 stars,When making calls; the people on the other hand can barely hear you..

    ","Sennheiser really did a great job with these headphones! They sound really crisp with a good balance of high's, mid's, and low's. Maybe a little more on the low's, but not too much so. Being made of mostly/all plastic does cut down a lot on the weight, but does not make these feel like cheap, flimsy, easy to break headphones. Although somewhat of an oxymoron, these headphones come the closest to rugged plastic headphones that I have seen.So this might be a weird mix-up of comparisons, but's to it's what I have listened to.  Compared to the Sennheiser 429, the sound is definitely more towards the bass side, giving the headphones a more feeling in my opinion. They definitely feel more rugged than the 429's, and the fold-able design makes these much better for travel. Also, for anyone that is on the fence about going bluetooth, these are a great option! I love being wireless. I believe that it is indeed worth the $50 jump up from the 4.30 to go to the wireless 4.40. The sound both wired and bluetooth is fantastic on these headphones.  I bought the Sennheiser Urbanite XL wireless (and returned them) before buying these. It might be my head size, but the Urbanite XL's did not fit me at all. I gave them a little while, but the circular shape of the pads was just a horrible fit on my ears. The Urbanite XL was so small -- or my ears are just so big -- that the top and bottom of my ear were uncomfortably squished against the side of my head. The diameter of the Urbanite XL's is about the same as the minor diameter on the 4.40. The 4.40 still pushes down on my earlobes a little bit, but there is so much padding that I can barely notice. The Urbanite and 4.40 have rather comparable sound in my opinion. I am not the biggest audiophile though.  The Beats Studio Wireless and the Sennheiser 4.40 have rather different sounds. They are both comfortable, but I think the Senny's have a more crisp, less muddled sound.In summary, Pros:-Great sound-Comfortable-Good, reliable bluetooth connection-Rugged plastic build-Can be used if the battery dies-Long battery life-Good passive noise isolationCons:-The super comfortable, copious amount of padding does make these headphones stick out on my head a lot. Not a problem with getting in the way, but some people might not like the look-The next/previous track button clicks in to answer calls and do other functions. Easy to function, but the clicking in part made me feel like the switch is loose. But I quickly got used to the button scheme.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, comfort, and design.

The problem and reason that I was looking for Bluetooth headphones now is because the arms that hold the ear cups on the Sony's has broken four times now and I'm no longer able to make them work.

The battery lasts a long time (I've gone at least a week with light to moderate use)! The ear cushions are comfortable and blocks out a significant amount of sound. The bass isn't the strongest, but it's definitely there! The mids are great and the highs are clear! I've tried these headphones with a wide variety of genres (including EDM, Classical, Pop, Chiptune, etc.) and they've sounded amazing with everything! The sound stage isn't very big, but that's to be expected from a pair of closed-back headphones.

    ","I already owned the Sennheiser HD600 and currently own the HD650, so when I saw these headphones on sale for $100, I thought they gotta be pretty good because it's being made by Senheisser.  Disappointment falls way short of my feelings towards these headphones.  The bass is boomy, muddy, and overshadowed by the pronounced mid-range.  The sound is more like ""oomy"" without the ""b"" because there is no impact from the kick drum, etc., etc.  Also, there is no tightness or control in the bass... disgusting.  The mid-range is way too pronounced and took over my listening experience.  It was clear, but just too much.  The treble disappeared and was faint in the background with no crispness or tizzle at all.It came this afternoon, I charged it up, tried to listen to Diana Krall, KD Lang, some Pop & Deep House, and I could not stand it any more.  It's going back tomorrow.  I'm gonna save my nickels for the Momentum 2.0 Wireless and give them a try.",1.0 out of 5 stars,I thought they gotta be pretty good because it's being made by Senheisser

    ","disappointed with it. I am not sure how do other wireless header phones works, but this one does not reach my expectation. The following are the bad things of this product:1) There is no way to figure out how much power left. So really hard to know when should I charge it.  ---> It is a bad design!2) There is no way to figure out when it is power on or power off. It is recommended to power off if you are not using wireless function. I am always wondering whether I forgot to power off it or not. So I have to press the power bottom to check whether it. ----> Another bad design!3) The voice quality is pretty bad if the distance between you and the music source is more than 5m. I usually listen to NBA games or listen some public course lectures while cooking. I lost sound from time to time, there are also some unknown noise come in to my ears. Because of this, I have to put my laptop very close to kitchen.4) When I use it to make phone calls, the other side can hear some noise, which continuously bothering them.  Much worse than a common wired  header phone.5) When I use it while practice shooting basketball, it tends to drop off and I have to take it off.Sennheiser made some good header phones, but considering this wireless one, I would say it is just a toy.

    ","I bought these headphones from Best Buy just over a week ago.  I was looking for something that would produce decent sound without getting into the higher end, $200, headphones.  My overall thoughts are that these are a great purchase for under $150.I will say, you're not going to get a big bass kick from these.  If you're looking for a lot of heavy bass, then these are not the headphones for you.  You will be disappointed by the bass if that is what you want.  However, if you're looking for more of a genuine, crisp sound without spending over $150, then these are what I recommend.Pros:They have good battery life.  I have used them all day and did not get any drop in performance from low battery, nor did I ever run out.You can tell that these are built with the Sennhesier quality, but they are still light weight.  I personally think these have a better build quality than most Beats, or Sony headphones.If you're listening on a computer, these things can get LOUD.  I have noticed however, that they are not as loud when used with a phone, but that was expected.The ability for both Bluetooth or corded experience is a must in over-the-ear headphones now, and Sennhesier delivers on that.The controls on these headphones are great.  I come from most of my experience with controls being on in-ear headphones, so it was awesome to have an upgrade in control quality.Phone calls on the HD 4.40 are actually pretty great.  I spent some time on the phone with some people, and it felt like they were in the room with me.  The general consensus from the other side of the call was that the audio was fine.I think that they're comfortable, and I have big ears.  I have such big ears that they don't quite fit over my entire ear, but they mostly do, and I still found them comfortable.  I was able to wear them hours on end.ConsThe Bluetooth, while good quality with no lag, lacks volume.  That's pretty typical with headphones though.They are not noise canceling.  This came as a suprise to me, because I assumed that any over-the-ear headphone over $100 should be noise canceling.  These are not.  I was pretty disappointed when I could still hear the meat-head at the gym grunting away, but I should have read the box first.  Maybe it's my fault for not checking, but noise canceling should be a given at this price.Lack of bass.  They're not hard hitters, which usually doesn't bother me, but it's lacking enough that I have to mention it.Final Thoughts:I bought these headphones for the purpose of going to the gym.  With that said, they do the job and they don't break the bank doing it.  I found their long battery life, comfort, and build quality to be worth the $150.00.  I would recommend buying them if you're looking for an economy over-the-ear headphone.I will say however, that the carrying bag that comes with the headphones is too big.  Headphones are more secure in a tighter bag, so I replaced mine.  I would still have no worries about throwing these in a backpack without the carrying bag, which I did one day.  They lived.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Long Battery, Comfort, and Good Build"

    ","First there's not enough bass, it's more of a punchy bass and unable to produce the deep low bass. treble is too high and when turned down it doesn't sound right. Ear cups are too small to fit ears comfortably. I own the momentum 2.0 wireless and as soon as I compared them both, I knew instantly that there was no comparison. My jbl e50bt sounded better too all around but it's just as uncomfortable as this one. In the end, skip this and get a used momentum 2.0 wireless for a few dollars more and you'll be much happier with it.These things need to be burned in for at least a hundred hours for the highs to come down a little and sound better. If you didn't have momentums to compare them to you might like them better than I do but these are really not that bad.

    ","It took me awhile to decide. I was leaning towards one of the Bose wireless models but couldn't justify paying over $300 for one. My priorities were comfort, build quality and sound. First, the HD 4.40 is one of the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. I had it on for 6 hours straight over the weekend with no discomfort whatsoever. I work in media so sound is very important to me and it was great to hear the Sennheiser quality on these cans: Crisp, clean highs, solid midrange, and as much bass as you'd like using the captune equalizer app. The way the soft ear cups cover your ears, I found it completely unnecessary to pay more for active noise cancellation. My only complaints are minor: the back cups tend to pick up fingerprints and could show scratches easily. I wish there was more attention given to adding subtle color touches instead of just black and grey. And I wish it came with a proper case instead of just a silk pouch. But all in all, a great purchase. I have absolutely no regrets. Highly recommend if you want great sound and name brand quality in a light compact Bluetooth, over the ear headphones!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"For comfort and sound quality, hard to beat!"

    ","I just got these for Christmas, and I'm enjoying them very much.Turned on/wireless:  It's a lot of fun (and easy) to control Spotify volume & other controls from the right earcup.In my phase of headphone obsession a few years ago, I have always avoided any headphones with wireless or active noise cancel features.  These Sennheisers give me the chance to compare wired/wireless in completely fair A/B fashion:  the exact same headphones hardwired to my iPhone 8 Plus vs. connected by bluetooth.  Passive noise cancel is my preference, and these (circumaural) HD4.40BT headphones do passive NC almost as well as some DJ headphones, while staying more comfortable with the big pads.Turned off/hardwired:-Loss of the ability to control track RW/FF, skips/search, & volume from the headphone buttons.-Since I'm hardwired to my iPhone 8 Plus, it easy enough to use the phone/Spotify app to control everything.-The most important factor to me:  Hardwired, these headphones sound incredible - true Sennheiser sound!  I have listened to a number of Sennheiser headphones over the years, and they are always stellar.  I can hear a huge difference between BT vs. hardwired sound quality.  Through BT, there is noticeable graininess to the sound and a little loss of bass.  When plugged in, there is a tiny bit of graininess/fuzz at lower volume, which disappears at higher volume (I prefer to listen at quieter volume.)  And the bass is very satisfying when hardwired.If you're listening to music while cooking, the wireless control features are great, and the sound is good enough.  If you feel like sitting back and listening to high-quality sounds, plug in & enjoy what Sennheiser is really known for.",5.0 out of 5 stars,wire[d/less]

    ","While there a couple aspects of this pair that could easily be improved, I can't give them less than 5 stars, especially at the $100 Black Friday week price I paid. They are great value, amazing sound as others have noted, and certainly far better than any other pair I have tried at or around its price point. I own a wired set of Sennheiser headphones, and wanted a comparable Bluetooth pair. I held off due to concerns others have voiced about comfort. I do understand these concerns, as they are not *quite* as comfortable as my HD 558's, but I have worn them for three hours without any real discomfort. It is frustrating the lack of padding at the top, because it seems an easy thing to get right, but it has not impacted me, nor have the cans. I suppose this could depend on size/shape of head, so keep this in mind, but if they fit well for you these headphones are amazing value.Will update if anything relevant comes up, I hope nothing does.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Try Them - If They Fit You Well, Buy!"

    ","I wanted to go wireless at a reasonable price point, have portability and enjoy very good quality audio range and dynamics. That is a tough wish list to accomplish. Fortunately, Sennheiser just introduced these headphones at the 2017 CES and they are now coming into inventory on the market. They are packaged nicely and compactly. The cans are accompanied in the box by a quick guide, a safety guide, a USB / mini USB charging cable, a 3.5mm / 2.5mm wired cable and a cloth carrying bag.The cans are very nicely manufactured and attractive without being flashy. All surfaces are matte finish and very dark grey/black with theSennheiser logo on one side of the headband and the Sennheiser 'S'. They are sturdy, light weight and appear durable. They fold down into the headband. The cushions around the cans are a very soft memory foam covered in a leather-like material. The cups are closed back and over the ear but not large so if your ears are big they will not cover the entire lobe and that can become uncomfortable. The cans are deliberately on the small size to enhance portability. They adjust easily to varying head sizes and the cups swivel and pivot to make the fit comfortable for prolonged use. All of the controls are on the bottom rim of the right can. They include a power button; a multipurpose track forward / back;  start / pause  and all of the phone controls; a volume control; an input port for the wired cable; and the USB charging port.Although a full instruction manual does not come in the box it is available at the Sennheiser website for download and it is explicit.Pairing is fast and simple either by NFC or conventional BT. They are compatible with aptx codec for full CD type dynamic range and sound quality. The included 3.5mm wire is for weak battery situations or use in non BT environments and has a Sennheiser angled plug on the can end to ""lock""-in. The first full charge took a little over 2 hours and recharge is about 2 hours and provides an amazing stated 25 hours of use!Now the down and dirty. I know there are audio compromises to be made going wireless. The aptx codec mitigates the reduction of dynamicrange, headroom and soundstage  experienced with BT... but not everybody is going to have that available to them and will more likely usestraight BT. My previous experience with headphones has been wired and the cans I have used, until I received these, were open back andon the ear. They provided a spectacular bright, open and yes, even a thrilling audio experience. Going  to closed back over the ear BT cans is not entirely equivalent. You can achieve the goals of excellent sound stage, dynamic range, frequency response, no lag and impressive headroom at much higher price points. For this price, these 4.40's measure up very well and present an excellent value.They provide very crisp non harsh highs, clear mids and ""good"" bass. I have read many other early reviews that all emphasize the ""solid, punchy, powerful bass"". Many of those reviewers say the bass is extremely up front and almost too prominent.... if that is possible to someears.. My early experience has been that the bass is good, well balanced and does not overpower nor muddy up the rest of the midrange.Individual preferences, the type of music listened to, volume levels, source quality etc. all are factors to be considered with respect to thesubjective bass perception. I feel these cans provide a balanced natural sound without artificial or theatrical embellishment. The sound stage affect is satisfying and enjoyable.To reiterate, at this price point you can't have everything but the 4.40's present an excellent value. I am sure I will enjoy them even more as my listening experience grows. So far I don't have any reservations about highly recommending these headphones and am very satisfied with my purchase.I hope your experience matches mine.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Value

    ","I bought these to replace some Sony MDR headphones which broke, and now I'm not sure why I got the Sony's in the first place. Sound quality is way better, crisper, cleaner. The Sony's sounded muddy by comparison. They're not quite as bass-ey as the Sony's, but it doesn't really bother me. They're compact and fold down for easy storage in whatever bag I have handy, and even larger pockets on the right kind of jacket. I commute a lot on buses and trains (2-3hrs a day on average), and the battery lasted for what felt like much longer than the advertised 25 hours of use. With an audio jack built in, even if your battery dies on the bus, you can keep listening. One note that doesn't bother me but might be a problem for some: these are smaller than the Sony MDRs.

I have them paired with an inexpensive Chinese MP3 player and still the sound is so choice that it's like hearing some of my music for the very first time.  Sound quality over bluetooth is crisp and well balanced, with deep but not overly pronounced bass.I wear eyeglasses and the pads did a good job of sealing off outside noise without pressing uncomfortably on the earpieces.  My ears are pretty normal in size and fit comfortably inside the cushions.  Reading the reviews I was concerned that the memory foam would get hot but they did not in the course of an intense 1 hour workout.  Cushioning on the upper band is minimal but I never had any discomfort from it.  I'm happy and if the battery life is as good as they say then I'll be even happier.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed!

Price range over $300 seem a bit excessive for a pair of headphones that I wouldn't be using regularly its not bad to have but I decided to continue looking and found the Sennheiser 4.50 and finally found the 4.40 without the noise canceling which save a bit more money on unnecessary features and I knew this was the one..I'm no audiophile but these headphones sounded balance from out of the box.I downloaded the Sennheiser Captune app and adjusted the EQ & FX for Vocal & Bass Boost.Now the mid is more crisp and a small punch in bass.

I mean SOLD!!! Reliability, superb sound quality and comfort. All of them are wonderfully surrounding me in comfy to wear and amazing sound to listen. The 4.40s are equally in sound to the newer 4.50s but they don't feature the active NC (noise cancelling), however they compensate with larger ear pads (thicker, actually). Everything else is the very same. The most important for me, when talking headphones is the ability to keep them on for as long as it gets and this is even many hours in a row (4-5). Never ever have I experienced to much pressure or any kind of fatigue. Second on my list is what I can hear with them and all these three models feature a band with of 18Hz up to 22kHz. Human ear tops at age of 18 at about 18kHz, but trained ears (musicians, conductors and such) have the trained ability to go a little bit higher. But we don't get any younger, do we? All in all the 4.40 have the very same potential as the other here listed models (saying that because they are not yet broken-in); the controls are kind of sophisticated if you need phone control and skipping tracks (I don't do that and I don't use them in conjunction with a phone), but if you don't do that, they are as accurate as it gets with an independent On/Off button, and very distinct volume +/- button, and both are easy reachable and there is no way to trigger them by mistake. The overall build is simplistic and this is what makes them excellent. They are sturdy, comfy and are made from quality materials. If, for any reason something goes south, I will update this review accordingly.

    ","SoundI compared these to several other wireless headphones in the $150 to $200 range including the Sony Wireless, Beats Studio Wireless, and JVC wireless.  For my taste, these headphones had the best sound hands down.  I listen to everything from rock to hip hop to classical sometimes.  I found the Sony and Beats headphones have way too much bass and not enough mid/treble.  The JVCs were close; but, two out of three pairs were broken on the store display so I figured they wouldn't hold up.  These headphones get plenty loud for my taste.  However, I found that they are actually too loud.  While at work, on the softest setting, I frequently find myself trying to turn down the volume.  The minimum volume is just too loud.ControlsThe controls are decent.  I have a hard time finding the ""everything"" button that does play/fwd/back.  I have to feel around for it a lot of the time.  Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying.  I paired these with an iPhone 6 and they work great.  If you walk away for a while and come back, just hit the multi-function button and they re-pair instantly.  Stay away too long and the headphones shut themselves off to preserve battery.  Activating Siri is a bit odd though, you have to stop the music, then you can hold to activate Siri.Build QualityOverall these are well built.  I assume that they will last for years.  The ear cups swivel in two directions so they are pretty comfortable there.Why I Am Returning ThemAll of that said, the ear cups are just too small; probably by a quarter inch.  So either part of my ear is under the ear pad or I play with the thing for a minute until my ear is bent out of shape to fit in the ear cup.  I tried these for almost three weeks and realized that every time I put them on, I sit there adjusting them for like 30-60 seconds to get them comfortable.  Then after an hour or so I have to adjust them again because my ears hurt.  I am also returning them because of the minimum volume issue I noted above.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound but ear cup are too small

    ","Pros:====-Pretty solid bass.-Relatively clear sound production-Relatively Comfortable-Easy to use / pairCons:====-Not very loud-Ear pads are a bit small. Much smaller than my ATH-M50x's-A bit bass heavy. Bright highs and harsh mids are easily overtaken by the bass, which results in a somewhat muddy and hollow experience.These aren't my favorite headphones. I own Koss Porta Pros (weak sauce), Koss Sporta Pros (same exact phones as the Porta Pros), Sony MDR-V6 (what a nightmare set of headphones), ATH-M50x (usually my comfortable default, although light on the bass with BRIGHT highs and clear mids), Beyerdynamic DT770s (probably my favorite everyday cans for work right now, clear sound production and mostly comfortable in short sprints, well balanced), Monoprice 8323 (w/Brainwavs HM5 pads, DT770 headband... solid cheap pair of cans), Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro (crystal clear sound production, insanely comfortable, adjustable bass, but nearly as quiet as these Senn's), V-moda Crossfade LP (heavy bass, empty otherwise). I'm sure these will grow on me, as they will serve their purpose (being wireless), and I'll keep them because I hate returning stuff. For now though, I'm not super impressed for the price point... I've heard $100 pairs of BT Sony cans that sounded just as good. Maybe my wife will inherit them shortly, and I'll just spend a few hundred more for a better pair that doesn't come in what I imagine is the same flimsy cloth they use to make banana hammocks.Finally this is more OCD than anything (and really this is my first pair of Sennheiser's), but the fact that all of the cables connect on the right side really bothers me.",3.0 out of 5 stars,-Relatively clear sound production -Relatively Comfortable -Easy to use / pair Cons
303,"on January 5, 2018",,"The sounds quality in these headphones is astoundingly good for their price, and they are extremely comfortable. I bought these headphones with the intention of listening to music or streaming shows for long periods of time (3-4 hours at a time), and after using them for a week they have done this perfectly. The battery life on them is very substantial, as I have only really charged them once without even really needing to, so they really are perfect for long show/music binges. The only downside I can find about them is that they have a tendency to beep every time you switch media sources. This can be a little annoying when watching videos on Instagram/YouTube, but otherwise they are great.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for long periods of use

    ","First of all, I'm not audiophile by any means. I'm just a guy who happens to love to watch movies, has a family and a small home.My original purpose was use Kodi (on Raspberry Pi 3 using Xbian as OS) with this Headphones, so when my family was asleep i could watch my movies in silence, good audio and no cables attached. So, i paired this set with this: BTD 500 USB Dongle which worked flawlessly with this headsets.Kodi recognized the dongle as a sound card (you just have to select the ""soundcard"" kodi recognizes), and the pairing was flawless on first try. I selected movies i had with DTS/DTS-MA/AC3/MP3/Dobly and all played wonderfully, without lag of anykind. And on top of that, no matter what was playing, the APT-X light was on while the movie was playing, so you can be sure the audio was crystal clear.I'll keep updating this review on days to follow if anything worth mentioning comes up.Cheers!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect puzzle part for my Wireless KODI movie watching.
305,"on May 26, 2017",,"These aren't even close to the HD558 which are wonderful for the price. Just listening wired for comparison the soundstage and instrument detail on these 4.40 are only reasonable at best. I was hoping for a Bluetooth wireless solution to the HD558s but these 4.40 aren't it. The JBl 300 wireless on a kiosk at Best Buy even sounded better and they are on sale with open boxed ones as well.Returning asap and I will run, not walk to do so at my local Best Buy where I bought them the other day. Why would I keep them, I will search for other better sounding wireless solutions. Best Buy has the Beats Studios on sale for $199, With an open box set I should be close to the 4.40 price and I bet the Beats blows them away. Dunno, maybe I got a lemon  pair.Edit: Phew, after reading reviews and checking the 5 and 4 star write-ups I figured there had to be something wonky. Well it was the way the cable was connected to the headphones that caused mediocre sound. I had to connect up a few times until there was a drastic difference in what I was hearing.I still think the HD558s are better for sound but I am much closer to a wireless solution on the budget side with good sound quality. I rather not spend for Bose and the Beats on sale at Best Buy along with the JBL 300 wireless will be my next ones to try.These Sennheiser fit me pretty well, not tight and cover my ears pretty well for some isolation. They are comfortable enough for me not to have an issue with that.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Still Searching

    ","I had a pair of Sennheiser in ear headphones back to few years ago, I was impressed with sound quality for the price I paid(less then $50). I'm having a big hope when the sales introduce me to this headphone. But you got what you paid for, the sound quality is ok, but bass is not deep enough and the high is not too clear either, so it's an average headphone to me. Of course I cant compare this to any high end headphone, but I think for music lover should invest in something better than this one .",3.0 out of 5 stars,Little disappointment

    ","This headset was purchased for a 94 year old with two hearing aids who has trouble understanding words when using a phone.  Phones for the hearing impaired did not help much; speaker phones work a little better, but most are not loud enough and are disturbing to others.  This headset works perfectly!  We paired it to an ATT TL96456 landline phone and now long conversations with remote children and grandchildren are easy.For this use, over-the-ear style headphone are necessary, as the on-the-ear style are often problematic with hearing aids.  Word comprehension is improved dramatically by using both ears, rather than the single ear headsets that are common for phone use.  The reviews for most of the headsets in this category indicate that the microphone pickup is poor.  This one is different.  My thanks to reviewer Msturg29 for the invaluable comparison of different headsets, including microphone operation.  We chose this one because of the good  microphone review.  We couldn't be happier..",5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding for hearing-impaired phone use

    ","I'm not an audiophile, and currently have one good headphones (AKG K701) that are not really portable and I use them mostly when working from home (sound leakage, open design). I am looking for polyvalent wireless headphones, mostly to listen while working 8h / day. Tried the Skullcandy Hesh 3 Wireless Headphone, Black (S6HTW-K033), the Sennheiser HD 4.40 Around Ear Bluetooth Wireless Headphones (HD 4.40 BT), the Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2: Over Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Case - Gold and the Bose QC35II. Did compare them on various musics, rock, pop, classic, ... .Bottom line: The only one I kept are the Hesh 3! Not for myself as I felt the comfort was not great (too tight / clamping pressure, burning ears after 1h listening), but for commute / smaller listening periods (i.e not full workday), they are great. Bluetooth is stable, sound quality is good. I'll keep looking for a comfy work-polyvalent headphones, probably give up the bluetooth criteria as I'm disappointed by the sound quality of the Sony & the Bose, and I'm not ready to put 350$ for 100$ audio quality level.Sound quality:Sony and the Bose are OK, but that's it, just OK, not great and not what I expect from 350$ headphones.Hesh3 have well defined bass (not too boomy, just what's needed to make it a fun headphones to listen to). Very good spatialization. Grabbed them at 80$ on black friday, and for my uneducated ears, they compare more to the Sony & the Bose than with my AKG K701 (not in the same category :-)). TBH, the sony & bose are a bit more clear than the Hesh3, but ... I feel the Hesh3 are more ""fun"" and would be my choice here.The clear looser here are the Sennheiser. They are disqualified from this review. Stay away from them, my 10y-old 15$ Koss are better. No spatialization, bad for rock, for pop, for classic... Might do for techno / podcasts.Build / comfort:Hesh 3 feels a bit plastic like at opening, but you quickly forget it. Comfort is so-so, you definitely feel them more than Sony & Bose. More clamping pressure, lower quality ear pads.Sony feels good and are probably the winner, I'm just a bit worried about the touch control thingy, what happens after the warranty expires ? Do you pay 200$ for repair if this stop working or bug ?Bose earpads feel less durable, BUT, they are the comfort winner. If you have money and want to buy a light, comfy headphones, go for it. Sony are the 2nd best in these models.Bluetooth:Hesh3: all good.Sony: I sent them back because... they kept jumping on my macbook. If I looked left or right, the sound will jump. If I walk 2 meter away from the laptop, it will jump. Worked good with my iPhone, but ... it's the only BT headphones I tried that was disqualified because of this. Not acceptable for this price range.Bose: did try them only 30min, but they seemed good.Sound leakage / isolation:Hesh3: no active noise cancellation, but cost 5 time less than the competition. I don't need that much noise cancellation and what they provide is enough to work in a open space, very little sound leakage.Sony / Bose: amazing. You put them on, and feel isolated from a lot of background noise. If you're looking for peaceful commute, they are worth it. The mic from the Sony did seems to pick less background noise in the few calls I tried.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Tried few Bluetooth headphones, the only one I kept are the Skullcandy Hesh 3"

There is no included hard case, only a lightweight bag.  It's a small thing, but since they're designed for travel I was surprised they cut corners here.  3. My ears heated up and got sore a little faster than with the other pair I tried.  Now, you may not care about these things, in which case, you will appreciate the world class sound, easy bluetooth connectivity, and very good noise reduction considering it's not active noise canceling.
