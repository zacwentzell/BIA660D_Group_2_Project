    ","I will get straight to the point. What hifi rated the Sennheiser Momentum M2 in-ear headphones as the product of the year 2016. I own those and these sound marginally better than those with a very similar sound signature.The main characteristics of this headphone is lush detailed sound, great dynamics and tight, full bodied bass. These are not bass heavy, but these are not bass shy either. Its a bit hard to explain but I will try. My stereo setup consists of a pair of KEF LS50 speakers. I was extremely happy with it, till one day I added a HSU Subwoofer from the home theater system to the mix. The KEF's sounded the same but suddenly I was aware of what I was missing. Think of these headphones as a similar set up where a superb stereo speaker has an amazing subwoofer added to it. The bass never over powers the mids and highs like other bass heavy headphones do. It just adds the extension that you wont notice until you hear it.There is no noise cancelling feature here, I am fine with that. The passive noise cancelling did not bother me at all during a 4 hour flight.What this headphone does is deliver musicality and details in spades. Compared to my Shure SE846 (4X the price) these lack maybe a very thin veil of transparency and detail. But you will be hard pressed to find the differences in an A/B test. All that over bluetooth !!!Not sure why a previous customer complained about bluetooth range, these have a better range than Urbanite XL's that I also own. I was able to keep a steady connection to my Laptop inside the house while planting perennials outside today. That's at least a 50 feet range. When the connection does go out of range, the sq doesn't deteriorate, it simply drops out. I like it, this means I am not constantly trying to be as close to the source as possible to eke out the best possible sound from these.Charging is via a micro usb cable. I would have preferred USB-C but that's just me. One nice touch, if you are listening to music via PC and run out of juice, you can plug these in to the PC and it becomes a USB powered headphone while it charges. Sure the USB cable is inconvenient, but it keeps you listening to the music without interruption. There is no difference sonically between a wireless or a wired connection. This isnt a new feature, other bluetooth headphones by sennheiser have this feature as well, but I find it a nice feature to have.There are a couple of things I do not like about these headphones:1) The cables come out from the bottom of the neck piece. This adds a bit of length to the headphone cables and it simply makes no sense ergonomically2) The headphone cables are flat, but I would have much preferred them to be braided as well. Nylon braiding will add some tensile strength to the cables and will give them a longer life, also I find the rubber very slightly sticky on my neck. Nylon or hybrid braiding usually feels a little better.Then again, if you keep a beard, nylon braiding will be scratchy.3) Out of the box, you get 4 sizes of silicone tips (Xsmall, small, medium, large). My $ 9 Apie earbuds came with 6 sizes. I needed something between small and medium for the right fit. The comply foam tips for momentum fit on these just fine, so thats what I am using. Come on sennheiser, at this price, I expect a few more tips and a few foam ones as well.4) These headphones are bright out of the box and need at least 20 hours of break in to approach their actual sound quality. I wont ding these for that. But seemed like a longer than usual time to break them in.5) No aptX™ HD.There are a few things I do like about these headphones1) Incredible sound quality. I have quite a few bluetooth headphones including Sennheiser made ones as well as the Sony MDR-1000X and the B&W P7 Wireless. These headphones sound better to me than any of those.2) Improved bluetooth range. If you arent getting a good range or poor sound, check your bluetooth set up, these headphones have a better range than the ones mentioned above.3) Classy, understated design with a premium finish that oozes luxury.4) The switch to lower the volume is towards the outside. Easy to reach if you need to reduce the volume in a hurry.5) 15+ hours battery life.6) Unobtrusive neckband that easily hides inside the shirt collar.7) Built in USB DAC.8) Qualcomm® apt-X™ bluetooth setup. No discernible lag while watching a movie.9) Sensitive microphone. Everyone hears me clearly and I dont have to shout during my conversation. These will also catch a lot of the external noises, but not any more than your phones built in mic.10)Included case is quite nice and can hold an extra pair of IEM's.All in all, until Sennheiser releases a truly over ear headphone that can cover my entire ear and supports aptX™ HD, these will remain my go to headphones for listening on the go and at work. (My serious listening headphone is lately a Sennheiser HD 700), sure this headphone isnt for everyone. It doesnt have noise cancelling, isnt flashy and doesnt have a rapper or a dj attached to its development, (though I hear Sennheiser is trying that as well). If music is what you seek and are willing to take on the relative comprise of going bluetooth over wired, these headphones are heartily recommended for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommended with some insignificant reservations

    ","This one is tough for me because I love Sennheiser as a company and they produce awesome products. I purchased these understanding some of the flaws, thinking that they wouldn't really be a big deal and that I could overlook them, but after using them for a bit, there are just some gripes I can't see past. Before going further, let me say that this will be a review based on the use of these as an everyday wireless headset for your phone, which is what I believe most people shopping in this segment are looking for.If listening to music and sheer audio quality was the only thing that mattered, I would probably give these 5-stars since I think they do about as well as can be expected from any Bluetooth earbuds—the limiting factor being the quality of the Bluetooth audio signal rather than the earbuds themselves.As a headset for general use, though, I have three primary gripes.1. The Ear Buds REALLY Should Have Been Designed To Retract.This is something that I obviously knew about prior to purchase, but it's not until I started to wear these everyday and use them on a regular basis that I began to really understand how annoying this oversight in design could be. I generally have these around my neck almost all day, but it's not as if I'm making phone calls or listening to music the entire day so when I'm not, the ear buds just dangle precariously and I'm aware that I have this pretty delicate, but fairly pricey thing just waiting to get caught on something and ripped off.The alternative would really be to remove the band from my person and store it securely in the very nice protective case that Sennheiser provides, but I feel like that sort of goes against the idea of a headset since doing so would effectively cut me off from the hands-free call receiving benefits. So it seems to be either use it the way I would use my normal headphones for listening to music (although my normal headphones are far more robust) or have my earbuds get caught on everything from my seatbelt to the straps of my backpack.So this is one of those things that I simply underestimated the annoyance of going into it, but Sennheiser should really do better next time.-------------------------------2. The Mic Needs Some Sort of Noise CancellationPart of the reason one would purchase a headset like this is for the combined ability to listen to audio and make phone calls. With the average wired headset, you often notice people moving the mic portion closer to their mouth during their phone calls. The reason for this is pretty obvious—it essentially reduces the signal-to-noise ratio by making your voice louder than the ambient noise. The location of the mic on the neckband, however, means that without some sort of technology to reduce the ambient noise—something that doesn't seem to be present—the person on the other end of your phone call is going to hear a whole lot of what's going on around you.So while you will hear the other person well thanks to the great audio quality, this quirk of the microphone means that the other person may not hear you so well without you having to raise your voice louder than normal.-------------------------------3. Bluetooth Can Be FinnickyThis isn't so much a specific knock against this headset (although, I feel like it's performance in this regard is not as good as some other headsets I've tried), but Bluetooth can be a finnicky thing with connection being unexpectedly lost between the device and your phone. I was actually on a walk where the headset simply disconnected and refused to reconnect with the phone despite all of my attempts. I'm not sure what prevented the pairing (maybe it overheated?), but a few hours later, it suddenly started working again without a hiccup. This hasn't been a consistent problem for me so it's been difficult to really pin down the cause, but I would just put it out there that you might purchase these and suddenly find yourself in situations where they may not be pairing with your device for periods of time.I suppose that's a risk with all wireless technology to a degree, but as I noted above, I have other Bluetooth headphones and headsets that I've used that haven't suffered from the quirks that I've experienced with this particular headset... That having been said, I guess take this last one with a grain of salt.-------------------------------So now that we're done with the gripes, I'll bring up some positives. I find the controls on the neckband to be logically laid out and easy to use. The battery life has been very good for me and I've never had a situation where I was even close to running out of battery. The audio quality is, of course, excellent. And the headset looks pretty good in my opinion.I've replaced the stock ear bud tips with Comply Foam tips simply because I find them to be more comfortable, but that's personal preference rather than a knock on the stock ear bud tips.I hope this has provided a little bit of insight to help you make an informed decision. Frankly, there doesn't seem to be any standout in this category that performs excellently in all aspects so at the moment, it's going to come down to where you are willing to take your compromises. For me, even despite that grievances that I've mentioned, audio quality is still paramount to me, so I will continue to use them and if I could go back and do it again, I would have still purchased them.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Audio, Not The Best Headset"

    ","Love this IEM and I'm a guy who hates IEMs in general. The comfort is the best so far from this type of HPs, and the sound is very full and competitive to some of my full size cans. Great connectivity and very stable. Aptx is great if your source device support it. Battery lasts 2 days easily.Sounds great for phone calls too, on both ends. The dual usage [music and hands free phone calls] makes it a valuable  product for me.Wish the buds had magnets to stick to one another when not in the ear so they don't dangle.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pick this for sound quality and comfort.

    ","Now take this in to account that I'm coming from a pair of old LG Tone HBS-700's which were pretty muddy sounding.  The moment I paired these up and started up some music (I usually listen to some form of rock) these sounded night and day better!  Also keep in mind this was compared to both of them being paired via my laptop (running Linux Mint), not a phone that would be using the AAC or Apt-X codec that these support.  Regardless the sound was night and day better.  Do they sound as great as wired, not quite.  These are VERY comparable in sound to an old pair of V-Moda Vibe's I used to have which had nice clean highs and very decent bass for ear buds.  I say very comparable because there's SOME slight effect from being connected via Bluetooth but not a whole lot.  But as far as bluetooth headphones these are by far my favorite.  Normally I'd ding it because of the slight sound issues from bluetooth but seriously, you'll never find bluetooth that sounds as crystal clear as wired.  I also paired them to my phone and they sounded just as good, if not better (due to Apt-X support).  All the controls worked as expected.  I'm pretty happy.  Now if I can just keep them away from my rabbit that ate through the wires of my LG's.",5.0 out of 5 stars,... a pair of old LG Tone HBS-700's which were pretty muddy sounding

    ","Not what I was hoping for in terms of audio quality.  Bass is OK but highs are muddled and weak.  You can spend amusing hours playing with the equalizers on the app but you don't get very far.  To be fair, I AM comparing it against a Sennheiser HD650 and mid range headphone amp as well as a Sennheiser MBT-2 bluetooth headset, but for the price I expected to get closer in audio quality then I did.I said did because it just decided to quit working, fortunately one week prior to the Amazon replacement window closing.  New one is on the way, so we'll see if this unit is any different.Ergonomics are good.  The controls on the band are simple and straightforward.  There is less of a tactile difference between the various buttons than I would like but with some practice I was getting pretty good at it.  The fact that Sennheiser has pretty much the same UI between models is really helpful.  The silicone buds fit well and are very comfortable.In general, I like Sennheiser stuff.  The HD 650 is four years old, has gone through one headband (replaced quickly and free although it was probably my fault) and countless hours.  The MB2 is great.  I was hoping for a bit more here given the pedigree...",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite all in the family.

    ","sound is good.  Design needs work.  The earbuds have no way to secure them to the neck strap (such as a clip or magnetic attachment).  So they just dangle there when not in your ears getting caught on everything from backpacks, jackets, lanyards, or anything else that may come near the front of your personage.  For a pair of $200 buds, this is an unforgivable oversight.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Dangling ear buds.

    ","Update:It looks like the latency when playing video occurs in rare scenarios but it does occur.I use sennheiser for nearly 6 years and always appreciated the quality of the sound when compared to other head phones(including Bose).Having said that, the quality of the sound is top notch in this wireless headset as well, it is not bass heavy but still delivers a true sound with good quality bass. The Bluetooth pairing is seamless with iPhone(haven't tried with Android).The problem I have is the gap in audio sync when playing videos. The audio picks up late when playing video which is not a huge problem for me cos i mostly listen to audio but still it is not acceptable when i paid 200$ for something where a basic function is missing.I will have to probably return it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Quality yet missing something!

    ","Who am I: someone who owns many headphones, needs a bluetooth-capable headphone, and is picky when it comes to audio clarity and sound signature.  I own many Sennheiser products and am a big fan of their attention to detail.That said, I cannot recommend these to anyone who is hoping to use these for running or lifting at the gym or frankly any kind of physical activity beyond walking.Pros: Sound quality is very good, not great, but probably the best bluetooth headphones I've heard. . Bass is perhaps a bit too prominent and the midrange and highs aren't quite as clear and articulate as I would like, but this is to be expected at this affordable price. Battery life is very good, I do not doubt the 10-hour specification on the box.Cons: You cannot run with these headphones on as the device around your neck will rotate and pull one of the monitors out of your ear.  Headphone wires are too short to wrap-around-the-ear so you get all the annoying noise from the cable as you run - it's so loud you can't even hear the music.  Finally, the HD1 really struggles in multiple-device environments. Even though my iPhone was out of range the HD1 would  constantly remind me that it was either connected or disconnected from my iPhone while I was streaming music from my Apple Watch.If you only pair these headphones to a single device and don't intend to work out with them on, I think they're a good deal. Otherwise, pass.  I am returning mine.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not appropriate for running or other rigorous activities

    ",Love these headphones! I previously had some LG headphones that were good but lacked the bass response I wanted. These Sennheiser headphones deliver great bass but their sound is properly balanced to deliver the full spectrum of frequencies. They fit very comfortably in my ears so much so that I forget I have them on. They look great with a stitched leather band. The Bluetooth setup was accomplished easily especially with my smartphone as they provide an NFC (near field communication) feature that automatically sets up a connection with my phone. (only for the initial setup). The headphones come in a hard fiber case that looks good and does a great job of protecting the headphones.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tremendous headphones!

    ","I really wanted to like these.  I have  LG Tones LG HBS-800 Ultras, Sony MDRXB80BS/L Premium, and VMODA Crossfade Wireless headphones.The sound stage on these Sennheiser is indeed noticeably better than my LG and Sony earbuds. Clarity is good, mids are excellent...but it is too ""crisp"" or ""High"" for me.  Its sounds too shirly as if the treble is too high to my ears. I hear lots of ""hisses"" that actually started hurting my ears after a while. I did try all the ear tips and only the medium sized ones worked good enough for me.  Bass is quite good, not overpowered or emphasized, but natural...a bit more bass in these than I had expected actually. The Sonys have a bit more bass, but not quite as clean and smooth.The Leather on the neck bank is comfortable, but I question how long it would last. The headset isn't heavy, but it isnt light. But definitely feels solid and quality built product. Case it comes with is very neat.Wish it had a way to secure the earbuds, like the magnetic thing the LGs have.My second use of the headphones, the right earbud made a loud squealing noise when i put in in my ear and whenever i touched it. It also sounded lower in volume than the left. I put it in and out of my ear a few times, then turned the headset off then on again. That resolved the issue. It didn't do it again that session.Was on the fence of keeping these despite the high treble sound...but for $200, more than double the price of the Sony's I bought a few months ago....no they are not worth the price to me.

14,"on February 25, 2018",,"I really want to give these headphones 5 stars.However, there are a couple factors that I will address first that prevent these from being ""the perfect pair"" for me.(1) Call/Mic Quality: I've tried taking 3-4 calls both outside and inside (I live where cell reception is 99% of the time good) and every time the other person can't hear me. Repeatedly I was told ""Sounds like you were very far away in  a tunnel."" Maybe I'm missing a firmware update, but from my experience you should not be considering these headphones if you plan on taking a lot of calls with them.(2) Connectivity: Whether it's the headphones or my iPhone, I'd say at least three to five times a day I'll momentarily lose audio connection. It's usually for only a second or so and the music picks right back up, but it's annoying nonetheless.OKAY. On to the good!(1) Comfort: the leather on the neckband is very soft to the touch and while the structure is heavier than just having a cable, it never feels so heavy that it makes my neck hurt.(2) Cable-noise: there is none to speak of!(3) Sound: I've owned many different styles and brands of earbuds and headphones in the sub $200 range and these are easily the best. From Yo-Yo Ma to Kendrick to Coltrane to Mastadon to Kimbra to The War on Drugs to Bon Ivor--every band and genre I listen to sounds unbelievable. The clairty, soundstage, vibrance of the instrumentation, the depth and precision of the bass, the control and airiness of the upper registries--it's all beautifully balanced and alive.So: who should buy these?

15,"on February 8, 2018",,"These headphones are outstanding.  Easily the best wireless headphones I've ever used.  They're very comfortable.  Normally earbud wires rub against my beard or neck and annoy me, but these stay off to the side and don't.  The collar part is light and unobtrusive, features intuitive controls, and looks very nice while remaining subtle.  The buds fit my ears right out of the box, but there are also a number of other size options, including a suspiciously narrow one that I'll probably try out of boredom later.  I've seen some reviewers complaining that the buds don't grip the outer ear in the way that Bose earbuds do, but I always find those grips very uncomfortable after they've been digging into my ears after about an hour, so I really appreciate the design choice.  There isn't any active noise cancellation, but they do a solid job blocking out sound and I can't hear anything through them while music is playing even below half-volume.These are the 5th set of Sennheiser headphones that I have purchased over the last 5 years, and have had zero complaints about any of them.

    ","I am a huge fan of Sennheiser products, and of high-end audio products generally, having owned in-ear etymotic ER-4's, ER-6's and Shure SE-535's. I had previously been carrying around my Sennheiser Momentums (with cable). They were heavy but the sound reproduction was amazing and I'd had them for a couple years and they'd just gotten old and tired (they didn't hold in place very well), and it was time to replace them. Since I normally use my headphones to commute as well as for the office, I wanted something lighter.I made the mistake of going with Sennheiser's high-end bluetooth in-ear headphone. I mention the other brand of in-ear headphones because they, crucially, fit your ears. They come with several sets of baffles -- foam, two-and-three baffle silicone, and so on. For such a high end piece of audio equipment, this really just doesn't deliver in the fit department. If you move your head around to the left or right, the headphones have a tendency to fall out.Which brings me to my next and important point -- if you use this product for commuting, or exercise, it becomes infuriating to use. You have to continually adjust it to get the earphones back in. I have tried every single fitting that came with it, and nothing actually seats the earphones in my ears in the presence of motion. Other high-end products (the Shures for example) came with foam baffles that both isolate well and have very good traction, meaning they stand up to movement in conditions like exercise and moving trains. They also hold up to things like sweat, which these categorically do not handle.I originally used these with a Google Nexus 6P and the sound quality was good, but the Bluetooth reception was -- I won't mince words -- really, really poor. In areas where there were lots of people (trains, offices, apartment buildings) it was nearly impossible to get it to play without stuttering through even a single layer of fabric, and certainly not if I had my hand on top of my phone, leaving me wishing I had just bought a nice set of cans with wires. When I upgraded to a Pixel 2 XL, both the audio quality and the signal strength improved dramatically, so it seems that these were specific to that phone, but you may want to look in to what your particular phone's bluetooth capabilities are before buying these headphones. Some are going to perform better than others.After upgrading to the Pixel, I am really happy with the sound quality. I didn't believe it was possible, but the sound stage is broader and the mids are just more present and the bass is punchier. I went digging in the developer options and sure enough, the Pixel 2 has a much better bluetooth audio driver, and these headphones benefit from having a very good bluetooth audio driver. So it would seem that, even though you are buying high-end Sennheiser headphones, you are limited by what your device can actually deliver to them.And the last thing I want to say is that I like the aesthetic. They're nice in my hands. They feel well made. I like the leather and the two-tone cable. I like the buttons. This device has so much potential and is utterly ruined by the failure to just provide a fitting that works for listening in situations that aren't, I guess, quietly at your desk.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser makes great audio products for in-home use.

    ","You're gonna look like a dork, there's no getting around it. The leather doesn't help. Because the neckband is solid, you can't e.g. throw these in your pocket. Because the case is so inconvenient, you're going to leave them dangling around your neck. Because the earbuds don't retract or attach magnetically, they're going to dangle, getting in your way. The audio quality is decent, but there is noise cancellation, which you would expect at this price. The earbud tips leave much to be desired -- specifically, they'll shift around because they don't have ""wings"" on them like you might be used to. In addition, the cord between the earbuds and the neckband are coated with a rubbery material that transmits vibration, so you'll hear it in your skull if they get hit, brush against a zipper, or anything at all, really. Finally, although the bluetooth connection is about as reliable as bluetooth connections get, that's still super unreliable. My music hasn't skipped this much since the days of the diskman.

I'm an headphone addict/junly, whatever you guys wanna call it - that's me. I own about 80 headphones, yes, as I said, I'm aware that this is a little too much :DAnyway, here are my pros and cons for these Sennheiser HD1:Pros:- Great, fun, energetic sounds quality: well balanced with some bass boost which actually works amazingly well even for those of you who are NOT bassheads (like myself).- Good passive noise isolation, blocks outside noise well enough without being on the extreme side of things.- Comfortable: you have to love the ""around the neck"" style to like these. I'll admit I wasn't a huge fan at first, but then it started to grow on me and I really really like how these fit. They're light and well designed ergonomically.Cons:- Bass can SOMETIMES be a bit overwhelming, but only in bass-heavy tracks- Around neck design is not for everyone- No active noise cancellation for a relatively high priceIn conclusion, this is a major go for anyone who's in the market for great sounding wireless headphones who are looking for well-balanced sound and good comfort, without compromising too much on anything.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE THESE.

    ","I pre-ordered a pair of these because I was looking for great quality wireless earbuds. I had tried the neck design before in other wireless earbuds and I liked it very much. I have many headphones, wireless and wired, and I have to say that the around-the-neck design is one of the most comfortable things that can be. So as soon as I found out Sennheiser was going to release around-the-neck wireless earbuds, I knew I was getting some.These are based on the HD 1 in-ear wired design;  one of their smash hits in earbuds. The HD 1 in-ear are rated as one of the best earbuds one can get. So I in deed was excited to see Sennheiser make the move to wireless. And they delivered.The clarity of sound of these earbuds is amazing. Every frequency comes out crystal clear. The bass has a special presence, punchy but not doesn't overwhelm any other frequency. You get pretty awesome very low frequencies. I listen to Hi-Def music and these headphones pick up a lot of details.The carrying case is conveniently thing and portable. Everything that comes in the box looks premium and feels premium. The headphones are one of the lightest I have tried. I love how I can start walking around and forget that I'm even wearing earbuds. The earbuds themselves have an astonishing noise isolation. Their efficiency to block out noise helps you be immersed in your music even in noisy environments. What's more, they block out noise while being super comfortable. They sit in my ear canal without pushing outwards. So you get no listening fatigue from the earbuds or the sound waves.Battery life is great. Charging cable is long (unusual for wireless headphones).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Supreme sound.

    ","I've been using the LG neckband headsets since the HBS-700. The convenience of the neckband [with magnetic earbud holders, was priceless. The sound, however, was similar to an inexpensive set of wired earbuds. I also have a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 20, Active Noise Cancelling Wired Earbuds. I absolutely love the QC20s! I am ready to loose the wire, though. I decided it was time to up my game and get the best wireless sound quality available.  I debated purchasing the Sennheiser HD1 In-Ear Wireless Headphones OR the Bose Quiet Control 30 Active Noise Cancelling, In-Ear Wireless Headphones - since I couldn't decide, I chose both, and here's why:Since I can't just go to Best Buy and try these on, for obvious reasons, I was very dependent on reviews. The Amazon.com reviews were very helpful, and many other sites offered similar experiences. I ignored those reviews that indicated the user misunderstood the systems, and of course the rare ""defective item"" mentions. The Sennheisers won by a long shot - mainly based on audio quality [accuracy, range, presence, etc...]. The Sennheiser's materials include leather, and the overall build seems to be ""classier"" if not better. I thought I was ready for a wireless pair of great sounding buds.The Sennheisers are a nice looking, well-built unit. I do wish they had an ear bud storage method, like the LG magnets, for when they need to be on standby. When I set up the Sennheisers I was mildly impressed. I have since re-examined my iTunes settings and realized all my music was down-sampled to 128kbps during sync. I don't have enough room for all my music at 256kbps, but I did have room for 192kbps AAC, so that's what I selected. WOW!!! The difference is incredible!!! I'm not going to even try to describe it - just see for yourself - with any decent headphones. The moral of this story - double check your library file types, codecs, and streaming settingsAlthough I love the sound of the Sennheisers, there are a couple of issues.Cons:1 - Not the most comfortable - you must learn exactly how to insert the buds for maximum comfort;2 - I do not like closed-back headphones, they make me feel like I'm in a closet - the Sennheisers, as the LGs - are like ear plugs, and give the same effect. The Bose sit just inside the ear and don't plug the ear, so they are more similar to open-back headphones;3 - Related to #2, if you are wearing the Sennheisers, you will not be able to have conversations. The passive noise canceling when listening to music is pretty good. When listening to audiobooks or podcasts, there is little noise cancellation, but you still don't want to have a conversation - there is no sound pass through like on my QC20s;4 - I love the vibrating neckbands, but the vibration on these are very minimal and hard to detect at times;5 - Spoken Word sound quality is pretty bad. This is because most podcasting, radio streaming, and audio books are highly compressed and low bitrate. Since the Sennheisers are so accurate, the compression is very noticeable and tiring. This is one of the main reasons I also want the Bose QC30s;6 - The CapTune app is not necessary and difficult to use. The HD1's sound best with EQ at ""Flat"", but you might like to boost the Stage, Bass, and Treble with the optional switches. It takes a bit to figure how to do this, though. I believe the CapTune settings only affect music played from my iPhone - Audible and other apps don't seem to be affected;7 - No ear bud magnets for securing these while not in use.Pros:1 - Long battery life;2 - Fast and easy pairing;3 - NFC - but not supported by IOS;4 - AAC and APTx for supported devices - no APTx Low Latency, so there is a very slight delay with my Firestick;5 - Build quality and 2-year warranty;6 - INCREDIBLE sound quality for a Bluetooth earbud!!!I recommend you really research AAC, APTx, NFC, IOS, and other technicalities to determine how to best use the features of these earbuds and what devices each is compatible with.So, why do I also want the Bose QC30?Although I really appreciate an accurate sounding speaker when listening to my music library, I simply don't really sit still and listen to music very often. I walk and workout, do chores, work with machinery, etc... I mainly listen to streaming news and audiobooks, and although the Bose aren't very accurate, they sound much warmer to me, I can listen to such sources for hours on end without tiring. The earbuds sit in the outer ear, so the Active Noise Cancelling is necessary to block unwanted noise - and it works! Plus, with the ability to allow voice to pass through, I can have a brief conversation without removing the buds. I haven't received the QC30s, yet, but I tried a friend's pair, and as I have already mentioned, I own the QC20s which have a similar earbud. I understand the 30's ANC is not as perfect as the QC20's, but it should be good enough for my needs. I don't really love the plastic bulk of the Bose pair, but this is not a deal breaker for me. Like the Sennheiser, the Bose suffer from a lack of earbud management for when not listening. The convenience of the neckband is minimized when the loose buds are flopping around.This was just a quickly written review. I hope it wasn't rambling, but I wanted to get some thoughts down. I'll come back after I play more with the Bose to let you know what I find and to clean this thing up.Thanks for playing!UPDATED [06/11/2017]:After comparing the Bose QC30 with te Sennheisers, I returned the Bose. This is interesting, though, because when I compared only the audio range - e.g. highs to highs, mids to mids, lows to lows, I really couldn't tell much of a difference. When you listen to them holistically, though, the QC30s seem restricted, somehow. The music is less 3-dimensional and bland. I do like the QC30 noise canceling - it is almost as good as the QC20s, and the ear pieces are much more comfortable, for me. Additionally, the wires in the Bose are heavier and seem more durable.The Sennheisers, however, just sound so much better! Again, I find that it is critical to use high bitrate, low compression, good quality audio files in order to get the best experience. Look at Google Play, iTunes Match, and Amazon Music for access to those 320kbps aac files. I will also say that the earbuds are much more comfortable once I got used to them.

    ","From what I have heard the Sennheiser headphone is synonym of high quality.  This time around I have received their new in-ear wireless headphone – the HD1.  This headphone is designed to allow you to move freely while exercising or simply moving at home or at work.  Its design is very out of the ordinary since it has a neckband is made of leather and provide comfort – as a matter of fact you barely notice it.  Also when calls are coming in, it will vibrate in order to let you know about them.The headphone possesses bluetooth technology as well as NFC One Touch Pairing which makes pairing it with your device very easy to do.  In a matter of seconds, my iPad was paired with the headphones and I was able to use them.Now the first thing you will have to do obviously before using the headphone will be to charge them. And note that the charging part is located at the end of one of the sides of the neckband.  But careful as I find this part a bit fragile. I was expecting that this would take a few hours after realizing that once charged the battery will last for 10 hours.  But after checking the quick guide provided in the box, I learned that the charging time would be about 1.5 hour only.  By the way the quick guide is mostly images which illustrate how to use the headset but I can say that this guide is quite easy to understand.  However, if you desire to obtain instruction manuals and product support, you are encouraged to go directly the the Sennheiser website.The neckband also has control buttons on one site which will allow you to power the headphones, play or pause the music, control the volume as well as a speech mic when answering your phone calls.  The Sennheiser Captune app is also available for more functions.I first used the headphones to watch an episode of a show on Netflix.  The quality of the sound was amazing.  Then I also tried it for listening music and it was once again perfect.  Now this kind of headphone will not kill the noise around you so if someone come to talk to you it will be pretty clear.  However, there is a distance limit in the range of the sound to reach you.  Let me explain.  I was listening to music and left my ipad on the half-wall which we have between the living room and the hall-way.  Every thing was fine when I was in the kitchen or dining room.  But at some point since I was preparing supper, I went in the garage (which is at the other end of the house) in order to get something in our freezer and the sound was breaking up.  I was there for less than a minute but I was able to realize that distance can be an issue.  So be aware of that…The box contain: the HD1 in-ear wireless headset, an USB  charging cable (not plug though), an ear adapter set coming in XS, S, M, and L, as well as a carry case that is very stylish.Technical DataFrequency response: 15-22,000 HzSounds pressure level: 112 dB (1Hz/ 0dBFS)Total Harmonic Distortion: <0.5% *ikHz, 100dB)Supported Codec: SBC, AAC, aptXBattery Type: Lithium-ion polymerIf you are looking for a headphone that will allow you flexibility in movement as well as high quality sound, I think that the Sennheiser HD1 will be a great fit for you.  It is light, portable and will allow you to move freely without having the cord in the way.  You can even leave your phone on a desk while walking or exercising.  I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone.  It can make a great gift for a teenager as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The headphone possesses bluetooth technology as well as NFC One Touch Pairing which makes pairing it with your device very easy

    ","If sound quality is a priority in an in-ear bluetooth headset, then this pair of Sennheisers is the way to go. They are articulate and dynamic, consistent with Sennheiser's audiophile lineage, an entirely different animal than Beats and Bose for example. Imagine a photograph that is slightly out of focus, blurring some of the details, making them difficult to distinguish. The HD1s sharpen that image so that the details are clear and distinct. This results in instruments sounding more like themselves and less like a representation of themselves. The way they articulate the unique timbre of acoustic instruments brings the music to life, making it more three dimensional and real compared to some of the other offerings. And just as sharpening a photograph increases the contrast of the image making blacks more black and whites more white, the way these headphones articulate sound makes them incredibly dynamic sounding with no sense of strain or compression, never losing their composure even on the most demanding passages. These qualities are not uncommon on high end headphones or speakers but it's simply not a priority for most bluetooth headset manufacturers. And while most of them sound far better than the cheap headphones that came in the box with your phone, ultimate accuracy, articulate music reproduction and dynamic range is not their design intent. It's also not the highest priority for many end users so there is a place everyone.The bass quality on the HD1s is outstanding, articulate and focused like the rest of the sound spectrum. Having no point of reference I think many consumers are taken with the bass quality of lesser sets and relatively speaking, they aren't bad. But once again, these are a different animal. Think of it this way, which is more impactful, getting hit with a five pound pillow or getting hit with a five pound brick? The focus and articulation of the HD1s give the bass more slam, not more bass, just more impact to the bass. You can feel the purr of a slapped electric bass, the nuances that bring it to life, the space between the notes, without the sound becoming blurred, even at high volumes.One of the unique aspects of in-ear headphones is that their tonal balance is determined to some degree by each user's particular anatomy. That being said, I found the HD1s reasonably neutral, somewhat rich, but not overly so and at times a bit aggressive on the top end, in my ears. Using the Comply foam earphone tips seemed to tame the top end a little, perhaps at the expense of a bit of sparkle. I could easily have gone either way but the fact that the Comply tips stay in my ear better and provide greater sound isolation, coupled with the fact that the included tips can become uncomfortable over extended listening periods, tilted things towards the Comply tips, so that's what I'm using. Also, some modification of tonal balance can be achieved by experimenting with the tip size. Better seal = greater bass.So oh yeah, these things work with your phone. They paired to my iPhone 7 (but not my MacBook Pro) without a hitch. I can use them as a wired set connecting to the USB port on the MacBook. The sound quality of calls is excellent and the passive noise isolation blocks out a very high degree of environmental sound, especially using the Comply tips. Think the squishy foam earplugs typically used in an industrial setting or on the gun range. Callers on the other end reported that the sound quality from the microphone was also excellent, better than what they experienced from my Bose SoundTrue wired set but environmental noises also come through loud and clear. For quiet on both ends there are better choices, perhaps even Sennheiser's own HD1 Wireless over the ear headphones with its beamforming microphones. The HD1s are light and comfortable around my neck, often forgetting they are there, only to be reminded when they begin to buzz from an incoming call. This is particularly useful in noisy environments where you wouldn't hear the phone ringing without the earphones in. On the neck band, up and down volume controls that double as skip forward and skip back are easy to locate by feel after a bit of practice as is the center answer, hang up, voice dial button. The power button is safely out of the way. Battery life is rated at 10 hours but that, I assume, is continuous talk time as the battery life indicator displayed on my phone barely moved even after a couple of days without charging. I never managed to wander out of bluetooth range from my phone though I haven't measured the exact distance. Also notable is that when you answer a call on the phone itself, the sound is routed through the phone, not the headset, even when it is connected. This can be annoying at first but is actually convenient once you get used to it.Occasionally, when making a phone call, the sound would become extremely deep and garbled on both ends sounding like two aliens speaking some foreign and frightening language. I'm not sure if that's an artifact of the headphones, the iPhone or Bluetooth itself but it requires hanging up and calling back. Fortunately that is a rare occurrence. There is also a bit of lag when playing games or dialing numbers on the phone with the sound trailing the button press by about a second. This isn't an issue when speaking on the phone or listening to music.The whole set is elegantly understated, the leather on the neckband soft and luxurious and it feels like a quality piece. If you love music and need a bluetooth headset in this price range, these are worth serious consideration.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you love quality sound, these are for you"

    ","Everything about this headset screams quality.The packaging was nice. Simple, straight to the point. Borderline minimalistic. The look, the feel, the smooth leather, the chrome accents, shout ""high quality""The sound quality is impecable. Strong base, clean mids and highs.  The volume is very loud, leaves nothing lacking.The wiring to the headphones themselves may be a little too thin, just an observation. Pulling and tugging on external objects could cause damage.I can only assume if the wiring was thicker this could mitigate the potential for damage.I wish there were magnets on the back of the headphones so they could connect together and help keep the earbuds together while dangling.The ear buds aren't the best fitting, but they work.It comes with a case which is large but has a slim profile. It's big enough for me to carry a second pair of Bluetooth headphones or wired headphones if your battery ever runs out.The battery life, lasted over a days worth of use. I'm very happy with the battery life! A tap on the power button and it will audibly tell you an estimate of how much time you have left.Phone calls cause it to vibrate, which is a plus because other headphones only ring in your ear. This way if I am not listening to audio, I will still know a call is coming in, when I'm not near my phone, or it's on silent.My main issue with the headphones is the noise cancelation.I'm giving this 3 stars because there isn't any noise cancelation. That should have been a feature.I've received complaints that the microphone picks up too much background noise.Typing at a keyboard while on the phone with someone will be cause for complaintsthat our typing is too loud and is disruptive.  Use at work will intolerable for anyone you are speaking to. All manners of distant noise will be picked up by the Omni-directional mic.This will not be a good choice for wireless headphones to use during the day if you are conducting business.You will need to use headphones with noise cancelation.It's a shame, because Sennheiser is great when it comes to sound quality, but they seriously dropped the ball on this one.They forgot to take into consideration that people use their Bluetooth headphones to communicating as much as they use it for listening to music.This is really a high quality headphones for listening to music that has a microphone added as am afterthought. As if someone said, ""hey"" you forgot to add the mic!Aside from that, the onni-directional mic WILL pick up your voice clear as day, along with your neighbors down the street!Unfortunately compared to other headphones, the sound quality of the person's you are speaking to, sounds muffled.It could be the deeper base signatures affecting the sound, but it's not the best quality.Other than that, music listening is a pleasure on these headphones which I believe is their main purpose.They are music-focused headphones WITH minimal communication capabilities.Hopefully they will realize the mistake they made and produce a better model.This is the 3rd sennheiser product I own but I don't think I will buy from then again.It doesn't take a genius to know you that Bluetooth headphones, will be used with smartphones primarily. Therefore people will be talking to each other on them and will want to have a pleasant conversation where they can hear each other clearly on both ends.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Almost, One of the Best headphones Available"

    ","I wanted to say first that Sennheiser has given me a pair of these in order to do a review of them, and most importantly give my honest thoughts. I believe that since they are an ""in ear"" device, returning them was not something they were interested in... This is totally fine by me since I have integrated them into my life ha.  I will explain why below!Background about meHearing Bluetooth sound is something that I am used to, BUT owning Bluetooth in ears is something I am not... I was very curious about these in ears since I didn't know what the sound quality was going to be like, nor the functionality.  Even though this is my first time owning an in ear like this, due to my involvement with a high end audio store I have developed an ear for what quality is (or at least I think so :).  through the years of headphone listening my personal tastes have fluctuated and I now look for a slightly warm signature. I can enjoy neutral sound, but I feel like slight warmth can add something to it that can get me more engaged in the sound. I bring this up just so the part of the review where I talk about the sound sig could make more sense.Physical Designear tips- Right out of the box you are given 4 different ear tips of different sizes. I put a pair in that I thought were my size and started listening. After a couple hours I pulled them out and my ears hurt slightly. I don't own any higher end in-ears so I figured that slight discomfort was just par for the course for any in ear... After a couple days I still felt the slight discomfort after use and eventually thought ""I might as well try a size lower, even though they look a lot smaller"". To my surprise, not only did they stay in my ears perfectly they also did not hurt my ears after long use! I clearly felt stupid for not trying this days ago ha. Anyways I am glad they gave 4 different sizes, but I am curious if that really is enough for most consumers? I also don't know if people would just replace the tips anyways with something like a comply tip or another brand.comfort-  I find the genuine leather collar to be very comfortable, and honestly as I am typing this I forgot it was on my neck ha. When looking at any in ear that involves a collar like this I was skeptical to how it would feel. The HD 1 put that to rest by being very comfortable and lightweight as well.  I also want to mention that the build of the HD 1 in general is very durable feeling... I can grab both ends of the leather and bend it around it retains its shape.  I feel like you get what you pay for in regards to it.practicality-  Now this may sound stupid but when I first looked at the buttons and their functions I was curious how long it would take me to get used to pressing them when on my neck. You have the on/off button that also pairs with whatever source you want (in this case it was always my phone). The ""+"" and ""-"" switches to go up and down in volume, or hard press to go forward or back in song track. The middle button is to pause the music or answer a call. I loved the simplicity of all this, and I also feel like they made it very easy to get used to using effectively.  I love the fact that when you turn them on and you phone's bluetooth is on, the voice says ""Power on"" and ""connected"". It's so effortless and easy.  The voice will also say ""power down"" to let you now you turned it off. There is also a reminder about battery life that is very useful. It is these small features that I feel are super cool and make them very ""grab and go"". There is also a small vibration that will tell you physically that the HD1 turned on or off! These little things are what really make you feel like they cared about the design of the HD1.Something that I found odd about the HD 1 was that the earbuds just hang down over you when they are not in use. I know that seems obvious, but I figured there would be a way to attach them to the leather band or have them detract when not ""in use"". The purpose of this could be if you put them in your cargo pocket you wouldn't have the wires wrapping around anything. This may just be nitpicking but for me I figured it would be an easy feature to include.  *Also I want to point out that it turns out I am not as stupid as I thought, and it didn't take long at all to ""get good"" with the functions!!SoundLets get down to brass tax am I right?the mids -So the frequency balance to my ears is a slight ""U"" shape.  There is decent extension up top and bottom. Mids are slightly recessed against both. For my tastes I am a mids guy. This doesn't mean that I don't enjoy the sound though, because in the end I find them very engaging... The mids them self seem a little warm which I am cool with!the treble- Has a little sparkle and it sounds clear to me. I have found some tracks that were fantastic with HD 1 and others that didn't sound bad, but didn't ""pop"" like others. I think this is truly up to the mastering of the track and I am glad that the HD 1 is capable of letting a good mastered track shine.the bass- Has some bloat to it, but I feel like it is in line with the price.  If you are looking for rock solid bass that can be punchy and deep then I feel like you are definitely going to pay more for it, OR in return loose a lot of the great features of the HD 1.overall- I think there is good width in sound stage (which surprised me actually) sound stage depth seems par for the course for price since it's not very large.. I definitely think that the overall sound totally sounds like it's a Sennheiser sound signature. So anyone who buys it and is knowledgeable about Sennheiser should not be fooled by what they are getting.microphone/talking on the phone-  I used the HD1 occasionally when talking on the phone. The one time I used it, my buddy thought he heard me walking on rocks or stones. it was as If he heard  a lot of movement on his end. I didn't know what he was talking about since I was just walking back and forth through my kitchen. The next time I used it, (different friend) he said that I sounded completely fine and didn't hear anything different. I am not sure if this was because the first friend was using an android phone and the second was using Apple? No clue in the end but overall I enjoyed being hands free and felt comfortable with the sound quality on my end.ConclusionAfter owning this for some time now I feel like it fits well into my life style. I LOVE using it especially at night so I can lay in bed and not interrupt my girlfriend next to me when i'm listening to music and she is trying to sleep. I feel comfortable laying on my back using it with a pillow and if adjusted correctly I can also lay on my side. When I am done listening I can just hold the power button down and it tells me that it turns off . I can then just slip it off, put it by my bedside table and go to sleep. I don't have to think twice about whether it turned off , or even look at it to tell if it tuned off...The HD 1 is also great for my commute to work riding the shuttle. my music doesn't bother anyone else and I can grab it at home and run out the door. I think the sound sig they chose and also the appearance of the HD 1 will fit a lot of peoples tastes... I am very pleased with it in the end!",5.0 out of 5 stars,More in ear love then Q-tips

    ","just as a disclosure, I bought my headset from ebay since the price was better at the time of this review.The headset sounds great. I quickly adjusted to the button placement, and pairing the device via nfc is a breeze. Rest assure, connecting the old fashion way via bluetooth is easy as well. be sure to download the ""Captune"" app through the iOS/Android app so you can adjust the equalizer to your personal preference.Sound is extreme subjective. To my ears, I personal prefer a flat response, with moderate/low bass. I love treble and clarity without having the bass drown out the lyrics. I've listened to these earphones for about a week now, listening to them during work for about 6 hours a day. Battery has held up just fine at %20-50 volume. any higher, I'm sure battery would die quicker. I personally need to be aware of my surroundings still since I use them during work. If you're a bass head, you might be disappointed in the sound quality of these earphones. These are very well balanced and I would recommend them to almost everyone. Here are a some cons I found along the way that prevented me from giving them 5 stars.1. I wish the earbuds could be retractable like the LG Tone series. Perhaps LG has a patent on it, I don't know. But at this price point, I wish they could have included that feature. The wires are a little longer than I would prefer, and sort of just dangle down in an awkward way when it's not in your ear.2. When I do phone calls, the microphone is waaaaaaaay too sensitive. It picks up on everything, literally! When I'm cooking, washing the dishes, walking outside (caller can hear the wind) its crazy. Annoying for the other caller from what I've been told. As good as the earphones sound, just be aware. Try to be in a very quiet environment, or else your caller will hear every background noise possible.3. Going through the tap/hold features (play/pause/next/previous/answer call/ignore call) I tried the mute/unmute feature by holding the button for 1 seconds. It mutes the caller who is speaking, which I found odd. In all other bluetooth headphones I've owned, it would mute ME, not the caller itself. A huge let down in my opinion.For me personally, I can now only use these for casually music listening, which is fine for me since I listen to music with this headset for a couple of hours a day, these are yet to die on me, yet alone give me a low battery warning.  I was hoping this could be by go to headset for everything. But because of the sensitive microphone, and the odd mute/unmute feature.. this headset is useless for phone calls. if you can get by that, go for it!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"almost perfect, super sensitive phone mic. mute/unmute flaw"

    ","I bought Sennheiser PXC 550 recently and just fall in love with them - sound, BT handling, ability to use with 2 phones + PC communication at the same time in the office by using micro USB (not many people mention that - this is very hard to find option) - can not be better.For my walks i use bose wireless sport. when i saw the HD-1 decision was automatic - get these.i went through the reviews and bought them (not from Amazon).big disappointment.PROS- most important  - very good sound, but highs are little bit too harsh even unpleasant. The same source, song and PXC 500 - what a difference.  - fit is not the best, but acceptable  - very comfortable on the neck - don't feel them at all.- secondary  -  look - amazing  - quality - seems very good  - pleasure just to hold itCONS - BT, BT, BT  - connects only to the 1 phone - the one that was synced last.  - you can manually connect to the 2nd one and it works.  - turning HD1 OFF and then ON, connects only to the 1st phone - never the second  - if 1st phone is OFF, but second is ON, when you turn HD1 ON, it doesn't connect to 2nd (any) phone, probably keep looking for the 1st one  which is OFF.  - tried to disable devices, reconnect them in opposite order - all the same  - when 2 phones are connected - music start stutter - not really hard, but i definitely can hear that.  - at the beginning i thought it's a BT, but when i disconnect 2nd phone stuttering stops.Conclusions:  - i don't know how to rate them really.  - almost everything is so good, but BT (bluetooth) handling is very bad.  - i hope that i've got bad unit, and i will keep follow the posts hoping nobody else have these issues or they will be fixed  - then i'll definitely will buy this beautifull set again, but for now - back to Sennheiser.thanks for reading",2.0 out of 5 stars,i don't know how to rate them really.

    ","Nice earphones, I like how they feel and look. I never had around neck earphones but I often forget I have these on. Sound is good, but not the best, I would like them to be a little bit louder. Sound quality should be better for the price",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice earphones but sound isn’t too good for the price

    ","I really, really hate this. I wish I could give it a negative 5 star. I can't get it to sync with airplay, which means it won't work. Bluetooth only allows bad sound in one ear. I had high hopes. Way to expensive and way too complicated.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hate it
