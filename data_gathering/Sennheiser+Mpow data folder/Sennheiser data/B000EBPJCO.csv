    ","The Pros: Excellent wireless headphones. -- We needed wireless headphone for watching TV at night without disturbing the neighbors in our duplex.  We needed the base to plug into the audio out of our TV, which wasn't easy to find as most wireless headphones are now Bluetooth.  Found these here on Amazon and are very happy with them - bought the base which comes with one headphone and one other matching headphone.  They are very comfortable to wear and their audio quality is excellent. You can adjust reception to get the optimal sound quality. They also have a considerable range. Put the TV on a music channel and walked around with the headphones to determine their range. Across the house, out in the garage, going to the mailbox, out in the back yard - they never lost the signal or faded in and out and the sound quality never varied. Granted, we live in duplex on about a quarter acre of land, so with bigger homes and yards, their performance may not be as good as we've experienced.Only One Con: the headphones eat through batteries, which cost them one star. They take two AAA batteries - neatly nestled and hidden behind one of the ear cushions and are very easy to change. Fortunately we have plenty of Eneloop rechargeable AAA batteries which are the best rechargeables. (See my review on Eneloop batteries which got 5 stars)I think anyone would be completely satisfied with these wireless headphones as long as you have rechargeable batteries to go with them.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent wireless headphones in all ways except they go through the batteries quickly.

    ","I can understand dialog now! Before we got these headphones, we had trouble hearing scenes with speaking, especially anything with an accent. That includes the great British costume dramas, like Downton Abbey. Now we can hear all the details without cranking up the TV. We also get the benefit of stereo effects that were missed with the previous sound system.  Pros: Huge improvement over TV speakers and medium grade external sound systems. Great for walking around and still being able to hear the news, music or other audio. Comfortable. You only need one charger base for 2 sets of headphones, if you don't mind rotating them occasionally. Long charge life - about 4 hours. Cons: Minor static and other FM radio tuning sounds depending upon where you sit and the proximity to the TV. There will be a REALLY LOUD STATIC BURST when the TV signal is interrupted for 30 seconds. Switch them off if you pause your program!  Summary: I recommend them. They are the best I've had. Worth the money.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but not perfect. The best I've used. Recommended."

    ","My HDR120 headset failed after almost 5 years of use when the integrated on/off switch died (it wasn't the rechargeable batteries).  I am surprised to see that the technology has not changed at all on the home entertainment wireless headsets in the last 5 years and the new unit works just the same as the old one with the old transmitter.  However, if you designed a great product to start with then there will be no need to change much over the years.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Additional wireless headset

    ","Best headset for general use, great reach, much better than headsets that costs 5x more, can go outside to dumpster&back and still hear the TV through several walls (with static but still). Also very affordable. Have had four of these for many years. Buy extra ear cups in advance, will wear out after years of daily use. Last long on each charge, does not shut out noise in environment but never gets sweaty and is very light, in contrast to more expensive over the ear head phones. Sound quality perfectly fine for 95% of all general TV watching. Have bought many more expensive HiFi headsets through the years but still use these for 95% of all TV watching because of comfort, reach etc.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great general use headphones for TV!

I don't actually have to see many of the shows I watch, just need to hear. works great with any tv or DVR box.

5,"on February 14, 2018",,"these headphones are the best iv ever used & the price can't be beat!! Cuz these head sets WORK!!! Unlike cheaper brands. I see that some others don't like the  tuning knob on the back of the head phones  but u have to look at it in a different light,,yes the tuning wheel can get hit by accident giving you a slight static but only takes a split second to put it back in tune & that's my point unlike other RF head sets this set has a tuning wheel that lets u tune your headset to the  perfect frequency  & they sound dam good & for me in my home they have a EZ 60 foot range a 100times better then my Bluetooth. For home use u can't do better with out spending a $100 more & it's nice that I can have as many headsets as u want hooked up automatically to the same receiver just turn them on & they work & they hold a charge like nothing iv ever seen B4  u can use any 3 AAA u want but I use rechargeable & they last an EZ 24hrs of  continuous play before they need to be recharged. I paid $59 for my 1st setup head set & transmitter then I got 2 more head sets for my wife & kid. A year & a half later still the best money iv ever spent",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Durable,,long lasting charge,, long range,, excellent price!! What more can I say"

    ","This additional headset works great with the base and headset I purchased previously.  Overall I'm satisfied with the system for listening to TV using a mini-computer and big-screen TV display.  I tried bluetooth devices, but that method of radio transmission adds noticeable delay to the audio, so the sound does not match the picture.  I suspect any bluetooth solution will not work with video for that reason.These Sennheiser products are very good - others have mentioned that the base transmitter shuts off when there is no sound for a minute or two, creating noise in the headsets.  That is true, but unless your headset volume is rather high, the noise you hear in the headset is not too objectionable (in my opinion).  With only one charging base you would need to either swap headsets back and forth to keep both charged, or else use standard batteries instead of chargeable ones.  I built a couple of charging stations that are attached as hangers on the back of our side tables so charging is not a problem.The only reason I gave less than 5 stars is that there is some very brief static now and then.  Adjusting the tuning dial will usually clear it up, and for our purposes it is not much of a problem.  Our base transmitter is about 30 feet from the normal listening location, in a closet with all the A/V and internet equipment.  This static may be caused by interference from these or other devices in our home, so your experience may be different.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works with TV video where Bluetooth will not

My only complaint is that they time out after a few minutes of no sound from the TV and they produce a really loud ""static"" white noise. Would be nice if the vendor could find some way for them to simply mute or turn off sound output at that point.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them. can use them all over the house

    ","I am in an apartment, for the first time in many years. Time moves forward. Our society has not. Ill mannered live out lout neighborsforced me to look for headphones. Nothing is easy anymore either. This is the third brand I have bought. Already promptly returned Sony, too heavy. TV Ears, too complicated. When I did get them to work, I was suppose to do a work around to get the tv out of my Roku and DVD player. The main thing is I was forced to buy a Vizio TV while in KS. This tv only has an optical/audio combination port. Sony hooked up right away. So that was great. Using them for 4 days was not. The weight, is a literal headache. Thought I had solved that with TV Ears. Less than 2 days my ears were killing me. The ""buds"" themselves are a hard foam. Painful. This was my last hope, and I thought I would have to do a work around with an audio box. I know more and have spent more time than a consumer should have to in order to get what you want/need. These hooked up in less than 5 minues they have a converted in the package to go with RCA style audio out. I am a happy camper. Because of this journey, I felt compelled to try and save others. What I needed is not really talked about at any of the individual companies.",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the one!

    ","The first one I got croaked after a short time. I sent it back to the repair facility in Haverhill, Mass. and had it, or a refurbished replacement, back in record time. There was no explanation given as to what had been wrong with the first one and they didn't say if what they sent me was new or refurbished. Also, it came with only a 90 day warranty when I had most of a year left on the original one. Nonetheless, it works great and not only allows improved volume but also clears up a great deal of garble.

    ","Had a bit of a problem when first tuning it but it came in clear when we put the stand on an end table instead of on the tv stand.  There was a lot of static coming in but came in crystal clear after we moved it.  Not sure why that made such a huge difference.  I purchased this with another one that comes with the stand so my husband and I can watch it while our baby is sleeping.  This is so much better than reading closed captioning!  The headphones go on the ear as opposed to being concaved where it goes over your ear.  It doesn't bother me though and feels comfortable but I haven't worn them for longer than a couple of hours.  I just purchased another one so we can have one for my mom when she visits.  So we will have 3 headphones tuned into one stand.  It was really unclear when I was reading the reviews and researching if multiple headphones can be used with one stand as some people said no or they didn't know and one person said you had to buy a splitter.  Just want people to know that you can use multiple headphones with one stand, you just tune them one at a time, no other equipment is needed.",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is so much better than reading closed captioning

    ","My husband and I live in a townhouse in a retired community.  We share a wall with our neighbor.  Wouldn't you know, her bedroom is joined to our living room on the common wall.  Watching to TV and  listening to music with these headphones, we can be good neighbors and respectful of each other when only one of us wants to listen and one wants quiet. Another really important advantage to me is that it brings the sound right to me.  I have some hearing loss in both ears, and even with hearing aids it is sometimes hard to distinguish words, especially as the sound goes up and down from action to quiet conversation.

    ","My wife and I have a small child and we are always afraid to wake him up by watching TV at night. It's great to be able to put these on and each set the volume to our liking (we got the extra set of headphones along with the base station) and know that we won't wake him up.The range seems great. I can use them all over my house while getting up to go to the kitchen for a snack during a movie or to the bathroom and still hear everything. Battery life is also good, I've used them on and off for a few days without recharging and had no issues. The only thing is that you can only charge one at a time, so if you have two like we do, make sure you alternate which one you are charging so you don't end up with a dead pair when you want to watch something.Tuning them in can be an issue, and there is almost always a very faint hissing sound, but when you are actually watching a movie or playing a game, you don't notice it. I have tons of wireless stuff in my house with phones, routers, other wireless devices, etc and haven't had any exceptional problems with interference. The hissing isn't loud enough to be a distraction to me or my wife, but audiophiles or picky listeners may find it more distracting than we do.One thing to be aware of is that a lot of newer TVs and even home theaters do not have headphone jacks anymore. I plug the headphones into my Mac Mini computer which we have hooked up to the TV as a media center, but I can't plug them directly into our TV or into our Sony ""Soundbar"" speaker system, as neither one of them have headphone jacks or RCA Audio Out (the red and white connectors). So, make sure they'll actually work for you with your setup. If you only have optical audio out on your home theater system or TV, you may have to find headphones that support that type of connection, and they are quite a bit more expensive.Setup is as easy as plugging the base up to the power outlet and into your audio source. You may have to adjust the tuning knob to get a good signal as well. Like I said it can take some fine-tuning to get it just right, but after I had it setup I haven't had to mess with it since.The headphones are very comfortable for my wife and I both. I've worn them for some marathon gaming sessions and never found them to be uncomfortable.I'd recommend these headphones to anyone looking for some wireless headphones. I think they are a reasonable price and good quality for the money.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice to be wireless

    ","I gave this 5 stars even though I had a set ""go bad"" on me; however, the set that went bad was my fault because evidently I didn't read where I was advised to never use regular batteries, always use rechargeable (even though I ruined the 1st headset I got at least 2 years of wear out of them).  There are some Sennheiser's that you can use regular batteries in but this wasn't that product....I realized that when I read the instructions that came with my new headset.  Even if I only get two years wear out of these, I'll be happy but I expect, since I'm aware of the ""battery dea,l"" that I will get more service than two years.

    ","My first HDR headset broke in the middle after considerable use (three years), possibly by my handling.I ordered a replacement headset, but a little over a year later, when lowering the ear pieces, a small lock broke and the ear pieces would not stay up and hung by the wires.  This happened with one ear piece followed by the other about a month later.  I think this was poor design (cheap plastic parts).  I had not handled the pieces roughly or damaged them.I ordered another headset in Dec 2013 which had an erratic on/off on switch on the headset the first time I used them, and then again about a week later.  Overall, it may have happened five or six times in the first month, so I sent them back.My first experience with Sennheiser with the original headsets (ordered Aug 2009) was excellent, quality, sound, etc., but now I feel they have a quality problem.

    ","I purchased an extra headset to compliment the 2 units (charging base with headset) I have been using for some time now. We keep one charging base with a headset in the living room (for the main TV), and another charging base with a headset in the bedroom (for the bedroom TV). The charging base can only hold 1 headset at a time, so this is why we have 2 charging bases and headsets. The 3rd headset will allow us to use the 2 headsets while charging the third.The sound quality is fantastic. We prefer to listen to the sound through the headsets, as the flat screen TVs have horrible speakers (even with an added speaker system). We used to have TV Ears, but got tired of having to replace the headsets every few months and the horrible customer service. These headsets are a litter heavier (due to the rechargeable batteries are in the earpiece), but are worth it. This product is durable and has never given us any problems. I can wear it outside and go across the street, and still hear the TV! The wireless technology is fantastic. If I want to watch TV in living room and spouse wants to watch a different channel in bedroom, there is no conflict in the sound, since the headsets are near an individual charging bases and you can adjust the frequency (located on the earpiece).

    ","I bought 2 of these headsets because my mother will be staying with me to help take care of my newborn baby girl.  My apartment is small and baby is super sensitive so I bought theses so that my mom can watch tv without affecting the baby while she sleeps.  For my purpose, these worked out great, no complaints from her at all.  She can watch tv at a comfortable volume and not have to worry about awaking the baby.  At the same time, my neighborhood can get noisy with traffic and police sirens as well as window ac.  With this headset, I can turn up the volume to beat the outside noise at the same time not disturbing anyone else who might be sleeping at home.  These are great choices for the budget conscious who doesn't have super high expectations for sound quality.  You do have to turn it off as soon as there are no sound output from the tv otherwise you will hear static.  Each charge lasts for many hours of use so I'm pretty happy about that.  My mom was also concerned about how tight it might be as she is very particular about how it feels on her ears.  She has no complaint about this at all.  It's not too tight, just enough to sit comfortably on your head.  But if you happen to have a small head and you lower your head for reasons such as eating, the headset will move and not stay in place.

    ","Freedom to watch at any time without disturbing people around you.  We used these at home (have two, plus a charger, and alternate or even charge both at once - needs a bit of acrobatice setup but can be made to work).  They're phenomenal and well worth the price tag.  The sound almost feels ambient to the point where sometimes I don't know if I'm on headphones or TV set until I take off the headphones and hear silence (well, small noise from the headphones, but not the TV).  Unlike earbuds, they're not going to damage your ears, since you don't need them too loud to hear well (esp. if the point is not to drown out outside noise but to remain silent for the kids sleeping in the next room).  And the range is good, albeit not infinite: if we go through the bedroom (adjacent to the living room) and bathroom and close the door, we get only half the signal.  Still, that's all we need in this city apartment: we can make a cup of tea in the kitchen and keep listening to our program (nice if someone else is watching and doesn't want to pause).  With out setup, our two kids sometimes prefer to watch their programs with the headphones because they hear better without the noise from us, the grownups.  And we're quite happy to have our peace and quiet at the dinner table, too.This is easily our best home improvement purchase of this shopping season.  I highly recommend this item to any couple with children in city apartments.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Freedom, baby!!!"

    ","What's not to like?  The sound is fine, even with the occasional hiss when turning your head...rarely.  I actually bought a second one to link to the base so my wife and I could both watch TV nice and loud when our newborn is asleep.  They hold their charge for a long time, and have a loud hiss when no sound is coming through (when the TV is off, on mute or paused). It's alarming if you fall asleep watching a DVD and it ends, or if you pause the TV while going into the kitchen to grab a snack, but it keeps you from leaving them on unnecessarily.  I think it's a great feature.  I live in a 4,500 square foot house, and I can walk all over the place with these on (though you'd rarely want to, I suppose).  Does the sound match the surround sound from an audiophile's home theater system?  Of course not.  But I'm really not aware of the difference.  I really like being able to watch things as loud as I want without disturbing the baby or having to fight with my wife over how loud to make it (which we did long before we had a kid).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Does what it's supposed to

The old set was around the ear, so was more secure, but after a couple of hours were intolerable to wear... tradeoffs.  Oh, one other thing I discovered that I really like is that the ear cushions are easily removable and can be cleaned with a mild detergent, dried and snapped right back on.

A vicious cycle.I purchased the base/headphone combo Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle along with extra headphones Sennheiser  HDR120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless Headphone for RS-120 System (charging/transmitter base not included).  While I expected some interference, being it uses radio waves, I was impressed that it is minimal.  You have a dial on the right head set that you must tune in the head set to.  If you experience significant interference (which I didn't)you have a slide switch on the base to select one of three channels, so the anti-static noise options are built-in.The head phone are very light weight and fit great.  As for the sound, I've never heard stereo so well.  Wow, what was I missing for years!Charging is a charm.  With the (replaceable) rechargeable batteries, you just hang them on the base for a charge.  I'd estimate that a full charge lasts at least 20 or so hours of continuous use.  I've never really timed it, so it is only a vague estimate.What can I say?  If you need a wireless headphone, this is a great buy.Update! Almost Two years later and they're still working great.  Batteries are original, and still taking recharges fine ... and full charges lasting long.  I've dropped these things on our ceramic tile numerous times with the worst effect being the ear cushions twisting off ... so I put it back on.  I can't tell you how really impressed I am.

    ","I bought a set of these wireless headphones so I could watch TV and not disturb my wife's reading. I do have a hearing problem that makes it difficult sometime for me to distinguish words, particularly if there is a lot of background noise or music. This equipment fixes that deficiency nicely. When we would watch TV together and my wife started asking me what was said, I ordered her a set of these earphones, too. It makes a world of difference to both of us. They are comfortable and sit lightly on the outside of the ears, rather than cupping the ear inside the pad. If I need to do a chore or move about the house for some reason, I can go from room to room--even out to the garage or to the patio--and the signal remains strong. The only negative I have found is that they can fall off my head if I bend over. But that's not really a big thing to either of us. After it happened once, I could move them further back on my head. No problem. I have one charger for both earphones. The charges last a long time, so it's simple to give both earphones some time on the charger. I would recommend these earphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Top quality sound

    ","A wonderful product for me. Being hard of hearing (nearly totally deaf in one ear) I have tried several devices to enhance TV watching. These headphones are the perfect item for me.

    ","We just bought a TV (40"" LCD) for the first time since our daughter was born 3 years ago, and we really wanted to be able to enjoy it in the evening after she's in bed. The problem? There was only one place to put it -- on the other side of a wall from our daughter's crib. Enter the Senn 120 headphones!We're by no means audiophiles, but for ordinary folks like us, they're a great deal for the money. When compared to my in-laws' home theater, the sound is definitely inferior, but it's quite adequate for our needs. Even without surround sound, sounds locate very appropriately and there's a rich response throughout the frequency range. Even better, I can turn my unit volume way down for my supersensitive hearing, while my husband can bombard his eardrums to his heart's content.We bought one base unit and one additional headset. The only drawback to this setup is that only one unit can charge at a time. That's not really a problem, though, since the battery life exceeds 20 hours! The charging mechanism is easy to use, and we were able to mount the base directly to the wall next to our television.One minor quibble -- the top part of the headband is a little uncomfortable for both of us, so we have to loosen it and rely on the earcups to stabilize the headset. A major positive is that the earcups are not nearly as snug and clamped-down as most of the more expensive units we tested. I'm very sensitive to pressure on my head, but I can wear these headphones for hours without a twinge of migraine.All in all -- it's not perfect or theater-quality, but for the price, the value is amazing!NB: This is the additional headphone listing, which comes with only the headphones and batteries. You'll need a transmitter/charging unit to use the product.",4.0 out of 5 stars,A Lot of Bang for the Buck

The tuning control and volume control are identical knurled wheels on the same earpiece.  Its real easy to hit the tuning control when you really want volume control.

They are subject to occasional FM interference, in the form of mid to high frequency static, like you might here on your car radio when turning a corner or moving through hills. This only happens when you are moving around, and is a minor annoyance.

    ","I have been using the RS-120 System (with base charger/transmitter) for about a year. I have been very happy with it, so I decided to buy these headphones (HDR120) to pair with the current ones I have. The setup was the most simple thing you could imagine. I opened the box, pop in the batteries, put the headphones on my existing charger for a while, turn on and do a 3 second tune with the dial and my wife and I were watching a movie together while the 1 year old slept. The sound quality is decent with these headphones. You don't get major driving bass or pure clarity with music like you would with a high-end music headphone like Bose, Skull Candy or Beats but they are just as good as my Sony headphones. Voices, background sounds and subtle music in TV and movies sound great with these.  The only minor complaint I have about these headphones are the comfort.  After wearing them for a long movie (say around 3 hours) they start to become quite uncomfortable to my ears. They need better ear pads. Plus they are really bulky and heavy. If they could find a way to make these about half the size and weight, they would be absolutely perfect. Even with the size and comfort issues, you will not be disappointed with these headphones. They get great reception, even when I am in the next room or even outside on the deck. My wife loves to use them while doing laundry or cleaning, walking from room to room in the house, and never has an issue with reception.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Best Wireless Headphones for the price!

Still as happy as i am with this product.. it loses 1 star cus they fell off my head into the toilet because .. well because that's how loose they fit.  If you have a small head pass on these.  If you have a very large head rejoice.. cus these are great.  and whatever size you have take them off before you go somewhere where u dont want them to fall off.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser HDR120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless
596,"on April 8, 2018",,"These headphones can only go about 1-2 minutes without transmitting static or some other ear-splitting sound. The reception is like an FM station with a weak signal: Decent when it's coming through; unbearable when it's weak. There are supposedly a number of steps to fix these issues that people have suggested in the reviews and Q & A section. But (1) it should not take this much tweaking and repositioning and general fiddling to make headphones work. They should just work out of the box. Wired Sennheisers, for instance, just work--like how headphones are supposed to work. And (2) none of the suggestions that will supposedly alleviate the reception issues are guaranteed to work.I usually listen to these headphones about 6-8 ft max from the transmitter. No obstructions, no walls, just air and the electromagnetic spectrum between us. Yet these headphones cannot handle that much distance from the transmitter, even with the television turned up almost to the max, the transmitter resting on a surface approx 5 ft off the ground, and otherwise just generally in friendly wireless headphone conditions.If you can get them to work, good for you, but I don't recommend rolling the dice on these.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Like a staticky FM radio that costs $60 and regularly assaults your ears

    ","I have had the 120 base set and its original headphones for over five years.  They have both worked near flawlessly.  My wife and I use these headphones for TV in bed so one of us can enjoy ESPN and the Walking Dead and the other can sleep.  ...and then one of us can enjoy whatever the heck runs on OWN in the middle of the night, while the other sleeps. The sound quality is average as is the build quality and comfort.  The band and cups fit all head sizes pretty well, including our 11 year old son's.  The wireless reliability has been excellent with no signal degradation or interference up to 50', unless you put a wall or two between you/phones and the base unit.  Setup was super simple and everything communicates well directly with the TV, through a DVD player, or through set-top box.  Since the original pair worked well, these were purchased as a second set of phones so two out of three could watch TV without disturbing the odd one out.  Just like the originals, they paired seamlessly, charge and hold a charge well and sound okay.  Sound quality is fine for TV dialogue and they have enough stereo-quality to them to transport your ears to what feels like a larger space.  For rich movie soundtracks or other music/sound-intensive applications, however, their function is limited.The only knock, beyond the maybe-slightly-better-than-average sound, is the controls which are REALLY basic and antiquated feeling.  Perhaps rotary dials and plastic slide switches add to durability/reliability over push buttons and micro-sensors, but they just feel old and cheap.  Unfortunately, it is also pretty easy to accidentally move the dials (volume or tuning) when putting them on and off of your head.  Not a huge deal to correct and I'm not sure that any sets with on-ear controls are any better, but it is annoying.All in all-  pleased enough to buy these as a second pair.NOTE:  We rarely push music through them but when we do, the sound quality is pretty good-  not concert hall, not street bucket-drumming either.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Juuuust fine and perhaps a marriage saver

    ","We have used *many* RF headphones over the last 20 years, and for our purposes the Sennheisers have proven to be the best. That does not mean they are perfect. Our application is fairly simple - my wife and I use them to listen to TV. I need them to provide volume control for my deteriorating ears without blasting out others. She needs them so she can listen to TV while doing other things that often take her to other rooms in the house, or even outside. We do NOT use them to listen to music at all, so the ability to deliver clear dialogue is far more important than sound effects or cymbals.This Sennheiser model is supra-aural, ie, it has flat surfaces that rest ON your ears. For most people this design keeps your ears cooler during long sessions than a circumaural design. Since I wear them a lot every day, I personally prefer this design. However, Sennheiser's implentation . . . flat, smooth ear pads combined with low tension . . . allows the headphones to fall off your head if you look down too far.This model does not have automatic noise suppression, and I prefer this design as well. When something interferes with the signal (eg, too many walls, too much metal in the path, or too much distance), you will hear the static while the headphones continue to work. In Sennheiser's more expensive model with noise suppression, static causes the headphones to shut down. I'd rather hear the static than hear . . . beep beep.OTOH, my wife prefers the more expensive models with the circumaural design, trading off the ""noise suppression"" for headphones that stay on her head. She's happy to adjust her location until the sound comes back on . . . so we use a mix of both types, sharing the same transmitter.The range on these headphones is excellent, again compared to all other RF headphones we've used. 100' in open air is a very fair range estimate. However, the practical range is highly dependent on exactly what is between you and the transmitter. In one location we have trouble reciving a signal over 35' through a single wall containing Pella windows and sliding glass doors. In another, we get nearly 100' through one stucco exterior wall. Overall, these RF headphones perform at least as well and most often better than others have in our highly radio-frequency-noisy environment.One final word of caution: With the industry's content protection paranoia, make sure your current audio source will output an audio signal these headphones can use, when and where you want to use them. Many TVs that formerly would allow headphone and TV-speaker use simultaneously will not allow that now. Also, the headphones will not accept a digital signal - you will need a digital to analog converter to get the ""red and white wire"" audio output you need for the transmitter. You can thank the Hollywood 1% for those changes :)The 5-star rating is for use with TV in difficult environments compared to other RF heaphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for TV - Best of the Bunch
601,"on June 4, 2017",,"I am not an audiophile, and used these headphones primarily for watching online videos and playing video games. I like the sound of these headphones, and they fit quite comfortably on my head. The primary issue I have with them is that there is a constant background static noise that gives me a headache after a while. Whenever there is a pause in the sound feed, this noise becomes quite prominent. Also, if the sound source is not providing a signal at all or after ~ 30 seconds of no sound, the headphones go into a strange mode of operation where there is a very loud burst of static noise.These headphones use a tuning mechanism which I feel is quite clunky and poorly implemented. You have to manually turn a dial to tune the headphones in to listen to the signal broadcast by the base station, which only has 3 fixed frequency settings. I found this to be quite odd, why not just have 3 fixed settings on the headphones that correspond to the 3 stations? To complicate matters worse, the tuning dial is located right under the volume dial on the headphones and is the same exact shape. On multiple instances I found myself accidentally bringing the headphones out of tune with the base station rather than changing the volume.I have owned wired Sennheiser's before and loved them. Unfortunately these are not worth using for me due to the aforementioned problems, so I will be giving them away. If they didn't have the problem with static noise, I would rate them 4 stars and likely would be keeping them.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Background static is too much for me

The original set has the ""base"" unit, so I just needed another pair of headphones.  We are thrilled with the quality of the sound coming from them, and also thrilled with the fact that you can walk throughout the house with them on and still receive the sound from the tv.  Also, we love that we can turn the tv sound way down, and have the headphones set at whatever level we need.  Everything comes through very clearly.  I would recommend these to anyone who has difficulty hearing their tv well, and anyone who might have a day sleeper who needs to have the house quiet.

604,"on July 13, 2015",,"These headphones work very well for me. I have severe hearing loss and to hear the TV I have to turn it up to where everyone else is being blasted into their own form of deafness. I watch TV with the CC on all the time because I cannot understand what is being said but the CC is far from perfect, in fact on most devices it is very poor and you can't get a good read on what the actors are talking about. So I got an idea and thought, with all the technology we have today, there has got to be a set of wifi headphones out there that don't require wires strung across the room. So my search turned these up. I ordered. My Stereo sound system was already connected to the TV Audio Out. So I could have the TV audio controlled separately on the Sound System from the TV.  This gave the ability for me to plug the HDR120 phones into the sound system, thereby giving me separate control of the volume to the headphones and my wife control of the volume to the normal TV. Now I can hear every freaking word that is spoken on the TV shows without blowing my wife out of the room. She can control the TV volume for the room and she's happy, I'm happy and I bet the neighbors are happy too.  Now about the headphones themselves.They work very well. I don't notice any hissing except on some mp4's and other Movie files but that is the problem of the file quality. Normal TV doesn't have noise, but keep in mind, I have severe hearing loss and noise is in the higher frequencies and I may not be able to hear the noise anyway. This review is more for the hard of hearing. I can go anywhere in the house (two story) and never lose the sound or quality, which is nice because I don't have to pause the program I am watching or the song I am listening to.  Music with these phones is fantastic. The only problem I have with these phones is the earpieces are flat, not cupping your ears, so if you are doing something that requires you to bend over, they are not tight enough to hold on and will slip off your head. Cupped earpieces would stop this.All in all, for the hearing impaired they are fantastic for watching TV and listening to music.

Problem was an over-abundance of choices & too little knowledge about such electronics.  Finally I found these Sennheiser HDR 120 Wireless headphones that seemed to be what I wanted & appeared to be easy enough to install & were in an acceptable price range (about $70 on sale).  Got them in 2 days; installed them in less than an hour.  They are everything I was looking for, clear, adjustable surround sound.  In fact, I can walk the length of the house & never miss a word from the TV.  Before I bought them, I checked the One-Star Reviews, as is my habit, to see if I find a consistent weakness ... All I found were mostly complaints from the truly stupid ... so I ignored them.  When they arrived, I immediately looked for the tuner &, sure enough, down low, on the bottom of the charging cradle, there was a tiny 3 channel selector to adjust the tuning.  Mine did not tune well on the first 2 channels, but I found perfect, static-free, no-whistle reception on the 3rd channel ... Have been enjoying perfect TV listening ever since, & my wife is not being blasted out of the room.  Could not be happier.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Could not be happier...

The flat foam covers come off too easily.  It's just a slight rotation and they are not held in tightly.*  3.  On Off switch is too close to volume switch*  4.

Sound is about crystal clear for me, I love it to watch bluray movies, maybe they just havent tried different channels to see if there is less interference on the other channels.The last thing I really hate and find it really dumb is that the receiver will turn off after 5mins but instead of silence, it will burst in static and scare the heck out of you if u had it too loud. I mean, when im watching a movie and pause it for a few to do some other stuff, i usually have the volume up high, and when the static comes out, damn throw those headphones away!! will blow ur eardrums. I find it really stupid they didnt actually turned the headphones off complety or idle them or something. Listening static if u fell asleep will drain batteries anyway, which defeats any sense of shutting receiver off, its plain dumb.Other than that I love the headphones, and prolly will be buying more for movie nights!, I just wonder how many of them can u hook to a single dock before the signal degrades, ill have to look into that. But anyway, ill totally recommend this headphones.And by the way the recharging feature is really awesome. the headphones have a cushion pad in the top, and 2 metal contacts that when u put the headphones on the docking, by default the big metal contacts will hang in the docking and charge them, also there is a Charging LED indicator, and I find it really easy to make it charge, unlike the Sony headphones, which the contact is really crappy and annoying.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice sound, yet got a dumb feature"

    ","As far as wireless headsets go these work passably well: they have a solid range and get decent sound.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer assumed that you would ONLY be using these headphones when there is an active signal at all times.  There is an unstoppable 5 minute time-out on the transmitter and, when it hits, the headset SCREAMS static into your ears.  Let's say that, like me, you are always wearing your headphones while using the computer.  You turn them on to watch a YouTube video.  After that video is over you start reading an article and don't start up another video or turn on music.  Five minutes later . . . WWHHOOOOSSHHH -- you're flooded in ear-piercing static.  Other people have had this same complaint the the manufacturer replies with some standard 'your signal is too weak' boilerplate.  Don't be fooled by this simple misdirection -- unless you plan on NEVER having a 5 minute segment of silence when using these headphones you WILL be getting blasted with static.  It's a serious design defect and makes this otherwise nice product completely worthless for everyday use.  To the manufacturer: would it really have been so hard to to add the exact same timeout to the headset as you put into the base?

    ","First of all, these are good quality headphones.  The sound quality is good, the range is good, and they are comfortable to wear.  However, the sound that emits from the headphones can be heard by everyone around, at about 1/2 volume.  I bought these because I wanted to be able to listen to music in my office, without having to worry about a cord restricting my movement and getting in my way all of the time.  Even at a normal volume (and I like to listen to music a bit louder than most folks), the music from the headphones can be heard by everyone within 30 feet or more at my office, and there is a moderate amount of white noise in the office to combat some of it to start with.  The point of headphones, in my opinion, is to provide the user with a comfortable auditory experience without bothering those around him/her.  These headphones defeat that purpose completely.

It is even possible to for one person to watch and hear TV programs with the TV's sound off, thus allowing a 'disinterested person' or persons to do something else without the sound  distraction",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Hearing Aid for TV

    ","Simple complaint. If I tilt my head forward, the headphones slip off. The foam Sennheiser selected to cover the ear is smooth and slippery. So you have to keep your head upright--perhaps good for posture but Sennheiser simply goofed, or were careless. There is no way to ""tighten"" the fit either. Duh!",3.0 out of 5 stars,Bad engineering

    ","I have owned Sennheiser RS120 headphones and they help me to hear better while watching DVD's (I have some hearing impairment). However, when watching with my spouse, I couldn't use the headphones and I lost some of the dialogue.The additional headphones have solved the problem. They perform as well as the original phones and charge on the same cradle (at a separate time). Folks who visit us and try the headphones rave about the sound quality. My son-in-law bought them so he can do his ""honey-do"" tasks and listen to sports at the same time. (Who says guys can't multi-task?)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Additional Sennheiser RS120 Headphones

    ","My MAJOR complaint is the sleep mode on these things. If it's been 5 minutes since you've listened to music you must wait for them to WAKE UP. This usually takes 5 to 15 seconds of sound before you can hear anything. If you listen to your audio at too low of an audio level, the headphones mistake this for silence and shut off, filling your ears with ear-piercing static. Would not recommend these or buy them ever again.Another problem is the constant drop in audio level that I experience with these headphones. It's as if they are attempting to compensate for some thing, and drop the entire song/audio file level.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst wireless headphones I've ever owned.

    ","- Sound quality is not that impressive.- Hissing is horrible, despite my best efforts at tuning.- If you are using with a computer, you probably occasionally have periods when the computer is silent. When the sound of the source drops off for more then a minute, you get a cacaphonous, nerve-rattling screech from the headphones. It's a terrible, terrible design flaw.DO NOT BUY.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Very frustrating.

    ","I have had my Sennheiser HDR120 headphones for almost a year now.  Whereas I often have trouble hearing speech clearly coming straight from the TV, with these headphones I get crystal clear sound.  I like being able to roam around the house and not miss a word of sound.  I have demonstrated these to numerous friends, and their most common reaction is, ""I gotta have a set of those.""",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these headphones

    ","I bought these headphones, hoping that they will allow me the freedom to move around the house while still being able to hear the stereo. These headphones do have great range: I was 50 feet from the base, with two walls of separation, and could still hear the sound as clearly as when I was right in front of the base. Unfortunately, the clarity of the sound, even when you're right next to the base, is not very good. A high-pitched whistle pierces my ears, and I just had to return the headphones. I don't recommend them.",2.0 out of 5 stars,The hissing will drive you mad!

    ","Naturally, you expect the name Sennheiser to represent quality; not so with the Senn HDR 120 Wireless headphones.My set will hold a charge for about 30-45 minutes and then static. Even the 30 minute work load is filled with constant static, snap, crackle, pop.I made the purchase to use while on my elliptical, only 8 feet from my computer, but have so many interruptions in quality that I have to use an $18 set of wired headphones from Wal Mart.Sennheiser was recommended to me by professional musicians.
