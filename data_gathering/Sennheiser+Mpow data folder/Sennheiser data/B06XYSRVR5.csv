    ","The Sennheiser Flex 5000 Digital Wireless audio system for headphones is a Godsend. I’m 65 and have tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Thanks to thirty years in a huge train maintenance facility. Being retired is great except I live with family members that still work and go to bed earlier than me. They were always complaining that the TV volume was too loud and I’m sure it was. I had to have it down so low I would cup my hand over my ear to hear what people were saying. I knew I had to find a solution and began researching. I found TV Ears for around eighty bucks but the reviews were mixed. Then I googled best wireless headphones and Sennheiser came up a lot. They were pricey but at this point that didn’t matter. I ordered the Sennheiser RS-5000 that are designed like the TV Ears with the “receiver” suspended from your two ears and hangs down resting on your chest. They worked great but were uncomfortable to wear. Whenever you moved your head slightly your ears weren’t happy. Then an astute engineer at Sennheiser woke up and said “hey guys, why don’t we make a more comfortable pair and do away with the dangling receiver” and voila enter the Flex 5000. Now you simply plug in your favorite set of earbuds into the feather light receiver that measures a mere 3 x 3/4 inches, stuff it into your pocket and you can roam around the whole house while listening to the TV. How cool is that! A set of earbuds come with the Flex 5000 system but I found the set that came with my Apple IPhone work much better. I never used them anyway. The setup could not have been easier. I have a Visio smart TV with a sound bar hooked up by an optical cable. I opened the Flex 5000 box. Plugged the Flex “transmitter” into an ac wall socket, removed the optical cable from the sound bar and plugged it into the transmitter then plugged my earbuds into the tiny receiver, hit the “on” switch located on the receiver and turned the volume up. Suddenly a huge smile broke out over my face and I knew I and my family would live happily ever after! And we are. Now for some technical stuff. The long and the short of it is ....  (drum roll please) there isn’t any. That’s right there isn’t any. Oh yes you’ll read about the high tech built in audio circuits that do this and that. And audiophiles will wax on about the quality of their favorite symphony but that’s not my experience. I found the audio to be sublime for TV programs and music with the factory settings right out of the box. OK, enough blabbering ... we’re wasting time. How about doing yourself a big fat favor and spend the bucks to buy these things. Your life will change instantly for the better. Promise.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Brought a huge smile when first plugged in!

    ","I bought this unit as it allows you to use whatever headphones you already have. I use it to help hear some TV shows without turning up so loud my wife has to wear ear muffs.  I feed it from my HiFi amp connected to the TV.  It works very well, giving me independent volume control.  There is a very small delay that is noticeable if you have open backed headphones or simple ear buds, so make sure you have snug fitting earphones/in ear buds so that the sound  from the TV cannot be heard, otherwise the delay is untenable.  Of course this will not be a problem if you only listen via this device.  The sound quality is great, and using good quality ear buds the bass is very good.  I haven't needed to fiddle with the various sound enhancement modes for hearing disorders as my hearing is not that bad (yet).  I find that by using ear buds the footprint of the receiver plus buds is very small versus some other solutions that are large cans with inbuilt receivers.  It's bad enough having to use something like this but at least you don't look like a dork.  (Well, less of a dork...)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommended

    ","My 88 yo mother had gotten to the point where she couldn't read the crawler or announcements on our old 49-inch television.  I finally broke down and bought a larger set, but of course the new ones don't have a/v plugs, so her old Sennheiser headphones would no longer work.  After a lot of comparison, I purchased this set which has an optical input, and am very happy with it.Since you can plug in your own headphones, I was able to get her some under-chin headphones, since she can't raise her arms above her shoulders.  The sound is crystal-clear, and the range is so much better than the old tech which would go staticky with just a few steps.The only issue is that the charging station is connected to the television, so that if my mother forgets to get them before she sits down, she either has to get up again, or if I'm watching for her, I can jump up and retrieve them.  Not a big deal, as the battery lasts a long while, but still an annoyance for someone of limited abilities.  All-in-all, an excellent choice for those who are hard-of-hearing.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for the hard-of-hearing

    ","AMAZING product. My wife can now listen to the TV at the volume she prefers and I can hear all of the dialogue clearly at my preferred volume.  The receiver is extremely lightweight and attaches easily to clothing for hands free mobility. But the ability to use the headphones of your choice is what really makes this product a game-changer!  I can wear my Bose on-ear noise cancelling headphones, Sennheiser over the ear cans, or a lightweight pair of in-ear buds if I wish. This is SO MUCH better than being tied to one particular style of headphones as with the TV Ears or the other Sennheiser RF systems.

    ","I had a wireless Sennheiser TV headphone set for several years (similar to the 175) that I loved. When it broke, I bought this as a replacement. After loving my previous Sennheiser to the point I wouldn't watch TV without it. Using this set has been nothing but torture.What I hate about it:1) included earbuds were WAY TOO  large for my ear canal -- couldn't even get them in my ears! So I've incurred lots of additional costs trying to find something that isn't tinny and hissy sounding and I'm still looking. I've spent at least an additional $100 trying to find something to plug into this set that sounds good and is comfortable to wear (I could comfortably wear my old set for days long binge-watching). If you currently have earbuds or headphones you like, this system might work for you. But the detailed sound I loved and discovered with my old Sennheiser wireless TV headphones has been replaced with dreck.2) wires hang down and catch on everything pulling my earbuds off. I like to listen to TV while cooking dinner but with this set the wires are hanging down to the stove and into what I'm preparing -- unsanitary and dangerous. The wires are constantly catching on cabinet pulls, etc.3) can't figure out where to wear the receiver-thingy. I wear light-weight T-shirts, so they're pulled indecently low. I tried putting it in my pocket but if I move around the house, furniture and cabinets block the signal. Its also caused scratching and rashes on my skin because I'm constantly trying to re-arrange it to a comfortable position.4) the volume is adjusted on the receiver-thingy but I can't find the sweet spot -- it's either blasting or murmuring. I tried playing with the controls on the base to check out the other hearing profiles but it's a pain to get up and go to the base unit every time I change programs. The hearing profiles just seemed to diminish the sound range. The sound is much more full by NOT using this Sennheiser set.5) the only thing I like better over my old Sennheiser is the base unit lies flat and there's a light to indicate the connection is good. My old Sennheiser died because the headphones were knocked from the charging unit. So the flat base unit profile is a big improvement..I hate this set so much, I'll probably end up spending another $200+ to replace with the model 165 or 185, which are similar to my old Sennheiser. I definitely prefer the over-the-ear design included headphones of my old set. My old set came complete right out of the box and I didn't have an endless quest to find decent earbuds/headphones. With my old set, I could easily wander around the house cooking or cleaning without having wires hanging and catching on things since the headphones were safely on my head without an endless rat's nest of wires. The sound quality of my old Sennhesier was unbelievably fantastic! I heard nuances in movie soundtracks that I'd never heard before. Now I feel like I'm living with snakes from the continual hissing. I also feel like an over decorated Christmas tree with the receiver-thingy and the wires from the earbuds/headphones hanging all over me. My old Sennheiser wireless TV headphones truly increased my enjoyment of TV movie watching. This new set is IMO simply horrid.",1.0 out of 5 stars,I hate it!

    ","If you are confused about what this product does - join the club.  I like to get away from cords on headphones but don't want to necessarily replace my excellent wired headphone.  If you feel the same you should look at this product.The large piece is the base of the wireless signal that gets its signal from your TV or stereo through hard lines.  You basically plug it into the stereo or TV.  The base converts the sound to digital and sends it to a small receiver that has rechargeable batteries.  It is the receiver that you plug your headphones into and it is the receiver that it getting the wireless sound from the base.  The receiver is small enough to take with you around the house by putting it into your pocket or wherever.  The sound quality is excellent and dependent on your headphones.If you have a wonderful wired headphone set but like the idea of getting unplugged from your stereo this works perfectly.  The sound is just as good as being wired (in my opinion) so the freedom of movement this allows is great. Sennheiser has a good reputation for quality and that appears to hold true with this digital wireless set.Overall, I am very happy with how it works and love the freedom of enjoying music on my headphones without being tied to anything.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Freedom for Wired Headphones

    ","Are you a night owl? Do you watch tv/movies or play games into the wee hours sometimes while others are asleep? Do you have a young child who sleeps a little too lightly not far from your master bedroom? I have to own that these are my own truths, and the Sennheiser Flex 5000 has been a fantastic compromise. My AV receiver isn't in cord distance from my bed, and even were it that would amount to running a wire across the room; I also have a couple dogs and a cat who thinks he's a dog -- tripwires attached to electronics and my skull are a generally bad idea.I suffer no delay or other perceptible cost for the benefit of being cordless. The units are attractive and inconspicuous, and the freedom is fantastic (all while being able to use high end and highly comfortable over-ear cups or even the provided ear buds which are comfortable and offer solid quality of sound). Better still, I don't have to scramble for the remote every time a noisy scene erupts. Sennheiser is a name commonly associated with quality audio, and the Flex 5000 is no exception.
