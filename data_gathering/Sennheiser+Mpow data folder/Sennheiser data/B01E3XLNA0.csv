    ","Headphones used in this comparison: Sennheiser PXC 550, Sennheiser MM 550, Bose QC35, Bose QC20 (in-ear).Sound Quality - I'm shocked that some think the QC35 is on par with the PXC 550. The PXC 550 is definitely a step up, though it's not so much better that I would advise not getting the QC 35 for this reason alone. The QC 20 is not going to be able to produce the same level of depth of sounds because of the in-ear format. I would rank SQ as 1) PXC 550, 2) MM 550, 3) QC35, 4) QC20.Noise Cancelling - Again, shocked that some think the PXC 550 is on par with the Bose QC35. In this case, the QC 35 is a step up. In my view it's not so much better that I would not get the PXC 550 for this reason alone. However, for some, ANC is the overriding factor and in that case Bose wins. I actually like the QC 20 (and soon to be coming QC 30) over the QC 35 because the in-ear format blocks more noise passively. However, I find the in-ear format less comfortable for me. Loved the portability of the QC 20, but the lower 10 hour battery life is a drawback that bugged me as well. The PXC 550 is a huge leap forward for ANC compared to the MX 550, which had problems with loud noises and wind. With the QC 35, there is an audible white hiss noise that I think helps further mask outside noise - this hiss is less present in the PXC 550. Often complained about the QC 35 is that you can't turn ANC off when you're in Bluetooth mode. If I'm not on a plane/train/bus, I tend to not want ANC on as the effect when you're moving about is unnatural and almost disorienting for me. The passive noise cancelling on the PXC 550 is much better than the QC 35. To me, the headphones form a much better seal to the ear and use higher end materials, so with ANC off on both headphones, there is much less noise with the PXC 550 just by putting them on your head. The downside to this is that if you want to hear your surroundings with the PXC 550 on and ANC off, not that much noise gets through. Also, since the seal is better for me with the PXC 550, there are less sound intrusions when you move your head around. For example, if you open your mouth from a yawn, the QC 35 will lose its seal for me and let sound through. The PXC 550 will lose some of it seal as well, but not nearly as much. I would rank ANC as 1) QC 20, 2) QC 35, 3) PXC 550, 4) MM 550.Comfort - Several have noted that the cups for the PXC 550 are smaller than the QC 35. I would agree with that and I felt that my ears almost had too much room to move around in the QC 35. With all of the over ear headphones, I felt that the ears would get hot over time and sometimes get sweaty. However, that is preferable to me over having in-ear headphones. Comfort here is very subjective, but for me at least, I would rank them as 1) PXC 550, 2) MM 550, 3) QC 35, 4) QC 20.Build Quality/Style - The look and feel of every Bose product I've used with the exception of the Bose Mini Soundlink, is that they are cheap relative to the cost that they are charging. The QC 35 and QC 20 are no exception. The MM 550s were hideous headphones. The PXC 550s look incredibly classy and elegant, with top notch materials. I am not a fan of the alcantara used on the QC 35 as alcantara will eventually pill and look terrible over time in my experience. Also, the hinge quality seems to be somewhat fragile as there is just so much plastic on the QC 35. I think the QC 35s look great, but they certainly don't look like $350 headphones. 1) PXC 550, 2) QC 20, 3) QC 35, 4) MM 550 (just so ugly)Carrying case - The semi-hard carrying case on the QC 35 is much better than the PXC 550 and seems like it will protect the headphones better. The square shape is also much more stylish than the semi-circle look on the PXC 550. The PXC 550 case lacks the structure and the material is not as thick or protective. The zippered side is also soft instead of hard. The one thing I do like about the PXC 550 case is that there is a fabric flap that goes between the cups so that they don't bang around and scratch each other. Both are relatively large so they will take up quite a bit of space in your bag. The QC 35s look to fold smaller, but the carrying case size negates that ultimately.Usability - While both have apps, I don't find much value in either. It's nice to have the different effect modes with the PXC 550, but I probably won't use them most of the time. Both look to be able to connect to two devices simultaneously - something I read was proprietary to Bose, but clearly is not. The QC 35 will state the name of the devices it's connected to, but will butcher the name. The PXC 550 will just say Phone 1 and Phone 2. I like the PXC 550 ability to turn on/off by unfolding/folding the cups, and the touch interface works great. It is easier to use than to feel around for the buttons on the QC 35 which are in a less natural position. The talkthrough feature on the PXC 550 is missing as far as I'm aware from the QC 35. If you want to talk to someone in person, you pretty much have to take the headphones off. At an airport, this is crucial if you want to stay on top of any public address messages. 1) PXC 550, 2) QC 35, 3) MM 550, 4) QC 20Call Quality - Both the QC 35 and PXC 550 had great call quality to me. I think the incoming voice quality sounded a little better to me on the PXC 550, but honestly both were great for voice calls. I didn't have any issues on range with either and I liked that the QC 35 would pick up outside sound so you can hear your own voice (which you would otherwise not with ANC always on).Overall - I ultimately returned the QC 35 and am sticking with the PXC 550. I will sacrifice the lower quality ANC for better build and sound quality, but that is me. With any of these headphones, there will be some give and take so you will have to decide for yourself which features are more important.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Tradeoffs between Sennheiser PXC 550 and Bose QC 35

    ","✎ NOTE: This is going to be a very long and detailed review. If you do not like long reviews, you can quickly skim through it to jump to the various sections of the review as I have tried to organize it by the various features as I discuss them. Also, I will be updating this review and those updates will likely go toward the end of my original review. So with that note, here it goes...I have been a long-time user of Bose QC25. I’ve loved Bose’ noise cancellation feature and I have been using them almost everyday and especially when I travel. I do travel at least once a month so noise cancellation is a critical feature for me.I had upgraded to Bose QC35 right around the time when I was offered to try the new Sennheiser PXC 550 wireless headphones. This review is going to be a detailed comparison of these headphones with Bose QC35. But before I talk about QC35, let me talk about my first impressions of PXC 550.✧ PACKAGING AND WHAT’S IN THE BOX ✧✮✮✮✮✮ (5 Stars)PXC550 comes in a very nice box that was easy to open. In addition to the headphones, the box includes a black carry case, a 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable, a micro USB to standard USB cable, airline audio adapter, and a 3.5mm to 6.5mm audio adapter. It includes everything that is needed to use these headphones. It also includes a tiny quick guide. I suggest that you not throw away the included quick guide because I could not (yet) find the PDF version of these on Sennheiser’s website. Since these headphones are not ‘officially’ released yet, I am hoping that Sennheiser will publish the PDF version of these docs when these headphones are generally available.✧ SET UP AND OUT OF THE BOX EXPERIENCE ✧✮✮✮✮✮ (5 Stars)The headphones can be folded to store in the supplied carry case. They are very easy to unfold and set up - even without looking at the included guide. As soon as you swivel them to unfold, they automatically power on. So there is no button that you have to press to power them on. This is a very intelligent design and shows that Sennheiser spent some serious $$$ in research and development (R&D).Connecting Bluetooth was a breeze too with the built-in NFC. One tap from my Nexus 6P quickly detected it and I was able to connect. I was able to connect the headphones over Bluetooth with my MacBook Pro and my Windows 10 laptop. The Bluetooth connection worked flawlessly on the first attempt. The voice guidance identifies every device as a “phone”. So when I connected them with my MacBook, it identifies it as “Phone 2” and said “Phone 2 connected”. I could not figure out how to change these assigned numbers without resetting the phone. So the first device it connects to will always become “Phone 1”, with the second one being identified with “Phone 2”. You can connect up to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously.✧ SOUND QUALITY ✧✮✮✮✮✮ (5 Stars)I like balanced headphones but with some emphasis on bass. I don’t like heavily unbalanced bass or treble (like Beats Audio). When it comes to sound quality, I have already been a fan of Sennheiser, having used many of their previous generation wired headphones. PXC550 lives up to the Sennheiser name and provides a very rich sound with deep bass. The volume level is good so I don’t have to turn it all the way, unlike some other headphones. With NC enabled, they sound magical when listening to music in a noisy environment.✧ FEATURES AND EASE OF USE ✧✮✮✮✮✮ (5 Stars)I love the touch control on these headphones. The outside of the right earcup acts like a touch sensitive touchpad - similar to a laptop’s touchpad. I can tap it once to play/pause music. I can swipe my finger on its surface from up to down to turn down the volume or down to up to turn up the volume. Likewise, I can swipe left and right to skip forward and reverse (i.e. play next/previous track/song). It is so very intuitive to use and you don’t have to fiddle around to find the right button to press only to find out that you hit the wrong one.I also love the fact that I have four choices when it comes to the built-in equalizer presets providing various “Effects” as Sennheiser calls them. I can cycle between: 1) Off, 2) Club mode (for music), 3) Movie mode, and 4) Speech. I like listening to podcasts so the Speech mode works really well. When I am listening to music, I either switch it to Club or turn it off.As I mentioned earlier, unfolding the headphones powers them on automatically so there is no need to slide any power switches. As soon as it is powered it, it searches for signals from any paired devices and connects to them without further action. This happens faster than I can put them on.I also love the intelligently designed audio cable jack that automatically turns off Bluetooth when the audio cable is connected, saving battery life.Talking about battery, the battery charges to full within 3 hours. It easily lasts for weeks for my use since I use it  everyday for about less than 2 hours each day and I always fold it to put it in its carry case. Because folding it automatically turns it off, I never accidentally leave it on when they are not in use.✧ Mobile App (CapTune) ✧✮✮✮✮✮ (5 Stars)Sennheiser has produced a really neat mobile app called “CapTune”, available through both Android (goo.gl/xenbNL) and iOS (goo.gl/3wLT9r) app stores.I don’t have an iOS device so I cannot talk about their app on iOS but, looking at the screenshots, I’m gathering that both the Android and the iOS versions of their apps are nearly identical in look and functionality.The Android app provides a lot of features that make these headphones even easier to use. For example, you can switch between the three equalizer presets, called “Effects”, right from the app. You can also manually change the equalizer to create your custom presets. You can completely control the noise-cancelling feature from the app, as it allows you to turn it off or set it to 50%, etc. You can check the battery status. You can play/pause the audio, skip forward/reverse, control volume.The app also includes a feature called SoundCheck, that allows you to adjust the equalizer in a new way by continuously selecting one of two choices (A or B), refining your sound preferences while listening to the music that you are currently playing. This allows you to come up with a very custom preset based on your selection of bass, treble and mid ranges.I was not expecting the app to include so many more additional features so I was pleasantly surprised and very impressed. I highly recommend installing CapTune on your device if you own these headphones.✧ PORTABILITY ✧✮✮✮✮✮ (5 Stars)PXC550 are very light and easy to carry. The carry case can fit everything, including the audio cable and the various adapters. I always keep the headphones in the carry case along with its accessories in my messenger bag. I have traveled with these headphones on airplanes and although they do add bulk, their light weight does not add much to weight of your carry on luggage.❝ COMPARISON WITH BOSE QC35 HEADPHONES ❞With a company like Bose that is known for its noise-cancelling headphones, their customers, like me, expect more than just the same old stuff packaged as a new upgrade. When I upgraded from QC25 to QC35, I felt that I was paying a premium just to use wireless (Bluetooth) on the new model because besides that feature and the rechargeable battery, Bose did not change much with the design or feature set. QC35 looks nearly identical in design and functionality to my old QC25. It was the same type of case, the same folding mechanism, the same level of noise-cancellation. Yet, they still cost a lot more compared to other similar Bluetooth headphones that include far more advanced feature set. How can Bose get away with that? That is because Bose has name-recognition in noise-cancelling headphones and they are capitalizing on their brand recognition. But they better watch out because Sennheiser has far more brand recognition among audiophiles.So let’s get into the details of how Bose QC35 falls flat when compared to Sennheiser PXC550.➊ Noise Cancellation ☊I hear no difference in noise cancellation between QC35 and PXC550. To be honest, at times, I find PXC550 to be just very slightly better when moving or walking. QC35, just like QC25, tends to turn-off noise cancellation for a brief second or two if they are suddenly jerked, like when you are walking down the stairs. This happens very rarely though and I don’t count it against Bose. Overall, both QC35 and PXC550 are equally excellent when it comes to noise cancellation.✔ PXC550: Excellent noise-cancellation.✔ QC35: Excellent noise-cancellation.➋ Noise Cancellation Controls ☊It appears that Bose did not spend anything on R&D when it was working on QC35. They just took everything that was in QC25 and packaged it as is with QC35 after adding Bluetooth and rechargeable battery. For example, the noise cancellation button on the new QC35 is nearly identical to the old QC25. The only slight difference is that It now supports three positions instead of two, allowing you to enable Bluetooth and power with the same button. But that’s a major flaw in my opinion. That is because this one button controls three completely unrelated things 1) power, 2) noise cancellation and 3) Bluetooth. You cannot independently turn off NC while keeping Bluetooth on. With QC35, NC it is either off or on when used with the included audio cable. What is even worse is the fact that NC is always on when you are using Bluetooth. You cannot turn it off without turning off Bluetooth too. This is a horrible design and a major flaw with QC35. I guess Bose did not want to add another button on QC35 so they thought they would just let that one button do three different, unrelated things.✔ PXC550: Allows three options to choose from: 1) NC off. 2) 50% NC, or 3) Full NC.✘ QC35: Two options: On or Off when wired. But always on when using Bluetooth because of the design flaw where one button controls three unrelated things.➌ Design ☊With PXC550, you get a brand-new premium look and feel. Although QC35 is well-designed, it looks very outdated, much like any other Bose headphones with the oval-shaped earcups. It seems that Bose does not want to experiment with new designs of their headphones. PXC550 looks far more intelligently designed than QC35.✔ PXC550: Fresh upgraded look.✘ QC35: Old, outdated design.➍ Controls ☊Talking about design, you have to wonder why Bose is sticking with the old-fashioned buttons when everything else these days includes touch-sensitive controls. From your smart TVs, to your thermostat, touch is the new interface. PXC550 automatically turns on when it is unfolded. No need for a power on switch. Even though QC35 can also be folded to store, Bose never thought about including such functionality. Talking about buttons, Bose also fails to include any button on their audio cable that comes with the QC35. Even my older QC25 had buttons on its audio cable that are no longer present on the QC35. It looks like they went backward with the new model, instead of improving the existing design. Unlike QC35, Sennheiser PXC550 includes a button on the cable so you can quickly pause/play your music or answer/end phone calls.✔ PXC550: Touch swipes (left-right for skip, top-down for volume, tap for pause). Button on audio cable.✘ QC35: Manual volume buttons on headphones. No button(s) on audio cable.➎ Weight ☊Travel headphones need to be as light as possible if you are lugging them around in your carry-on bag. Bose QC35 are 2.9 oz (82g) heavier than PXC550. To put this in perspective, Bose QC25 weigh 6.9 oz (196g), much lighter than QC35. PXC550 are not as light as QC25 but they are still lighter than QC35.✔ PXC550: 8 oz. (227g).✘ QC35: 10.9 oz. (309g).➏ Bluetooth Version ☊I like to look at specifications to understand what I am buying. The Bluetooth specification has gone through so many revisions and updates over the years since it was first introduced. These updates provide not only improved features but better power consumption. I do not like companies that hide details around these specifications so you don’t know what you are buying. Imagine buying a USB device without knowing if it meets USB 3.0 or USB 2.0 or USB 1 specification. While Sennheiser advertises their headphones as Bluetooth version 4.2 certified everywhere you look, I have searched for but failed to find this information about Bose QC35. I have looked everywhere I could, from Bose’ website to the QC35 user manual but I could not confirm whether QC35 meets Bluetooth 4.2 specification or not. It is rather absurd that Bose does not publish this information in their specification for QC35.*** UPDATE 07/16/2016 ***I just found out through Amazon’s product page of Bose QC35 under the Customer Questions and Answers that QC35 includes Bluetooth version 4.1. A Bose official response mentioned this fact on June 8 but they still do not update the product description to include this information.Some of the key enhancements that Bluetooth 4.2 introduces that were missing in 4.1 are:• Some key features for IoT.• IPv6 support.• Privacy improvements.• Security improvements.• Speed improvements over 4.1Bluetooth 4.2 was released on December 2, 2014. It is simply unacceptable for a pair of premium Bluetooth headphones that were released in June 2016 to not include Bluetooth 4.2. I can see the reason why Bose tries so hard to hide this fact from their product description and specification.✔ PXC550: Bluetooth version 4.2.✘ QC35: Bluetooth version 4.1.➐ Qualcomm aptX Support ☊Qualcomm’s aptX is an audio codec that provides superior audio quality over Bluetooth. When buying new Bluetooth headphones, aptX is one of the technologies to look for. Sadly, Bose does not include them in QC35 but Sennheiser does.✔ PXC550: aptX fully supported.✘ QC35: aptX NOT supported.➑ Mobile Apps ☊When comparing the mobile apps provided by Bose and Sennheiser, there is no comparison at all. I don’t even know the purpose of the Bose Connect app. You cannot control the noise-cancellation feature in any way shape or form. All it gives you is the ability to name your headphones for Bluetooth. If you just look at the mobile apps alone, it shows how much disregard Bose has for their customers and how little they have invested in their top-of-the-line, overpriced headphones. Hands down Sennheiser wins here with their far superior mobile app, CapTune.✔ PXC550: Sennheiser CapTune is a full-featured app.✘ QC35: Bose Connect does not provide any additional functionality.➒ Warranty ☊✔ PXC550: 2 year limited warranty✘ QC35: 1 year limited warranty----So there you have it. I will be periodically updating this review as I continue to use these great headphones and provide additional perspective for potential buyers. I will definitely warn here if I find anything negative about them but so far, with my less than 30 days of use, I have been blown away by these and they have quickly replaced both my Bose QC25 and QC35 headphones. I cannot recommend Sennheiser PXC550 enough. If you were previously considering either QC25 or QC35, get the Sennheiser PX550 instead. You won’t regret it.----*** UPDATE 07/19/2016 ***❝ MORE DETAILED NOISE-CANCELLATION TESTS  ❞Although I have been using PXC550 regularly since getting them, I had also stopped using my old QC25. This is because I could tell no difference between them when it comes the noise-cancellation feature alone. They both did an excellent job.After reading some of the genuine concerns in the comments section of this review regarding whether PXC550 can truly match the NC capabilities of the best NC headphones on the planet (namely, Bose QC25/QC35), I decided to take my QC25 out today for a test so I can compare both Bose and Sennheiser, side-by-side.First, I rode a bus and decided to sit in the back so I can hear the bus engine loud and clear. Without playing any music or any other audio, I simply put on my QC25 and turned on noise-cancellation. I could still clearly hear the bus engine but there was noticeable reduction in noise, as expected. I then switched to PXC550 and did the same. That is, without playing any audio, I just put them on with NC enabled and set to full (100%). They performed nearly identical to QC25. I tested multiple times and could not tell any difference in the level of noise-cancellation.Now, both of these headphones (PXC550 and QC25), do not create a pin-drop silence, as expected. As I mentioned, I could still hear the bus engine and some background noise. But the amount of noise that I could hear from either headphones was nearly the same.Since bus engines are too loud when you are sitting right next to them in the back of the bus, my next test included my office. The HVAC system in my office creates the perfect hissing sound that could be a great test for these headphones. Without playing any audio, I put on PXC550 to test. I could still hear some noise and it was not pin-drop silence as expected but I could clearly tell how much noise is reduced. I then tested QC25, with NC switch turned on, without connecting the audio cable. The amount of noise reduced was nearly the same. They both performed equally in both situations.As people who own earcup headphones might already know that, because of how the earcups of these headphones are designed, even without NC feature, some noise is reduced (called noise isolation). So both of these headphones do noise isolation as soon as you put them on without even enabling NC. But as soon as you enable NC, there is a very distinct and noticeable reduction in noise. Again, this reduction is noise is nearly the same for both QC25 and PXC550.Since I do not have the QC35 with me anymore, I could not test it but having used them, I know that their NC capabilities are identical to QC25.Obviously, this is not a scientific test in any way and I am sure that once these headphones are released, there will be many more tests performed and many more comparative reviews. I can tell you from my experience since I have both headphones, QC25 and PXC550, that I take PXC550 with me when I can take either one of them with me. I prefer PXC550 over QC25/QC35 because they provide the same level of NC while PXC550 provides many more features, including the most important feature in any headphones: sound quality. PXC550 sound much superior to QC25/QC35 when playing music.*** UPDATE 07/19/2016 ***I have attempted to add additional images to my review but they are not showing up. These images were side-by-side size comparison of Bose QC25 and Sennheiser PXC550. I have contacted Amazon customer service regarding this and I am hoping that these images should show up soon under my review, like the previously uploaded images that are visible.For folks who wanted to know the size of the earcups, I want to let you know the measurements: The inside opening of the earcup measures to be about 2.4 inches. This is nearly the same for Bose QC25 which measures to be about 2.5 inches. My measurements were very rough so they are not 100% accurate. The 0.1 inch difference can be attributed to the placement of the measuring tape as you will see once my image is successfully visible in my review. So I would say that both Bose and Sennheiser are the same size when it comes to the size of the earcup.----*** UPDATE 08/07/2016 ***❝ CALL QUALITY TESTS ❞I have been using these headphones every day since getting them. They have not disappointed me.I have tested them for phone calls. I have received and made calls while walking in busy city streets. To be honest, PXC550 is not as perfect as my Jabra or Plantronics bluetooth headphone but it is not bad either. Let me elaborate more. When I am talking on the phone using these headphones, although the other party can hear me fine, they can tell some difference when compared with my Jabra and Plantronics headphones. Although, people can still hear me fine, they do notice improvement when I switch to my Jabra or Plantronics headphones. With the PXC550, I have to speak a bit louder.I have a theory for why this happens, i.e. why I feel that I am speaking slightly louder. As opposed to the single-ear mono Plantronics or Jabra, when I am using PXC550, both my ears are completely covered and even with noise cancellation disabled, I cannot tell how loud I am speaking so I tend to speak at a lower volume than I normally would when using the other Bluetooth headphones. So it is possible that I speaking at at a different (i.e. lower) volume when I use PXC550.This result did not surprise me because PXC550 are not designed to be primarily used for long phone conversation. For lengthy phone conversation, I still prefer my single-ear headphones that are designed for the purpose of talking on the phone like Jabra or Plantronics over PXC550.----*** UPDATE 08/20/2016 ***The battery on this keeps going for weeks. I had to recharge it last night in the middle of watching a movie. It seamlessly connects to my Samsung 4K TV. I could control the volume right from the headphones. In the middle of watching the movie, the headphone alerted me with a voice prompt that the battery was low. After about 15 more minutes, it turned off. I connected the micro USB port to let it charge with a portable USB battery while I continued to use it to finish watching the movie. I must add that I have been using it almost everyday for about 20 minutes to 60 minutes, for the past week without recharging the battery at all. The last time I charged the battery was more than a week ago.----*** UPDATE 08/23/2016 ***= TalkThrough (feature) =Here’s a feature that I didn’t know about but accidentally found out about it. (Reminds me that I should go through its 50-page user guide.) When you want to not only disable the noise cancellation but also want to listen to your surrounding as if you were not even wearing these headphones, you can just double-tap the touch pad. If you are playing music, this will not only pause music or video but also completely turn off noise cancellation and allow you to listen in to your surrounding. It works so well that it is feels like you have literally removed these headphones from your ears.----*** UPDATE 08/27/2016 ***I am super excited to report that not only have I been fully enjoying these headphones, they have been much more indispensable than any other stereo headphones I have used in the past because of their versatility.I have finally taken the time to review its lengthy 50-page instruction manual.☞ Link to Instruction Manual in PDF ☞ goo.gl/rvrzPHI found some really interesting features that are possible only with the touch controls. Here are a few of the touch controls that I should mention because I find them very useful. I should mention that you should really check out the Instruction Manual because there are many touch controls (in addition to what I mention below) that you may find very useful. They also substitute for having to look at the CapTune.❝ TOUCH CONTROLS ❞✨ Transferring a call to/from the headphones ✨ (Page 36 on Instruction Manual)Action: Tap and hold the touch pad for a second.When I receive a call while I am enjoying music or podcast through my phone,I can always transfer the call back to my phone and then back to my headphones by tapping and holding for a second. This allows me to continue the conversation on the phone if I need to put away headphones, without having to disable/disconnect Bluetooth.✨ Voice control function ✨ (Page 37 on Instruction Manual)Action: Swipe backward on the touch pad and hold.This simply activates Google Now. I have a Nexus (Android) phone so I use Google Now quite a lot when I am using hands-free so I was very happy to find that these headphones allow that functionality with a very simple swipe and hold. On iPhones, I am guessing this may activate Siri but since I do not have an iPhone, I cannot confirm.✨ Battery Status ✨ (Page 29 on Instruction Manual)Action: Tap and hold the touch pad for about 4 seconds.This gives you a quick status on battery in percentage.✨ TalkThrough ✨ (Page 26 on Instruction Manual)Action: Quickly tap the touch pad twice.As I mentioned earlier in my review, this is a very useful feature for noise-cancelling headphones. It pauses whatever you are playing, disables noise-cancellation and somehow activates some type of pass-through microphones that work so well that you feel like you have literally removed these headphones from you ears. It allows you to listen in to your surrounding so you can talk to people without having to remove the headphones. This is a really good feature and I happened to find it accidentally and couldn’t be happier to use it more frequently now.----*** UPDATE 08/31/2016 ***I mentioned this information under comments so I thought I should mention it here. The touch controls work fine wearing gloves. I also noticed that it only responds to touches that cover area of a finger or thumb. So when I place my palm over it, it does not activate it.What's odd is that it still works when you cover your finger with a fabric. So I tested it by touching it with a pointed surface of a pencil eraser but it did not activate. So the touch surface works really well and is able to identify a finger even with gloves.I was very surprised that it does work when you're wearing gloves. I should mention that I only tested it with wool gloves.",5.0 out of 5 stars,With these headphones Sennheiser leaves Bose in the dust [UPDATED REVIEW]

    ","As others have noted, these are very comfortable headphones that sound great. The max volume is a little lower than the other headphones I tested against (Bose QC35, Sony MDR-1000x, JBL Everest Elite 700 and V-Moda Crossfade 2 Wireless). However, this is only a problem if you want to go deaf at a young age.The headphones are comfortable, but the QC 35 is much more comfortable and somehow feel lighter on the head. Also, the PXC 550 can be tight for those with big heads. The Bose headband expands to accommodate bigger heads. I like that the earcups are easily replaced with a better process than the competitors. I did notice that my ears get hotter with the PXC 550 as compared to the other models mentioned above. The shape of the earcups can also be a problem for users with bigger ears. The QC 35 would be a better choice for those users.The noise cancellation on the Sennheiser is somewhat less effective than the QC 35 or MDR-1000x, particularly when it comes to voices. However, the PXC 550 seems to induce less of the pressure on the ears that the others do. It's very nice to be able to adjust or disable ANC with the switch. The QC 35 requires using the companion app (after upgrading firmware) which is not as convenient as the Sennheiser's switch.The ""smart pause"" is entirely too sensitive. I had to disable it in the Captune app as it would constantly pause songs when I moved my head or in any way moved my jaw.The fatal flaw of the PXC 550 is the implementation of touch controls for calls. While the touch controls are nice for music playback, they are a disaster for use during phone calls for a simple reason. It is entirely too easy to drop calls by accidentally brushing the touch sensor. I tried these last week for a few teleconferences and accidentally dropped calls on three separate occasions. The MDR-1000x gets around this problem by requiring a double tap to hang up a call. This made for embarrassing and frustrating situations where I had to dial back into important conference calls.Sennheiser really needs to fix this boneheaded design choice, but there lies another serious problem. There is no way to upgrade the firmware. For a $400 pair of headphones, this is ridiculous. Most of their competitors allow upgrading firmware to fix bugs and add features. Sennheiser apparently didn't think of the need for this, or couldn't be bothered.The companion Captune app is another sore spot. It's almost entirely useless for most users as the EQ feature limited to local non-DRM files and Tidal streaming. Since the vast majority of users don't listen to music in these ways, the EQ is pointless for them. You can change a few settings and you can partially customize the sound effect modes (Club, movie, etc.) and can activate an additional ""Director"" effect. The iOS app also suffers from some annoying UI bugs. Overall, Sennheiser really flubbed the companion app.Finally, the included case is pathetic. It's basically a soft case with what feels like a cardboard spine. The spine on mine already creased, so the case offers no protection from being crushed. If I decide to keep these, I'll have to spend more to get a decent case. For a $400 product, the case is an insult.I still haven't decided if I'm going to keep these. I often work from home, so good call performance is important. While the 3 mics make for good call quality, the problem with accidentally dropped calls is close to a deal breaker. I'm lucky in that I have other bluetooth headphones that I can use for calls, but it's ridiculous to have to swap out my headphones every time I need to make a call.Honestly, the Sony MDR-1000x is the best unit I tried, in just about every category. Unfortunately, those seem to have build quality issues with the headband cracking and Sony is giving users a hard time about warranty repairs. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't hesitate to choose the Sony over both the Sennheiser and the Bose.As it stands, I have to decide between the PXC 550 and the QC 35. I'm not happy with either one, but after writing this review and recalling all the things I don't like about the Sennheiser, I'm inclined to keep looking.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sounding, comfortable headphones, but don't get these to use for phone calls"

    ","There are many great reviews on this item so i'll just give you my flight experience... I fly 2-4 times a year and have always used Klipsch wired earbuds (no noise cancellation)... on my last trip from AZ to Ireland I bought passive noise suppression foam ear buds on the return leg which ended up making my ear canals hurt really bad by the time I got home. That prompted me to shop for over-ear, lightweight NC headphones and narrowed it down to the PCX550 or QC35 for a long trip from AZ to Israel... after many reviews and struggling to pay $50 more for the Senns, I made the purchase and don't regret a thing. I was blown away with how well the PXC550 worked. NC was great at 100% and with a little extra volume on my music, even the screaming babies faded away. To be clear, airplane white noise from engines and such are gone but voices and crying babies although very muted can still be made out to some degree but with some music or during a movie, you wont hear them at all. I also absolutely loved the touch controls and thought that was worth the extra money alone. The sound quality was great in club mode and as far as BT, I inadvertently left my phone at my seat when I walked to the toilet on the plane and realized after I closed the door how far the range was... very nice. So between movies and music on about 17 hours of flight time heading to Israel, I charged the headphones at the hotel and was surprised to see it was still charged at 3 full bars (of 5) with bar 4 flashing (charging) and took a little over an hour to charge to full. At the volumes I was listening to, I'm inclined to think it would've lasted both legs of the trip on one charge even though I know it says 22 hours... i'll have to let it run down to empty next time and see. They were extremely comfortable to wear throughout the trip and compared to the countless headsets I saw others wearing, I thought these looked by far the best... simple elegance that screams quality. I would recommend these to anyone.",5.0 out of 5 stars,...Simple elegance that screams quality

    ","Ok so here is why I picked these over the Bose QC35 or the Sony MDR1000.Here are my like and dislikes:1. Dual connection support for both my personal cell and my work one. If I am listening to music on one, I can still received a call on the other. It will pause the media.2. Sound cancelling, With these the amount of sound cancelling is adjustable so I do not get that dead space isolation chamber feeling, just a very nice reduction of volume.3. Ambient listening. If you double tap the touch pad, you can hear everything around you just as if you were not wearing headphones. Very nice feature when crossing streets, or want to hear what going on around you.4. Comfort, I travel a lot and use these a lot. Once the headband is positioned correctly I have used these on 5 hour flights and not had any kind of ear fatigue.5. Sound, They sound great to me, just wish they could get a touch louder in BT mode for when I really want to crank up the music.6. Cost, yes these are expensive and if it were not for the noise cancelling I probably would have gone another route.7. Wear and tear, The provided case for a 350-400 set of headphones is a disgrace. At least it makes me feel that the money was spent on the headphones and not the case. The rubberized material for the trackpad and other side is very susceptible to scratches and rubs and shows easily (not good). The earpads are very soft and comfortable which is a very good thing and shows no sign of wear in the past 2.5 months. The headband could use some more padding in my opinion, but seems to hold up well.Conclusion: would I recommend these to anyone?Depends on the person, if you travel a lot and are concerned about the roar of jet engine noise, and also like listening to music or other media while that is occurring, while also being able to tap on the side to engage the ambient listening mode to order your next drink in first class then probably. If you are not in need of the sound cancelation or ambient listening features then I feel there are much better options.Final thoughts: Yes they are very good headphones, but for the money I feel they should be spectacular, with a touch more comfort on the headband area and the ability to inflict hearing damage from the volume, but sadly these do not.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Travelers honest assesment

    ","Wow, these headphones really delivered. I went through this search for the perfect bluetooth headphones that could do two things very well:1) Have great bluetooth call quality2) Have music quality that would blow me awayI wanted them for mostly listening to music and shutting out my environment to focus on work, but I can spend some days entirely on the phone from morning to night, so call quality is a huge.Headphones I tried:Sennheiser HD1 - got them on sales for around $380Bose QC35 - paid $350I ended up returning them both after extensive testing. The Bose had EXCELLENT noise cancelling, and are still the most comfortable headphones I've tried. However the sound quality was not great as I found the clarity to just be severely lacking when listening to instrumental pieces or loud bass parts. It also didn't have great quality on calls.The Sennheiser HD1's had unbelievable sound quality, best headphones I've ever used and wirelessly at that. However the mic quality was pretty terrible, and I got the robot sounds interference pretty regularly.So I returned them both and decided the goldilocks pair of headphones just wasn't out there. This year, after reading up about the PXC 550 for a long time, I decided to pull the trigger. I'm happy to say I found the perfect pair of headphones (for me)!The sound quality is excellent, not quite up to the HD1's, but still excellent. I seem to just prefer Sennheiser's sound stage and music mix more than other brands. They never over emphasize bass, they have solid mids and clear highs. These headphones are no different.What truly blew me away about these headphones though was the call quality. What I lost on music quality from the HD1's, I gained in call quality. With the additional microphone, I come across crystal clear to the people I'm speaking to. Even better, they sound like I'm literally sitting next to them. The sound cancellation and snug fit work great, and so I hear perfectly and they hear me perfectly as well. It's seriously the best call quality I've ever experienced.Another VERY nice feature is the ability to double tap the headphone and have it allow ambient noise. It's like taking off your headphones! It's super nice in an office setting when you need to exchange a few words with a colleague, then go back to listening to music.Bluetooth range is also fantastic - I live in a 735 square foot apartment and I can walk anywhere in the apartment on phone calls/listening to music. Pretty awesome.The noise cancellation is also very good. Maybe it's not as good as Bose, but it's negligible. I don't work in a crazy loud environment though, so I might not be a great judge. I will say that the Bose was so intense on the pressure side that I felt uncomfortable wearing them, and while these are a little better, they're not that much better. There's still a good amount of pressure when they're on MAX settings - the good news is you can adjust or turn it off with the flip of a switch, so it's no problem! Turn them up to MAX in the airplane, have it off or on automatic when sitting around at home.Now for the cons. While these are the perfect pair of headphones for me in terms of performance, I have a few things I don't like about them.1) Fit - it's comfortable, but not terribly comfortable. Still trying them out and putting them through the test of hours of wearing, but they're just an awkward shape. When you get the cones kind of vertical on your ears, the head band on top is in a weird place. It's also unfortunate that when you put them away you have to reduce the headband to the smallest size, and therefore re-adjust it every time you put them on (they're stiff in the beginning).2) The Cap Tune app - this has been labeled by many reviews as a great bonus...but I really have no idea why. I quickly learned that the EQ stuff only works when streaming through the app. Not a problem right? Except it is ONLY compatible with the Tidal streaming service...which costs $20 a month. They give you a free trial for 3 months, but still. I use Spotify, so I'm just left out and it makes the app entirely useless to me.Not only that, but I found the app to be relatively buggy. It frequently shows me 0% battery and none of the accurate settings for my headphones when I open it. Then sometimes it just randomly kicks in and reflects the right battery and settings. So if it's not reliable for settings, it's not able to work with my streaming service, then what is this app for? Ya got me. Many reviewers said it allowed them to fine tune the audio profile, but I couldn't even do that because I have no music locally on my phone. I only listen through Spotify, so I could do literally nothing.3) The price - I bought these headphones on sales for $299, and I don't think I could really justify them for $400. Maybe for $350 since that's in line with their main competitor (Bose QC35).All in all though, this is the exact right balance of audio and call quality, and I look forward to using them the next time I'm traveling. It's always great to have the option to take out your regular headphones and shut out airplane noise!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent balance of audio and call quality

    ","The PXC 550 a good match for your iPhone, even w/o aptX?Short answer: YES. Why? on a real-world test I couldn't distinguish the difference between aptX and SBCLong answer:You might know by now that there are different audio codecs for Bluetooth audio streaming, SBC (the old one), aptX and AAC (the new ones). The issue is that the PXC 550 supports aptX but the iPhone doesn't, Why? Licenses and other kind of business decisions. Honestly, I was worried about the PXC 550 not supporting AAC because all iPhone/iPad do and apple is not going to include any time soon support for aptX. But, since I don't want Bose, because I feel like I am buying snake oil (try to find the frequency range of the QX30 on Bose's website), I decided to give them a try. As you will read on many reviews here, the construction is solid rock and the audio quality superb. I didn't particularly dislike the case and I am happy that Sennheiser spent the money on the headphones and not on the case.So I tested them. Off all my equipment the only one that do supports aptX is my MacBook Pro, so I did a test using a good quality audio file (ALAC, apple's lossless audio codec) and switched many times between SBC and aptX.As you can see on the attached images, SBC is showing the graphs in orange and aptX in green. The important thing is that although I could see a difference in the bit rate: about 45 Kbps for aptX and ~43 Kbps for SBC (as maximum), I could not hear any difference. The test environment was my office before 8am so was not noisy and I tested different audio files, ranging from classical music, electronic and rock.My humble concussion is that I couldn't tell the difference in a quiet environment, it simply won't matter if I use SBC on an airplane. Remember, if you want the real thing and the best possible audio you should do the following: 1) do not use Bluetooth, use the cable (no middle man codecs); 2) turn off the noise canceling; 3) do not try to listen music on an airplane!As a previous owner of the PXC 450 that wanted to update to Bluetooth, the 550 is just amazing, worth every penny.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The PXC 550 a good match for your iPhone, even w/o aptX?"

    ","These are very good noise cancelling headphones. Judged solely on that scale, they get 5 stars for their ability to hear content during a flight. They are also comfortable though people with very large ears may notice the pads more than I did. They can make your ears sweat a little too in humid conditions.Notably useful is the PXC 550s ability to pair to two different devices and receive notifications on the first device while listening to music on the second device, allowing calls to come through and mute the music so you can talk.The high quality that Sennheiser is known for is apparent here too, though the price premium you are paying is quite high. Sound quality is nowhere near what I am used to with the HD 650 available for a similar street price. But the two models are meant to serve different purposes, and both do their job quite well.The package includes a soft carrying case, a USB A to micro adapter for charging, a 1/8"" to 1/4"" phone adapter for home listening, and a 1/8"" stereo to to 1/8"" mono plugs, which I guess is for plugging into the airplane's sound system.Battery life is excellent, and I never have been able to count the actual hours of use to see if the rated battery life of over 20 hours is accurate. Seems like it, htough.You will want to turn the headphones into their off position when not in use (a 90 degree turn of the cups -- which also flattens them for placement in the case).The phones automatically connect to their paired phones / computers when opened and placed on your head (""phone 2, connected""). You can connect to two sources at the same time. Phone 1 will take precendence is opened, sllencing the secondary source for two seconds while it seeks an audio signal. If none is found, sound will resume on Phone 2 (the music is not necessarily paused).it's nice to be able to hear your phone while listening to music, and especially helpful not to repair to your phone everytime you use the 550s with a different device.There are two different levels for the active nosie cancelling (ANC). I found the passive mode was sufficient to hear a movie in flight, but I used the low strength anyway as any reduction in fidelity was well overcome by the increased dynamic range available from the lowest audible sounds to the highest. Listening to a movie on an airplane was very pleasant and the noise from the aircraft engines was audible but not distracting.In noise control mode, you will notice a slight increase in air pressure. Thls is part of the design of nearly all ANC headphones and can be uncomfortable for some users. I got used to it after a while.There is a feature that allows you to listen in to voices around you by turning on the microphones outside the headphone. This can be helpful during card games in public rooms while listening to music, allowing the player to hear bets from the other players and instructions from the dealer. Voices sound louder so you can eavesdrop into whispered conversations if that is your thing, though I imagine there is more specialized equipment availbable for those seeking to engage in such nefarious activities.Overall, noise cancelling is as well implemented as I need. For those walking around in cities with jackhammers tearing up the streets, a more careful comparison may be desired. But the 550s are more than enough for my noise reduction needs.I try not to listen to music very loudly (I see too many people with hearing aids these days). For these heaphones however an extra db or two is helpful to hear detail during listening with bluetooth on.So far as straight sound quality, I felt the 550s clearly sound superior to the Bose 35 and Sony 1000x. The Sony's came closer to matching the 550s, with a wired connection.Bass is not exaggerated, though perhaps a slight bump of the upper bass range exists. With bluetooth, dynamic range compression flattens the sound -- in noisy environments this is probably helpful. Sadly, the music begins to sound more like mp3 files and less like the lossless files I listen to on my comptuer. The treble seems slightly muted, especially at the uppermost reaches of human hearing (I found a web site that plays sweeps from 20 hz to 20khz and my hearing drops off at about 14khz).The character of the sound with the closed backs is extremely controlled, too much so for my taste, and while alone I use my open back Grado SR 125 or Sennheiser HD 650.Imaging is quite good, though, which makes up for the somewhat limited soundstage.Overall, the Sennheiser PXC 550s are a strong recommend for those who can afford to spend the money for a set of travelling headphones. I would recommend other choices for the office or (especially) private use, however.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best in class? Maybe!

    ","Comparison is Sennheiser PXC 550, Bose QC25, Bose QC35, Beats Studio Wireless.I happen to have all of these right now except the 35 which I had recently.Summary: Sennheiser is excellent. A worthy competitor to the QC35. Much better than the Beats Studio wireless.Sound: Similar to the QC35. Overall well rounded, and capable. Bright. Powerful lows. Sometimes a little to bass-y and a little too bright, but overall excellent. Sounds clear, unmuddled. Similar to the QC35. Beats Studio sound is similar to the QC25. Studio sounds warmer, a little more muddled.All these headphones generally sound fairly flat which is especially surprising for the Beats.Noise cancellation is excellent on the Sennheiser, but try as they may, its not as good as the Bose 25/35. In a room with a loud fan and room AC, I could still hear a little of the AC with the Sennheiser. Its the best ANC I've heard other than Bose, but the Bose still beat it. I couldn't make out the AC with the Bose but did hear is some with the Sennheiser. In a quiet room the Bose seems to have more hiss than the Sennheiser. Noise cancellation in the Beats is a joke. The Bose turned OFF reduces noise more than the Beats with noise cancellation turned on.On the Sennheiser you can turn off noise cancellation. Thats my primary reason for choosing it over the Bose 35. However its not quite as useful as I hoped in that even with noise cancellation turned off, there's still lots of noise isolation and I can't hear much of whats going on around me unless the music is very low. I wanted to be able to hear people talking around me in case someone was trying to talk to me. There's a ""talk through"" feature which is really cool. It uses a microphone to pickup outside sound and pipes it into the headphones, even while noise cancellation is going on. It works really well. You can hear people crystal clear and it still takes out rumbling low noises. However, this feature isn't quite as useful as I hoped either because turning it on stops the music. You can only use it when you stop listening to music and listen to people. For that you could just as easily just take off the headphones. I wish they'd let ""talk through"" work while still playing music so that I could tell that someone wants my attention before they have to tap me on the shoulder or jump up and down to get my attention.Comfort: Most comfortable are the Bose 25/35. Super soft head strap and ear cups. Sennheiser is next, ear cups are super soft and comfortable but the head strap is a little narrow and firm. Beats are reasonably comfortable but the ear cups are too shallow for me and my ears end up squished somewhat. YMMV.Usability/Tech: Sennheiser has every feature and the kitchen sink. Its great flexibility, but makes for overly complex interaction. ANC and effects buttons on the headphones are small, hard to find and of questionable value. Touchpad is large and very sensitive, so its easy to accidentally make something happen when you were reaching for a different button or just readjusting the headphones. Sennheiser app is a mess. I assume they'll fix it. On an iPad, it started up in a tutorial you couldn't get out of. Had to kill it. Once the app does start and connect to the headphones, if you get out of the app and back in, it can't communicate with the headphones any more. The UI is confusing. Part music player, part headphone configurator. There's lots of function there, but not presented well. Too confusing with funky rules. You CAN adjust noise cancellation on the headphones from the app but only if switch on the headphone is set to 50%. You can configure a Director effects setting in the app but its not terribly obvious that its there.The Beats has a simple UI but is functional and seems to work well. Buttons on the headphone for volume up/down, play/pause. Despite being an Apple product, I had numerous bluetooth disconnects to my iPhone 6, whereas the Sennheiser never had a connection issue. The Bose 35 never had a connection issue, but I did have it skip or stutter sometimes.Price: From this set, the Bose qc25 is supposed to be the cheapest. For an extra $50 you can get the Base QC 35. To me, its worth getting wireless for only $50 extra. The Bose QC35 are excellent. For an extra $50 beyond that you get the Sennheiser which sounds as good, is also wireless but adds a bunch of options for ANC. To me, its worth it if you've made it this far. The Beats I'd still consider only because its actual price has dropped so much from its original retail. Its possible to get it for half the price of the Sennheiser which might make it worth consideration. At its original retail price, its not a serious contender.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Review w Bose QC25/35, Beats Studio and Sennheiser 550"

    ","After buying the Bose QC35 at Bose, I experienced the same Bluetooth connection issue that I discovered others were having. So I ordered these from Amazon. They're amazing. Here are the pro's (not in any particular order):1. Sound is really clear (like the Bose);2. App's equalizer allows you to tailor sound to your taste (unlike Bose's purposeless app);3. No Bluetooth issues--great range too (the QC35 cutting out when IPhone was in my left pocket was what got me to research issue and then read about the PXV550. It was a deal breaker.);4. Weighs less than the Bose, though imperceptible;5. Love the auto-pause when you remove from your head;6. Really like the touch pad control on earpiece (unlike Bose's buttons) but have to get used to not playing with it if you don't want to accidentally skip a song;7. Power on when opening headphones is Okay, no big deal;8. Haven't put battery life to the test.9. Can separately turn off Bluetooth and noise canceling (unlike Bose);10. On phone calls it gives you feedback on your own voice which makes it easier to modulate your speaking volume.Cons:1. Bose noise cancellation is a bit more powerful, but only noticeable when not playing any music, the PXC550 cancels enough;2. Bose has a bassier bass if you like that (I do) but audiophiles will prefer the more balanced range of the PXC550 (and it is marvelous, I don't miss the Bose's bass), equalizer does allow you to boost the bass (Bose cannot be adjusted);3. I found the oval shaped earpieces on the Bose slightly bigger and more comfortable than the egg shaped earpieces on the Senns. My ears are probably on the larger size so your mileage may vary. Was no deal breaker, as I returned the QC35's to Bose. But Bose *might* be slightly more comfortable for lengthy wearing.4. Cost $50 more.5. Carry case is significantly larger than the Bose (unnecessarily so) which may affect the room you have in your brief case. I plan to use a separate compartment on the outside my briefcase rather than the carry case as it will also make these easier to remove and stow on planes. But this is a definite negative.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Why the PXC550 beat the Bose QC35

    ","I have tested the sony mdr 1000x, bose qc35, as they are the 2 main competitors versus the PXC 550. Pairing with the PXC 550 is a breeze depending on what device you are using whether it is your computer, laptop, or phone. I connected it to all 3 and fortunately - it'll remember the profiles on my laptop and phone since my bluetooth DONGLE on the pc is pretty weak (lacks aptX and is just a cheap 4.0 bluetooth device). It is a common issue that there will be difficulty connecting to these devices which was why I took away a star. SOLUTION for windows 10 as I have not used any other OS : there is an ""effect"" button which is right beneath the ANC switch - and what you can do is just hold it for 4 seconds when your bluetooth is ON. it'll show up as a HEADSET OR SPEAKER icon if you want it to properly pair. If it looks like a phone trying to connect w/ the computer - then that is not the proper connection. After figuring that out - connecting it consistently is simply a breeze. Now - if you want to skype or discord etcetc -and listen to something else at the same time - it'll act as a bluetooth device and shut off every other sound which is fine but sound won't really come back unless you decide to reset the headset on/off and reconnect. You can change this by going into any settings (for both the computer settings AND the program -skype,discord,etc- settings and changing the output as ""PXC - STEREO"" not hands free as I kept getting numerous errors. Once you have that all set up - it should work as the best as it can sound for your device w/o the phone modifying the sound. OTHER SOLUTION : if none of these work - the the alternate route is simply go into the call / voice chat etc FIRST and then connect your bluetooth - and change all of your settings stated above. It is a tedious process because I havent received my aptX dongle to pair it with my pxc 550 yet so i cant say anything else.It pairs up with multiple devices perfectly fine - it just cuts off my sound on PC / LAPTOP whenever i use my phone, but it'll shortly reconnect itself (not always so you gotta redo everything).The ANC is pretty amazing since you get to adjust your ""NOISEGARD' as sennheiser calls it - on your phone to whatever % anc you want - and this becomes extremely helpful since I would want the ANC to work as little as possible sometimes rather than fullblasting the strength of the ANC in my ears (such as bose qc 35). I don't have the best ears anymore for hearing every sound outside of my headphones, but they are trained so I can't really hear anything else other than the details of whichever music is playing - but Sony mdr 1000x is the winner when it comes ANC amongst the bose qc35 and pxc 550. My reason why it is the best is simply because it really does sufficiently cut off all noise levels without adding the pressure you'd feel as though you were diving into a pool at its deepest level and feeling the pressure against your ear (which bose qc35 does automatically and you cannot stop the anc when wireless). Or going up a mountain - whichever makes relates to you more. The sony mdrs also have soft paddings on the top band / earcups so it adds to the comfort of wearing it. However - it is a tight fit in my opinion so for most users - each cup will PRESS against your ear while the cups surround the outer parts of it and also has more weight than the other 2 headphones which makes it uncomfortable since you'll (slightly) feel more pressure from the ANC, but still not as bad as BOSE. The PXC 550 ANC will add pressure but I hardly notice it when listening to music, it is enough for my needs.The main reason I bought the PXC 550 is because of the sound quality being much more clear and crisp to enjoy compared to the other headphones. The qc35 sounds like it has more bass (i prefer flat) and the sony mdr 1000x just doesn't sound as rich as the pxc 550. The best I could explain it is that - while sony mdr 1000x still has great sound quality, it is just a few steps behind pxc 550 in this field. When I listen to music with ANC on, i actually hear better quality just because it reduces enough of the external noises to affect my experience from its performance. Disclaimer:Multi-profiling or compatibility etcetc as stated in my first paragraph - it works great, but the process can be tedious depending on what device you're using. I think the boseqc35 is the best you'll get amongst the 3 since it works as a bt device without any tampering needed as far as my experiences w/ it goes. The sony mdr CANNOT perform this function - which ends up making this lack utility over the other headsets - a great inconvenience for a fast pace society because you need to disconnect its current bluetooth pairing - and then switch it over. If you are somebody who wants or needs only 1 device paired - then it's perfect for you.Utility - there's a lot of great utilities on the pxc 550 - since you just need to swipe around for volume, playback, calls, etc. The switches aren't that  apparent since you really do have to find your way to them, but once you're used to it then its not an issue. Sony MDRs are as simple as the pxc550, but not as sensitive as the pxc 550 which I dislike. I laid in bed for a bit and turned my head - and then it hung up my call and paused my other stuff for gently tapping against the pillow (just to see how it'd feel like when watching a movie in bed or something). The bose doesn't really have anything to go about, so I don't really have a comment other than the fact that they lack these handy utilities.Something that the sony mdr and pxc 550 have is the open mic or ambiance sound option. You get to turn these on and you can listen to your surroundings. The Sony Mdr's slightly lowered everything else - so i didn't appreciate it downgrading the sound overall, but I'll admit that this feature (like when you cup your hand over your right ear to hear everything) is extremely useful since i did not need to take off my headset - as it will just continue playing my music after i take off my hand. The pxc 550 can essentially do the same, but the difference is that while you do have the open mic feature - you ALSO have a talkthrough feature by double tapping the right ear and then you can hear everything even more - regardless of the ANC mode you're on. This has proven to be the greater feat. just because I was able to clearly hear everything outside of my headphones - on an even more enhanced level than my ears could originally pick up. I also managed to set up on my PC - the same way i set everything else in my first paragraph - to not disrupt the audio at all - works perfectly hearing the best of both worlds. Also, Just switching my headphones into its swiveled position automatically turns on / off the headset. I'm very forgetful since I tend to always forget to turn off my headset via button pressing. Now that this feature is included (although it CAN be a nuisance when adjusting your headphones on your ear to fit properly - it might disconnect), I use it endlessly and ofc effortlessly. I don't own an android device but I have tested it on 3 different phones that do thanks to friends (s7, s7 edge, s6), but NFC works perfectly.Comfort WHILE listening to music - The pxc 550's weight and over ear form is why I got these. The pxc weighs LESS than the other competitors - and since it's wireless, it's just nice not having the extra weight or tangling of the wires. The sony's weigh as much as the audio technica m50x but slightly less - and without the wire weight ofc. Bose feels the best in my opinion for its paddings cupping my ear fully and not pressing against my ear. However, during listening - the anc just feels like my head is being crushed. The pxc 550 doesn't crush my head at all or add on any extra pressure. The cups on the pxc 550 were able to barely cup my ears fully *thankfully, but for people with larger heads / ears - the PXC 550 is hard to break in to your size so it might not fit you, and it will hurt quickly. But since it fits me -  I don't feel the drivers touching my ears at all, and only the slightest back part of the headphones touch my ears so I have no complaints since it's exactly what I was looking for. This is mainly thanks to the curvature of the ear cups.Battery life - they're all great at battery life with and without ANC. BUT the sony mdr's cannot CHARGE while in use. So that's the main downside, but charging to full from a dead sony is 4hrs and bose took me around 3. I haven't fully drained the battery from the PXC550 so I don't know since I tend to put the usb in often because of testing (charging it inevitably).I have my own headphone case, but as most people say - the case should be much more durable thank it currently is, but I like the pouch it has inside - makes it pretty nice that It's a thin case overall so i can squish it a little more in my bag without damaging my unit.Overall, I love these headphones for its wonderful sound quality (for a wireless headphone) and all of its utility. Incase anyone wanted to know - I also use it for gaming in my leisure - and it's pretty enjoyable still for overwatch, league, etc incase anyone decides to use it for these reasons as well",4.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT QUALITY AND UTILITY at the cost of some labor.

    ","After hours of research and in-store testing (comfort, sound, appearance) these came out the best. I am not an audiophile by any means and I wanted wireless headphones that fit nice and were comfortable to wear for 5-10 hours at a time at work. Seeing many nice alternatives (Sennheiser's HD1's (Momentum 2.0 rebrand), Bose 35's, Beats, Sony's & Audiotechnica's versions) I noticed that none of them had the ability to turn of ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) while listening in wireless mode. Although minimal, after long periods you notice the pressure on your ears while this feature is on (all the time). The best feature I was looking for was the ability to control ANC while using wirelessly. These were one of the few pairs I found that you could do so. The reviews about the touch control features on the ear kind of made me weary, but they are actually excellent and very useful. Most people have some form or smartphone or tablet that uses touch commands and these are no different. They aren't as sensitive as an iPhone but as you would except, tapping pauses and plays audio and you swipe up and down for volume. One feature the description doesn't tell you is the double tap feature which pauses the audio and the outside speakers listen to your surroundings. This is nice so that you don't have to take off headphones to answer questions or listen in to your co-workers talking about you while you have huge headphones on. You may notice the ear-pads are different from most others in their shape. The only downside to these is that they could possibly be uncomfortable to people with larger ears as they are a bit more narrow towards the bottom. Mine however fit perfectly as you can slightly tilt the cups to fit your head size without much effort. My ears are ""normal"" if that makes sense, not to big or wide, but not tiny either. These are a bit pricey but they are very well made, very comfortable, and very customizable. You can customize the output based on what you are listening to. it has many pre-made settings to adjust voice emphasis as in podcast & audiobooks and other settings for music & movies. You can look into that using CapTune on iOS or Android devices. I personally use the default settings 99% of time. Another great feature is that these headphones are very easy to pair with any bluetooth device. They have a tiny button on the back right cup (the one with the touch controls as well) and you press until the voice assistance says ""pairing"" and usually only takes 10 seconds to be connected and ready to go. It will automatically connect to your previous 2 devices (1st if it's on then 2nd if 1st device was off) once headphones are powered on. Lastly the battery life on these is amazing. It lists 30 hours with ANC on in wireless mode. I've gone well over a 40 hours workweek without charging (but with ANC off all time). The passive noise control (just simply headphones on with ANC off) is quite nice alone and gets rid of most noise on its own. I highly recommend these headphones and couldn't be happier with my purchase. I've wasted so much $$ buying cheaper alternatives and them breaking or malfunctioning that in the end these will become a very good investment.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Wireless Over-Ear Headphones with ANC control

    ","Read and believe what you want on the internet--Amar Bose was NOT the pioneer of noise cancelling headphones (I sold all of Bose's audio products in college in the early '80's, and frankly Dr. Bose was not really the pioneer of much of anything...his passion for better sound and leading-edge engineering was certainly key to his success, but he was honestly more of a marketing genius than an acoustical physicist...RIP, Dr. Bose).I have purchased and tried just about every noise cancelling headphone since Sennheiser introduced their first offering (yes, it was before Bose introduced their ubiquitous, mass-marketed products). And while in recent years, Bose and Sennheiser have traded places as front runners in the NC headphone and NC IEM marketplace, my nod goes to the Sennheiser PXC-550 wireless over-the-ear headset. These headphones have the most natural frequency balance, soundstage, comfort, and versatility of any travel headphone I have ever tried. I currently own Sennheiser PXC-450's, Bose QuietComfort 20i IEMs, and some older models of both aforementioned brands that no longer rate any worthiness in my business travel kit.Without reservation, the Sennheiser PXC-550's are hands-down the best NC headphones I've ever tried. And the fact that they are also aptX Codec Bluetooth wireless (this is equivalent to red book CD-quality Bluetooth transmission--no current Bose wireless headphone can make that claim), the Sennheisers have a cool touch-sensitive pad on the right ear cup which provides volume adjustment, track forward and backward, multiple phone call and ""talk-through"" controls, AND a host of other awesome features too long to mention, the other headphones in this class just simply can't compete!!!. You can download a great customizable app for iPhone and Android phones, which adds even more versatility to an already well-conceived product. When enabled via the app, the headphones automatically pause your music if you remove them--very clever! The PXC-550s are also lighter and sexier than the latest Bose QC-35s.

    ","Bought these to replace my PXC 450's I purchased here on Amazon 7 years ago.  The 450's fit was excellent.  I wore them on 14-17 hour international flights at an average of 10 hours straight with the headphones on and never had a sore ear from the headphone cups.  Well the 450's just died and to get them repaired would cost almost half the price of a new pair of headphones.  (Be sure to read Sennheiser's warranty)I needed a new pair for a short domestic flight.  Yes, I hate being crammed into a little flying capsule with tons of strange people, and worse, having to listen to them.These 550's work awesome.  The ear cups felt a bit smaller than the 450's but still had a comfortable fit.  I loved the option of bluetooth or (supplied) wire connection.  When I travel by myself I sometimes use bluetooth but when I travel with my child we're always plugged into the computer watching movies using a splitter since they currently have wired headphones.  Great, great option you won't find on other higher end headphones.I'm no audiophile so hearing those subtle differences are irrelevant to me.  I just need to cancel out some noise, enjoy listening to a movie or music, have a fit that won't start bothering me a couple hours later and the nice option of bluetooth or wired.  The 550's met all those expectations.  The touch controls will need some practice.  I recommend practicing before your trip so finding the right spots to touch and slide won't be an issue during your trip.  Otherwise you'll be taking off the headphones and putting back on to find the right spots that control different features.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Forget the Bose.

    ","Picked these up a few weeks ago to use on a trip cross country, and the PCX 550s are a typical Sennheiser product, which can only be a good thing.While not an audiophile I hold sound quality near the top of my list.  No use spending three figures if the headphones sound like a $9 pair of JVCs.  Sound is clear.  Bass is hard and punchy, highs are tight and non fatiguing, and both without the kids getting lost.Build quality is solid, the deciding factor in choosing the PXC 550s over the all plastic HAD 4.50s.Noise cancelling is well done.  Adjustable, able to go from ""I can't be wearing closed back cans, am I?"" to complete isolation on a plane.You get a multitude of inputs, with Bluetooth, 3.5mm aux cord, and USB audio.  Through USB and Bluetooth, you get source controls through the touch pad on the right cup.  Which is useful in itself.The Android app let's you take full control of the sound aspects of the PCX 550, adding reverb to changing bass response.  These settings then seem to carry with the headphones.The only downside I've found so far is there doesn't seem to be a way to turn the headphones ""off"" when wearing them without waiting for the battery to drain, as the act of unfolding them turns them on.  The issue being if you have a decent DAC/amp and want to use these without anything in the signal path, no dice.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Sennheiser quality

    ","Having used this headset for going on 7 months, the PXC 550 has been amazing. I got it to use for travel, as a bluetooth headset for phone conversions, and as a noise canceling headset for watching movies, listening to music, and playing games/using skype. This headset has not disappointed in any of these uses. Great sound quality, the touchpad on the side works great after getting used to the gestures, and the bluetooth connectivity works very well. I use it with a Linux (Mint/Ubuntu based) operating system and it is supported perfectly as a USB sound device, working both as an output and an input (microphone) device. Unfortunately bluetooth headset functionality is still experimental and doesn't work 100% yet in Linux.I love that it has boomless microphones, it's way more stylish than a traditional boom mic headset. The noise cancellation is top notch. I have a window A/C unit that's only a couple feet from my head when I'm on my computer, and this headset blocks about 90% of that noise. I even use it when doing yardwork with gas powered implements. If you can swing the high cost, I can't recommend it enough!",5.0 out of 5 stars,the PXC 550 has been amazing.

    ","After much research I decided to go with the PXC550. I've been using them for a couple of months so I feel I can finally write a good review.Good: Bluetooth connection is very stable and headphones are super comfortable. Rich and detailed sound with good space. Noise reduction is effective, specially with low pitched noises (fans, bus, airplane). Battery life is amazing.Meh: Bass is tight but timid. These are not the best headphones for bass heavy music. Microphone for calls is mediocre to be honest, and when you are using it wirelessly Bluetooth enters into ""call mode"" which reduces audio quality even more. I'm not a fan of the on/off mechanism. I've drained the battery by forgetting to close them a couple of times.Bad: My biggest problem with these headphones is that the sound is fatiguing after a few hours of use. The Sennheiser Captune app is very limited. It only allows you to customise EQ on your phone when listening music from the app (not from Spotify or other apps). Since the headphones have a DSP chip installed it should be able to allow for custom EQ without the Captune app instead of the useless FX presets. That would greatly improve the lack of bass and brightness.My conclusion is that these are good headphones for listening to music at home, but are spectacular for watching movies and tv shows on your iPad or your TV (if it supports Bluetooth).If the Captune app allowed to add a custom EQ curve to the headphones themselves I would give these 4 stars instead of 3 because that would (in theory) fix the fatiguing sound and soft bass.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Fatiguing sound

    ","Very happy with this purchase. I was worried they would be too big, since I have a very small head, but on the smallest setting, they fit comfortably. I also wear glasses, and am pleased to report that I can wear these headphones all day long at work without getting any pain or discomfort around my ears, and the ear cups are big enough to fit all the way around my ears.Sound quality is great, as expected from Sennheiser. These sound as good as my wired Momentums, and the Bluetooth connection is pretty solid with my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Very minimal skipping, even when I am on a different floor and several rooms away from the phone (left the phone in my bedroom in a top corner of the house on the second floor, and it stays connected when I am in the kitchen on the first floor and opposite corner of the house). Activating the noise cancelling did not have any noticable degradation in sound quality for me, and it really does block out sounds. I was running the garbage disposal in the kitchen sink while listening to a podcast, and couldn't hear the disposal.I downloaded the CapTune app so that I could further customize the settings. With the app, you can turn off voice notification and other sounds. I turned off all the sounds so that I don't have to hear the voice telling me when devices are connected, or when the battery is low, and also to get rid of the little beeps it makes when you raise or lower the volume using the touch pad on the right ear piece.The touch controls do take some getting used to, and are a bit sensitive, so sometimes I want to skip a track, but end up accidentally pausing it instead. I expect I will get better at it with time, and I really like this feature.  Have not had any phone calls while wearing these yet, so can't comment on the phone call quality.Took one star off for superficial reasons - they are not very asthetically pleasing. They only come in one color (black), and the build looks rather cheap, in my opinion. Time will tell if they hold up, or fall apart. For now, these meet all of my qualifications, and I hope they will last.Update (09/11/2017): Well...these didn't really last very long. After 6 or 7 months of perfection, these headphones basically became unusable due to constant crackling when in Bluetooth mode. I contacted Sennheiser customer service, and they suggested that I try unpairing and re-pairing the headphones from my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 4). This did not help. The Sennheiser rep. said that the crackling problem was probably just because in urban areas there are lots of competing signals, etc.  The problem with this explanation is that the headphones worked beautifully for the first several months, and I have not moved to a new area, and the crackling happens no matter where I am, even if I am using them while hiking in a very isolated and rural area. The other problem with this explanation is that my much-less-expensive wireless BlueTooth earbuds ($40 range) work perfectly even when I'm in the city, without any crackling at all.  The crackling with the Sennheiser headphones started out of nowhere - there was no incident that could have caused it. The headphones have never been dropped or exposed to water or abused in any way. Very disappointed.Update 11/8/2017: I contacted Sennheiser customer service, and after suggesting a few solutions which did not fix the constant crackling/skipping, I sent them in for warranty repair/replacement. After a couple of weeks, I received a box containing a pair of headphones. There was no note or documentation beyond a small card that said the product was refurbished. So I guess they sent me a refurbished pair as a replacement? There was no explanation, and the return address was the name of a person, so it was unclear where the package even came from.  Anyway, just tried out the pair they sent me, and the cracking and skipping seems even worse on this pair than on my original. They are really just unusable. I'm not sure what to do at this point beyond maybe contacting customer service again and seeing if I can just get a refund.I love the sound quality of Senns, but they just do not last long. I previously purchased a pair of Momentum 2.0 (wired), which didn't even last a year before the cord went bad and sound was only coming out of one ear.  I think it is time for me to try another brand.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones (for a while...Edited review)

    ","I purchased the PXC-550 and the Momentum 2.0 wireless at the same time to compare the two.I am returning the Momentum 2.0 wireless.The PXC-550 just sounds better, the noise cancelling is noticeably superior, it has more useful features, is more comfortable, and is more compact. It is also arguably better looking.All testing was done using an iPhone 6+ with the Sennheiser CapTune software.  I listen to everything from European Viking/black/pagan metal, Trance, Dubstep, Indie, 90's Alternative, Classic rock, Chopped-n-screwed rap, and lots of Beatles (they have the best stereo effects, especially with headphones).PXC-550I received the PXC-550 first.  Connecting to Bluetooth was simple and sounds good enough for casual listening, though I can tell the sound improves through the hardwire connection.  This is my first wireless headphone and there is something liberating about the lack of wires, and getting tangled up in them.  I like the touch controls and have only accidentally skipped tracks a couple times.  Probably the best part of the touch controls is just tapping it to pause the music when you need to concentrate, talk to someone, or take them off.  One thing about the touch controls that is slightly annoying is whenever I turn the headphones off or disconnect from a source (go from Bluetooth to hardwire), the volume resets to a pre-set medium/low setting, and I have to flick up to get them loud/where I like them again.  THESE HEADPHONES ARE EXQUISITELY COMFORTABLE!  I wear them for hours and hours and just forget they are on.  No pressure from the headband, which has nice soft padding.  The ""holes"" your ears go into the cups seem small, but they are ear shaped and has been no problem at all.  I think my outer ears may be touching the pads, but it is so ergonomic and soft that it feels good, like wearing very nice earmuffs.  I'll be honest: I like having these on my head than not!  FYI: I am a 5'11' man with normal ear size for my build.  I am onboard an aircraft carrier, and between the loud ventilation, server racks with multiple cooling fans, plus aircraft taking off and landing right above me, they do a great job of cutting down the noise to a barely audible ""fffffff"" in my workshop.  I will say that they don't handle wind very well.  One of the air conditioners in my shop blows right on me, and it seems to cause the noise-cancelling some fits and oscillations if the breeze hits the headphone's ambient audio sensors at a particular angle.  It sounds like a low, dull, midbass flutter.  I turn this AC unit off due to this reason, plus it gets way too cold in here!  These headphones fold up into a small travel case that can easily be thrown in my backpack.  One feature that I LOVE is the auto turn-off when I take them off and rotate the earcups.  Way smarter than an on/off switch that you can forget to do.  The CapTune app is pretty cool, and lately I've been using it more than the regular iPhone Music app.  It features several great adjustable equalizers, allows you to customize the controls.  It also allows you to access a ""Director"" mode, where you can modify Boost, Spatial, Reverb, and DLC.  Playing with these can make the headphones sound either interesting or simply BETTER, depending on what you are listening to.  The ""SoundCheck"" mode will give you a choice between 2 EQ curves.  You click ""A"" and hear the music and see one curve, or click ""B"" and hear it through another curve.  You just select the one you prefer, and after choosing between 10 pairs of EQ curves, CapTune combines them all into your preferred EQ curve.  I found the results generally pleasing (it is now my default EQ curve). The overall sound quality, even with the EQ on FLAT, I would best describe as ""smooth"". These aren't bass cannons, or reference headphones.  But they never hurt my ears, and I have sensitive ears.  Super shrill and loud upper mids can send my ears into a crackly convulsion.  However, I do enjoy my music LOUD.  I wish these headphones would get louder than they do, but they get as loud as I probably need.  Any more and I'm probably not doing much service to my long-term hearing.MOMENTUM 2.0 WIRELESSI bought the Momentums thinking I'd prefer them over the 550s.  They look to have an AWESOME build quality, and they do.  I ordered the ivory edition with the brown leather headband.  I was a bit put-off with the ivory color, which looks more yellow in person than the white-ish it did online.  The first thing I noticed was the box was much bigger than the 550s.  Opening it revealed the travel case, which is easily twice as big as the 550's (not nearly as portable).  I opened the case to reveal the headphones.  Touching them, the ear pads feel almost gooey... they are that soft.  However, they just don't feel right when I put them on, and they don't seem to cover my ears completely.  Perhaps it is because they are oval, and the 550s are ""egg"" shaped?  The headband is not comfortable at all and causes me discomfort, and I usually don't complain about that with any headphone.  From the moment I turned on the Momentums, their upper-midrange was so shrill it caused my right ear to go into a crackly seizure until I turned the volume way down.  It's like the upper-midrange is boosted.  Or maybe I'm too used to V-shaped frequency responses?  Either way, I don't like it and it is painful.  No amount of EQ adjustments using the CapTune iPhone software could get the Momentums to sound as smooth as the 550s.  However, the bass on the Momentums seems punchier overall than the 550s.  Another bummer I discovered while trying to sort-out the painful mids was the ""Director"" options are not available with the Momentums.  Apparently, that is a PXC-550 only option.  I have also noticed that the noise cancelling does not seem to be as effective as with the 550s, but I do not notice as much wind buffeting.  I actually had to check if the Momentum's noise cancelling was working, or if it was the effect of over-ear headphones muffling the noise.  To turn on or off the headphones, you have to find and hold down the small button for several seconds.If the Momentums sounded like the 550's, and had the same electronic features, I would love to keep them.  But as it is, they are being returned.  They were a big disappointment.",5.0 out of 5 stars,SENNHEISER PXC 550 vs MOMENTUM 2.0

    ","I can say without hesitation that the new Sennheiser PXC 550 is the best Bluetooth headphone available today.  Best audiophile quality, best comfort.  Surprisingly it does not have the dark, warm Sennheiser sound signature; instead, it's bright, clear and highly detailed.  It's not lacking in bass but maybe just needs more break-in to unleash its natural warmth.  Right out of the box it can sound a bit too clean and analytical to these ears.  The Lossless tracks I used were ""Stravinsky Firebird finale"" (Boulez), ""Nutcracker Waltz"" (Solti, CSO), ""Mozart Piano Sonata K.330 (Uchida)"" , and ""Capriccio- moonlight music"" (Te Kanawa/Vienna Phil)....on a Gen-7 iPod Nano.  Having heard the same tracks on my SONY (1ABT, 10RBT) and a borrowed Bose Q35, I was blown away by the clarity and detail of the 550 that the others could not match.That it does active noise-cancellation as well is a bonus that I appreciate but probably will not use often.  Like my other (wired) Sennheiser HD 600, the 550 is also exceedingly comfortable to wear for long periods.  The Sony 1ABT's earcups are larger but surprisingly do not fit as well as the 550 and it's also quite bulky.The Sennheiser PXC 550 is my new benchmark in portable headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Trumps Sony 1ABT, 10RBT and Bose in my A-B tests"

    ","Liking it so far. It arrived yesterday afternoon.Took 2 or 3 hours to charge. I recommend charging overnight if you plan on charging regularly. But on the bright side, they are still at 100% according to the optional CapTune app, which lets me choose whether I want it to tell me things by voice, just beeps, not even beeps, what level I want adaptive noise cancellation to be, if I want a custom sound profile, and so on.The headband kinda hurt to wear at first. Then I adjusted it on either side, and it seems fine to me now. I even fell asleep in a recliner with it last night, without realizing it until I got up later.Noise cancelling is strong and has so far made no practical difference to me over Bose QC25, except those broke and needed Post-It notes to fix twice, and this seems sturdier to me thus far. I like it being Bluetooth. Convenient.As with all ANC headphones, it's not going to block voices as well as regular background stuff, but I have a loud, squealy coworker who makes me want to take whatever protection I can get. It does a good job of shutting out background noise, and muffles the coworker's noises.The touchpad is very sensitive, but I haven't had more than minor fumbles (pausing when I want to do something  else) but I can learn, it hasn't  been too annoying, and I like the double-tap to hear everything around you feature.Side note: Do get yourself the PDF instruction manual and skim it- you learn what to expect from it in different situations that way. In fact, cautious shoppers, go ahead and skim that now and see if it has any behaviors or implementations thereof that you don't like, or wish were different. This wants you to fiddle with it a bit initially, unlike Bose, but you can dial it in to your personal preferences waaay better than Bose as a result.Update - August 25: Still loving it. Only had to charge it twice so far. Works well with Bluetooth even in a SUPER crowded wireless environment (150+ wi-fi connected devices and 9 access points, with 40-ish Bluetooth devices in the same office room).Is so cozy I've worn it to bed once or twice, and drifted off while listening to shows on my phone (which would itself be on the other side of the room, charging). Just don't roll on your side if you're going to emulate me, of course- they're still bulky if light earcups.They have also saved my bacon around the office. Turning noise cancelling on or off with a double tap is a lifesaver when near the loudest people in the solar system.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Classy headset- this techie enjoys it

After about a year of using the QC35s, I decided to give the PXC 550s a try. I had been experiencing connectivity issues with the Bose headphones. I was simply unable to connect them to my brand new Samsung TV, despite the fact that they had no issue connecting to my older model Samsung.The PXCs connected to the Samsung immediately, and I have not had a single connectivity issue with them. They are also really, reallycomfortable. The controls were a little confusing at first to get the hang of, but after about an hour of use everything starts to make sense. My only complaint is that the volume on these isn't as loud as I would like when paired with my TV. That was also an issue with my previous pair of Sennheiser Momentum 2.0s. Overall, these are great. The noise canceling is very similar in quality to the QC35s--I haven't really noticed any difference. I recommend these headphones. They're a bit more expensive than they should be in my opinion, but otherwise there is little to complain about here.After a month of use, I wanted to update my review. I've knocked off one star because these headphones take FOREVER to reach a full charge. Over 24 hours. Not sure if my pair is a dud on this front, but either way, unacceptable. The Bose QC35s charge lightning fast. I also never noticed any charging issues with my older Sennheiser Momentum 2.0. If I don't plug these in first thing each morning, they'll eventually die while I'm watching TV with them at night.After 2 months of use, I've decided to update my review once again. The charging issue aside, the biggest concern with these headphones is that they just don't get loud enough. When paired with my TV, I can barely hear with the loudest volume setting on. It's simply unacceptable. Furthermore, the quality of the noise canceling just isn't on par with the Bose QC 35s, which I also use regularly. Lastly, these are not even close to as comfortable as the QC 35s.Bottom line, save your money and by the QC 35s, which are cheaper and just better overall.;",2.0 out of 5 stars,Unsatisfied after 2 Months

    ","So these are pretty big step up for me. I generally buy headphones in the $100 range and I can definitely tell the difference in overall build quality as well as sound. I somewhat like the twist to turn on feature but I worry it won't last as some reviewers have said. The touch controls work great for volume and skip but not so well for play/pause. The over-ear fit and comfort are fantastic for me. I have pretty big ears and have no issues.The major complaint I have is the voice-lady says ""recharge headset"" when the battery hits 20% (according to the on-screen display, nice feature). Now if she just said it once I would be happy. My Sony headset used to just die without warning so this is great. Trouble is, she says it every five minutes! These things advertise a 30-hour battery life so 20% means for 6 hours I am going to be badgered about recharging every five minutes?!? That's ridiculous. I should be able to enjoy the full charge of the battery without being constantly badgered. Who thought this was a good idea??",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great with one (major) complaint.

    ","I tried different high quality brands of headphones for noise cancellation/sound quality over the past few months. The Bose QuietComfort 35s are a nice set, but the build feels cheap, the noise isolation great, and the sound very ho-hum. Sony 1000X are nice, but the look bulges off the head and looks alien.Then I tried the Sennheiser PXC 550. The sound quality is SUPERB, the noise isolation is better than the Bose (Really. I put my head next to an air conditioner vent and music still sounded angelic). The build quality is so well thought out with every button placed in a very convenient spot – all flush against the housing and sleek. When you put them on the feel incredible and don't protrude from the head nearly as much as the Sony's.I didn't think a brand could beat the Bose QC35s across the board, but these pair of Sennheisers are meticulously crafted and will be my primary cans moving forward.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best in Class

    ","I bought these to replace my dying Bose QC25s. The bluetooth connection is strong, and the audio quality is excellent. The sound cancellation is *almost* as good as the QC35's. However the sound quality more than makes up for the sound cancellation.The touch functionality on the side is a godsend, as using gestures works 99% of the time without me having to fumble for buttons or pull my phone out to adjust volume or pause/play.These feel well built, and I have used them for 8 hours a day, every day since having them. The band holds onto your head nicely without adding what I call a dent in my hair. The pads are also extremely comfortable, if not a little warm after a few hours of use. Call quality is above average, and the mic picks up your voice without picking up any ambient noise going on around you.The ladies voice is a little loud for my taste, and she scares me every time she tells me battery is low, but it is nothing major.The battery life is around 26 hours with my listening, and to me that is more than fair when you consider the weight and size of these.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Deciding between the QC35s and these?

When I use it while driving, my vehicle seems like a high end Lexus! Very convenient to have the calling features as well, and people tell me my voice sounds very good.

    ","The Good:Fantastic sound quality. Very balanced with great dynamic range. Plenty of bass but not an unnatural hump. They can play dubstep and classical music equally well. The flexibility of being able to use them with bluetooth, bluetooth aptx, wired headphone jack, or wired USB audio has come in handy and I've used all of them. The battery life is stupendous and they charge extraordinarily fast so I've never been without them when I needed them.The Bad:The interface is not particularly intuitive. I have to look up how to pair them when I have to (which is too often, more on that later). You can charge them while using them, but if you do it will keep giving you the audible notice that the battery is low even once it is full until you turn them off and back on again.The biggest problem though will likely relegate these to a secondary pair despite their sound quality. They say they will connect to multiple devices at once, but this isn't really true. When connected to both my phone and my computer at the office there is some interference caused between them that causes both me and the other side of a call to cut in and out. Disconnecting the other device usually clears up the problem, though sometimes I must turn them off and back on again with only one bluetooth device on to make them work. They also will often do what I assume is them connecting to my computer in the wrong sample rate and all the voices will be lower as if they are slowed down and then skip ahead every couple of seconds. Again, I have to turn them off and back on in order for them to work. It will also often only take one call before the next time my devices will refuse to switch to the headphones until I reboot them. I thought maybe this was my device, but the problem has carried across two phones and my computer when I try to use skype or similar.It is really disappointing to get such terrible electronics in an otherwise very fine pair of headphones. The problems are consistent enough that I really can't count on them for use in taking phone calls so I end up ripping them off quickly whenever my phone rings because 50% of the time my voice will be garbled.So, I can only recommend these if you intend to use them with a single device. If you want to connect to two devices then these will not work well with either one and you should pick another set. I expect more from Sennheiser and at this price I feel like 3 stars is generous for such a major flaw, so I'm going with 2.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sound but the Electronics are a Deal Breaker

    ","Absolutely love these.  Sent my Bose Q35's back as they were too big and slip down the back of my head while running.  The Sennheisers fit like a glove.  The pads around the ears are angled appropriately and so super soft and squishy.  The padding at the top is the same.  They rarely slip.  Love love love the touch controls.  My only 1/4 complaint is that they shut off by themselves when you are doing upside down moves like downward dog in Yoga.  Fortunately it only takes a tap to get them back on.  They sound great but have a volume limiter just like the Bose Q35. Sometimes you just like your music loud (AC/DC) and you are not going to get there with these either.  You do sweat with these too even if you aren't working out.  Sooner or later, if the room/atmosphere is warm enough you will sweat.  I wipe them down at least once every 15 minutes(while working out) and air dry them for 15-30 minutes after.  (I want them to last forever) As far as the noise cancelling goes, the Bose are much better, IMO.  I can still hear everything around me with these but that isn't why I bought them so no deal breaker for me.  I wanted headphones that wouldn't fall out of my ears or off my head while working out and these are perfect.  A little pricy, but super duper comfy, fit well, sound great, easy to use, and I really love them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A little pricy, but super duper comfy, fit well, sound great, easy to use, and I absolutely love them."

    ","I sent the PXC 550s back and kept the HD1s.First off, nobody paid me for this review. I am just an amateur audiophile looking for nice bluetooth cans, with the added twist that I work in a call center and would like to use them there. This is why I immediately ruled out the Bose QC35s and the Sony 1000's, because they can ONLY CONNECT TO ONE BLUETOOTH DEVICE AT A TIME. In 2018 that's just not acceptable to me.I started with a pair of Sennheiser HD570 wired headphones 15 years ago and these really set the standard for me. Fantastic audio quality and total comfort. I included them in this review just for fun. I bought the PXC 550 and HD1 over-ear (not the on-ear model) which is basically a rebranding of the Momentum 2.0 from what I understand. I tested all three, the two new bluetooth headphones and my old trusty wired ones.PRICE: PXC 550 ($300), HD1 ($350) as of Feb 2018.COMFORT (Winner: PXC550): The HD1s have ever so slightly larger inner diameter on the cups and it makes things ever so slightly better. I don't have weird ears or anything, pretty normal size and shape. The wired HD570s that I have from 15 years ago are still the epitome of comfort. Sennheiser absolutely nailed it with those. Granted they aren't bluetooth but I still ran them in the comparison here. The PXC 550 synthetic material earpads were actually a little comfier than the leather HD1 pads but they were smaller. The headband on the PXC550s is superior because it's padded and the HD1s aren't. This didn't bother me much but I wanted to point it out. The HD1s are sort of noticeable on my head when I first put them on, whereas the PXC550s seem to fit like a glove immediately. It feels like the HD1s just weigh a bit more or something. Yet after wearing the HD1s for an hour or two, I don't notice them anymore.NOISE CANCELLATION (Winner: HD1): Both headphones have the talk-through feature for calls which I personally like, but I have heard some occasional low level rumbling or popping on the PXC550s with the noise cancelling on, whereas the HD1s are silent. Both do a very good job with noise cancellation overall.CALL QUALITY (Winner: PXC 550): There is no mute button on the HD1, there is a touchpad gesture for this on the PXC550. Numerous people have all said, when I asked for their opinion, that they could hear me more loudly/clearly on the PXC550s than the HD1. They never outright complained about the call quality when I used the HD1s but when I called back and forth with each headset the pattern was demonstrable. The PXC550s do occasionally blurt out ""call ended"" while I was on a conference call with my Macbook Pro 15""/2015/Webex. It never ended the call, but it is startling and seems like a loose end that needs to be tied up. Still, I think the PXC550s win here.AUDIO QUALITY (Winner: HD1): This is where I saw the biggest difference between the two headsets. If you like rap or you listen to music at a very low volume, buy the PXC550s because they are very bass-heavy. If you like accuracy, get the HD1s. The soundstage was far more alive on the HD1s than the PXC550s. The HD1 stereo separation is better and they sound brighter, yet I don't think they were shrill. The HD1s remind me why I like my ancient Onkyo Integra amp, so if you've listened to one of those then you know what I'm talking about. It's exactly like that. The PXC550s sounded great but with the HD1s available for side-by-side testing there wasn't really any question about the winner here. The bass notes are all present and accurate on the HD1s but it doesn't define the whole experience the way it does on the PXC550s. The HD1s are more on par with my HD570s. Crisp and balanced. Over and over I swapped them for comparison and the result was the same.USABILITY (Winner: PXC550 if portability is critical, otherwise the HD1): I found the touchpad controls on the PXC550s to be more annoying than regular old buttons. I liken it a bit to the Apple TV Gen 4 remote control. It seems like a good idea but when you get your hands up there to touch it, sometimes you swipe and nothing happens, or there's a slight lag, so you're not always sure exactly what's happening. Also the motion of aiming your hand in the air and hoping you ""nail the landing"" on the PXC 550 pad adds a level of awkwardness. Worse, sometimes I would try to adjust the PXC550s on my head and accidentally touch the pad, which isn't hard to do. This would pause the music or hang up the call. I got in the habit of being careful how I touched the PXC550s. The HD1s just have a multifunction button that I find simpler and more accurate to use. For portability the PXC550s are the winner. They turn on and off by twisting them in a way that feels unnatural, but I got used to it and they are slimmer to transport. The HD1s fold in a more natural way and have a traditional on/off button, but they are bulkier. Both cans come with a wired cord in case the batteries die. Both cords felt pretty cheap. The HD1 cord twists securely into the headphones and the PXC550 doesn't. The PXC550 cord has an inline volume control, the HD1 doesn't. Audio quality when corded didn't change notably over bluetooth, interestingly enough.STYLE (Winner: HD1): The PXC550s look really good but let's be honest here, the HD1s in brown leather/ivory are gorgeous.  They remind me of some retro cans or like the old headsets from an airplane. Style wasn't that important to me, but they do look good.CAPTUNE IPHONE APP: I don't see the point. The EQ doesn't seem to work unless I give it access to my music library etc etc, and I'm not going to do that. So I didn't test it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser HD1 (Momentum 2.0) Over-ear versus PXC 550 versus HD570

    ","My use case for purchasing these were to walk my dogs along urban streets while listening to podcasts and being on work conference calls where I mainly have to listen but only occasionally have to speak.  I've used wired over-the-ear headphones for dog walking, but the wire always gets in the way when I'm bending over to pick up dog poop, and eventually the wire connectors tend to break from the strain.Let me start with the bad first.  Unlike many other over-the-ear headphones where the ear pads are circular (such as TASCAM TH-02 wired headphones) or oval, the bottom part of the Sennheiser PXC 550 ear pads are a narrow ""V"" pattern.  I am of normal height for a man and I believe my ears are normal sized, and I've never had an issue with over-the-ear headphone ear pads before, but the bottom of my left ear was a little uncomfortable with the ear pads.  After a week or two of using the PXC 550, I've learned to ignore the feeling, but it certainly is still there.  I can't imagine falling asleep on an airplane wearing these due to this issue, but fortunately that is not my use case.The rest of the review is the good parts.  Active noise cancelling is fine, I can now enjoy podcasts on city street sidewalks that are unlistenable with standard iPhone earbuds (I have no real comparison with other ANC headphones).  There is no weird ""whistle"" or ""hum"", the ANC itself is quiet.  Functionally for my use case is excellent.  The right ear touchpad lets me easily mute and un-mute conference calls, plus volume up & volume down is easy as well.  The ""double tap"" to turn off ANC and turn on ""hear through"" is also great, I use this when meeting other people walking their dogs to ask if their dogs are friendly enough to greet mine.  Some people say they don't like the headphone voice telling them ""power on...mute on...mute off...power off"", but I really like the positive feedback from the system!The microphones seem to work OK, people seem to understand me on calls and I haven't had anyone complain about my speech quality, but I have to admit that I'm not expecting quality like a boom mic in front of my mouth, and when I need to talk on a conference call I walk the dogs down a quieter side street.I occasionally get some garbled Bluetooth when I am inside in an environment with a lot of contention for the 2.4 GHz band (other Bluetooth devices, WiFi, etc.).  I find that doing ""volume up"" or ""volume down"" seems to clear up that problem.  Hard to know if this is a problem with the PXC 550 or my iPhone.  I never have that problem outside.I think there would be a great market for after-market ear pads that are wider on the bottom.  Not sure if that would have a negative impact on the active noise cancelling though.Overall, my dogs are happy that I have more time to walk them in the morning as I am no longer chained inside for conference calls, and at night I can enjoy the Revolutions podcast while walking the dogs.[Update - after several weeks, my left ear has become used to the ear pad, and I don't really notice it any more.  These are really great.  The only issue is that once I accidently put them on backwards and no one could hear me talk on a conference call.  If you put them on backwards, the directional mics are not going to pick up your voice!]",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great functionality, ear pads a bit small on the bottom"

    ","There are so many things that a good pair of headphones has to satisfy today: Connectivity, comfort, sound quality, convenience. The PXC-550 gets closer to perfect (for me) as any other headphone in this price bracket.-- Connectivity. Bluetooth (of course), but the PXC-550 are smart enough to connect to multiple devices and seamlessly switch back and forth depending on which one is playing music. They are even smart enough to switch from my Apple TV to my iPhone when I get an incoming call. But you also get analog audio (hey, some of us still have headphone jacks) or USB audio (with simultaneous charging). The microphones work well with all connection options, so they are pretty good as gaming headphones as well.-- Comfort. Unlike my previous reference (Ultimate Ears UE9000) these 'phones can be worn all day. You really hardly notice them, even after several hours of listening. The noise cancellation is excellent, and seems to avoid the strange ""pressure"" feel you get from some active noise cancelling phones.-- Sound Quality. These 'phones are never going to compete with high-end audiophile headphones (at $$$ more), but the sound is well balanced, with good clarity in the mid-range, and bass when you need it without the bloat so common in other brands (Beats, I'm looking at you...). If you are used to ear-buds, even expensive ones, these 'phones should be an eye-opener to you.-- Convenience. They fold up like origami to fit in the reasonably small carrying case, which provides pretty good protection for lugging in a backpack, and also has room for the cables and adapters. Battery life is pretty good; I've not measured it, but I'm so used to them just working that I'm always surprised when they need charging (""oh yes, it HAS been a long time...""). The simple spoken audio prompts for many functions also make using the phones much easier than the mysterious beeps and pings from other products.Why not 5 stars then? Well, the touch pad controls are a bit eccentric. Deliberate taps are often missed, but the slightest tap when taking the phones off can sometimes trigger play/pause, which can be annoying. As with so many other phones, decoding the meaning of the various LED flashes requires checking the manual.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nearly Perfect

    ","Pros: amazing sound quality. Great noise cancelation. Light-weight. Convenient to use (just twist earmuffs to turn on/off). Packed with features on the accompanying app like auto-pause when headphones removed from head, as well as different equalizer presets and sound effects.Cons: headphones occasionally pause for no apparent reason (no, auto-pause feature isn't enabled), and auto-pause is pretty finicky which is why I have it disabled; even a slight shifting of the headphones will sometimes trigger it. The TouchPad is also finicky and works right only most of the time (side note: it's not terribly difficult to accidentally scratch). I also get high-pitched, incredibly loud squeals in one or both earmuffs; what I believe to be a malfunction of the noise cancelation.

    ","I'll leave the evaluation of this headset audio performance to others, as I don't have a final opinion on that yet. Onto Bluetooth then.The PXC 550 can memorize up to 10 devices and connect to 2 simultaneously. For instance, I can listen to Netflix on a computer and the sound will automatically and seamlessly switch to my phone if I make or receive a call then revert to the computer once I hang up. This also works manually: starting any audio source on the phone will switch the headphones to it, and subsequently starting one on the computer will switch the headphones back to the computer. Similarly, the PXC 550 does not have a start button, the earpads rotate flat to store the headset, and simply rotating them into listening position starts Bluetooth and automatically connects to the first two paired devices it detects.Limitations:1. If the PXC 550 headset is already connected to two Bluetooth devices it will reject connection attempts by a 3rd one, even manually initiated, so you need to first disconnect an existing device beforehand.2. If two phones are connected to the headphones and the first phone is on a call while the second phone attempts to make a call, phone1 retains ownership of the connection and phone2 will simply have no sound (or at least that's the case in my attempt with phone2 running Android 8.1). The problem may not be immediately obvious to the phone2 owner, who may not have noticed the phone automatically connecting to the headset, as call connections are initially silent.3. The Sennheiser PXC 550 headset supports the AptX codec, a superior alternative to the (very) limited A2DP Bluetooth profile. However, it doesn't support the more modern AptX HD codec, or the excellent LDAC alternative that Sony donated to the Android Open Source Project, starting with Android 8.04. While not directly Bluetooth related, taping the right earpad to pause/resume/previous/next/deactivate-noise-cancelling/volume-up/volume-down is very convenient. However, the finger tap detection doesn't work 100% of the time (finger slides are more accurately detected).",4.0 out of 5 stars,Review of the Bluetooth Implementation

    ","These are great headphones.They come with a good case and everything needed, cable-wise, except for a charging plug, which isn't exactly hard to find nor expensive.  Charge times seem a little long to me (3 or 4 hours), but then the charge will last through many hours of use.Sound quality is excellent.  Plenty enough bass, but not bass-heavy--I'm not a fan of bass-heavy sound anyway.Noise cancellation is very good.  I can't compare to the Bose's since I've not used them, but I'd bet these are about as good.  Noise cancellation doesn't block all outside sounds (and it never will because, if nothing else, your body will itself transmit some sounds), but when playing music/video especially, you'll really appreciate how much isolation it provides.The headphones are very comfortable on the ears and can be worn for hours... though your ears will get a little warm.The controls are okay.  The touch pad can sometimes be triggered accidentally if you're laying down or put your hands behind your head, but not a big problem.  Remembering and properly performing all of the taps, double taps, slides, hold taps, etc. etc. etc., however, is sometimes more challenging than I'd like--there is a lot of functionality tied up in that touch pad.Bluetooth connects easily enough.  Supposedly can keep up with several devices and will connect with two devices at once... though it won't play from both connections simultaneously--one or the other will play--and depending upon what's connected and playing, it may not switch well between the two.  However, this is a limitation of the Bluetooth standard, not the headphones themselves.Downloadable app for sound customization and turning on/off a couple of features is meh... not as user-friendly as it could be... sorta confusing actually.All in all, if you can get them at a Black Friday discount, I highly recommend.  At the full $400 price... hmm... not sure any headphones are really worth that much.",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great headphones.

    ","The sound on these is great.  Better than my Beats headphones.  Not sure how they'd compare to Bose or the Sony's in the same price range. I wouldn't pay $400 for them, but at $350 they are about right.  Features that made me choose these over the better rated Bose and Sony Bluetooth equivalents:  1) ability to connect to 2 devices - the switching between my PC and phone is really seamless and requires no intervention from me. 2) the touch/gesture features.  Also very comfortable and great mic for phone calls from what people tell me who are listening.  On the last one, though, they are 'touchy'.  you can accidentally drop a call by grazing the ear cup, as others have said.  All in all, not bad.  But if Sony or Bose had the same Bluetooth multi-device support, I'd go for one with better noise cancelling.  These aren't bad, mind you, however you still get some leakage from ambient noise.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound on these is great. Better than my Beats headphones

    ","Great sound. Very stylish. The on/off mechanism - rotating the ear-cups - is a concern. I am not sure how durable they will be because of frequent turning of ear-cups. Was it really so difficult to give users an option to switch them off, say, in their  official app - CapTune?I am impressed with noise cancellation, but I have never used noise-cancelling headphones before, so no comparisons here.Speaking of comfort, I find them a bit tiresome to wear, but 1) they are still new and the fit will relax in the future; and 2) I have a larger than average head.Can be paired with two devices simultaneously.

    ","After listening to the highest end offerings for Wireless/Noise canceling headphones from Sony, Sennheiser and Bose, I chose the Sennheiser PXC 550 due to the audiophile sound, comfort, and build quality.  I  travel occasionally so the noise canceling, though important, was not a major factor in my choice but happy to hear that it does work well on the PXC550. However, I would give Bose the edge in noise canceling by only a bit.  The Sony and Bose Audiophile sound quality was good but Sennheiser is, by a large degree, better in that area and that was my primary choice factor.  The wireless function syncs quickly and seamlessly with all my devices.  I rated the PXC550 5 stars with only one minor complaint.  The touch pad control is a bit more challenging to use than a button or dial would be.  Sometimes I have to swipe two or three times to activate a function. I'll probably get better at it I as use them more.  Other than that I truly love these headphones and positive I made the right choice.  PS they came already charged and ready to use right out of the box. I bought 2more of these recently as gifts for my daughter and son-in-law who are discriminating techno geeks and they absolutely loved them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"PXC 550 -built to last, with comfort, and great audiophile quality sound. Best of the Best wireless, noise canceling headphones."
43,"on April 2, 2018",,"I bought these for work to break free from the wire of my HD598 Cs. Seeing as how this is bluetooth, I didn't expect the sound quality to be up there alongside my HD598s, but it's still great quality! I'm no audiophile however, or if I am, I am a novice.The bluetooth function is a bit hard to pair as the initial pair is supposed to happen automatically by connecting to the headphones from your phone or whatever device. I ended up just holding the button for different preset sound profiles for 4 seconds (in included instructions/handbook..page) to force the headphones to pair to my phone normally. Furthermore, there is a lighted 5-dot battery-level indicator that lights up when you initially turn these on or plug em in via a typical Android charging cable (NOT USB-C). When the battery level reaches around 2 dots, I've noticed some random intermittent interference-like effect in the middle of songs. It's like when you have your car radio on but you drive through an area of with no reception for your particular radio station: quick but noticeable and eventually irritating.I've worn these all day long before at work (9 hour days) and have felt no discomfort. That being said, I do have a smaller/narrower head than most. Compared to the QC35 (tried my coworker's), I find this to be more comfortable. However, if you have a wide or big head, these may be uncomfortable due to the pressure of the headphones trying to push inward on a larger head. Also keep in mind that due to how noise canceling works, you may feel disoriented if you turn on active noise cancellation without any music playing.The controls were pretty easy to learn. I'm not sure why others have such a hard time learning them; they're pretty straight-forward. That being said, I never learned how to answer or reject phone calls. Maybe that's where others are having trouble?Few things to note about the controls though: (1) it is dependent on the angle of the headphones. For example if they're tilted enough, a side swipe will register as a volume swipe due to the angle. (2) You have to do it fairly slowly. If you do anything but pause the music too quickly, the headphones will only register a tap, which will just pause the music. (3) A double tap allows you to head 'normally'. I say 'normally' because it sounds a bit like you're hearing through a tin can, but it's pretty cool and useful; no need to take off your headphones whenever someone needs to grab your attention.Another thing to keep in mind: the normalized sound on the headphones may not correlate to what you have on your phone. I recently switched from a Moto G4Plus to an HTC U11, and how volume is controlled is a bit odd on the U11. On the G4 Plus, swiping up or down will actively change the volume on the phone as well. On the U11, however, the base volume will be set to whatever you already have preset on your U11. Swiping up or down does not change the volume settings on the phone at all but will change the volume on the headphones. In other words, you can change the volume on the headphones to the upper limit then change the volume on the U11 and the resulting volume will be twice as high as it should be.Overall, I love these. They have quite a long range and are close enough to the HD598s in terms of quality for me. Did I also mention it was cheaper than the competition too (Sony's flagship and Bose's flagship)? At least it was for me ($300). I can wear these all day long without any issues, and I am completely satisfied with the purchase. However if you are a full-fledged audiophile to the deepest part of your soul, I doubt you will like these at all.I should also mention that I've been using these for two months now. No issues (yet).*** If you have not bought these yet but are considering to do so, check the ""Used"" ones. Apparently with these you cannot sell them as new unless you are Sennheiser or the like, so 3rd party sellers will list brand new headphones as ""Used - New"".",5.0 out of 5 stars,but it's still great quality! I'm no audiophile however
44,"on April 13, 2018",,"I have and like Bose Soundlink minis and a pair of their noise cancelling earphones. I decided to try their popular over-the-ear noice cancelling headphones and was struck by how suppressed the sound seems. You get used to it, and then it does actually sound fine while you're listening, and the noice cancelling is good, but when the bluetooth drop-outs start, they don't stop. Very frustrating.Looking around some more, I found these. I've known about the Sennheiser brand for a long time, and trust them for sound quality, but wasn't sure about them as an electronics company. But, at $30 less than the leading competitors, and a good chance at superior sound, I figured I'd give them a try. Great idea.Their app is better, the touch controls are actually pretty good, and the sound is definitely better. I'll be keeping these. The one complaint I have is with the auto-pause feature. Great idea. However, it should only work when I take the headphones off or off one ear. If I tilt my head or lean back to drink something out of a glass, the music pauses or a call goes on hold and I miss part of the conversation. That's a fixable problem, so hopefully it gets addressed with an update. In the meantime I have turned the feature off and will have to remember to manually pause to the music when I remove the headphones.On a similar note, people have mentioned that there is no power button. True: You turn off the power by rotating the ear piece until you hear the click. This sort of stuff is all in the very basic quick start guide provided in the packaging. Please read that information before criticizing a product in a review on Amazon so as to avoid misleading potential customers like me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,So much happier with these than the Bose QC 35 II.

    ","The active noise cancelling is nearly on par with Bose's Quiet Comfort 35, while the sound quality and comfort (particularly when wearing for long periods of time) are far superior. The touchpad controls take some getting used to, but end up being a really neat feature. At this price point, and for $50-$100 above it, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better set of headphones.If your first priority is noise cancellation and sound quality/comfort are very distant second/third place, Bose QC 35 are perhaps the better choice since there is still a slight gap in ANC. If you consider other features such as sound quality, comfort, and bluetooth connectivity of nearly equal importance to ANC, and certainly if ANC is not a priority, I would argue that the Sennheiser PXC 550 is an absolute no-brainer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,while the sound quality and comfort (particularly when wearing for long periods of time) are far superior.

    ","I have both the Bose QC35 and the PXC550. Having been used to the Bose, the first 2 things I noticed was that the PXC feels tighter vs the Bose that has a more comfortable grip. However when it comes to sound quality, the PXC has a noticeably wider spectrum and sound clarity. It’s almost analogies to the difference between a DVD vs. Blu-ray.Noise cancellation is similar between the two headphones.There are things that I like the Bose better such as on-off switch vs turning the cups on the PXC and the carry case.However, for me the sound spectrum and voice clarity justifies keeping the PXC.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Shines on sound spectrum and sound clarity
47,"on October 31, 2017",,"Purchased just over a year ago. I will not claim to be an audiophile or have tested these against anything else. But, I can tell you about my experience (review may be all over the place, I'm writing as things come to mind that I find important).I have a larger than average head and ears. So, to start, these fit very comfortably on my head and completely surround my ears, forming a nice seal on my head. The headphones are very light, making them comfortable to wear for hours at a time. I ride the subway for 20-30 minutes each way for my commute and use these to listen to podcasts, music, books, and play the occasional game. The noise cancelling takes care of most of the noise save for the highest pitched screeching sounds. I also use them daily for phone calls on Skype. The battery easily lasts for two weeks of commuting. I have also flown with them several times and used these for the in flight entertainment, wearing them for 4-5 hours straight. I personally believe these are one of the most attractive headphones on the market with a refined look that doesn't stand out. They connect to two devices, so I can listen to music on my PC at work and take a call on my cell phone without having to do anything, it just works. Finally, I think the audio sounds great, but again, I'm not an audiophile, and I'm not making any claims about how they sound compared to some other high end head phones because I don't know.There are two downsides I can think of. One is that the headband is not replaceable. This is not an issue, yet, but I can imagine the day when it rips or wears thin and I have no option for replacing it. Two, when the battery does get really low, the headphones tell you every few minutes that the battery is low, over top of whatever you have playing. It is very annoying. I just charge them every couple of weeks whether they need it or not so I never have to worry about it.I paid full price back when they came out. I'd buy these again in a heart beat if I didn't already have them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Would buy again at full price

It folds nicely into a flat compact form for storage/transport. It does seem to have a problem reliably being a headset for online voice service calls like Skype, Slack, Zoom, Hangout, etc. though I think this is a problem with my old MacBook Pro (2012) and software config.

    ","Just put these on an hour ago and loving them. Unbelievable sound quality.I was worried about the fitting of these as I previously had the Momentum 2.0 and had to bend the metal.  I'm going to see how these do.  For now they are tight.  The benefit is that they stay on very well.  I have a large head 7 1/2 size so don't find many things that fit well without a headache.Controls work great.Noise cancelling is solid in my house.  If the same as Mo's, then should be awesome.  Why buy any other headphones, which to me are such an important part of my life.  I'm a computer programmer, musician, and sit in a cubicle these days, so I need solace and bad ass, natural sounding music.  These deliver!I might add that if you are a flagship android phone owner with aptx, these blow away the Bose re: sound quality. For iPhone folks, I don't know if superior vs. Bose, but I assume these also support AAC steaming which is 90% as good as aptx. The Bose are probably better with noise cancelling, but that's not my main purpose (but it is important).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Blown awayyyyyyy buy now!!!

    ","I tried all 3 and have decided on the PXC 550 as my go to for every day.  Couple of items up front:  a) I am not an audiophile. I love music and movies and enjoy good sound... b) I wear over-the-ear hearing aids  - and with those, I have perfect hearing. So I wanted the headphones to fit over the ear and be comfortable.Here is my summary.Sound/Music:Bose was the poorest to my untrained ear. It was ""good"" but I missed the stronger bass and full tones.  The Sony is much better.  The PXC 550, at first, was poor, but then I realized there are both effect-settings and an EQ in the app. Once I adjusted them, I prefer them. They are at least as good as the Sony (to me).Noise cancellation:I am looking for cancelling fans, the train noise, rushing air in the car etc.  I don't expect it will eliminate everything (e.g. someone talking on their phone next to me will get through).The Sony has the best programming options for noise cancellation.  The Bose was good. I find the PXC 550 does a little bit better than the Bose, and it does almost as good (and at times on par) with the Sony.  It doesn't have all the options of the Sony. The big difference for me is the fit over my ears (and my hearing aids).  The Sony might leak some chatter in at times. The Sennheiser does not (they fit my particular face better). Be sure to follow instructions for the Pause Play option or it won't work as well IMHO.Comfort:IMHO the PXC 550 beats both the others. Sony is very heavy and large and weighs on you after 45 minutes.  Bose is light but I don't feel they fit as well. The PXC is really good for my shape etc.Controls:Bose is very basic and works well. Sony and PXC both use swipes and taps on the right ear pad.  For me, they work the same. I personally like the power switch option on the PXC - better than the Sony.Bluetooth:I am using an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Pro.  After upgrade to iOS 10, all bluetooth devices are wonky. With the latest upgrade, they are working now.  Connecting more than one device to the PXC works, however, there are some quirks. For example, if connected to more than one device, the hand-gesture to determine battery level doesn't work. (not sure why). If I am only connected to one device it works fine.Playing from both devices or getting a phone call while on the iPad works perfectly.The Bose works great with no glitches.Sony doesn't support multiple devices.Hope this helps.  The truth is none are a bad choice. I believe it's fit and sound preference that will steer you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,PXC 550 vs Bose QC 35 vs Sony MDX 1000

    ","Hard to believe mobile can sound this good, but I was let down by EQ settings not being usable outside of Captune.  This, combined with Tidal, Pandora and most other streaming apps not having built-in EQ is all that is really left to tackle in personal audio, IMO.  That said, these have some killer features:- Sound quality with all effects off is pretty good for a closed-back of this form factor and with so much active electronics packed in the cup.  I'd estimate it's about 80% of the way to HD600 to 700 level when streaming Tidal lossless over USB.  Transparency on Bluetooth suffers, as with most wireless headphones.  I do not have an AptX-enabled phone or I'd really like to see how that would work.- A little smaller soundstage then the big open Senns (no surprise with this cup depth and being closed), but still quite good imaging and enough separation to make complex music passages surprisingly coherent in this form factor.- I don't find them bright or fatiguing at all, but rather more neutral without the flabby bass and big treble roll-off found in most other popular phones lately.- Comfort is awesome if you don't have huge ears (low-profile design) or a giant head (clamping pressure is just right for average size).- They are incredibly flexible in connectivity and show as a USB dac output in various operating systems.- The sound is the same with ANC on or off.- They even had good low latency (12 ms) audio streaming for studio monitoring when using ASIO4all to control buffer size, which was killer with ANC allowing me to more easily focus on my project.- The midrange is a touch soft compared to higher end cans I've heard.- The gesture controls take a while to get used to, but once you have them down, it is pretty impressive.I find myself wearing them more than anything else now; even briefly considered selling my primary desktop rig tonight due to the immense convenience and comfort with these things.

    ","WOW was my first impression of the Sennheiser PXC 550 Wireless with Adaptive Noise Canceling (ANC) headphones after unboxing it and trying it out. I did extensive research of several headphones, the Bose QC 35II, the Sony 1000MX2, and the B&W headphones and chose the Sennheisers for its features, light weight, and sound quality. I listen to a bit of everything from jazz, classical, country, r&b, and hip hop and the Sennheisers handled them all with aplomb. If you're looking for a set of cans with a lot of volume or a really pronounced bass then you may be better served by going with one of the other headphones I mentioned. Although the adaptive noise canceling feature was not a must-have feature for me initially, I've come to really appreciate how effective these headphones are when I'm relaxing and trying to get some serious music listening done and the ANC feature seems to give me the feeling of being in a private, live concert. The Sennheisers are feature laden and were a breeze for me to pair with my Apple phone and laptop as this model is able to be paired to two devices, something some of the other cans can not do. They are light and comfortable to wear on my large-sized head for extended periods although they can be a bit warm.

Still better then Bose though.Build Quality- This is the part that Sennheiser needs to really read because for me its the nail in the coffin. This doesn't feel like a finished product. The construction is plastic and some metal adds a weight you notice after maybe 35 minutes of use. The biggest construction flaw is the driver cones inside the earcups, they literally touch my ear because they protrude so far out.Pros:Battery- I can go three days of listening about 6 hours a day without charging them, sometimes i can go a full week, they are what you want out of wireless headphones.Noise Cancelling- They have three settings just like the Bose counterpart and I keep mine on the highest setting almost all the time. The best feature they have though is the double tap on the ear cup touch pad and it turns noise canceling off and turns on the microphones making it so you don't have to take off the headphones to have a conversation.Range- They have outstanding range. Leaving my phone at my desk I can walk down the hall and down two flights of stairs into my garage and I still have perfect audio signal.The three cons should be the main focus for version 2 of this product and I would also sneak some Google Assistant integration in there as well. I almost want to go back to Bose just because that feature was so killer.I give these headphones a solid C- overall.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Better then the Bose QC35ii in a lot of ways, but not perfect"

    ","REVIEW SUMMARY:You probably have already read several reviews and are probably still confused about which one to buy. Here is the final verdict: Stay away from Bose Quiet Comfort 35 & Sennheiser PXC 550 because of very poor sound quality & also stay away from Bowers Wilkins PX because of painful clamping pressure applied by the headphone on your head. The winner by many miles is clearly the Sennheiser HD1. Buy the Sennheiser HD1 and delight in spectacular sound quality with good noise cancellation.DETAILED REVIEW:All three headphones except the Sennheiser PXC 550 were tested by me personally in airplanes in-flight. I will focus on sound quality first, comfort second and noise cancellation third.Sound Quality: I am an audiophile - defined as someone who can tell the difference between high quality audio file vs. very good quality audio file. Sennheiser HD1 & Bowers Wilkins PW both produce spectacular sound. The kind of sound that would truly want you to go back through and listen to all your songs again. I personally like the clarity of the treble better on the Sennheiser HD1. Bass is excellent on both Sennheiser HD1 and Bowers & Wilkins PX. Sennheiser HD1 also is the winner on midrange voice sounds. You for sure won’t go wrong with sound quality with either one of these - they are beyond impressive, actually better than many wired headphones. The sound stage on both are also amazing, at times you’d think the speakers are 10 feet away from your head - it is really that impressive. Sennheiser PXC 550 produces below average sound and was ruled out right away and returned to the store; hence it will not be discussed any further in this review. Now, about Bose Quiet Comfort 35, the sound quality is nowhere close. Bose sound quality is below average at best. Compared to Sennheiser HD1 and Bowers & Wilkins PX, the sound quality of Bose pretty much ‘sucks’ - that about summarizes it.Comfort: Bose Quiet Comfort 35 is supremely comfortable followed closely by Sennheiser HD1. Do not buy the Bowers & Wilkins PX in terms of comfort - the clamping pressure is way too high on your head. Can’t bear it for more than 30 minutes. This is the reason why the Bowers & Wilkins PX was returned to the store.Noise Cancellation: Sennheiser HD1 and Bose Quiet Comfort 35 cancel out lower frequencies in an airplane very effectively. Bose wins for overall noise cancellation, but with a major caveat - it creates a lot of pressure around the ear to accomplish the noise cancellation. Sennheiser HD1 creates no such pressure around your head to create the noise cancellation. Bose Quiet Comfort 35 does a better job of canceling mid range frequencies. To be clear both Sennheiser HD1 and Bose Quiet Comfort 35 do allow voices to come through and you will hear crying babies on an airplane on both. Bowers & Wilkins PX does a good job with noise cancellation in an airplane as well, but I’d rate it’s noise cancellation below the Sennheiser HD1.THE VERDICT:Buy the Sennheiser HD1 and truly cherish how music was supposed to be heard in comfort & with most background noise tuned out! The treble, voice clarity, and clear bass punches will sure make you listen to your music on the headphone instead of your expensive audiophile grade home theater system. Sennheiser HD1 does produce sound that is that mind-blowingly amazing!",1.0 out of 5 stars,The Final Verdict on Sennheiser HD1 vs. Bose Quiet Comfort 35. vs Bowers Wilkins PX. vs Sennheiser PXC 550

    ",Love the acoustics and how you can be on your own space in a busy airport. The noise cancelling is something to get use to. I felt sick (nausea) turning on the anc function. I had to turn to low setting at first then after awhile going to high. There is a bit of pressure on the top of your head from the headband which made the nausea felling much more noticeable when turning on the anc. During flight I was able to relax in a quiet environment but I could not wear the headphone for more than 2 hours since the pressure from the headband was really bothering me. I opted for the Bose at the end since the headband is more comfortable but I miss the acoustics on the Sennheisers.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the acoustics and how you can be on your ...

And my laptop can't sustain internet with them, while it works fine with a cheap pair of Bluetooth headphones... go figure.  It's a known issue with Bluetooth.  Bottom line, I'm not sure if either of these issues are Sennheiser's fault, or just the fault of the poor standard that Bluetooth is.Takes some getting used to, but they look good and generally feel good (a little tight for me).

    ","Sound and call clarity are great in my opinion. They are not for exercising or running around outside as they pick up a lot of noise from the ear muff moving(even when just walking). But for working around in the garage or sitting and enjoying music they are excellent. Noise canceling is decent without the excessive pressure that I experienced with the Bose headphones(Bose cancel the noise a little better but at a comfort cost). Battery life seems good too. I tried about 6 others wireless noise canceling headphones and these worked the best for me. I like the gesture commands and tap to pause/play or double tap to hear outside conversation through built in microphone. It pairs very quickly with my blue-tooth phone.  Finally, just twisting the ear muffs to turn off and on is simple and easy to make sure it is off when you are not using.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound and call clarity are great in my opinion
69,"on March 8, 2018",,"My journey to these headphones began after three of my previous attempts at buying quality bluetooth headphones failed, for various reasons. The headphones I had previously purchased and returned were the Sony MDR-XB950N1 (too tight on my head, bass way overemphasized), Bowers & Wilkins PX [sound quality was horrible (I suspect I may have received a faulty pair because everyone seems to praise their audio quality), app was atrocious, sound leakage was bad) and then the Sony WH-1000XM2's (too loose on my head even at the tightest setting, and ironically the ear hole were too small for my ears). Then came these, which are also being returned for not living up to what I'm looking for.PXC 550:The good: sound quality, battery life, carrying case it comes with.The mediocre: the app, which only allows direct connection to Tidal, a music service no one uses, but will play music from other sources, just won't directly acknowledge them. The fit is a bit too tight on both my head and ears, even after adjusting.  Finally, the touch controls are way too sensitive. I am so sick of touch controls, I've yet to use a pair of headphones that has them and feels more like a benefit than a hindrance. These were functional, but still felt more like a hindrance.And then there were two things that were unacceptably bad:1. The bluetooth connected fine to my phone, but had serious issues with my computer. At first, it connected fine to my computer and started playing music at the same quality as my phone. Then, the audio quality randomly tanked to 1920s AM radio levels, and then it just dropped out completely. Ok, bluetooth connections drop out all the time, that's nothing exclusive to these headphones. But then it wouldn't connect to my computer, period. Until I did 3 ""forget this device""s and two disconnects from my computer. Then it worked again!....until it didn't again. From then on it was such a pain to connect to my computer, I either just stuck with my phone's connection (which never had issues), or used the cord for my computer. I shouldn't need to do that with $350 headphones, and many other reviewers have mentioned the spotty connections with this device.2. The volume is WEAK, even at max levels. I wanted it to get 2, maybe 3 more notches higher on the volume scale, and was extremely disappointed at how low the max volume got. Unacceptable, Sennheiser.I'm sending this back, and sadly, the search continues =(",2.0 out of 5 stars,Two main issues with these headphones: 1. bluetooth connectivity. 2. volume doesn't get loud enough.

    ","These things are great. I love the features offered. The ease of moving between tracks, changing volume, and pausing music with the giant track pad on the side of the right ear is awesome.I didn't know about the pass through mode where the microphone picks up people talking to you and plays it back at the right volume. I cannot wait to try them out on an airplane soon.The CapTune app for iOS and Android has a lot of bells and whistles I plan on experimenting with too. I like the A-B testing option for training a custom EQ, but then again I am a nerd.One cool trick this set of headphones can do is allow you to control the level of noise canceling. Without the CapTune app you get three options, 0/50/100%. With the app you get 12.5% increments. I suspect this is over kill but it's software, why not have the option?Great set of headphones.

Which are kind of a pain, but definitely sound better.  However, the ANC is a lot better on these Sennheisers.

I am a bit of an audiophile, I burn through headphones constantly when they cease to impress me I snag another pair to try out, I can say with certainty that I will be holding onto these for some time to come. The sound in these things is absolutely top not, I didn't even need to use my custom EQ to be satisfied with the quality. They are really light compared to some headphones and the noise canceling is fantastic without compromising audio quality while active. I notice very little change in audio quality between off, 50%, and 100% ANC. These are an absolute audiophile dream if you want ANC and top not audio quality, very highly recommend these.

    ","I purchased these headphones when they went on sale during the thanksgiving week. Overall they are very nice headphones but they do have a few flaws. I did notice that the manual that came with mine had incorrect information and referred to what I am assuming was a previous version of the device where the pairing process was different. This led to some confusion when trying to pair with another device. In terms of sound quality they are pretty flat which is great for instrumental music like jazz, but seems to let me down with metal and country music. I prefer the flat sound structure on open headphones, which these cannot be for obvious reasons, so this is a bit of a letdown in terms of sound structure. The noise cancellation works really well, however it runs into the same problem most of these systems do with discontinuous signals like wind where it cant quite correct for it.Overall I enjoy this device, my one star removal is mostly due to the incorrect manual and the sound quality. I also have a pair of Bose QC25 and have tested the QC35 (the wireless ones) and I tend to think they sound better. This may just be unintentional bias however as I have owned Bose stuff for several years and just got my first pair of Sennheiser headphones.edit: After having these for a little less then a year they have been very handy. They definitely last for the advertised 30 hour battery life and have been helpful on flights. I have noticed that the mic is a little overly sensitive as it will pick up stuff across the room when i use it for skype or phone calls but that is minor. The sound structure has grown on me enough that I was using these for travel everywhere and after purchasing the Sony MDR1000 bluetooth headphones that directly compete I think I still prefer the sennheisers over both.

80,"on October 29, 2017",,"Headphones are awesome when they work, and they work great with iPad and iPhone, but sometimes my Windows desktop has to pair with them again. I'm not sure they're really made to be in range of any more than 2 devices they're paired with? My 2010 Macbook does not have strong enough bluetooth to use these wirelessly with it, so be careful if you are getting these for aging hardware! I do believe it is weak bluetooth from the laptop as my newer iOS devices and PC desktop can send audio to them just fine all around my apartment.Battery lasts a really long time and sounds great. Noise cancelling is incredible, but I do not have a reference for how it compares to other noise-cancelling headphones. Sometimes calls fuzz out a bit on my iPhone 6, which is annoying. Very strange that it's intermittent. I have had to scramble to plug them in while on the phone, which is a real pain.Sound quality, though, is great. No complaints about that. Mid-range is quite clear and both voices and music sound great. The audio modes are garbage though, at least if you have a discerning ear.Also, they only work through bluetooth or USB at CD quality. I believe, though cannot confirm, that the headphone cord does go cleanly straight to the speakers. I have some FLAC files ripped from vinyl at above CD quality and believe I could notice the difference between using the headphones with the audio cable. I could not notice a difference between USB and bluetooth use, which makes sense as I think both are capped at CD quality. Of course, at that point the difference is pretty subtle and won't bother most people.I do usually use them wirelessly because being able to get up from my desk and make lunch or use the bathroom is more valuable to me than the slightly improved sound.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Mostly great but bluetooth can have some issues sometimes

    ","I’ve had Bose QC25’s which were decent but stopped working shortly after the warranty expired. Prior to that, I had Beats and those stopped working after a while too. So after being bitten by both aforementioned brands I decided to give Sennheiser a shot this time around (third times a charm, right?). These have already exceed my expectations in both terms of sound quality (which is superb), and NC works very well. I am pleasantly surprised. These are by far the best sounding headphones I’ve ever used. I am traveling internationally soon and plan to use these during my long flights and I will update my review if there’s anything relevant to add. If you’re comparing these to Bose or Beats, do yourself a favor and go to go with Sennheiser, it is audiophile level sound quality which you won’t find with the other two brands.FWIW: I considered the Sony MDR1000X2 but there were two major factors in me not going that route:1) the headband cracking issue still seems to be an issue in the version 2.2) Sony has capacitive touch. I need my headphones on flights where I can rest comfortably with a neck pillow and not have the headphones constantly freak out over every little touch. The PXC 550's have inductive touch which means only your fingers can affect the touch. This means a neck pillow touching the headphones won't cause it to pause or change songs etc. This was a crucial decision for me in going with Sennheiser.Also, if you check the Amazon reviews of the Sony headphones, they have lots of phony reviews which is pretty suspect; whereas the Sennheiser reviews are legit.Update: I used these on a long international flight. With noise cancellation on, they lasted a full 16 hours of flying time plus a two hour layover.

Though not quite as spacious as the 598s, the cups on the PXC 550s fit around the ear comfortably. I think I have average sized ears. I don't even notice the headband. It is soft and well- cushioned. I think the top of the band and ear cups are made of real leather. They definitely smell like it. I have not been able to confirm this, as that info is not on Sennheiser's website. Sound wise, the PXC 550 is excellent. The sound when connected via bluetooth is unexpectedly great. They sound seriously great wired. Amped, tiny bit better. Base, highs and mids are all there, as is soundstage, surprisingly, given these are closed cans. Haven't dropped a connection yet when playing music on my phone. They will reconnect with the last device you used them with automatically when turned on. Turn them on by simply turning the earcups in towards your ears. Call quality is decent I'd say. I need to make more calls with these to get a better perspective on this aspect. The quality of the build of these cans is very good. They are quiet when on your head. This is a must at this price point. There's nothing worse when you're trying to listen to tunes and you turn your head and the headphones creak. Only thing I'd quibble with is the case. It not tough and looks cheap. It won't protect the headphones adequately, so get something better if you're going to be carrying these around with you most days. If you want a comfortable, portable pair of headphones with excellent sound, that also have solid bluetooth and ANC, this is your pair. Overall 5 stars from me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I rarely write reviews but...

96,"on April 9, 2018",,Clear sound.  Bluetooth cuts off from time to time.  Volume not nearly loud enough (first bluetooth headphones I've owned.)  Volume here is my major gripe.  Noise cancelling is not that vacuum effect that I have heard on my friend's headphones so the combination of the volume being too low and not the noise cancelling being that effective on me (i.e. GYM). Dissapointed but kept them.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Honestly disappointing w/ the bluetooth experience and volume levels.

    ","Stunning once you discover the CapTune app for modifying the EQ to your liking! Underwhelming beforehand... almost left with a ""that's it?"" feeling before using the app. Feels premium (not overloaded with plastic like the similarly priced Bose QC35) and the touchpad controls are very intuitive once you get a feel for them. Love that these turn on and off automatically when folded for storage & opened for use. 25-30 hours of battery life is great and the noise cancelling rivals Bose in my opinion.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Stunning once you discover the CapTune app for modifying the EQ

    ","I'd been a Bose noise canceling headphone devotee for years and was in the market to replace my QC-15s with something new. The QC-15 was my second pair of expensive Bose headphones, but they suffered from the same problem as my first pair--over time the leather material on the ear cups and on the crossbar began to flake off leaving my ears and hair covered in black dandruff. Bose offered to replace the ear cups for $35 but there was nothing they could do about the crossbar and they really didn't offer a suitable remedy (like a discount toward a new pair of QC35s) so I decided to look elsewhere. Being fully invested in the Apple ecosystem I regularly watch Apple-related podcasts and read Apple-related websites so when I found that iMore.com reviewer Rene Richie had recommended the Sennheiser PXC 550s I was ready to buy. I checked a few YouTube reviews and comparisons against the QC35 and eventually decided to make the plunge, despite the higher $50 price tag.Truth in advertising, I was a motivated buyer because I was getting ready to depart on a trip out to Saipan from Jacksonville, FL, a journey that involved a 4 hour flight to Detroit, a 13+ hour flight to Incheon, Korea, and a 4-hour flight from Inchon to Saipan. With layovers it amounted to about 28 hours of ""travel.""The headphones arrived as expected, one day before my departure for Saipan. Just enough time to get acquainted with the features, though the inadequate documentation that came with the headphones compelled me to re-visit a couple of YouTube videos and finally to go to the Sennheiser web site to download the detailed instructions that I needed. For $400, I shouldn't have found myself on a scavenger hunt to figure out how the headphones worked.The case is only adequate. It is not a hard clamshell like the Bose case so I was never confident it would protect the valuable headphones inside when I stuffed it into my overstuffed backpack.Out of the case, the headphones paired quickly to my iPhone and iPad. The sound quality was excellent. I did not experience any mismatch between what I was viewing on my device and the audio track I was listening to through the headphones. I found the audio experience very satisfying.Noise cancellation was good, though I think the Bose headphones are slightly superior at this. The difference is not significant though and I much preferred that the Sennheiser did not cut out when the planes vibrated on takeoff and landing; a phenomenon I experienced frequently with my Bose QC15s.Battery life was phenomenal. I never felt the need to interrupt a listen in order to provide a booster shot of power to the headphones until I arrived in Saipan. It charged quickly and repeated the strong battery performance a few days later on the trip back.As to comfort on the ears, the asymmetric shape of the ear cups and infinite position (no soft stops) crossbar combined to make it difficult to consistently find a comfortable listening set up that was reliably repeatable. I found myself fumbling with the phones frequently, though I will admit that as an eyeglass wearer, finding a comfortable listening position for headphones has always been a challenge.All in all I'd say the PXC 550s are a solid product, but at $440 delivered ($399 plus tax and shipping) I was hoping to be ""wowed."" That, sadly, was not the case. The adjustable noise cancellation feature was useful and the ability to turn off the Bluetooth in order to conform to FAA rules about radio transmission below 10,000' are great features. The touchpad on the right ear cup is a neat idea, but it's another set of swipe gestures to learn and as I use the headphones infrequently, anything beyond raising and lowering volume or advancing / retarding a track quickly perishes.If you are dissatisfied with the Sony or Bose offerings, the PXC 550 is worth consideration. If you can tolerate disintegrating leather over time, don't mind replacing the ear cups occasionally (the QC35 crossbar is no longer leather so doesn't suffer from the same malady as my QC15), and don't you'll need adjustable noise cancellation, the Bose QC35s might be a better alternative.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Marathon Survival Test

    ","Wow!  Let me start with saying my quest was to buy the Bose Quiet Comfort (QC) 35.  I had used the QC 35 from a friend and found them amazing.  I was using Beats Studio wired for the past 2 years because i had received them free.  I travel a lot and was never happy with the comfort or the noise cancellation from the Beats, but the sound was pretty good.  The Bose 35 were the first real noise-cancellation I had heard in years and they were great.That said, I was thinking to myself while wearing the QC35's that something was missing.  I mean even my 2 year old Beats had controls for volume, track, on/off, etc. on the earphones.  The Bose had none of these.  Just on/off and no app that did anything.  Sounded simple until I wanted more.  I researched and tried several headphones from Beats, AudiTechnicha, Bose and Sennheiser.If you want top of the line noise cancellation and premium quality Bose and Sennheiser are on parIf you want truly clear and amazing sound quality and a great mobile app with configurable sound features go with Sennheiser.I can tell you I heard sounds I never knew were part of some of my favorite songs with these on.

    ","Fantastic headphones! I'm not a audiophile by any means and if you blind folded me I would probably tell you beats sound good because I have so little knowledge on audio equipment. You'll have to test them out for sound yourself but Seinnheiser has been around for decades and they have been known to make quality sounding headphones. However, what I am so excited about for these headphones is the tech and extra little touches they put into these headphones they make them such an awesome traveling utility. The smart touch pad is extremely responsive and will make you never want to randomly try to guess which button does what on your standard pair of headphones. The ANC is good (not as good as Bose qc 35, but bose also creates way too much pressure in my ear that makes me nauseous) which doesn't make me dizzy, and with adding 40-60% volume to the ANC you won't hear a peep from the outside world. You can turn the ANC on or off, adjust the power of it from 0, 50, or 100%, there's a preset EQ settings button on the headphones and advanced EQ settings in the Captune app (disclaimer, due to DRM (google it) you will only be able to listen to music in the CapTune app that you have purchased and won't be able to play cloud based music i.e. Apple Music, Spotify etc.). More features: smart pause (lift left cup up/take headphones completely off and it will pause music), tap smartpad to pause, double tap to pause music and turns on microphones/turns of ANC so you can amplify voices around you (helpful in airport if you're trying to listen to announcements or if someone is talking to you). Overall I'm a sucker for techonology that I never knew I needed and the combination of the ingenuity of the smart touch pad, the captune app, great sounding headphones, extremely lightweight that you can wear for hours (literally up to 30 hour battery life!) and dare I say professional looking/style enchancing headphones you just can't beat it!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best traveling headphones for sure

You can control volume, forward or reverse in songs and scroll through songs using the control panel on the phones.  You can also check for charge left and answer phone calls with the touch pad.Now to the sound.  I started listening to the fabulous Lady Jane Monheit to test the voice reproduction.  I was blown away.  Jane's voice was crisp, clear just plain elegant.  The highs, midrange are clear, and the base is percussive and throbbing, but not overwhelming.  I've since moved to funk of Parliament, blues of Stevie Ray Vaughn and Robert Cray, rocking Aerosmith, GnR and Led Zepplin, and am presently going through Herbie Hancock, Miles and Wynton.  If you want phones that can handle it all, these will not disappoint.  A bit pricey, but well worth it!!!!!!!!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The PXC 550s are nothing short of amazing.

    ","I bought this headphone to use in travels, but with high quality music. I own pxc100 / pxc 250 / pxc300/ AKG 701 / Denon ahd 600 / Sony MDR100abn / Sony mdrx750. I know it is always true you must test all your electronic choices and learn if you like it or not. So this was the first time I bought without previous tests. This is very desapointing product in terms os confort, to small headphone earbuds for me and I do not have a big head, even my wife did not like it, it is not really confortable like its value should bring to us. The sound quality is just average, no bass and the conection is not that good. It is Sennheiser quality, for sure, but it is not the value I found in my other headphones. I tested 800S from sennheiser and it is great the best headphone I heard, but this one the worst value I had in my life from any headphone I had.I changed from 3 stars to 2 stars, I am suing more and more this headphone and I can see all the differences it has with Sony and Bose. I really do not understand how someone can compare them, this is much worst. I tried with 10 people among these headphones and all these friends said the same about it, it far the worst of them. Very disapointing headphones. PXC 300 is much better, one of the best headphones I have ever in terms of value and sound quality. This one is really not Sennheiser quality. I still considere Sennheiser one of the Best Headphones in the world, just not htis model.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Oicehoic

    ","I have owned 2 pair of these headphones.Technically, I have only purchased one. The first pair I bought in 2016 and true to the description they sounded great. But after a few months of folding them up, unfolding them, so on and so forth (by design) they simply ceased to work any longer. So I sent them to Sennheiser directly, and they sent me a replacement pair. This pair has lasted longer by about 6 months, but now the left can has a pretty irritating static noise unless I can rotate it juuuuuust right. That can also no longer seems to cancel out ambient noise.As a set of headphones, their audio quality and noise cancelling features are great, but the build quality needs to be improved or the design needs to change to eliminate these issues. I have a suspicion I'm not the only one with this issue. I'm going to replace these with a different brand altogether that do not fold up so I can avoid this same type of problem in the future.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great audio quality, but breaks down after months of repeated use"

    ","Good headphone. Coming form Momentum 2.0 that i recently bought and was very satisfied. But I realized it's like a year old and can't turn off Noise cancelling. I gave a shot to try PXC 550 that's more recently released. They did listen to customers and added buttons or switches so you can control more, such as bluetooth, noise cancelling, and mode. Touch control is pretty cool too.So let me compare with Momentum 2.0 wireless.Lack bass, clarity, and dynamic (subjective) vs Momentum 2.0. Momentum 2.0 gave me many wow moment as this one does not. I was very disappointed. I guess impedance difference is big when I'm using iPhone / computer for the music. My music sound boring with this headphone compared to Momentum 2.0.Their noise cancelling really did improve. They categorized this headphone as traveling headphones. I guess their sound quality had to give in to improve their noise cancelling, which is a shame.I tend to sweat more on these headphones.

    ","Update:  I bought the Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2.  The ANC on the Sony is much better than the PXC.  But both make my ears hot and sweaty.  The PXC made my ears so hot that I've returned them.==================================I received these yesterday so obviously I don't have a lot of experience with these.I'm not an audiophile but I do have very good hearing.These are my initial impressions:ANC is absolutely fantastic.  I use my horribly noisy bathroom fan as my ANC test subject.These headphones totally eliminated the fan noise when playing music at a low level.  When my wife was speaking, I though she was having a laugh by miming.  No, by golly, she really was saying something.  But these don't filter out screaming voices.Some neighbor is running a leaf-blower that has this ear-piercing pitch which we can hear through triple-pane windows.  Outside, the noise is intolerable.  I put the headphones on and while the noise wasn't totally eliminated with the ANC, the noise was enormously reduced.  Putting on some music at mid-level almost completely eliminated the tinnitus inducing screeching so I could bear being outdoors.  So much for the myth of the quiet leafy suburbs.I was surprised that the ANC filtered out voices since my last experience with a headphone years ago was that ANC could only eliminate repeating sounds like a propeller.The Bluetooth sound quality is as good as my $200 wired 1More Quad in the ear headphones.  I'm able to walk around the room without losing connectivity.  While I was outdoors, the headphones connected to the iPhones inside the house.I had no problems pairing to an iPhone.  Each time I turn the headphones on, the pairing is automatic.  I haven't tried connecting to different devices yet.Swiping actions:  I still learning the swipe actions.  Sometimes I want to advance to the next song and I wind up redialing.  Between the iPad Pro and the iPhone X, I'm familiar with swiping but this will take some practice.  I might have to carry a cheat sheet for awhile.I haven't made or received any phone calls yet so I can't comment on the phone features.I downloaded the software and ran the A/B soundcheck.  My perception is that the sound seemed to improve.Here's are my biggest complaints with the PXC 550:✷ The headband is not comfortable.  Fortunately, I have a padded headband accessory that I removed from another headphone so the headband no longer digs into the top of my head.✷ The over-the-ear muffs squeeze my little head.  In a warm room, my ears got hot and sweaty.I have an Avantree HT3189 Bluetooth on-the-ear headphones.  While the sound quality is truly awful (but much better than the sound from the iPhone speakers), the Avantree is light-weight and comfortable.  But the Avantree leaks out so much sound that anyone sitting next to you can hear what you're listening to.  Don't listen to NSFW stuff when someone is near you.I'll be receiving a pair of Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM2 in the next day or two and I'll compare them.  If the Sony isn't comfortable, or the ANC isn't great, then I'm going to reluctantly take a trip to the local store and check out the Bose QC35 and do a comparison.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great ANC, great sound quality but the muffs are tight and make my ears hot & sweaty."

    ","I bought these a few months ago then returned them and got Bose QC35 instead.Here is a short comparison of the two:Noise cancellation: I think the Sennheiser has better noise cancellation than the Bose. I ride the subway everyday, which is the perfect environment to test that.Sound quality: I think they have similar sound quality. These Sennheiser PXC 550 is definitely not superior to the Bose QC35 as many claim.Comfort: The Bose is much more comfortable. That was the main reason I replaced these. The cushion on the Sennheisers is tight and it presses on the ears so it gets painful after an hour or two. With the Bose, however, your ears are completely inside the headphones and the cushions are just surrounding them.Features: The Sennheiser has more features than the Bose but they really aren't that great. One feature for instance is the one that makes the music pause when you lift the right ear side, cool but when this feature is on the music will also pause every time you look over your right shoulder, which is pretty annoying. The touch surface doesn't add much really and it is more prone to you mistakenly increasing the volume, pausing the music, or changing the song and it sometimes doesn't respond so you have to tap it a few times. The Sennheiser app is much better than the Bose app, no doubt there. A feature that I liked in the Sennheiser's is that it cancels the wind noise too. With the Bose the wind noise feels as if your blowing on a mic if you're walking against the wind. Another thing that was pretty bad about the Sennheisers, and was the other main reason for me to return them, was that I would hear this loud shrieking the middle of the song which would ruin the experience and hurt the ear. That would happen quite often and it made me anxious while listening to music because could happen any moment.Price: They're in the same price range. When I bought these they were $330 and the Bose were $350. Now things have changed it seems but I don't think you should factor in the price when comparing the two. If I am paying more than $300 for a pair of headphones I wouldn't cut corners to save $49. After all, you're paying a lot of money and they better be worth it.As a conclusion, I am quite happy with my Bose headphones. The Sennheisers have the potential to be great if the make them more comfortable and if the fix the glitches that I mentioned above. I've heard good things about the Sony but I haven't tried it yet.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfort, Glitches, Potential; I tried both the Sennheiser PXC 550 and the Bose QC35 and this is a comparison of the two"

    ","Pros: Excellent music sound quality.  I already own the Bose QC35 which would be the primary competitor for these.  I feel the music is clearer with better mids and highs than with the Bose, and that's saying something because I think the Bose sound pretty good too.  In particular, I noticed the difference when listening to music with guitar.  The guitar riffs would come through clearer and stronger with the Senns.  When the singer takes a breath you can hear it more with the Senns.Battery life is excellent.  They are well made and seem a little stronger than the Bose but I've had no problem with either one.Telephone call quality is a little unusual but very good.  Sennheiser added a feature to make phone calls sound more like you are talking to the person in the same room and it works.  You can also hear your own voice and a bit of your surroundings which makes it better to communicate.  I thought that was a little better than the Bose but they are both excellent.The three sound modes really make a difference.  club sounds ""fuller"" with more bass.  The phone app has a ton of controls and ways to adjust the sound.Cons: the touch controls are finicky.  They generally work but I often hit them by mistake or had a little trouble getting them to react as expected.  Not terrible but I think I would prefer push buttons.The ""lay flat to turn off"" is a little weird.  It works as long as I remember to do it correctly but I did find them dead a couple times because I didn't turn them off.  Not a big deal but I do prefer the simple ""on off"" button on the Bose.My biggest complaint is the comfort of the ear pads.  They are little small for my ears, making them ""on ear"" instead of ""over ear.""  They fit over the front of my ear fine but would trap the back of my ear under the pad rather than in the pad.  I could push them around a little and get my ear completely in, but then the pressure would irritate the back of my ear instead.  I don't think I have big ears.  Just a 1/4"" inch bigger opening would have been enough.  Comfort isn't bad, I still found them way more comfortable than my vmoda on ear headphones, but they are definitely not as comfortable as the Bose.Overall, these are excellent headphones.  I like the music sound quality possibly better than any of my other headphones and I own quite a few.  I would have kept them but Amazon had them $50 cheaper shortly after I bought them and Amazon won't price match themselves.  So when Amazon wouldn't price match I just sent them back really on principle.  I hate feeling like I overpaid.  I still have the bose qc35's which are so similar that I don't really need both of them.

    ","I tried out Bose QuietComfort 35s, Sennheiser Momentum wireless, and these, and OVERALL liked these best. Using with iPhone 6. To me they were the most comfortable. When it comes right down to it I found the noise cancelling comparable for practical purposes to the Bose, despite the more stringent tests concluding the Bose's is better or at least stronger. I had no problem with the sound compared to the other two and in some cases preferred the sound to the other two. I like the look of the Momentum's quite a bit better but these were more comfortable, and the look of the QCs is pretty abysmal. You get used to the original way of turning on and off (by rotating) quite quickly and I would say same for touch controls, which are quite handy. Pairing has been without issue. The app is no great shakes and I don't care much for the sound sculpting options (such as reverb? really?) but to my ears it sounds good flat. Constuction quality is decent for today's standards and relative to other products, i.e., not built to last in the sense that things used to be, but seems a little sturdier than competing products.

    ","Sennheiser is synonymous with audio perfection.  The HD800 reveals and articulates like no other.  I must say the PXC 550 is no slouch when it comes to the same.The soundstage is exceptional for a closed back headphone.  The low end has helf.  The details are engulfing.Most of all, the noise cancelling is excellent.  I've owned the QC35 of which the noise cancelling is great but the SOUND quality of the music was NOT in the same league, at all.  The PXC 550 places you in a world of pristine sound of your own choosing.  (I've been startled a few times by someone trying to get my attention and having no clue they were even there.)My only complaint, for me, is that my ears sweat a lot with the ear pads although they are very comfortable.The headphone is very light and you literally forget that they are on at times as though the sound is just playing in the world around you.My iPhone 6 Plus was down stairs in the kitchen charging as I was on a call upstairs walking around.  I was told ""you sound very clear"" on the other side.  I let someone else listen and speak to see what noise leak I could hear.  Zero.  None.  It was as though they were talking to themselves only.I also listen to audio books as I'm doing work around the house with audible and it's pretty great no having the cord in the way.The touch features are intuitive.  A double tap turns off ANC momentarily so that you can hear outside voice without having to stop the audio.One of the coolest features is that the second I remove them from my head they auto pause and a simple folding ensures they are powered off.  A lady with a British accent gives the verbal cue.  She also lets you know when to recharge the battery.Speaking of battery I must say that it takes a lot longer than the stated three hours to charge this exact pair and maybe it's just this unit.  However, once charged it lasts for a very long time.Skip the Bose and get the best ANC that money can buy.. $50 is not worth sacrficing excellent sound quality when you can literally have both!The best of both worlds.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best of Both Worlds

    ","Had my first chance to try them on a couple of flights. I was truly amazed by how much they cut down on the flight noise. They are very comfortable and sound great with or without music. The ear pad for control is very sensitive so if you just brush against it, the music will pause. This is something that I need to get used to.They are much bulkier than the ear buds I previously used but I would not go back to using the ear buds when flying or in any environment where there is a lot of background noise. With these I was much more relaxed on the flight.If you have the means, I highly recommend them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive but worth every penny.

    ","GENERAL OVERVIEWAfter using the PXC 550s for a few days I must say that am very happy with these headphones.As a proud owner of several respectable headphones, namely the HD600 and Sure 535 IEMs I feel it is important to note these headphones can only be compared to noise canceling type headphones, where the noise canceling technology changes the characteristic of the sound and generally self amplifies the sound.  Although the NC can be turned off, I feel that the PXC 550s should also be amped in some way to get the full benefit in sound, this being the NC active or an amp wired. The PXC 550s do have a more even sound when wired and I found a greater appreciation for these while wired up with may DAC amp and optical connection to my Mac.Having never owned noise canceling headphones and as a fan of Sennheiser my review might be a bit biased.  So far I have been enjoying these rocking out at work, and streaming shows at home.I would classify the PXC 550s as a multimedia headphone. The characteristic of sound can be changed and tuned to the type of media you are listing to. For most people, I think folks just want to put their headphone on and get too it. However, with feature rich headphone like these, the option is there to tune the PXC 550s to the activity you are in. Watching a movie? Change the effect mode to Movie with deeper low end. Joining a webinar? Switch to speech mode where the emphasis is on the presenter’s voice. On a phone call? Enable call enhancement for clear phone calls. Rocking out to your favorite tunes, try Club mode.. What to customize the EQ? Use the phone app Captune. Many Options here.With audio presented in varying modes, the PXCs offer many options to dial in the sound to taste which is one of the features I like best about these headphones, all the while, keeping the noise in the background out! I imagine these would work well as travelersIMPORTANTThe Bluetooth technology you use with these has a direct relationship to the sound quality experienced. If you using an older computer, even if it runs the aptx profile this can affect the Bluetooth sound quality. For the best experience, you really want a low latency modern Bluetooth receiver. Initially I ran these with straight to my Macbook Pro 2010 on El Cap for instance and although they connect and play with respectable aptx sound quality, I still experienced sound clipping and was not as good as what a new Bluetooth adapter provided. I purchased a quality Bluetooth Adapter, the USB Advantree Leaf. This Adaptor does all levels of Aptx with low latency, the sound is noticeably more impressive with no clipping and great wireless range. I cannot tell the difference USB wired or wireless with this adapter.Connecting to my Android phone the PXC 550s sound great as well. I installed an app called Base EQ which is system wide nice EQ.PROS:• Dial in your media experience with different listening modes• Take phone calls with stunning clarity (almost too clear)• Versatility in connectivity ether wired wireless out of the box with adapters• Turn off NC option.• Adjust level of NC in adaptive mode and phone app.• EQ with phone app and other custom settings• Connect to two devices at once• Great battery life• Modern touch controlsCONS:• Button controls are small and tricky to reach• Some Touch controls take some practice and a bit tricky• Travel case could be made of a more durable material• Highs a touch too bright on wireless mode verses wired or USB modeCONCLUSIONI am happy to add PXC 550s to my collection. Do the PXC 550s sound as good as HD600s or Sure 535s? They Hold their own. While wired and amped, the PXC 550s remind me of what HD558 sound like but spacial effects, and while wireless the highs take on bit brighter tone, but still nice. I must say that having headphones that you can adjust the effect mode for listening activities is a nice touch. And club mode tends to get a lot of use. These bring my movies and streaming shows to life, where in past you would need a DSP add-on and amp, and although having separate components dedicated to this function is not really the same, all this is compact headphones with a similar experience and wireless even is impressive.I would have gone for the Sony MDR1000X and I am sure are great as well, but I really wanted to be able to connect to more than one device at a time and I found a great deal on these.Updated:I was able to try the MDR1000X recently and compare them side by side. The MDRs have a great sound stage and most everything I listened to was impressive. I did find them to be a little fatiguing. The controls where also a little funky to reach as compared to PXC which is mostly touch gestures. Overall the PXC550s are my preferred choice. They are versatile, can be warn most all day without too much fatigue, sound great, and adjustable noise cancellation. The dual Bluetooth connection feature works but not that well so don't make this a deciding factor.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Headphones with Options!

    ","A great set of headphones. I previously owned the PXC450 (this models predecessor) for 3 years and loved them until they broke. I've also owned various sennheiser models so I believe my review will be helpful for those on the fence.Comfort: This is my first pair of wireless headphones, as I was cemented in the belief that bluetooth audio would never sound as good (I'll get to that in a second). Nonetheless, these are absolutely some of the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. They fit perfectly around my ears, and I can use them for hours without any soreness or discomfort. I love how versatile being wireless is, I can roll around in bed without jerking the cord out, i don't have to worry about tangles or my dog chewing on the cord - it's just fantastic.Sound: I primarily listen to hip-hop/R&B/ as well as classical. The first album i listened to on these was THE LIFE OF PABLO - I chose it due to the sheer amount of production talent involved with the project. I heard things on Ultralight Beam that I've never heard on previous headphones. You hear every single detail of the music, and never have to ask myself ""did i miss something? what did he say""? it's all there and gorgeous. I was worried that the bass would be as flat as it was on my 450's, as sennheiser's are usually tweaked for a classical soundstage, at least in my experience. It's still flat, but you can tweak it for some HEAVY bass here, very satisfied. Equally satisfied with mids and treble. The one complaint I have here is that they don't go as loud as I'd like them to, which is slightly annoying. It may be something I have to tweak in my EQ settings, but i wish it would go just a few notches louder. Music does sound SLIGHTLY better with the cord, but thats expected with wireless headphones, and you really have to listen for it and won't even notice unless you're on FLAC files or CD's. The sound is almost just as good as wired senns. It's possible the Momentum 2.0's sound better; I'm interested in picking up a pair to compare. I'm surprised nobody's compared them yet since they seem like similar models.Noise Canceling Ability: Fantastic, far better than my old pxc450's. all ambient sound is disposed of when you flip that switch, and its eerily quiet. That being said, when I'm listening to music at home i never have it on as theres nobody else around and the music drowns out any annoying sounds anyway. I'm not sure if they're better than the QC35's that everyones comparing these to, but they definitely exceeded my expectations in this categoryControls: Very Very cool. Thought that the touch controls would be gimmicky, but boy are they cool and definitely refined. It never misinterprets what I want to do and always does what it's supposed to. The walkthrough function is groovy, better than the one on my pxc450 for sure. The only complaint i have here is that I feel like the NC switch is placed in a slightly awkward position, and i wish it was a bit larger so that I could switch it on without having to take the headphones off first. Sometimes I can get it, but its not easy. The battery definitely comes close to the ~22ish hour mark on wireless, its incredible. I don't have to charge them for days.Overall, these are expensive headphones but I do believe the price is justified for these incredibly modern set of cans. I feel so free without the wires, and the sound is still incredible and what I expected from sennheiser. The controls are incredibly refined, and nothing feels gimmicky. For 400 bucks, you get a set of very well constructed cans with a modest look on the outside, but some of the most advanced features i've ever seen. 5/5",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great set of cans

    ","The good:- Great sound quality.- Solid noise canceling quality.- Comfortable to wear for a long time.- Well constructed* (see below)- Long battery life.The bad:- Touchpad controls take a long time to get used to. Even after 9 months of use, I am constantly accidentally brushing the touchpad with my arm or hand causing the audio to unintentionally pause or play.- While one of the EQ settings does make listening to electronic music more enjoyable, I would rather if these headphone had no customizable EQ settings. Most of the time I want the EQ settings to be in normal mode. However, I find that I'm constantly accidentally pressing the button which changes the EQ mode. This is a really annoying problem.The absolutely horrible:I cannot recommend these headphones for a single reason: unwanted tones caused by the Bluetooth radio.These headphones can connect to up to 2 Bluetooth devices at one time. When they are connected to two devices, there is not problem. The headphones work just fine. However, when only a single Bluetooth device is connected to the headphones, a show-stopping problem occurs.If the connection to the second Bluetooth device is lost, the PXC 550 headphones begin searching for a device to connect to. The issue is that the Bluetooth radio in the headphones was poorly implemented, causing the radio to play a very high-pitched tone when searching for a device to connect to. Each time the tone occurs it can be heard for 5 full seconds followed by 8 seconds of silence between tones. If you've ever been to the ear doctor and done the test where you hold a speaker to your ear while the doctor plays tones for you to hear, the Bluetooth radio tone in the PXC 550 headphones sounds exactly the same. It's a terrible noise that absolutely ruins the headphones. There's no way to ignore the noise. This problem means that the headphones cannot be used only for noise cancelling unless you want to listen to that terrible tone beeping over and over again.While it could be claimed I got a lemon set of headphones, unfortunately this is not the case. After communicating with Sennheiser's support team, sending in my headphones, and receiving a brand new pair back from them, the problem remains.Overall:The Bluetooth radio tone problem ruined these headphones. While I can still use them to listen to music or podcasts with no problems, the second I turn off the audio and try to use them for noise canceling, I run the risk of having to listen to the horrible tone beeping. These headphones require that I have two devices connected to the headphones at all times, otherwise I have to take them off.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible problem with Bluetooth radio tones

I haven't taken, or placed, a phone call on these yet, as I've been using these mostly for airplane trips and walking, but I'm assuming that will work as described. They are comfortable to wear, and relatively light weight. I highly recommend these if sound quality is important to you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic headphones

    ","These Headphones are amazing.  Simply put.  They have a very wide range, and sound crystal clear when playing high quality audio files.  Movies sound ridiculously good.  The only issue I have, and I am not even sure its with the headphones, is that the volume seems to be a bit on the low side.  This can be addressed with an equalizer, and using VLC yielded some great results.  The battery life is excellent, somewhere around 20 + hours. The design is excellent, and makes ergonomic sense.  I really like the tap and touch features, especially when I am working out and don't have to mess with my phone in my pockets to change music or volume settings.  My head gets hot and sometimes there is some sweat on the ear muffs but I think that is just me.  These headphones sound damn good with hip hop, especially if you adjust for lower range...but they really shine with progressive trance and techno music, with great mids and ear blasting highs.  I really enjoy these things and would highly recommend them to anyone who wants to take their audiophile scene to the next level.",4.0 out of 5 stars,These Headphones are amazing. Simply put

The sound quality of the 550 is also very good but IMHO not as good as the Sony and the Sony although 1.5 ounces heavier was far more comfortable to wear and like another reviewer I forgot I was wearing them as they rested on my ears whereas the PXC550 clamped too hard and in a very few minutes my ears were too warm and sweaty.As far as Captune it's usefulness to me is limited as it does not work with streaming sources like Google music as I do not buy CD or MP 3I do not know if my 550 was defective as it made a vibrating sound in my left ear only when no music was playing,  yet with a 31 January return date the Sony is easily my choice and these are boxed up waiting for UPS.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose QC35,  Sennheiser PXC550, Sony MDR 1000x trial"

    ","I originally gave these a pretty low review, but I have re-evaluated the situation and elevated them from two to five stars—and I have chosen to keep these over the Bose QC35s and the Sony MDX 1000s.I originally purchased bluetooth headphones to support my 2016 Samsung SUHD 4K TV, which does not support wired headphones (or so I thought).  Initially, the PXC 550s would not pair with the television, nor would they pair with a couple of the Apple devices I owned—so I considered them fairly worthless in spite of the fact that I loved their sound.  Whereas, the Bose QC35s did pair with the TV and about half of my Apple devices, so I planned to keep those.  Later I figured out how to pair the PXC 550's with pretty much everything I owned, the steps were just a bit more complicated for some devices.The later reality led me to re-evaluate the Bose QC35s, which I did not love for a couple reasons: They did not fit my head as well as the PXC 550s, and the QC35s were heavier and created hot spots on my jaw and the top of my head.  Moreover, they were difficult to wear while lying down.  Also, the QC35s sounded less precise and detailed than did the PXC 550s or the MDX 1000s.  During the short time I tested the MDX 1000s, I could not get them to pair with ANYTHING I owned, though they sounded great in wired mode.  But, the Sony’s too, created uncomfortable hotspots and were noticeably bulkier and heavier.So I happily kept the PXC 550s, and returned the others.  After a year I have grown to really love these headphones, but the all-critical comfort issue will vary from user to user based on head size and shape.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not for everyone, but ..."

    ","I really enjoy these headphones. I've been using the Bose QuietComfort 15s for many years and overall was very pleased with those headphones, however the cable with microphone and phone controls broke which made taking calls on the go quite difficult. I looked very closely between these headphones and the Bose QC 35s as I really wanted to get away from the cords and was willing to sacrifice some sound quality for connivence.I have been very pleased with my purchase, the sound quality is fantastic. They took a bit of listening time to break in, but once they did, they sound great.  The noise cancelling is slightly behind the QC 15s, but not by much and I only can really tell if I focus on it.  For my normal listening while on the train, I don't ever notice noise intruding on my music.  The touch controls are fantastic and very responsive.  The call quality is great and I've been using these during my commute and a little bit while in the office for about 1.5 weeks and I haven't had to charge them yet.The only complaint i have about them, is that they can get interference and break up a bit in large crowds of commuters, however that is a limitation of bluetooth technology and not a particular failing of this product.  I have spoken to other users of bluetooth headphones of various styles and manufacture, and they all report similar issues.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great pair of headphones for commuters

    ","I have had these for a couple months and I use them everday and I even sleep with them. They are tighter than the Bose QC35 and therefore not as comfortable for me. However, they don't fall off like others I have owned. I wonder if the extra clamping is used to compensate for noice cancellation? I tried them at Bose store along QC35 and the manager couldn't hear any difference. No hiss like previous noise cancelling headphones I've had the controls are nice. Don't expect great sound from these type of headphones. The battery monitor voice tells me when it is a 60% repeatedly, maybe there is a setting I missed? It has begun to shut down due to low battery when it is at 40% so I charge it more often. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. However, the battery holds up well, I'm not sure if it is as advertised? Seem durable. I am hard on headphones and I will find out in time if they hold up. I would consider the Bose just for comfort if like me it bothers you. However, I have a health condition that creates sensitivity... Neither these or the Bose block all noise. I use a white noise app along with them when needed which really helps me.

    ","I was shopping around for a headset and I ended up ordering these, and borrowing a set of Bose 35 QC.  After a trial period where I switched between them, I ended up deciding to keep this one just barely.  They are both excellent headsets, as the reviews state.  For the most part, any of the major selling are pretty minor and subjective.  This one just happened to fit my needs a little better and edged the Bose out.My usage is conference calls which I do for work every day - 15min to an hour - and media as I travel about.  I need them to work with my phone and tablet as I often watch something while eating, but also need them for air travel as I'm often at airports.As I do sometimes use them for extended sessions, it was important for them to be comfortable.  Actually Bose was slightly more comfortable for me.  However, this is also very comfortable, and I have no problem wearing these for several hours.  I don't find they pinch, and they fit my ears well.As far a phone calls, they were virtually identical.  Both had excellent sound for me and for the other callers.  I'm not an audiophile so I really couldn't tell enough difference when it came to media.  They both sounded excellent and did a good job blocking outside sounds.The controls for both are good.  I could go either way.  I haven't accidentally left my headset on.  I haven't shut down a call by accident because of the touch button features.  At the same time, it's not that big a leap from the Bose controls.  Each is pretty easy to operate, and really didn't play much a part in my decision.So Bose is $50 less, yet I pick this one.  The reason is fairly simple.  It was the ability to shut off the active nose cancellation while in bluetooth, and Sennheiser's pass through feature.  The passthrough lets you pretty much talk with the headphones on, amplifying voices.  That's not actually why I use it, though.  I use when I'm trying to hear information pertinent to my flight while wearing my headset.  While I'm sitting in the airport, I need to turn off the noise cancellation, since they sometimes change flights and announce the changes.  When I hear something, I can turn off what I'm watching and amplify the announcement with the pass through.  It's a very specific usage, but for me, it was worth the extra money.I'd recommend first and foremost if you are looking at this an the Bose to try them out if able.  The comfort is one of those things that's very subjective, and really needs to be felt to know.  If the ability to control the noise cancellation in bluetooth mode is important like it is for me, then this might edge out the Bose.  Otherwise the 35QC is a perfectly nice set as well.  Can't go wrong either way in my opinion.  Worth the extra money for my needs, but might not be worth it for someone else.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent but pricey

    ","I want to love these headphones.  The aesthetics are sleek and the sound is great but the problems with Windows 10 are too much.  I have been trying to pair these headphones properly for two days.  Windows 10 shows the headphones as paired but there is an audible ""Pairing"" voice that plays through the PXC 550s every 30 seconds or so.  I've reset them twice and turned off any other Bluetooth signal around with no success.  Additionally, I've connected them via usb to see if that would ""kick start"" them into operating properly...I was desperate.  Still no luck.I've been on various boards and have found that this issue is not uncommon.  I can't identify any drivers or software updates that can fix the problem.  I sent an email to Sennheiser technical support and will update if/when a solution is found.  Until then, I can't recommend these headphones to Windows 10 users.  It would seem the PXC 550s aren't quite fully baked...at least Bluetooth with Windows 10 wise.Update 4/8/17After a couple of emails with Sennheiser tech support (who were very responsive) I was finally able to successfully pair the PXC 550s with my Surface Book.  The sound is outstanding and it now pairs flawlessly when the headphones are powered on.  I wish I had a step by step fix; I ended up wiping the Bluetooth memory on the headphones several times and it finally worked.  Oddly, Windows 10 showed 2 PXC's every time I attempted to pair.

It is simple to use. I need to put in a lot more time to decide what difference I might or might not hear between corded and BT. None so far. The noise suppression with audio off is such that noise is off too. I live on a very busy street with lotsa bass bangers. A bit gets through in the upper mid region about where you might expect a yell to be. The fit is perfection. I really can find nothing whatsoever to criticize about it except that they didn't figure out how to exceed the range restriction of BT. It stops just at my toilet exactly like every other BT device does.They have lenses in the ear cups that I believe will override any user Pinnae effects to replace them with their own as coded in the DSP. Their own are very good as demonstrated by the acoustic image I get. I'm not surprised to see that they have become unavailable.

I own several high end Senheisser headphones, but i regret buying these. although everything around the sound itself is great (design, features, etc) I find sound to be pretty unstisfying.  I cannot say they sound terrible, cause they don't. but I expected at least a reasonable hi res quality for the price. first, they lack the output volume of high end headphones. even with the vol to maximum, they won't sound loud. bass is too unreal. you don't ""feel"" it. that's a minus for me. treble and mids are great! I own the Sony MDR1DAC and they are far superior, although they are wired. I intendednto move from the parrot Zik to the Sennheiser PCX 550. and there is no way the Sennheisers will sound better. No. Never. By far. Zik were the first ""touch"" headphones, Sennheiser tried...  Now, about the CapTune software, good idea, great concept. unfortunately it wont play iTunes or any other DRM tracks. Boom is far better software. I have always thought Sennheiser is the top. and I still do, but not with the 550's. i think they are a failed prototype of wireless touch hp's. they are not for audiophiles. if you want to just listen to music these are great, if you are willing to pay $400. for this price, there are much better optios.

    ","I initially was looking to purchase noise cancelling headphones for an upcoming flight and wanted some peace and quiet. While researching this, I found myself at Best Buy trying on the Bose QC35 headphones and was amazed by the noise cancellation technology but a little underwhelmed with the sound quality. To a non-audiophile I'm sure Bose is fine and probably would have been fine for me but Bose was also missing a feature I wanted... the ability to turn NC on or off whether I'm using bluetooth or a cord. With the QC35 you are forced to use NC if you use bluetooth since it's paired with the same button. Kind of weird to design it like that.. but oh well.I'm very impressed with the sound quality of these Sennheisers. I own the Sennheiser PC 363d for my PC gaming and have since fell in love with their quality of sound. These are also very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I've even used them to help me fall asleep when I kept hearing the temporary paper blinds we had rubbing up against the window. I have done some moderate sweating in these as well (mowing the lawn) and have yet to experience any issues in that regard. As far as the noise cancellation in comparison to the QC35... roughly the same. When I first purchased these, I was concerned that the magical noise cancellation I heard for the first time in Best Buy with the QC35 was better than these. I have since gone back to Best Buy and found that they didn't seem to be any better than what I experience with PXC 550. Since I don't own a pair of the QC35's I can't do any extensive testing, but the difference isn't big enough to say for sure one is better than the other ...at least to my ears.Pros:-Great comfort - I have used these to help fall asleep a couple of times and to mow the lawn... no issues-Great sound - I have another pair of Sennheiser headphones and their sound quality is unmatched. Better sound than QC35-Great noise cancellation - Seems on par with QC35 although I haven't done any extensive testing. It definitely does a good job.-Long battery life - I have used these for 2-3 hours at a time and it still shows 100% battery. Haven't even gotten close to draining these things yet-Captune app for android is user-friendly and useful.-Plenty loud enough for me.Cons:-Touch controls can be a bit wonky at times but not a deal-breaker by any means. It still works fine.-Design is a little bland for my taste but still attractive enough.Fantastic pair of headphones if you want great sound quality paired with great noise cancellation.

    ","Lots to like about the PXC 550-The sound quality is outstanding. Hearing new elements in well known songs. Things that do not show up at home or in my car's B&O system.The PXC 550 sound stage, frequency response, dynamic range, critical elements the discerning listener demands are solid.To truly experience how good they are use the cord and plug them in, a bit of difference over Bluetooth is to be expected.Even with BlueTooth across Black Flag, Miles, Naz, Deep House or Hayden these wireless cans perform.Worlds better than the Bose. You know what they say, ""All highs and lows?...it must be Bose”.And yes I also own the Bose.- Cordless. Its a new world brother.These are light and comfortable, as others have noted its easy immersion and to forget wearing them.Get up and walk around, it feels like a privilege to be given this sort of freedom. Nothing impedes movement.Put your phone in your pocket, hooked up to a streaming service like MixCloud, good fun discovering some new music through a new experience.A huge plus is with these is the previous poor quality of bluetooth audio has been surmounted.That's what always held me back from getting a pair of cordless cans. This time I think Sennheiser has nailed it. Kudos!- Noise cancelation Works pretty well.Still faintly hear background whirr of fans, doors opening, other walla; but that may be a good thing as to be completely isolated feels odd and lonely.Minuses:- Set-up. Getting the optimal configuration dialed-in is a bit of a chore.Cordless these did not sound all that good out of the box. Reason?Bluetooth needs to be updated on all devices, which means getting USB dongles for your older machines.Without which my MacPro tower and MBPro 2012 both exhibited dropouts,  skipping or scratching.Another Apple item that helps is the BlueTooth Explorer app (free). This allows you to force aptX codec.Now this is may be a geek item for some, however the sound quality is noticeably improved using the aptX codec, which Apple does not natively use.- Choice of mobile device matters.Older items may not perform to spec.Android uses aptX. iPhone does not.Therefore the PCX 550s seem to be happier with my Galaxy S7 than with my iPhone 6S.Quibble? Perhaps, but the bluetooth range and quality of sound seem a bit more stable with the Android device.Not that the iPhone sux (hardly), just that given the choice, I put the S7 in my pocket for listening.- Wind noiseOk these are designed for use on a plane (hopefully there’s no breeze in your cabin) or office situation;But walking around on a breezy day I get a lot of wind noise. So if on a bicycle or skiing, anything out and about, you may get irritated by the constant whooshing.- Device connect IDCalls everything “phone #x” so there’s no recognition of laptop v phone v whatever. Everything is phone number 1 or 2.This tells me nothing.- Their appYeah. This is a POS.. Useless joke as it sees everything as violating DRM and refuses to play anything regardless of the source of the media.That’s as far as I got.So yeah there’s LOTS of room for improvement there.Still have to use on GoTo Meeting, Skype, etc so no review on that part.Still haven’t tested with my Dell laptop.Bottom line:At this rather dear price point this User finds solid value. These beat the competition handily.Look and feel great. Sound fantastic (in windless environments)Long-term listening is comfortable with low fatigue. Touch interface well designed.Looking to be this year’s Xmas gift for favorite clients",4.0 out of 5 stars,Lots to like about the PXC 550 -The sound quality is outstanding

    ","I bought Sennheiser PXC 550 headphones (currently $299) hoping they would be better than the Sony WH-1000X M2 headphones (currently $348) that I bought about 3 weeks ago. I like the Sony headphones, except that they are not that comfortable (they tend to sit on my ears, not over my ears, so my ears feel squashed after hours of use, and the headband padding is too narrow and too hard, leading to a headache).From the pictures, the Sennheiser headphones looked like they had a bigger, more ""ear-shaped"" opening, and more padding at the top. It turns out that this is an optical illusion, because the Sennheiser headphones are quite thick, so in person, the ear opening is smaller and narrower than any normal person's ear. (Why on earth doesn't anyone make headphones that actually sit around (and clear of) your ear, not on top of it? My ears are not unusually large...) The padding on the Sennheiser earphones is not that comfortable compared to the Sony headphones. Also, I thought the fact that the headband angles back a bit on the Sennheiser headphones made a lot of sense, since your ears are a bit angled back relative to your head orientation, but in practice this puts the headband right on top of the parietal bump on the top of your head (at least on my head), which didn't feel like an ideal location for the headband.The next strike against Sennheiser came when I tried the headphones in max noise canceling mode (mode II on the 0-I-II switch). I sit next to a very loud HVAC vent, and while the Sony headphones block 95-98% of the noise (subjectively speaking -- it's hard to judge, because hearing response and perception has a nonlinear response), the Sennheiser headphones block no more than about 80% of the noise. This is probably representative of the difference in noise canceling capabilities of these two headphones while on a plane too, since the white noise profile would probably be quite similar to the sound coming out of this HVAC vent.The third strike against the Sennheiser PXC 550 headphones came when I tried playing music of a range of different genres, streamed over Bluetooth from my phone. In every song I tried, the Sennheiser headphones sounded worse than the Sony headphones. The Sennheiser sound felt a bit more ""distant"" (as opposed to the immediacy / presence of the sound in the Sony headphones), as well as muted in vibrancy, and a bit more ""noisy"" when a lot was going on in the music (making it harder to distinguish separate instruments). Overall, music in the Sennheiser headphones sounded just average -- even a bit dull and un-alive. Not to say the sound quality was actually bad, per se, but it wasn't crisp, full, rich and ""gleaming"" like music in the Sony headphones.In summary, the Sennheiser headphones might be a reasonable deal at the $50-80 price point, but not at $299.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Direct comparison to Sony WH-1000X M2: Sony is substantially better in sound quality, noise canceling abilities, and comfort"

    ","So I've been musing about getting a set of over-the-ear NC headphones for a while. I prefer wireless options just because it's always been easier - have been a big fan of the Plantronics Backbeat Go 2 in the past, but the earbuds just weren't cutting it for me anymore (plus the battery life was terrible).I tried the Bose QC35s and while I appreciated the NC effectiveness, couldn't stand the feeling of pressure in my ears or the subpar (to me) sound quality.So I was excited when I started researching again and found two new competitors to the QC35s. Both priced at $400 USD and both with, on the surface, the same core characteristics: over-the-ear, active noise cancelling, wireless/bluetooth, built-in microphones for calling.The lengthy review below is what I put together over the course of a week travelling around with both sets and trying to compare them head-to-head. Originally posted in another forum I belong to, but leaving them here as well in case they're helpful to others.Getting Bose out of the way:I only really tried the QC35s for half a day before I gave up on them, so I won't go as in-depth to comparing the Sennheiser/Sony sets to the Bose. I will say that overall, Bose had slightly better noise cancelling and significantly worse sound quality than both the Sennheiser and Sony. SQ in particular is of course subjective, but it's something I care about and the Bose SQ just came across as empty and hollow - almost as if it was all mids with no strength in even moderate lows and highs. The real dealbreaker for me on the Bose was the weird pressure sensation it gave me. I've heard it doesn't affect everyone the same, but it caused me enough discomfort to not want to wear them anymore.Note that most of the time I hate dealing with cords, so if I don't mention otherwise, assume that my comments reflect use when connected via Bluetooth and NC turned on.Noise Cancelling:In my opinion, both sets perform very well, with each taking a very slight edge over the other in different scenarios/preferences. I've tried both sets out on airplanes (3 hr flights), the ATL Plane Train, in airport concourses, in a parking garage with my car running and others driving by, in my house with a/c on and landscapers outside, and in a quiet room - both with music playing and music paused to evaluate *just* the NC. Again, both sets did a very good job with NC, so the differences here are pretty minor, and only stand out if you're really looking for them. Short story is that Sennheiser was better at wiping background noise away and getting closer to complete silence (though a very tiny bit of white noise is still left), but they weren't as great at passive noise isolation so some sounds did get through and were identifiable. Sony leaves you with a (very little) bit more white noise than Sennheiser, but that almost helps because non-background sounds are kind of covered up. Sony also seemed to have better passive noise isolation, which I tested out by wearing each set while turned off (or with NC deactivated, since the Sennheisers automatically turn on when you unfold them). As an example of this, I wore both sets right after one another in the air conditioning/landscaper situation - both the a/c and leafblowers went away to an almost unnoticeable hiss on both. But on the Sennheiser, I could clearly hear myself snapping my fingers and could make out the jingle of my dog's collar as she was scratching herself. On the Sony, I doubt I'd have noticed these unless I was actually listening for them. Playing music at a middle volume on either set, neither the white noise nor the snapping/dog collar could be made out at all.Sound Quality (music):Sennheiser wins this one for me. Great clarity at all ranges - bass gets a good thump but stays tight and compact, and highs are very crisp and bright. Vocals, which are my measure of mids, are clear and stand out without overwhelming. That's not to say that the Sony set underperforms at all. It is perfectly nice and clear, with great mids and decent highs. But the lows in the Sony come across a bit looser/muddy, and that at times overwhelms the rest of the range. They are in no way messy like most Beats sets, just ever so slightly less packaged than on the Sennheiser. Basically, the Sony seems tuned a little more heavily toward lower frequencies. And speaking of tuning, probably a big reason that the Sennheisers were so appealing to my ear was because I had the opportunity to ""tune"" their EQ using Sennheiser's ""CapTune"" app. Out of the box, they really didn't sound good at all, but 10 minutes of fiddling with the app and I was able to dial in an EQ that was perfect *for me* - and really, if you're buying a $400 pair of headphones, you really should be spending 10 minutes getting them set up the way you want. Apparently there's also a button on the Sennheiser that triggers different listening modes so you can customize all of those (""Club"" vs ""Movie"" vs ""Director"" or something), but I didn't find a need for that and honsetly the button just got in the way. If Sony has a similar way to customize the EQ for their set, I haven't found it, but would love that ability as I'm sure I could then get the Sony to sound as good as the Sennheiser. As it stands, though, my evaluation is on the final capabilities of each set, and so that lack of customization leaves Sony at a disadvantage. As an aside, I think both sets blow Bose out of the water without question, and the only real reason I can make a distinction between the Sony and Sennheiser is because I was listening to both sets back-to-back - on their own, both are perfectly capable cans and of course some personal preferences and music types may work a lot better with the natural range/EQ of the Sony set.Sound Quality (movies):This is a wash for me. Probably 80% of my use will be for music while working/reading, but I did my part and loaded up some Netflix videos on my phone to try out both, as well as a couple Youtube videos and the CNET reviews for both headphones. Dialogue came through nice and clear and I got focused enough on the content of the videos that I forgot I was supposed to be paying attention to sound quality. At that point, it became a non-issue for me.Call Quality:Sennheiser works much, much better as a headset for phone calls. While on both sets I could hear pretty clearly and the person on the other end said they could hear me fine, Mrs. Lee commented while I was using the Sennheiser set that it sounded even better than if I were just talking straight into the phone (this was in a hotel room with the window a/c unit about 6 feet away from me running). I also did a couple calls to an echo service while swapping out the two sets, and the Sennheiser was noticeably better. A particular calling feature that the Sony is missing is the ability to mute a call from the headset itself. On the Sennheiser, you just swipe back to mute, and swipe forward to unmute. On the Sony, there simply isn't an option. You must mute from your phone/computer. If you don't plan to make lots of calls, it's not a huge deal. But I can see myself using these around my home office to seamlessly go from music to conference calls and back, and it's noticeably missing. The Sennheiser set also seemed to do a better job at isolating my voice from other noise around me - if I dropped a pen on my desk or rolled my office chair around, the Sennheiser would just ""ignore"" those sounds, even while picking up my voice at the same time. If I wasn't talking, I'd get silence back from the echo service. The Sony, on the other hand, would pick up those noises regardless of whether or not I was talking. I just looked at the two boxes and apparently the Sony uses 2 mics for while the Sennheiser uses 4 mics - this probably explains the difference in capabilities for both NC and call quality. Personally, I don't care how its done, I just care what the result is, and however the Sennheiser is set up simply seems to work a little better in these two areas.UPDATE: The SQ for phone calls may have been a bit skewed based on the echo call test I did. I later left a voicemail for myself swapping off between both headsets and then speaking directly into my phone's speakerphone. The Sennheiser was still ever-so-slightly better, but the Sony was still quite clear and perfectly understandable. Both headsets sounded better than my phones speaker function, which picked up much more of the outside world. The missing mute function on the Sony is still a bit annoying, though.Build Quality:Perhaps due to their weight and slightly increased bulk, the Sony just feels better built. That's not to say that the Sennheiser feels weak by any means, but even over just a few days I've found myself feeling like I have to handle the Sennheiser more delicately than the Sony. This might be fine if you just plan to use them around an office, but if you're slinging them around on the road, I'm not sure that's something I want on my mind. Also, the parts and aesthetic of the Sony is that everything fits into place along side the next part, whereas the Sennheiser just doesn't have that look. But from a ""solid"" feeling perspective, this also contributes to the Sony feeling better. Finally, when I was taking a close look at the Sennheiser, I noticed the underside of the arch part that goes to the hinge of each can was hollow (I don't know a better word to use), and the wiring going to the cans was simply covered up by hot glue. I'm sure this is perfectly secure and fine, but by comparison that same part on the Sony, where the same wiring must have been running to go to the cans, is solid plastic with nothing exposed.Comfort (incl. weight):Sennheiser by a hair. The set is noticeably lighter, the tension in the headband squeezes my head more lightly, and the pads are softer and a bit wider, meaning less pressure on the side of my head. The Sony set isn't uncomfortable at all - I wore it through a full day of work while wearing eyeglasses and had no issues at all. The pads are soft enough but a little more firm, as is the ""grip"" that the band puts on your head. The biggest thing is the weight - the Sony set is I think about 1 oz. heavier, but it is a noticeable difference when switching between the two. Again, likely something you might not notice at all if you were not doing back-to-back swaps between the two sets to compare them directly. Neither set made my ears sweat that much, even during brisk walks through the airport terminal or sitting in a hot plane waiting for the APU to start up - more importantly, I didn't notice any heat difference between the two. Even though Sennheiser gets the edge here, I haven't been noticeably uncomfortable with either set and have been perfectly fine wearing both for several hours at a time. I've also successfully fallen asleep while wearing both sets on an airplane.Ambient Noise Management:I have enough to say here to make it its own section, separate from noise cancellation. AND, unlike the other sections I'm even going to use more than one paragraph.- On the Sennheiser, you can get ambient noise pumped in by double-tapping the touchpad, but doing so pauses the music track you're listening to. And you can't use that function at all (as far as I can tell) while on a phone call, as it will just end the call. The Sennheiser allegedly has an ""adaptive NC"" mode where it'll adjust based on your environment, but in my experience there wasn't a huge difference between this setting and just turning ""full"" NC on. The ambient noise modes and NC control are where the Sony really shines over the Sennheiser and becomes a much more versatile set, and the fact that the entire rest of this section is about Ambient Noise modes on the Sony are your first evidence of that.- There are a few different ways to control NC/ambient on the Sony. You can place your palm over the entire touchpad, which lowers the volume on whatever you're listening to and pipes in all ambient sound around you. This basically feels like you've taken the headset off altogether, except that you can still hear your music in the background and any voices coming your way actually sound clearer. For a less temporary ambient mode, you can also mash the Ambient Sound button on the set which toggles through two modes - Ambient Normal and Ambient Voice. Ambient Normal will leave your music playing at full volume, but add to it all of the ambient noise around you (similar to the palm thing, but with music at full volume). Ambient Voice leaves music at full volume, continues to cancel out ""murmur"" noise in the environment, but then identifies and passes-through any ambient sounds similar to a human voice.- Ambient Voice probably sounds like crazy voodoo magic, and it is. And it works surprisingly well in very specific situations. I left this mode on during the first half of a flight, and while the NC continued to wash away most of the engine noise and far-away voices, I could very easily hear PA announcements from the flight deck and FAs right on top of my music. I could also hear the guy next to me when he tried to talk to me, but I could not quite make out the conversation of the couple behind me, nor could I hear the soft-spoken FA offering me a drink. I was able to hear the FA and the couple when I did the palm thing, but perhaps that was because doing so also turned down the volume of my music. Using the same mode in an airport terminal, it did an okay job of separating out PA/gate announcements above the general din, but they didn't pop out as much as they did on the plane, I'm guessing because it's harder to distinguish voices from airport murmer than it is to distinguish voices from engine noise. Either way, I found this to really be an excellent feature that let me listen to music and wipe away most background annoyance while still being attentive to announcements and information. It's not perfect, and there were times I couldn't figure out what an announcement was, but I could always hear enough to at least recognize when I needed to pay attention to something.- The TL;DR version of all this is that Sennheiser only has one way to let in ambient noise, and you have to stop your music to use it, at which point you might as well just take off the headphones. Sony, on the other hand, provides three different ways to let in the outside world, while also leaving your music playing, and all are easily accessible with quick gestures or direct button-presses. For me, this means I can simply just do more with the Sony.Features/Quirks:Both sets have NFC, touchpad controls, etc....so I'm only going to talk about the differences here.- As mentioned earlier, the Sennheiser has slightly better touch controls when it comes to phone calls, with the inclusion of a mute function. The Sony touch controls work just fine and are basically the same (aside from the missing mute), and I didn't have any problems with touch controls on either.- The companion CapTune app for Sennheiser alllows for a great deal of sound customization and even the tweaking of different sound modes that can be accessed by the one physical button on the set. The Sony on the other hand has no such customization, though holding down the NC button for a few seconds plays a fun set of calibration sounds that essentially scans your head and optimizes the way the NC is processed - I used this feature numerous times and was surprised to find that it actually made a huge difference, especially if you switch from wearing glasses to not wearing glasses.- The Sennheiser comes with a somewhat thorough operating manual if that's important to you, wheras the Sony just has one of those fold-out sheets and then you figure the rest out for yourself. I'm sure there's some online guidance somewhere...I've figured out most functions just by Googling them.- The Sony uses a standard 3.5mm jack if you want to plug it in. The Sennheiser uses the smaller 2.5mm jack, which could be annoying. However, the included cord for the Sennheiser has an in-line mic with a call button. Haven't figured out if that means it can be used when the battery is dead.- Speaking of batteries, Sony advertises 20hr life and Sennheiser advertises 30hr life. I didn't have the opportunity to test out those limits, and I don't really plan to have that opportunity in my ordinary usage, so even if that 10hr difference is true, it doesn't matter to me. Both sets charge with a standard micro USB cable and drew power just fine from my laptop, inflight power, and basically any USB brick I could get my hands on.- Power switch - the Sennheiser doesn't have one. It just turns on when you unfold it - kind of cool, but it's not like I'm sitting here turning my heaphones on and off all the time. The Sony has a normal power switch that does exactly what you expect it to do. Both sets have a nice voice that tells you when they're turned on or turned off. Insert joke here about spouses/partners telling you when they're turned on.- Sennheiser provides a 2 year warranty. Sony only provides 1 year. For the price, both of these had better last a helluva lot longer than 2 years.- Both sets list a bunch of acronyms and fun words on their packaging. Sony: SenseEngine, LDAC, DSEE HX, HiRes Audio, S-Master HX, aptX. Sennheiser: aptX CSR, NoiseGard, VoiceMax, Beamforming Array. I don't know what half of these mean - if they made a difference for me, you'll see the result in other parts of this review.- Apparently the Sony set uses Bluetooth 4.1 while Sennheiser uses 4.2. I assume the higher number is better, but I didn't have any problems connecting either set to my phone, tablet, or laptop. If the Sony was coming up short of something as a result of Bluetooth version, I didn't notice it.- If you need your cans to be connected to two devices at the same time, you'll need to go with Sennheiser. I was able to connect them to both my laptop and phone at the same time, and while I didn't try playing music from both at the same time, I was able to receive a phone call while streaming Pandora on my laptop - quick pause on Pandora and off to the phone call I went. By comparison, the Sony wouldn't connect to my phone at all while connected to my laptop. I had to either turn laptop bluetooth off altogether, or disconnect the device manually (a few more clicks through sound settings). I can see this being a hassle since I also use a bluetooth mouse when on the road. Then again, I make more calls on Skype and WebEx than I do on my phone, so...we'll see. When I'm just moving around and my laptop is turned off, the Sony does automatically default back to my phone. Allegedly (per the Sony manual), you CAN connect to multiple devices if you set it up so one device is connected via A2DP and the other via HFP/HSP, but that seems like a lot of work since I have use cases for both profiles on both devices.- Sennheiser has a thing in the app you can toggle that automagically pauses your music when you take the headphones off. It works, but can get overzealous. With this feature activated, I found my music occasionally pausing itself when I was just shuffling around in an airplane seat trying to find my seat belt or getting something out of my bag.Appearance:I'd be comfortable wearing both around an office. The Sony is all black with minimal branding, and the outside of the cans has kind of a leather look. They way it's built, it looks more like one solid piece at all times vs. the Sennheiser. The Sennheiser has some silver accents and is overall more matte looking, but still quite sleek. The Sony appears, to me, slightly more ""chunky"" than the Sennheiser, but it's really a pretty small difference. Extending the Sennheiser reveals more silver that ""pops"" out from the black around it, whereas extending the Sony just reveals a continuation of the headband that is almost unnoticeable. This is really a toss-up: My ideal appearance would be the the shape and size of the Sennheiser but the colors (or lack thereof) and lines of the Sony. This is of course one of the most subjective items on the list.Cases:Sure, these don't matter as much, but it's worth noting that the Sony comes with a hard-shell case and the Sennheiser has this weird, kind of solid, but then meshy around the sides case. Sennheiser case has a pocket on the inside to store a cord and airplane adapter. Sony has a pocket inside for the airplane adapter, then a mesh pocket on the outside for a cord (which I don't like as it tends to snag when you're stuffing the thing inside a bag - would have rather just had the pocket on the inside). Both cases have a felt divider thing to keep the cans from rubbing against each other, but the Sony's is stiff vs. a flimsy/floppy one in the Sennheiser case that makes it get in the way more than it's helpful. Overall, I like the Sony case better.Ultimately, which set is ""better"" is going to depend on your personal preferences and use case. Both of these sets are perfectly capable and in my opinion much better than the Bose QC35. If your priority is purely on comfort and sound quality, the PXC550 is probably your best bet. If your priority is on durability and feature set, the MDR1000X may have a slight edge. After a week of use with both, I don't think you can really go wrong with either of these in the end.",4.0 out of 5 stars,PXC550 vs. Sony MDR1000X

    ","Many people trying to compare this headphones with QC 35 or a Beat's headphones. First, you cant really compare a beats headphone because just they have mediocre sound. Just suitable for rap music. Now we have QC 35 and this PXC550. QC series are the most loved wireless headphones for Americans all the time. Many people think Bose = best wireless and noise canceling  headphones. However, this pxc 550 is what makes you to think differently. Compared to bose, it is expensive because of premium tag attached to it. Bose is more like a medium high brand (actually bose used to be a top premium brand...). As I tested QC 35 and this PXC 550, I can tell the clear difference.1. SoundPXC550: clear low and mid sound. But laxking high sound. For this price, I was at least hoping for some high sound. Come on. Its $400. Interestingly, I could hear some noises coming out from the headphones. Maybe the headphone itself has some.problem producing sound.QC 35: they also have  low and mid but no high. However, their low and mid are very tangled. What I mean by that is their low and mid are too bassy and sound like something is covering their low and mid sound. So, you cant really year the clarity. Overall, I would go for PXC 550. (If you are picky with noise, I would still go for pxc550. Just test them. You can see the difference.)2. DesignNo need to narrow down each product to talk about the design.PXC550 wins. All the way. Period. QC35 still maintaining its old design all the time. PXC 550 has very elegant ear cups and cushions.3. Weight.Pxc 550 is a lot lighter than QC35. Period. This makes you to not to carry QC35 anymore.4. Noise cancelingWell, its 50% 50%. They both have great noise canceling. So, no one really wins for this category.Overall,Although they are few more categories to talk about but I think these are enough. In conclusion, get PXC550 if you want to listen to clear music. However, if you are not audiophile nor serious listener, you can go with QC35 if you want to save that $50. However, that $50 is going to make your earcup design, sound, and weight better than QC 35.",5.0 out of 5 stars,General review of PXC550 compared with QC35.

    ","Mind you, I don't fault the sound quality:  These headphones are perfect in sound reproduction.  I don't have an issue with the wear:  They are super comfortable.  The controls are excellent, the build quality is excellent...but ultimately, I returned them.  Here's why.I was looking for a set of Bluetooth headphones with which I could take critical phone calls without being disturbed by environmental noise and other peoples' voices.  I have a set of Nokia noise-cancelling headphones that do just that, but after an hour or so, I have a pounding headache from the pressure on my ears and on the top of my head.  I can't do that.  So I started looking around and since Sennheiser has legendary sound quality and I've read wonderful things about their noise-cancelling abilities, I decided to spend good money on them.When I got the headphones, I tried them out with music and was blown away by the clarity:  It showed up details (and even flaws) in music I had never noticed.  On the phone, voices sounded fantastic.  Then I took a call and started typing on my computer: I could hear every click as clear as if I didn't have headphones on.  My kids came in and I could hear them at the same volume as the caller.  In short, I heard everything going on around me, plus the caller.  The microphone picked EVERYTHING up.I think the issue here is one of mission:  I am guessing that the people who need this sort of headset want to cut out noise when they are listening to music, but to stay ""situationally aware"" when they are on the phone.  I am not such a person, so I will keep looking.  With all the other features these headphones have (stellar sound, clever design, solid build and that oh-so-cool British voice prompt), I wanted this headset to be my everyday go-to.  With regret, I must keep looking.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, but still disappointed"

336,"on January 13, 2018",,"First of all, the space in the earmuffs is not big enough. The speakers are protected by protuberant plastic, that will most probably touch your ears. All the members of my family make fun of me, because I have small ears. But even I had this very unpleasant pressure from the speakers on my ears. These headphones look nice and feel solid, but there are so many flaws. I did not like the touchpad. What's wrong with small buttons? You could operate them with gloves, they are cheaper to produce and there is less thing to go wrong. The touchpad on the other had will change volume level while wearing a hoodie. The sound is good and the noise canceling is decent, but for a $300 product I certainly wasn't blown away. Also the pressure from the headphones on the head is way too important. It's really not comfortable for long wear. It's a shame, really. These headphones are a missed opportunity to make a good and stylish product.Also the lady telling you to charge the battery is really annoying.

    ","Updated review -- I posted originally on 8/12/16, having had the PXC 550's since the beginning of the month. I had added a couple of updates on the 13th, and this is an updated version as of 8/31, now that I've had these headphones for a month).(NOTE: I purchased these at a bricks and mortar store due to total lack of self-control and the desire to try them even sooner than waiting a day for Amazon to deliver -- next time I'll go back to Amazon to make sure I have the other benefits Prime purchasing offers!).I’ve been an audio fan for more decades than I generally care to admit, going back to high school and college experiments in psycho acoustics, audio perception, compression and noise reduction. I still have the early Dynaco amps I built back then and something of a museum of many of the old speakers I’ve owned over the decades. Headphones became especially important to me about 3 years ago when my career path took me back to a “road warrior” lifestyle, flying weekly to work with clients in remote cities.My weekly flights 3 years back started just a few months before the QC25’s were released, so when I was looking at noise cancelling headphones, QC15 was the big player in this area. I was concerned about some of the reports I read that accurate audio quality was compromised in favor of noise cancelling, so I searched the market more before deciding, and also did quite a bit of my own comparisons. In the end, I decided on a pair of PSB M4U-2 headphones. The noise cancellation on the PSB's isn’t as powerful as the best that Bose offers, but the audio quality is superb.Since then, QC25’s, and now QC35’s have been released. I’ve tried them both several times – admittedly in stores, in less than ideal conditions, but I listed to material I’ve been listening to via my PSB’s over the past year, and had a good basis for comparison. I can imagine the store personnel being a bit irritated as I spent an hour or more dominating their demo units every time I came back to audition the headphones. I was actually a bit startled recently to put on the QC35’s and find them harsh sounding, with the low end sounding “flatter” than I’m used to with the PSB’s excellent depth and spatial qualities. Much as I love the sound of the PSB’s, after 3 years of weekly flights, I’m more interested than ever in excellent noise cancellation and compact packaging in addition to high quality immersive audio. My backpack is absurdly stuffed and heavy – and the PSB’s don’t fold flat the way the Bose and the Sennheiser’s do. Finally – the PSB’s are corded – so I wind up with the bulk and the cord, and as a frequent flier, I’m really interested even in small upgrades in comfort and convenience as well as quality.So – I’ve been looking for wireless, ANC, high quality headphones, and wasn’t quite convinced that the Bose would keep me happy after having spent hours a week with my PSB’s for 2+ years.I started seeing the notices for the PXC 550’s in July (2016) as I recall – and they caught my eye. I’ve been a big fan of Sennheiser for many years, and we have a couple of pair of their high end corded headphones in the family. I’ve been checking for reviews for the PXC 550's, and read the few actual reviews that were published in July based on demo units, and also read the commentary here on Amazon, which seems to have been the best source for meaningful experience before these hit the general market release. As with any product, different people have differing opinions, but this product caught my attention.In early August, as happens all too often, my flight home was delayed (again!), and I had a couple of extra hours to myself, so I wandered the airport and happened across a Brookstone store. I remembered that “Brookstone airport” was the only bricks and mortar location that was supposed to be carrying the PXC 550’s and was thrilled to find them in stock (CLT airport – Charlotte, NC). Turns out there are at least two (I know of two – maybe more?) Brookstone locations at CLT. The salesman at one of them was happy to let me experiment, but he didn’t know anything about the 550’s. We both struggled with Bluetooth pairing, as the folks in the store couldn’t locate the directions in the short time I had left before my flight. We eventually did get the 550’s paired with my phone and the 5 minutes I had to listen were promising, but I wasn’t yet convinced.I walked back to my gate, and unfortunately (or - fortunately, as it turned out!) my flight was delayed yet again – so this time I wandered over to the 2nd Brookstone location in the airport (near terminal C, in CLT). This time I found that the store manager was very familiar with the 550’s. We had my phone paired quickly, and I spent enough time there to decide to give them a try – so I bought them on the spot just before we boarded. Once I was seated I finally got to read direction, try out the wonderful, effortless NFC pairing, download and try out CapTune. It was another hour before the plane actually took off, and then about 2 hours in the air.My primary music source while flying is Google Play Music. My phone is a Droid Turbo 2, which supports aptX (a digital audio data reduction audio codec defined by Qualcomm, common to many Android phones), which is also natively supported by the 550’s (note: iPhone does NOT support aptX at the moment – so the listening experience with 550’s may turn out to be less impressive on iPhones than on high end Android phones – but I can’t speak to that from my own experience).My music library is pretty diverse, and I typically keep about 2,000 songs downloaded onto my phone so I have a good selection when I’m in the air in airplane mode. My music spans Bach (Well Tempered Clavier, Goldberg Variations and the like) through Jazz (Oscar Peterson still blows me away), blues geniuses like Bonnie Raitt, Susan Tedeschi, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Aynsley Lister, Kenny Wayne Shepherd (and many more) and into rock from the 70’s, 80’s and 90’s, hundreds of pop artists and more – all in all, a pretty good sampling.Cut to the chase: I had a blast cruising through my library for 3 hours with the PXC 550’s. Since I first wrote this review, I've been using the headphones daily, and count on them for the two flights a week that I'm on. I'm enjoying them immensely.Some details:Package, Case -The 550’s come in a pretty typical package. Slit through two circular clear plastic stickers holding the lid on the box, and you can slide it open to reveal the half-moon shaped headphone case. As you’ve no doubt seen in pictures by now, the 550’s fold nicely, with the earpieces rotating so they fold flat as well, making for a compact package. The case, when closed, is 2.5” at it’s thickest, 7.5” at its widest point, and the “half moon” shape is about 6.5” at its highest point. The case is nicely made, but it’s not as rigid as the far bulkier case I have with my PSB M4U-2’s or the hard shell that comes with the QC35's. If I force the case into my backpack, it’s likely to get squished. However, if I don’t manhandle it, the case should be fine, and the size is about half what my old PSB’s took up in my bag. Since I first published this review, I've had these on a few more flights, and the headphones and case travel quite well.The package includes basic cables, plugs and adapters that fit in an elastic pocket inside the case, so you can be confident of connecting the 550’s to various wired audio sources as well as using your Bluetooth connection.Sennheiser only provides a quick start guide and standard safety notes in the box – but you can find a full 52 page instruction manual on Sennheiser’s website. I don't seem to be allowed to insert the URL here that points directly to the PDF download from Sennheiser for the manual. As an alternative, use Google to search for a document named, ""PXC550_IM_EN.pdf"" (without the quotes). The search results will point to the download from Sennheiser's website. Good info in the full document - worth the download and read.Among other things, you’ll learn that you can replace the ear cushions when needed, and that the lithium ion battery is also replaceable, although Sennheiser urges you to let them replace the battery while the unit is under warranty (2 years -- actually 3 now - see note below), and thereafter by a repair facility trained / certified by Sennheiser. I have little doubt that I’ll be looking to handle this myself down the road when it’s time to replace the battery, as I've already been doing this with a variety of cell phones that are supposed to be ""permanently sealed"".Upon registering my new PXC 550's on the Sennheiser website, after about 5 minutes I received an email back from them confirming the registration, and noting that my warranty is now 3 years, instead of the original 2 years. Apparently registration provides you with the extra year -- a very nice bonus for 5 minutes of registration effort! I contrast this to the 1 year warranty that Bose offers for the QC35 -- this seems like a relevant point of comparison, among others.Bluetooth ConnectionAs I mentioned above, when I was at the first Brookstone store and we attempted to pair my phone with the 550’s, I did run into problems. Not knowing the proper sequence, I tried turning the 550’s off and on again, searching for them with my phone and selecting them for pairing. Unfortunately, when I tried this, I received error messages on the phone indicating that the 550’s rejected the connection. At the second Brookstone store, a knowledgeable sales manager used the manual pairing process and I was connected in a few seconds. I later unpaired the device and my phone, and tried using NFC, and all I can say about that is wow! The best Bluetooth pairing experience I’ve had – instant and painless.I was surprised that our first experiments with BT pairing were so frustrating. I had come to think of BT pairing as more intuitively obvious at this stage of its evolution, and this was not up to that level. However, with a tiny bit of knowledge, pairing became quick and easy, and using NFC it becomes trivial. The 550’s will remember pairing to 8 devices. When you pair to the 9th, the least frequently used of the remaining 8 will be dropped (per the documentation). In retrospect, my difficulty initially in pairing these was largely due to me not having read the directions -- however I also like to think that a task as routine as Bluetooth pairing should pretty much be intuitively obvious in most instances these days.While typing the initial review, I took a brief break to try pairing with my laptop (Dell XPS15-9530). Happily, this took all of about 10 or 15 seconds. I opened the Windows 10 BT add device dialog, did a long-press on the button on the 550’s that starts manual pairing, confirmed on the laptop, and all was set. Note: the 550’s announce your devices as “phone 1”, “phone 2”, and refer to the laptop as another one of these “phones”.I’ve only spent a few hours so far with my laptop as the music source for the headphones – but recordings such as Susan Tedeschi singing, “Lord Protect My Child”, and Michelle Branch with ""Everywhere"" and ""If Only She Knew"" sound spectacular. The bass is deep, resonant and crystal clear – the kind of tone that gives you chills. The high guitar notes also have a marvelous clarity that conveys something of a 3D sense of depth and reality - clear, sharp, but not at all harsh.Touch ControlsWith my “old” (2 years!) PSB headphones, controls were limited. On the cord there’s a button that I can use to either pause a song or skip to the next one, and a second button that let’s me temporarily defeat noise cancelling so I can hear sounds around me better. Other than that, I had to refer to my phone for any other functions. The 550’s provide a variety of controls right on the headphones themselves, and also via the CapTune app.I had grown fond of touch controls after auditioning the Parrot Zik 2.0 and 3.0 over the past year, and was delighted to find something (another worthy contender – but I passed them over due to only having a 6-hour battery life and ANC significantly less effective than either the Bose or Sennheiser units).I DID find the touch controls a bit “fiddly” at first, as I wasn’t used to them, and accidentally paused music or advanced through my song list a few times. However, after half an hour, I found the touch controls to be quite intuitive, and delightfully convenient, and I no longer make mistakes. Now used to these, I think I’d find any other kind of controls to be pretty primitive and cumbersome. In short – with the touch controls you can easily control volume (swipe up/down), advance or move back through your playlist (swipe forward/back), pause music (press), answer calls, reject calls, put calls on hold, switch between calls on hold, etc. Quite nice – and this all seems to work quite well.As you might expect, when you answer an incoming call, if you’re connected via Bluetooth, the headphones will pause your music and then resume it when your call is complete. If you’re connected via USB cable instead, the headphones can’t pause the music – but they can mute it until the call is over. The 550’s are also quite polite, and nice enough to provide a narrative for you about what they’re doing.Additional ControlsAlong with the touch controls, you have a slide switch to turn Bluetooth on and off, another one to switch ANC from off to adaptive (responsive to external noise level) to full on. I didn’t notice any change in audio quality moving between these, but if there is one it may be more apparent with more listening. There’s also a push button: a long press (4 secs I believe) will start manual Bluetooth pairing. Repeated short presses will cycle between a handful of predefined audio “sound effects”: Club (intended to simulate the spatial sense of a club), Movie (somewhat exaggerated bass – more “excitement”), Speech (emphasizes the tonal range that helps speech to be more intelligible), and “Off” (flat). Each of these has a different combination of effects including Boost, Spatial, Reverb and DLC (not sure about this – perhaps digital limiter / compressor? I believe I recall reading something about dynamic range compression with these headphones). You can also select “Director”, make your own settings, and store them in the phone so they are directly accessible.The “Speech” setting, BTW, is excellent for phone calls. When I’ve used the 550’s to make and receive calls, people on the other end simply say that they can hear me just fine and that the sound quality is excellent. Nice alternative to the portable Bluetooth speakerphone I’ve been carrying for the past 2 years. However if you forget to turn off the ""Speech"" setting when you go back to music, you may start to wonder why your otherwise marvelous headphones are sounding a bit ""thin"" with music.The CapTune mobile app (I’m using the Android version) allows you to select all these settings. I found it very lightweight (quick to load and respond in Android) and responsive. There’s also a full blown equalizer in CapTune, but this only has an effect on the music actually played via Captune – or via Tidal, which would be routed through this app to control audio output. CapTune also has a “sound check” feature that lets you listen to any of your music sources and do A/B comparisons as you experiment with custom settings so you can create a sound profile that’s to your liking.Most of you probably know this already – but the headset doesn’t have a separate “power” switch. When the right ear piece is rotated 90 degrees, the entire unit is turned off. When it’s back in listening position, the 550’s are turned on.How do these sound?Wonderful. Many happy hours of listening to a variety of music gives the same impression: there’s a marvelous sense of depth, space and clarity. Imaging is clean and clear. Bass is strong – but not artificially emphasized and muddy as it is on so many other headphones. Mid-range feels balanced, and is also clear and clean, and highs are excellent: clear and bright without being harsh (as I’ve unfortunately found many other headphones to be). This is one of the most enjoyable sounding headphones I’ve used in several years. I still love the sound of my PSB M4U-2’s, but the 550’s are also excellent for pure listening enjoyment, and are not solely justified for their excellent ANC - these are excellent headphones simply for sheer listening enjoyment as well.As with other excellent headphones I’ve had or used, I find myself getting deeply involved in listening, and lose track of what else is going on around me. Not entirely bad – I should probably be doing more of this!Battery Charging and LifeMine came charged about 20%. Sennheiser recommends a full charge before using these. A full charge from empty is estimated to take about 3 hours. Once charged, the battery should keep these running “up to” 30 hours; my guess is that, with ANC turned on, the total run time will be less, but this is still an excellent number. My primary listening time is twice a week on the plane, as well as any waiting time as I pace around the airport. If I listen just 5 or 6 hours a week, a single charge should keep me going for about a month – maybe more. If you forget to charge your 550’s, you can use one of the included cables and plug your phone into the headphones for passive use. This is fine – but you will NOT have the benefit of ANC with a discharged battery.Fit, Finish and WarrantyThe 550’s are lightweight and appear to be well made. While they’re not quite as luxurious as top of the line corded Sennheisers or Bowers & Wilkins, they are quite nice. The padded leather headband is comfortable, and the ear pieces themselves are a soft matte black with a subtle amount of brushed chrome trim. I’ll know more in a couple of years, but there are no red flags in the materials or design department so far. I find it interesting that Sennheiser chose to make the opening of the ear cushions somewhat small, almost as if they expect you to let the edge of the openings rest behind your ears and directly on your skull. For those who complain that the openings are too small, Sennheiser has an opportunity here to sell a variant on the replacement headphones, with a larger opening. This would be a very easy way to offer alternatives to even better match individual preference.Sennheiser provides a 2-year warranty on purchase, and I found that as soon as I registered the PXC 550's on Sennheiser's website, they extended my warranty to 3 years. I picked mine up at Brookstone (didn’t want to wait even a day for Amazon to deliver – purely did this on impulse while at the airport!) – no idea if an extended warranty is available. If you purchase on Amazon, a 3 year “drops and spills” protection plan is available for about $34, and a 4-year plan is about $51.Summing UpAs I write this updated review, I've been using the PXC 550's heavily - pretty much daily, and twice a week for a multi-hour plane ride, for about a month so far. I’m enjoying them immensely. Not only will I use them on plane rides every week, but I take them out with me when walking my dog, and I can easily see using them any time I’ve got some “alone time” – at home, shopping, going for a walk – especially in a noisy area such as Time Square (NYC). On a recent vacation, I had to call into a business conference call (from the beach house!), and do so when everyone else in the house was asleep. I sat in the kitchen with the PXC 550's on. There was a loud window air conditioner about 8 feet away from me, but the headphones blocked out that noise so I actually forgot that the air conditioner was on. The folks at the other end of the line sounded great to me, and those that I asked reported back that it sounded as if I was on a corded phone.So far - loving the PXC 550's. Excellent noise cancelling, excellent audio quality. Comfortable, sturdy, classy looking. Lightweight and fold compactly for easy travel. Fantastic battery life and a long warranty. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful Bluetooth / Wireless Noise Cancelling Superb Audio Quality Headphones

    ","Sennheiser recently upgraded me to these headphones because I owned a pair of the MM450X wireless, bluetooth, noise-cancelling headphones that had continuous problems holding the bluetooth connection to my phone.  In fact, I went through 3 pairs of the MM450X headphones until I gave up.  I was impressed that Sennheiser responded so quickly with an upgrade.  So, that being said, how are these headphones?  The sound quality and noise cancelling are absolutely outstanding.  I can hear music in my favorite songs that I didn't even know existed!  Also, I travel a lot and using these on planes is brilliant because they really do cancel out nearly all the roar and general noise of an airplane.  So, for these reasons alone, I love them.  However, I have to say there are a lot of bugs with these.  You power them on and off by rotating the right ear cup, which, on its own, is kind of cool.  However, when you wear them, and turn your head, and thus the earcup even a little, they register the movement as you wanting to either cut the power, or pause a call or a song.  Thus, I am constantly battling with calls being put on pause when I turn my head even the slightest.  It is SUPER, SUPER frustrating.  This happens with songs as well--the song will get paused when I turn my head too quickly so I am constantly tapping the side of the headphones to start things up again.  It makes me look like I have a weird tic.  Finally, the bluetooth connection, while better than the MM450X, can be weak, especially if the phone is in a pocket.  Because of all of these issues, I basically have to carry my phone in my hand while using the headphones for music or calls which, in effect, completely defeats the purpose of having wireless headphones.  Finally, the last incredibly annoying issue occurs when I use them with my Mac--the first time you turn them on and pair them to your Mac, they immediately trigger iTunes to open and start playing a song.  Sadly, this continues to happen over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and, well, you get it.  So if I'm trying to watch a movie on my Mac, and I move my head too fast right or left, iTunes will open and start playing the first song on my playlist--YOU CAN'T TURN THIS OFF--I know, I checked all the forums.So, all in all, they are amazing at making music sound like it is supposed to, and the noise cancelling is probably the best on the market, but the bugs in the system are incredibly frustrating and should give you pause when thinking of buying them.Update, Aug 2017--finally went back and saw some of the comments about turning off the smart pause. I did that, and it fixed the issue.  It's too bad that you have to turn this feature off though as it would be cool if it worked properly.",3.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear music in my favorite songs that I didn't even know existed

    ","What an awesome idea Sennheiser has here but fell short on power , the design and  clarity  is there but you have to put the volume all the way up to hear the power , when you spend 400 on headphones you  expect  Clarity and power. The bass is well not that good my bro has audiotecs sounds way better(no amp) , I  listen  To a lot of jazz and hearing that bass is what makes the sound. This is my frist impression of them , as soon as I got to use them the battery doesn't hold the charge and stays at 70% no matter what , but I'm going to have to say they are very  comfortable  As I said good deisign but falls short on power 😓",3.0 out of 5 stars,Fell short

    ","Physical build quality and technical feature wise, these are great. They are also the most comfortable cans I've ever placed on my head.. But $400 great, not quite... TLDR, just look at the pros/consWhen I first pressed play on my music, it was one of the most disappointing moments for spending that much money I've ever had. I've been using Audio Technica ath-m50's for the past 6 years, but needed something to work better with my iPhone 7 while using a portable charger. The sound quality on the Sennheiser didn't even come close. Sadly I've never used anything like the classic HD 800's or even something like the 598's so I can't quite tell if its just Sennheiser I don't like, or if these are a particular weak point in their lineup.Starting from the bottom, here are my cons:- The overall signature is a tad muddy- The captunes app EQ doesn't work at all for me, because its not compatible with any songs streamed or downloaded from apple music. Due to this, the app is actually quite useless for my purposes.- The bluetooth randomly dropped signal and skipped beats a lot even though it was just from my pocket to my head- There is a random bug that happened a couple times where one of the earcups would stop making any sound until i turned them off and on- The slightest bit of wind would cause major static when noise cancellation was turned on- The mids, while pretty clear, are extremely recessed with overtly soft vocals- And the biggest problem, which is the main reason I'm returning them right away, is volume. The max volume on these are about equal to your average over ear headphones at 50%. And if you turn the Senny's down to 50%, its almost silent and you can barely tell the musics on. There is a slight chance I got a defective pair, but from what I've gathered by their tech support, this is the intended function to appease the ""business traveler"" market. I don't care if the noise cancellation is great, I still need to crank up every song to truly immerse myself into the music, otherwise I feel like I'm sitting in the back row of a concert with awful acoustics.Finally, in case you are a casual business traveler that mainly needs these for noise cancellation, here are the pros:- Noise cancellation is almost rival to the Bose QC35. its not quite there, but does give less of the weird pressure feeling- Sound quality is crisp and detailed if you are coming from cheap headphones under $50- Battery life is great- The Bluetooth pairing is super quick and the range is actually very impressive, 30ft+- The touch controls are quite responsive and accurate- The ability to turn noise cancellation off/on is a huge plus vs the Bose- You can keep them plugged into your computer via USB while still being connected to your phone wireless, phone calls pause the computer's music- The call quality is excellent, and people could hear me even when wind was blaring- The double tap to engage external microphones is a great additional feature, but it doesn't make you hear ""Better"" than taking them off like some people have said- The comfort is superb and they never get fatigue",2.0 out of 5 stars,Make sure these are what you are really looking for

    ","First, a bit about me. I'm not an audiophile by any means, just a business traveler who listens to music and movies while traveling.  I believe the type of person these were targeted towards.

When I put the 35's on after the 550, the best I can describe is that it just felt better.Case:  The Bose case is a bit smaller and has a harder outer shell compared to the softer 550's.  I think its less likely to get smashed if I am packing a lot.Sound wise they sounded pretty darn close.  However, the 550 kept skipping.  This was the show stopper.  The 35's did not.  I have a Iphone 6S+ so the phone shouldn't be the problem.Controls:  Honestly, I like the simple controls of the 35. Turn it on and forget it.  The 550 has too many options between the listening choices (Club, movie etc modes) and the swiping controls (of which I accidentally touched by accident and stopped or skipped to the next track).Some will say the 550's has better audio (I can't tell) but between the skipping and the other issues, I'll stick with 35's (and save $50).In the pic, the 35's are on the left.",3.0 out of 5 stars,-)) The cup of the 550 is narrower than the 35's (the inside part-see pic) as as the 35's seem to be more comfortable.

    ","Purchased on PRIME NOW.  These have some issues.BUILD QUALITY - 4/10REALLY BAD for this price range.  Ever pick up a pair of generic headphones from an OEM?  You know, the ones branded differently by various companies?  Well, that's what you're getting here.  Low-grade plastic, adjustable sliders that are uneven (left side much firmer than the right), and cheap pleather wrap.  A complete leap down in quality from the amazing Momentum Wireless.  Switches really cheaply made and implemented.  Honestly, if you didn't know what they were and just saw & felt them, you'd swear they were $50 headphones.COMFORT - 5/10They say they are over-ear, but they definitely scrunch a normal person's ear.

The only way to EQ is to use the button on the headphones, which changes to ""Club"", ""Movie"", or ""Vocal"".  These adjustments are really cheesy and I can't imagine anyone using them at this price point.SOUND - 7/10When the BT connection is stable, it sounds good, but not great.  Very bright/harsh and fatiguing. Bass is decent, but lackluster.  It's an unusual sound signature.ANC - 9/10Pretty good, close to the QC 35, but not quite there.  No audible hissing and 100% ANC level does a great job with most noises.  Still does not quite get to that ""eerie"" feeling Bose gives you.OVERALLSuspect build quality & feels really cheap.

    ","Please let me preface this review with a few comments made after 9 months of use.  These have become indispensable for me for many reasons, some of which are:1.  I now use these for almost everything, simply because they have the best sound of any of my other headphones or earbuds, but also because I can take them anywhere and use them anywhere I have a source, be it phone, iPod, car (illegal if in motion), TV or even just to silence the environment.  I even use them on my ZTR mower sometimes, though it's a shock when I hit something hard that I can't hear :)2.  Watching my TV shows online or on the smart TV, when a commercial comes on with hyper sound... I think you know what I mean, loud loud loud, I don't panic and search for the volume control, I simply, calmly reach up and swipe down on the right earcup... no biggie.3.  There is often a lot of noise in my home.  My wife is Filipina and she talks on the cellphone like there is no phone there, and she yells like it's got to carry for miles.  With this headset on I can sometimes still hear her, but it sounds like she's next door.4.  So quick and easy to recharge this set, and the charge lasts a LONG time... days!5.  Sound quality always immaculate... as good as the source can manage.That said, let's get on with it.First, the End Result:Strapping these little cans onto your head starts a phenomenon.  You don't see the incredible hidden mechanics and electronics involved.  You can't understand the immeasurable design work that has happened.  All you know is that suddenly YOU are standing in the middle of the most up to date, high tech studio yet created.  Everything is natural.  Easy.  As it should be.Bass is not overamplified or pushed.  It is real and relaxed, but omnipresent.  Mid-tones are carrying their proper message, telling the story exactly as the original instrument did.  The highs are endless and accurate.  Crashes crash.  Earth trembles.  Things move.  YOU are there, and you are part of it all.Then you notice that you can pull yourself and your studio OUT of the real world of distractions and noise and make it totally personal.  Everything unrelated is gone.  It is now only YOU and the Music and Technology.But YOU are in full control.  With a finger to your right ear, you can adjust volume, select or reject, pause to answer the phone and return afterward.  On your smartphone you can shape the equalization even to minute detail.  You can allow some outside sound in, just for safety's sake if necessary.  You can of course browse and select just the music or other programming you want just then, at that very moment.Think of it as though you have somehow picked up the sound studio, along with all of its technology and design, and placed it, like a helmet, over your head.  It is not sound compressed into two little cans,it is your head and ears and brain expanded to fill that studio.Apology:  Since I was one of the very first people to receive and review this product, I received it before the full manual was available and before the drivers for windows 10 were updated (by Microsoft).  This meant that the original version of this review contained many many problems that took a while to sort out.  When the drivers for my computer were updated, suddenly it just started to work properly.  I may not have made that clear in my final version... there was a lot of work involved getting things going under these circumstances and it resulted in some ""not helpful votes"" even though I was working very hard to write a decent-but-not-too-technical review.  Checking out the comments will show some of the difficulties as others tried to help me.  I'm pleased to say that in the end, all of the issues were solved and I am very, very pleased with the PXC-550 system.  Defensive, even.SUMMARY:Sleek and comfortable.Excellent sound quality.Commands and controls centered upon 3 switches and a variety of ""taps & swipes"".Best Noise Cancellation performance I have experienced.Phone calls are crisp and noise-free, easily controlled by the ""swipe"" system.Long battery performance, charges via USB.Phone Music App adds features and dimensions and is easy to understand and manipulate.Connects to my Android Phone and my Windows 10 ASUS PC at the SAME TIME.USB interface between my Windows 10 PC actively detects the PXC and treats it as an external sound card with full control from the switches and swipe panel.DETAILED INSTALLATION AND FEATURES:1.  Packaging: Simple but sturdy box lined with foam, about 7 X 8 X 2.5 inches. No anti-theft plastic barrier, no tape to find. Lift the top off and you are inside.2. What's Inside? Nice hard sided zipper purse. Opens into a V shape and exposes the collapsed phones, webbed area with wires and connectors, and the basic minimal literature.3. My first response to opening a new set of phones is to put them on. I did that by swiveling out the ear cups, adjusting the headband and slipping them on. The ear cups are of course ""Over The Ear"" but looked to be a little small. However they are designed to go completely around and below the your ear flap, so you kind of slide your ear under the cup cushion as you put them in place.  This brings the seal closer to your ear hole and makes the fit both comfortable and fully sealed against your skull.As soon as I put them on, the unit said to me: ""Pairing!""4. Swiveling the ear cups into position turns the power on... so we are off to a fairly innovative start. But there seems to be a slight caveat with that, in that in order to listen with the headphone CORD (not using Bluetooth) you of course swivel the cups to put it on your head, so power still turns on... but of course that means the Active Noise Cancellation feature is working as well as the various “modes” (Club, Speach, etc.).  This simply means, I guess, that unless you are physically switched to “Bluetooth OFF”, “ANC OFF”, etc, you are still using your battery.  It could mean that if your battery were to die, perhaps on a long air flight, the passive would still work, but I'll have to wait for an actual manual to know if there is a way to do this without running the battery down.  With the ear cups swiveled out (power off) I can still hear the music when on the CORD, but of course can't put them on my ears without turning the power on.5. Bluetooth connected instantly to my Android Cellphone (BLU Studio Energy 2) and downloading the CapTune app from GooglePlay (free) added a new music player and highly detailed EQ to the phone as well as precise adjustment of the Noise Cancellation.  You will like this app for sure.6. I had a lot more trouble connecting the PXC to my Windows 10 desktop.  I am not sure what the problem was... probably additional drivers had to be added to Windows.  At first neither unit could pair, then with multiple attempts, suddenly the computer could see and identify the PXC.  I kept trying for over a week.  The final time, I kept it in a situation where the computer said it was connected to the PXC, but the headphones continued to say “Pairing” again and again for many minutes.  Then suddenly the voice announced “Phone 2 Connected” and the full connection was made.  Call the computer what you like, I'm happy to have the connection made.7. Controls for the PXC are many, but without the CapTune app on the PC, of course you can't do the detailed equilization steps or the percentage of Active Noise Cancellation you prefer.  Perhaps there will be something offered soon that can be downloaded to the compter. Updated Windows drivers now allow the USB connection mentioned in the Amazon description and this allows the circuitry in the PXC 550 to act as an external sound card.  So now you can connect via the analog cable for passive listening, USB for charging and listening at the same time, or of course Bluetooth for full utilization or CapTune.  There is not yet software available to fully control the set from Windows, but I will update as I learn more.8.  Physical controls on the PXC consist of 3 switches plus tap and swipe capability on the flat elipse on the back of the right earcup.  Switches are for Bluetooth on/off (hidden away somewhat behind the headband so that you don't find it by accident), Active Noise Cancellation on/off and a multipurpose pushbutton that steps between EQ effect modes (Club, Movie, Speech and Off) that effectively changes the response curve.  The pushbutton when held 4 seconds will make it go into pairing mode if you want to connect to a new source.  All of these switches are virtually unidentifiable.  You must know which is which by the instructions, but it's not difficult to learn.  There are virtually no labels on them.  The flat oval on the back of the right earcup is like the tap and swipe controls on most cellphones, and this controls volume, skip forward/backward, pause/play, etc.  This feature also manipulates the phone when you get calls.  I won't go into details, it is simple and easy to learn, but easy to accidentally trigger the tap (pause) when trying to do other things or adjust the position of the headphones themselves.  It's a step in the right direction, but needs refining.9.  Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is easily tested by pausing your music and listening to the noise coming from outside the headphones.  After you've thought to yourself, hey that's pretty amazing, just take off the headphones and listen to the same noise... you will be astounded by how loud your environment actually is (while your ears adjust to the noise).  It really is incredible!  Though this is the very best noise cancellation I've ever found, it is not perfect.  If you don't have program material playing you can still hear someone talking, sounding far away, when it is actually your wife speaking loudly to you from not so far away!  In addition, I would not recommend these for running or listening in windy situations because the wind blows across the mics that are picking up the noise you want to cancel, and you do hear that wind.  Shouldn't be a problem sitting in your lounge chair or on the Business Class flight.  Maybe Sennheiser will come up with a “wind plug” for situations like that.10.  Sound quality: Perhaps best described as EASY.  I don't mean easy to hear or easy to ignore, I mean it sounds like the system is making no effort whatsoever to create the sound.  It is natural.  Especially the bass.  With most sound systems, not just headphones, bass usually sounds over-amplified and forced to me, but with the PXC 550 it is easy and natural.  Even listening to the bass drum I hear harmonics I've never heard before.  The sound, in all, is complete in range, smooth and realistic.  If you want extra bass, of course it is there, and it is not coming from inside your head like with earbuds, it has more feeling of authenticity coming from outside your ear.  I love the sound and I love how CapTune allows me to adjust it however I want it for whatever I'm listening to.11.  Speaking of CapTune, the control and player app, you should really download this for your smartphone because it sets up your full library, equilizer, ANC percentages, plus some other things.  It is better than any of the other players I use.12. Comfort:  In all, I had the set on my ears about 6 hours today with a few short breaks for conversation. Not one time did I feel any discomfort whatsoever. I've been a DJ as a sideline, working clubs and radio and was constantly pulling off the ""cans"" any chance I got, so these really did impress and please me. I can easily see why they are designed for long air flights.13.  Basic ""Listening Test"" summarized by saying, if you sit in a comfy chair, set your Noise cancellation properly and lean back with your eyes closed, even with several maids chattering and running vacuums... you can still easily imagine you are in the recording studio with your music source. I'm serious, it's that good. I know, because that is exactly what I was doing today... my wife runs a cleaning service :) I fly internationally quite a bit, and believe me I will never fly without this headset. With no music playing, turning on the noise cancellation leaves you in a peaceful, virtually silent Utopia.... almost.  Remember that your own ears auto-adjust their own volume controls to bring quiet sounds louder and make loud sounds more endurable.  So listening (as other reviewers mention) with the music turned off, but the noise cancellation turned on will reduce the loudness, but you can listen past it and actually hear things you probably would not notice otherwise.  To test this, go through the procedure and then simply lift the PXC off of your ears... it will be surprising how very loud your car, your airplane, your air conditioner, your wife... whatever... is!  The ANC system on these is pretty amazing if you try this trick.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"9 MONTH UPDATE:  Very modern, Very elegant, Quite stunning"

    ","Great all around do everything headphone.  NC not as good as Bose.Let me start this review by stating that my noise canceling headphones are used almost exclusively in noisy environments, mostly on airplanes.  For anything else I use one of several pairs of wired headphones which don't have the inherit limitations that currently exist with bluetooth.Noise Cancellation:I really wanted these to be better than the QC35 and in many ways they were, but not in noise cancellation.  I tried them back to back on an airplane and the Bose were noticeably superior.  More noise was blocked out by the QC35.  For the PXC550 the noise that was coming through appeared to be on the higher end of the spectrum and more noticeable.  Excellent NC on the PXC550 but not as good as the QC35Sound Quality:Plug in the cable and these shine.  Crisper, deeper, clearer and wider than the QC35.  Better sound all aroundBuild Quality:Very subjective, but I love the look/feel of the PXC550 vs. the QC35.  These really feel like a premium product, but band is tighter than the QC35Other:When plugged into a computer via USB, these register as a Sound Device making it a breeze to take calls or use applications such as Skype.  The case is a bit flimsy and not nearly as compact as the QC35.  Minor gripe, but it was a bit of pain to fit the semi-circle into my bag vs. the rectangular shape of the QC35 case.If you're buying one all around pair of headphones to do everything, these are a great choice.  If you're purchasing mainly for Noise Cancellation then i'd suggest the Bose.  In my case I have several pairs of wired headphones with superior audio and was purchasing solely for NC.  So the even though these had more features and better sound quality, the Bose was ahead where it counts.",4.0 out of 5 stars,All Around Great Pair of Headphones ... but NC not as good as QC35.

    ","I preordered these and I was so excited about them having read all the reviews.  They are great headphones, they have all the bells and whistles, but if you need ANC as much as I do, I would go for BOSE, even though I like the sound of these way better.  The touch controls are very responsive and easy to learn, the sound requires some fiddling with the EQ, but they sound great after you tune them to your liking.  I think the BOSE QC35 are more comfortable having wider ear cups.  I would have kept them if it hadn't been for the ANC being subpar in my set, maybe I got a lemon since other reviewers said these trump BOSE, but in my experience, they don't, ANC is not even close to BOSE's offering.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones, not so good if ANC is your priority"

    ","I've owned a few bluetooth headsets and this one is by far the best. It's easily paired with multiple devices and intelligently fails over between them as they become available. This makes it easy to setup on both my iPhone and my Mac. Simple connection to both devices, which seems obvious, but so many headsets just can't do this. The passthrough feature is great. Double tap the side and the mic plays through the headphones. That's super handy when you need to answer a flight attendant on a plane without taking off the headsets. The touch pad controls are really great and the ability to pause music by just lifting the headphones off a bit is very handy.

    ","The short version:That seems to be draw of manufacturers of sound and video equipment. A lot of people brag that they have a (fill in the brand name) as if this puts them a notch above someone else. And just as many will reverse the argument.I’ve been using Panasonic headphones for 2 years (list $150, paid under $30). The Sennheiser (currently $400) has slightly more treble and slightly less bass. I make videos that include symphonic music so quality is of utmost importance. So this is not a negative on the Sennheiser, its just how good the Panasonic is. If you love super base, neither of these are right for you.I have a high end sound system for the house. I like that both headphones get me to a pleasing sound quality when I can’t sit in front of my multi-speaker setup. The Panasonic is corded, so being able to go wireless means I can walk away from my immediate work area. Both of these headphones are around the ear and have microphones. The Sennheiser is a little better at noise cancellation.They are equally comfortable for extended use. But this is a personal issue because it involves your head and ear size (the Panasonic is built for larger ears). Likewise, what you are willing to pay for the sound most pleasing to you. Had I not experienced the Panasonic quality, I’d unhesitatingly rate the Sennheiser 5 stars. If cost is a major factor for you, consider these 4 stars.The long version:The headphones are light weight and have nice soft ear pads that fit perfectly around my ears. It was snug enough that it even blocked out the sound of my desk fan without me even activating the noise cancellation feature.BluetoothThe pairing was very easy to accomplish - simply turn on the head phone by twisting the ear cups (so they are oriented to fit over your ears) and turn BlueTooth on for your device. A few seconds later the headphone’s identifying number showed up on my mobile device and I was connected. Moments later I was listening to my music.Direct connect wireSince these headphones are designed for air travel and the flight crews usually don’t want you to use Bluetooth during the flight, the headset comes with a wire that you can use to connect between your device and the headphones. Once again the music sounded perfect.MicrophoneThe Direct connect wire includes a microphone. Since I don’t have a smart phone to test the headphone’s microphone for a phone call, I plugged it into my computer and started dictating a few paragraphs in my word processing program. The words showed up in my document just as expected.Volume and other controlsI have mixed feelings about the headset’s Music and Call controls. They are accessed from the right ear cup. There are no raised areas indicating where the controls are. You simply place your finger on the outside of the ear cup and swipe up or down to increase and decrease the volume and left or right to play the next or previous song. This is kind of cool except that tapping on the headset stops and starts the music playing. So there were several times when I was trying to adjust the volume and I accidentally stopped the music playing. Not a deal breaker, just a slight irritation.My only real negative about the headset is the lack of a manual (either written or electronic). No manual could be found on their web site. Most can be figured out from the fold out instruction page that came with the headphone, but not everything is covered. Hopefully they will eventually post a manual on their web site.Bottom lineOver-all I am pleased with the look and feel of the headphone plus I like the clarity of the music that it plays. I just hope that the continual twisting of the ear cups to put the headphone back in its case doesn’t eventually wear out the wire connecting the two ear cups (if there is one), and then make the unit useless. Only time will tell.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good sound but a paying a premium for the brand

    ","I bought this headset from Frys for $288 and really like it so far. I compared it directly with my brother's Bose QC35 and we both agreed that the sound quality of the Sennheiser is much better. I have read some reviews saying the sound of QC35 is better. Maybe those customers prefer more bass. In fact, in term of bass, the QC35 has more quantity and is a little bit more extended (go lower). However, the bass in Sennheiser is more articulate/tighter. You can clearly the bass line/notes, while it's blurry in the Bose. Same for the mid/vocal, it's cleaner and clearer, more being there in the Sennheiser while I feel like it's a bit muddier, more distant in the Bose. Highs in Sennheiser also have more details. Overall, Bose QC35 sounds more processed (to create the effect of being spacious) with emphasis on bass while Sennheiser PXC550 sound more neutral and natural. I also like Bose headphones in general as I have the older version. But after getting the Sennheiser, I gave the Bose to my daughter as I feel like it's class below the Sennheiser sound wise.In term of NC, I don't hear much difference between the two. The Bose might be a hair better but it doesn't matter much. I like how quiet it is in the Sennheiser in NC mode, no static noise.Bluetooth connection and quality is equally great in both.One issue I have with the Sennheiser is the relatively small earcups for an overear headset.

    ","I had scored some Sennheiser PX 360's a while ago and they were great, they also let me know how good of headphones Sennheiser makes and they only broke because somebody else had yanked the headphone jack off of them. So I needed some new headphones and I got these because I didn't really like the cables and had heard good things about them. Being able to have both my phone and computer connected at once is great because if I ever have a phone call I only have to press the side and I'm talking through the headphones then afterwords I can just go back to the computer almost seamlessly+ Amazing sound quality+ So many great features+ Adaptive noise canceling is awesome- About the only bad thing I can say is that it has so many options it can be hard to remember what action does what",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones I've ever had
365,"on November 30, 2017",,"I purchased my PXC 550 headset from another online company on black Friday at a far better price.  So far the sound quality is much better than the sub $100 headphones they replaced.  I also considered the Sony's but with Sony's past policies I couldn't justify giving them any of my money.  Sennheiser has been making top quality headphones for as long as I remember and they don't improve the sound of cheap hardware with electronic tweaking like Bose.The reason for deducting one star is the abysmal quick start guide included with the headphones.  I mean when spending so much for a high end product, I expect reasonable documentation.  I really don't care that it comes in a super nice presentation box and would gladly exchange a lesser box for better documentation. Even the online PDF instructions that I downloaded from the Sennheiser website could use some major revisions.

366,"on January 12, 2017",,"I got these for X-mas and I really love them. They sound great, not as good as my Momentums, but really good for bluetooth, definitely cannot complain. The noise cancelling works really well, doesn't block out 100% but when you turn on some music you definitely cannot hear anything. It does, however, completely remove the sound of the jet engines on an airplane, which makes sense and are probably in some ways optimized to filter out that sort of sound. And with the app you can adjust how strong the noise cancelling is, although I prefer either just have it on 100% or 0%, but thats also a really easy option with the small switch on the side. And with the app you can also customize the sound to your liking, which actually has a ton of options. Perhaps my favorite feature though is the double-tap that pauses your music and instantly turns on the microphones so you can hear the world around you, works really well. Although I think headphones like this are so new that people don't understand that that is an option, so I actually feel sort of dumb if I try talking to someone like a barista if I do not take them off. I guess that will become more comfortable to do and common knowledge as more people are walking around with headphones like these. Battery life is awesome and I am really impressed. Overall, yes they are expensive but in my opinion really worth it.My only negative are that they can get warm with the leather, and they have a soft rubber coating on them that is terrible for my greasy fingers, I am always trying to wipe them off so the premium look of these isn't tainted by my greasy fingerprints.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Sound, Awesome Customization, ANC Works Great, Very Satisfied"
367,"on November 28, 2016",,"update: after having these for about a year now, I am deducting 1 star maybe more. The headphones suddenly started having issues. I would turn the headphones on and as soon as I put them on my head, the voice will tell me power off. And if I kind of move them around, the power comes back on and likewise goes off. on off on off. you get the picture. Wondering if it's the battery. I use it for maybe 3 hours on most days. I would expect a product of this price range to last longer after 1 year. Am sending it back for repair. We'll see how it goes from there.I'm lucky enough to be passing through London Heathrow where there are plenty of stores with these on display next to the bose qc 35 for me to compare. I've been following both closely for the past 2 months. I found the sennheiser to fit me better. To me it looks a lot better than the bose. Sound quality and NC to me is so difficult to differentiate between the two.  I really can't definitively say one is better than the other in quality. However, the bose has 1 major deal breaker for me. The only way I can describe it is that the bose NC feels like a  vacuum to me trying to suck out my eardrums. It's somewhat annoying and after about 5 minutes I get a headache.  I like the touch features of the sennheiser a lot and it's ability to turn off NC is important to me. I have no way of testing out the benefits of aptx on these 550s. Finally, here is the kicker. I bought these in London Heathrow airport(terminal 5). Thanks to brexit these puppies cost a total of 270 pounds. I had to do a double take. Oddly the bose was only 10 pounds cheaper.",4.0 out of 5 stars,These were awesome but now it's not quite working.

All I can say are these headphones play back my music the way ""I"" like it.  Good/proper solid bass, crisp clean treble and satisfyingly clear mid-range.  I've really come to appreciate the Active Noise Canceling technology of these headphones.  Quietness on my flights is pleasing bonus...  Good bye to all that engine droning.  I found CapTunes to be a useful Android app that takes over where HTC's Boom Sound stops, plus giving the listener a bit more control over the sound being delivered via Bluetooth.  If you want more control over how your music sounds, you can't beat the few dollars spent purchasing PowerAmp from the Play Store.  PowerAmp just shines brighter with these headphones.  Next, the intuitive user controls are just that, intuitive.  They work well with just a little learning curve.  I did turn off the auto stop/play function as just lifting the right ear cup off my head would stop the playing, which for me was a nuisance.

Setup instruction is VERY difficult to understand, and the text is microscopic.The headset pairs nicely with most Apple devices.

    ","I'm kind of an headphone junkie.  I have never really been entirely happy with any of my headphones.  The ATH-M50x sound great but the cord keeps getting in the way.  The Bragi Dash are an engineering marvel but the battery life doesn't last long enough for an entire workday and having in-ear headphones on for that long makes my ears itch.  My wife sighed audibly when I told her I ordered yet another pair.  I couldn't be happier, though.  These have all the features I loved from my first generation Ziks (see, total junkie) but without the added weight.The Smart Pause (the feature that pauses the music when you take off the headphones and resumes when you put them back on) is a great feature for those of us that are interrupted often throughout the day.  Although I don't plan to use them for phone calls, I tried them out and the audio quality was perfect.  I also like the fact that you can tone down (or turn off) the active noise cancellation.  One of my biggest complaints with ANC deals with the weird pressure sensation that I get in my ears when I have them on.  My Bose Quietcomfort 15s (my addiction is kind of out of control) give me a headache if I wear them too long.  The PXC 550's, however, let you dial down the ANC level.  I have them currently set to 25% and that seems to be just enough to cut down on the ambient noise but also not give me a headache.As for earcup size, these are snug but they do fit.  I tried the Sennheiser Momentums which are advertised as ""over-ear"" but the earcup holes were so small that they turned out to be ""on-ear"" and my ears hurt after less than an hour's worth of use.  The PXC 550 are a good size for my ears.The battery life is incredible, at least on paper.  My first-gen Ziks lasted maybe 6 hours, I ended up having to buy another battery to make it through a full day.  The PXC 550s claim long life but I have not personally put them to the long-life test.  As long as they make it at least 8 hours I'll be happy.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Drug of choice for an earphone junkie

But the MUSIC QUALITY that these headphones are producing are far from what i expected. its comfortable to use no ear fatigue(well it all depends on the shape of your ears i guess) if you are up for a wireless headphones and wants an AWESOME Sound Quality with great noise cancelling this one is for you. but if your prefer awesome NC and good Sound Quality look for others,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this headphone

I can be using machines and free weights without interrupting my workout to change the song or volume. And of course, there are no wires to worry about tangling.The volume is significantly lower on these than other headphones I have owned, but it still has the range that I desire, so unless you listen to your music really loud (like ""permanent ear damage loud"") then you should find the volume spectrum satisfactory as well.Overall, excellent sound quality with Bluetooth connection to match, all enclosed within a comfortable, convenient pair of headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound quality, flawless Bluetooth connection, very comfortable"

    ","The Sennheiser PXC 550 are almost, almost there.  I so wanted to love these.  It was painful to come to the decision that despite their flawless cord to BT switching, and multiple device pairing, and call handling, that there were two areas that just didn't cut it.1) Comfort, they focused on travel size and shrunk the size of the phones to no longer be over ear but on ear.  This and the head band was stiffer and had less padding.  I could wear these for 15 minutes and be happy when I took them off. As many others described it, their ears felt hot wearing them, a common sign of fatigue in wearing headphones.2) The audio quality, even with their special app, was just not up to par.  Even using the USB cable connected to the laptop where it does this amazing job of allowing for much better audio through the USB cable, but still could not match the pair of Sennheiser HD 598's I got.Ultimately it was a combination of both that really pushed me to return them.  I picked up the HD 598 for $120, compared to these for around $300.  For that price I was expecting the same performance and comfort that is what Sennheiser stands for.The noise cancelling was decent, not as good as Bose, but enough that my wife would get mad as she was leaving for work as I could not hear anything she said if I had a little music playing.  That's sort of the key to their noise cancelling, it works fantastically with other noise going through them, but only mediocre as a system by themselves.  Add to it that they get uncomfortable for extended periods of time and I couldn't see making the 14hr trans-pacific flights with these on.The touch interface left me wanting.  Solid buttons still have their place, and it would have been great to have a single button I could press and hold, or press again, to allow pass through for conversation, but alas it is stuck in their touch menu somewhere with a two taps to turn on, two to turn off, but don't confuse it with tap to pause, or volume, or something else.  Most functions I would have welcomed a solid button to press as many have reported the touch on the side can accidentally get pressed when trying to watch a movie in bed, or even simply adjust the uncomfortable headset.  This wasn't the deal breaker, I could learn to deal with it, but it is an annoyance.I will be waiting for the next generation to come out that fixes these issues, for now I'll be going with the HD 598 for an affordable over the ear headset.",3.0 out of 5 stars,They miss the mark on too many levels

    ","First and foremost, these things are loud. I mean, they get painfully loud. Granted, I don't usually listen to extremely loud music, but there's no way I would want them to be louder than they can go. I have no idea why so many reviews complain about the volume. Maybe they updated the firmware or something, or maybe it was a user issue? I noticed right away that you have two volume controls you have to mess with. First, the volume on your source. For wireless use, that's the Bluetooth volume. For wired, it's the normal phone volume or whatever other source. Then you have to adjust the volume n the headphone themselves using the earpiece interface. It works well, and it's LOUD.I've only had this a couple days, but so far I am pleased. The sound quality is good. I don't know that I would call it awesome, but it seems clear. I would compare it favorably with my Sennheiser 598 Cs headphones. Personally, I can't really tell a difference between wired and Bluetooth (I was using aptX), and I also can't tell the difference between using the noise cancellation and having it disabled (in terms of sound quality only).The noise cancellation works well. It produces absolute silence with normal noises like the heater running. I was also impressed that it did a great job of blocking out the bass line of music playing from the floor above. It does not block out higher pitched random noises, like normal talking voices, but I didn't expect it to.The earphones are very comfortable to wear in terms of padding. My ONLY complaint about the comfort is that the ear cups are rather small. My ears fit in them, but I have to sort of wiggle them on to get them to seal around my ears. And I don't have particularly large ears (at least, I don't think so...) for a normal 6'2"" male. So that part is a bit disappointing. But they don't feel too tight on my head, and there is great padding on the band. And the ear cup padding is so incredibly soft/squishy. It's weird compared to my other headphones, but not in a bad way. I think I'll like it quite a bit.Interface - I like the controls just fine. The touch controls seem to work well, and they are intuitive enough. I don't feel like I have to memorize a bunch of button sequences or anything like that. And it's nice having a switch for the noise cancelling. I'm not crazy about the CapTune app interface. It doesn't seem very staightforward, but I'll have to play around with it some more before I completely pass judgement.For now, I'm docking one star for the ear cup size. I'm looking forward to getting these to the office and trying them out more. If any other details of note come up, I'll update this review.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is LOUD!

    ","After spending several weeks researching different headphones and comparing every brand, model, and wired vs wireless headphones, I decided on the PXC 550 wireless headphones. Throughout the process I personally tested at least a dozen different higher end headphones in addition to reading 200+ reviews and articles. Overall, these bad boys really are as good as they say. I've had them for about 2 months now and I am still impressed and happy with my decision. I also own pairs of Sony, Beats, and Bose headphones, so those are the brands with which I've head most of my long term experience.The Sennheiser PXC 550's active noise cancelling is very similar to what Bose offers and I can not tell the difference between the two. The Sony and Beats headphones have almost none, so there's no comparison there. I also tried a few lesser known brands and to avoid redundancy I can just tell you they all also lagged in this department comparatively.The sound quality of the PXC 550's is exponentially better than the Sony, Beats, and Bose headsets I've tested. I've always heard great things about Sennheiser and the sound quality of these headphones is as good as or better than every other model I tested, including wired ones in this price range.They also have much more of a luxurious look and feel when compared to the flimsy plastic used by Bose, Beats, and Sony.In addition to music and movies, I frequently use them to make hands free phone calls and I've not had a single person have an issue hearing me. In fact, they have no idea I'm using the headphones instead of my phone's microphone. There's none of the tunnel-effect you hear when using lower end models.Finally, they're much easier than the Sony's at connecting to my devices since the PXC 550's connect automatically when turned on and turn on automatically when the headphones are in use. I never realized how much of a hassle all that could be until I didn't have to do it anymore. Likewise, the touch controls work very well, albeit after a small learning curve. In the beginning you will accidentally pause or change your music or hang up on a phone call, but once you've trained yourself on how it all works you won't have any problems.I highly recommend these headphones. I just wish I could go back in time to tell myself that, so I wouldn't have had to waste so much time and energy looking for them. Save yourself the stress and just buy these. I promise you will be happy!",5.0 out of 5 stars,And The Verdict Is...BEST HEADPHONES ON THE MARKET!

396,"on February 22, 2018",,"This wireless, noise-cancelling headset can be used for listening or phone conversations, or for when you just need things to be quieter.  I compared it to a set of Bose QC35, which is in the same price range and reportedly similar capabilities.  I have been using it intermittently for the last week, mostly in an office setting.Cons:- Touchpad control with context-sensitive swipes, taps, and holds.  It's easy to do something without meaning to (like hanging up the phone, redialing, turning on or off music, turning off noise-cancellation).  Very annoying, and almost a deal-breaker right there.- When connected to a computer via bluetooth, telecoms apps like Skype and Webex don't work well through this set.- Its soft-shell carrying case is made of nice-feeling material but does not provide robust protection.  The Bose set is much better in this respect.- Mechanical controls (a button and two mechanical slides) are TINY.  Hard to even find them, much less see what they are set to.- When using it as a phone headset, callers on the other end mentioned that I sounded ""far away"".Pros:- Music sounds great.  Clearer than the Bose set.- Noise cancelling is very good.  Not quite as good as the Bose.- On/off switch when you fold/unfold them.  If they're folded they're off.  Not folded, on.  No worries about whether you left them on to run down the batteries.- Bluetooth connection to phone works well, pairs easily, and has reasonably long range.- USB connection to computer seems to work well with Skype and Webex.- Comfortable to wear.  I have a large head and fairly large ears, and the earcups fit over nicely and seal well.- Comfortable to listen to.  They don't make that ""pressurized"" feeling that Bose users sometimes report (I noticed it also)- Battery life seems good.  Sennheiser claims 30 Hrs.  I've been using mine for about 20 without a recharge so far.  Recharges with a standard micro-USB cable.- Feels solidly made.  Hinges, slides, and swivels move smoothly, and feel like they could stand some aggressive use.Other comments:- The noise cancelling is adjustable, in case you want to dial back the effect.  The adjustment can only be made via a phone using the Sennheiser app.- Can also be connected to phone or computer by USB cable or standard audio cable.  Automatically turns off bluetooth when a cable is connected, which is good for use on airplanes.- Can be used for listening to music after the battery has run down.  I have not tried it.- The Sennheiser app can be used to adjust equalizer settings on other speakers that connect to your phone, such as the phone's internal speakers or a car's bluetooth.  Each speaker is adjusted independently.- There is an auto-pause feature that is supposed to pause your music when you take off the headset.  I found that it stops and starts the music inconsistently.  That feature can only be turned on or off using the app, and by default it is ""off"".- A much less expensive alternative is the Audio-technica ATH-ANC7B SVIS.  It is a step below the Bose in sound cancelling and a step below the Sennheiser in sound quality, needs a wire for connections and doesn't have the fancy digital features.  But at 1/3 the price it is quite serviceble.  I am thinking about going back to that one.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound.  Clever features.  Deeply flawed controls

    ","Great! my only complaints are that the max volume isn't very high. they are fairly clampy, and hurt a bit.  i cant  receive audio wirelessly simultaneously while using the cable, and the aux plug being on the right side is a real shame.-Update: uh..i am updating and lowering my review after using this headset for about a month now.Major Alert- if you are planning on gaming with this headset, DO NOT BUY IT. it has a major issue- when entering any game that supports voice chat, the sound mutes, meaning i have to manually disable the microphone in the windows sound options, otherwise the game will have no sound. this obviously means i cannot use the microphone for games. i suspect this is because windows detects this headset as two playback devices, one for normal audio, and one for voice chat (hands-free ).-After a month of daily use, the headset is still as tight and clamping as the day i got it , i hoped it will loosen as time goes, but that doesn't seems to be the case. i have to take it off after listening to music / movies for an hour to give my head a break from the pain.- these being able to connect to two Bluetooth devices is a bit misleading. sure, i can connect both my computer and smartphone. but if i listen to something on my computer and do as little as unlock my phone, the phone will take over the sound, and will disconnect my computer. forcing me to turn off and on the headphones to continue listening to the computer, quite annoying.Update 2: MUSICIANS BEWARE!i always wondered why the volume sounded fairly low on these headphones. now i know.i recently started using these as a digital piano monitors, when i want to play quietly. boy was i shocked when i discovered these headphones will actively sabotage the max volume. when i hit a note hard i can actually hear the sound level decreasing in the form of the sound crackling, this will happen a few times as i start playing until settled on a volume, that it decided is low enough. Thanks mom!these were somehow decent when listening to music in a fairly consistent volume. but when used for playing instruments, these are as bad as it gets. after hitting a single note hard the volume will decrease drastically to the point i can barely hear myself playing.AVOID, just go for the Sony's instead..",1.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty bad.

    ","Simply the best in class.  I've had them for a few weeks and have logged in well over 100 hours and they just are the benchmark for hi-fi noise cancelling headphones.  Bar none.  I'm in the process of going through my extensive collection of music to hear clarity and detail that I'm pretty sure I've missed on before. Bose has nothing on them, and let's not even get started with Beats.  My favorite feature is the customizability for any situation.  The use of various effect modes, paired with the Cap-Tune app makes these perfect for just about anyone who wants to cut the cord without sacrificing audio fidelity - with 20 hours of comfortable playback to boot. And let's not even get started with the authentic soundstage with incredible depth and breadth.  I listened to Miles Davis' My Funny Valentine (Live) and every instrument was perfectly placed in space.  It really feels like you are there.  These cans are scary good.  For those who say they aren't loud enough, give it some time.  The spectacular noise canceling when turned completely on will drown out most noises except for very high frequencies, and it takes time to adjust to not hearing outside noise, overcompensating with a cranked volume.  You are just one with the music - sequestered in your own world, hanging on to every note and chord.  For those that love a punchier, meatier bass, a few adjustments via Cap-Tune will have you in bass nirvana.  My settings are as follows: boost (thumb), spatial (near), reverb (off), DLC (on).  Sennheiser hit the nail on the head, and definitely struck a chord with these.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best In Class

410,"on January 24, 2018",,"I recently just bought these from my local campus book store (sorry Amazon I couldn't wait) and I love them. I haven't had many experiences with high end headphones, and for the most part have stuck to in ear headsets for work and school. I needed an upgrade though with the current schedule and looking to wearing them 6 hours a day most of the week. I saw complaints about these not being an over the ear set, and rather an on the ear, but for me they are completely over the ear. It is a smaller over the ear cup though so if you do have bigger ears it may not be completely over the ear. The sound quality is amazing, and even more amazing if you fine tune it to your liking with the Cap Tune app.They've overall just been very comfortable headphones to wear for a long period of time in my classes. The touch controls on the right ear cup make life easier when I may not actually have access to my fingers and I can just brush the cup with the side of my hand and it still does what I need. I do have a bit of sliding on my head even with them on where they feel uncomfortable tight but if you don't been completely forward it's not a big deal.I can't say anything about the noise cancellation because I literally have had no need to use it. I literally can't hear anything else with the headphones on even with it off, so I consider that a plus.After the full week with them I've had no issues other than the slippage on my head though and maybe wishing the cups were a tad bigger and maybe more rounded or a fat oval vs the oblong shape they seem to be in. Nothing that would make me unhappy with them in the long run though.Best purchase I've made.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Headphones

    ","I'm impressed with the Sennheiser PXC 550 wireless headphones. They are well-built, smart looking, comfortable and great sounding. The noise cancellation and touch UI are thoughtfully designed and implemented. I have high expectations from Sennheiser and it doesn't disappoint.These are circumaural, closed back headphones. They came packaged in a foam lined sturdy box, which opened up to a semi-soft carry case with the headphones safely stored in it. It also came with a 1.4m long audio cable with remote, USB cable, in-flight adapter and 1/4"" adapter.The headphones appear to be well built and sturdy. The exterior is mostly plastics but it looks high-quality and solid. The ear cups can swivel and fold into a compact size for travel. Power is automatically turned on or off by swiveling the ear cups into position. The headphones feature a voice prompt to indicate the current status. The first time they were powered on, a voice would announce the Bluetooth pairing mode. Pairing is simple and straightforward. I was able to pair it with my iPhone within seconds. The Bluetooth connection seemed solid throughout the review and I had zero issues with it.The head band and ear cups are generously padded. The clamping force is not overly hard. I don't have the uneasy feeling like they are pressing hard against my skull. I could comfortably wear them for hours on end, which is great considering these are designed for extended travel use. That said, I don't know if the ear pads are user replaceable since I can't find a way to detach them.The active/adaptive noise cancellation on these headphones is excellent. It cuts out a lot of the ambient noise in the room and out on the street. This allows me to hear the subtle nuances in my music without needing to turn the volume up. The built-in rechargeable battery is rated for 30 hours on a single charge. If it goes flat before you have a chance to charge it, you can continue to use the headphones in the passive mode via an audio cable (provided). It is very desirable for extended travel when you don't always have the headphones charged. There are many active noise cancelling headphones in the market that would render themselves useless when they run out of power.Perhaps the most important aspect of any headphones is the sound quality. I'm happy that these sound awesome. The bass is nice and tight but not the kind that would thrill a bass head. The highs are crisp and clear. Vocals are fluid but a little recessed at times. In general, I'm very happy with how natural they sound. There are a few sound modes that you can mess with as well.Primarily marketed for business travel use, these headphones have some of the best speech clarity in voice calls that I have heard. Crystal clear voice in both ways. A thumb up.One innovative and useful feature that I really like is the touch interface on the headphones. A simple tap or a swipe on the right ear cup will answer an incoming call, play/pause the music, turn the volume up or down, forward to the next track or go back to the previous track. No more little buttons to fiddle with while wearing the headphones (well, there are still few tiny buttons for switching audio modes, pairing and turning the noise cancellation on/off though). For the most part, the touch interface works really well. It is intuitive, easy and quick to use.These are great for business travel as well as casual listening in a noisy environment. While these are great sounding, they are not really considered audiophile grade by Sennheiser and certainly won't keep an audiophile as happy as the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless would.Overall, I really like these headphones. Some of the big pluses that come to mind are comfort, clarity, intuitive controls, great noise cancellation and sound quality. These headphones are expensive but you do get what you pay for. Great for business travel as well as daily commute. I am thoroughly enjoying mine right now.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent noise cancelling headphones for business travel and daily commute

I have extended the headband out as far as possible, and they barely fit.Second, the sound quality is sub par.  There is virtually no bass. If you try to boost the bass with the EQ settings on your phone's music player, you will get horrible crackling though the headset and a loss of volume.  The headset will then be unable to continue playing until you rotate the cups to cycle the set off and on.The ear cups are ares oddly shaped, requiring you to stretch them out to fit your ears.

    ","Nice headphones, nice tech built into them. The lifting of the (right only) earphone to pause, and removing of the earphones to pause, the touch controls (although takes some practice), the double tap to talk through, the turn ear phones portion to power on/off. Overall these are nice.features, but still don't beat out the Bose QC35s overall.Build- VERY nice, leather is top notch, weight and overall feel is solid and they're just nice to look at. All materials are quality as they should be at this price point.Comfort- this is subjective, everyone is going to find different aspects are nice here. I found the ear cups were really nice but took some fiddling to get my average sized ears into them. Once seated they sealed up nice and I could wear the for long periods. Headband also felt nice, needs some breaking in, but soft enough that it doesn't apply too much pressure.Sound- Very nice. I am hesitant to say these are better than overall in sound than others in it's class. It really is music dependent. For example, these sounded better (to me) with jazz than say the Bose QC35 (which I tested against them). But the bose outperformed them in other genres. Again, this is a subjective areas for listeners. I would say in total both the Bose QC35 and these are VERY close in sound quality-too close to say one is better than the other.ANC- The PXC 550 ANC does a nice job, but bottom line..Bose absolutely beats it  hands down. If I had to put a number on it, by a 25-30% range. Give or take. Voice gets through ALOT on Sennheiser, which left me feeling, often times, that I was just using a regular set of headphones. My wife sitting next to me I could literally have a conversation with them on (no music) whereas the Bose I had to remove them to speak with her. With the Bose,  it just felt like I was actually listening to a set of headphones with noise cancellation. The PXC 550 not so much.Battery- Both are on par with what they say they can perform at. I will say the Bose QC35 does charge up faster where the PXC 550 takes quite some time (2-3 hours) to go from 0-100% charge.Bottom line is this. If you are looking for a headphone with effective noise cancellation just stick with the Bose QC 35 (they're cheaper), they beat these  Sennheisers hands down. And anyone on these reviews saying otherwise is NOT doing what I have done over the course of over a week. Which is to literally sit and listen and A/B test back and forth both in the same environment, in different situations. If you are looking for the best sounding headphones don't buy either of these or bother with Bluetooth ANC versions, just get the B&W P7s and be done with it. The build quality the edge goes to Sennheiser, the materials and over feel of them were more taught and quality feeling. It's a nice headphone, but they aim to be a noise cancelation headphone and they fall majorly short of who they are aiming for in that regard. So for that I deduct a star since they are commanding $400. I am ok with living without the tech features (which are neat) and staying with the Bose for the ANC, long term I don't suspect people will value those features as much as the ANC. If that ranks lower than other priorities for you I'd say get these they are nice, but at that point I'd say why are you looking at wireless ANC BT headphones in the first place.",3.0 out of 5 stars,These are nice but...

    ","I am one of those people who have tried tons of headphones in the attempt to find the ""right ones"". I might have actually found them this time.These headphones are extremely comfortable. The cushioning is very soft and the angle of the cup seems to fit perfectly over my ears. The head band isn't too tight, which means I can wear them longer without getting a headache or earache. The length adjustment is smooth, but holds well, meaning they don't adjust themselves as I am wearing them.The sound quality is fantastic. Although I would say they seem to be heavier on the treble than the base. That being said, I was still able to listen to basey songs without feeling like I was missing it.Noise cancelling works well even when no music is playing. I work in an open office and I can put these on to drown out the noise without being forced to play music. This is great when I really need to concentrate, which I find difficult while music is playing.Bluetooth connection seemed solid with both my laptops (macbook pro mid-2012, windows 8 PC at work) and iPhone. I have had a TON of problems with cheaper bluetooth headphones and my macbook, even to the point where I generally left my previous BT headphones wired. I have had zero issues with this set. It seems to connect right away, every time.You turn the set on by unfolding them. At first I thought this was really weird and wasn't a fan, however I have come to appreciate the fact this turns them off. I don't run down the battery because I forgot to flip the switch to turn them off.My only complaint, and it isn't worth deducting points, is due to the controls. Volume and play/pause is done by taps and slides of your finger on the right speaker. I found that I often accidentally paused playing when I touched them and sometimes had trouble getting it to start again. Volume control seemed a little better.

428,"on February 10, 2018",,"I am a Sennheiser follower. Seriously. I remember the first set of Sennies that I had - they were 300 dollars when a KEF reference tower speaker would cost 900 dollars. I wanted these to be Sennheiser's but they are not. The look is better and the fit is waayyyyy better than anyone else. The sound is not!! Its good, then Ok, then great, then weak. You find youself hunting for the Sennheiser app to adjust it - but the app is not good and it doesnt work and leaves you wanting more.The tech side of it is weak and not done well. I had nightmares wanting to keep these. They do not measure up to Bose. I did not like the sound of the Bose on the store rack at all. I thought the Bose were terrible.after having the nightmares I found this -The bluetooth is not that great when you are talking about greatness. Nothing is going to get you there. Nothing beats the cable yet.Bluetooth is a low bandwidth signal. These senn cans wont get you what you want.The phone quality is weak at best with echo and everyone can hear everythingNo-one does the bluetooth thing like Bose does. I am going to save you 400 dollars and tell you what I dont want to tell you. Go with the Bose. Go with something else. The fun is here with Sennheiser but you will regret the investment - its not as good - I urge Sennheiser to look to tomorrow and do something cool. Please Sennheiser do this! I wrote you several times on facebook to get answers.The consumer answer is still with the Bose. I would.I WOULD HOWEVER look to Sennheiser for a wired headphone as I think no-one can compare.Miss you Sennheiser - please read this.",3.0 out of 5 stars,The look is better and the fit is waayyyyy better than anyone else

    ","I only use headphones while running or weight training.Battery life is not the 30 hours as claimed, I have gotten around 18-22 hours.I doesn't take 3 hours to charge( i think that is what they claimed) it took a total of 12 hours to fully charge.I'm not sure how to quantify this but the sound ""loudness"" is about 50% of my other photive bluetooth wireless headphones, the photives also gave me around 50 hours of use as well.The ""touchscreen"" is awful, when I'm trying to skip the song forward or backwards it pauses and vice versa, it randomly calls people without my knowledge...I have never ever ""butt dialed"" anyone until getting these head phones.Noise cancelling it is amazing but I don't have a reference point as i have never tried it before but never the less, it don't hear anything else when on 100% noise cancelling.bluetooth 4.2 is amazing, the range and quality is very very good, and I love the fact that between sets during workout i can quickly shut it off with a simple twist to preserve battery life.but for $399.99 it doesn't even come close to my expectations...",2.0 out of 5 stars,For Exercise

    ",The headset gives a very high quality sound.  They are a bit too heavy on my head.  I'm prone to migraines so the weight bothered me.  I also had a little issue with the touch screen on the side of the right ear--it was a challenge for me to get good volume control using the touch screen.  I ended up adjusting the volume on the device instead of the headset.Comes with a very sturdy travel case.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality
