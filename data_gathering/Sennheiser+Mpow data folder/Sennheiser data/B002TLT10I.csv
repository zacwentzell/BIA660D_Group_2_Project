    ","For starters, I do not write reviews so this will be relatively short and definitely to the point. All of the other reviews posted will tell you just about everything you may want to know and enough to make you wary about purchasing this. I wanted to share my experience to dispel the fears of anyone who is on the fence as to whether this is what it claims to be. 100%, it is precisely what it claims to be. I do not garden (I am in my early 30's so maybe that will change in a few decades at which point I will submit an updated review), I do not have hearing deficiency, my aging grandmother does not live with me who requires louder volume while watching Antiques Roadshow while everyone else watches in misery at normal people volume, I do not try to listen to music while down the street at my neighbor's house four blocks away. I live in a larger than average home with every wifi entertainment/streaming gadget known to man. I watch movies and shows at high volume, and don't want to disturb the family during late hours, etc. through my surround sound. My requirements for a wireless headset are as follows:1) ZERO interference, static, or ""hiss"", or lag time between sound and screen2) REASONABLE distance without losing signal (I think 50 ft from your TV is quite reasonable)3) PERFECT no loss sound and deep bass as I expect from a quality surround sound system while watching a movieThis headset meets all 3 requisite criteria. You can stop reading. Really.Ok, apparently you need more, due diligence = happiness I suppose. I have purchased 2 wireless RF headsets (as a reminder, this is not an RF headset) in the past from Amazon. With RF, you will ALWAYS have static. It is a fact of life, the end. No matter how much you spend on an RF headset, you will have interference and the constant ""hiss"". Trust me, I know, THE END. Yes, there will be one guy who responds to this review saying that his magical RF headset has no interference. Ok, buy that one. This review is not for you. Stop reading now. This review is for the guys/gals who research until their eyes bleed to ensure that the product they are purchasing is top quality. I can walk the entirety of my home listening to movies at full blast through the headsets with 100% ZERO interference (yes, I have a wife and child who prefer not to have R rated movies blaring at max volume while they are sleeping, which I why I bought this product). I stream from a Roku and Boxee Box (the greatest invention ever/cannot BELIEVE they no longer make this, I bought three (yes, literally 3) just in case Boxee 1 and 2 died and they are no longer available in the universe) with the base of the headset sitting right next to them and IT DOES NOT impact the wifi strength or streaming quality (Note: I do not have a crappy wifi router, I have a ASUS RT-AC66U Dual-Band Wireless-AC1750 Gigabit Router because I am serious about home networking/streaming/NAS. If you have a crappy wifi router, I cannot help you. Likewise, if you prefer to listen to your music/movies with your headphones on with your head in a microwave and complain that there is interference, I cannot help you. This review is not for you. Stop reading now.).To dispel one of the common cons other reviewers have cited. ""The buttons on the headset are SOOOOOOOO confusing. I wish they had a volume wheel instead of buttons for my clumsy fingers!!!!"" RIDICULOUS. The reason why they have buttons is because the geniuses at Sennheiser are smarter than you. You bump a volume wheel with your hand/pillow/whatever by accident and you can go deaf, particularly if you let your kids use it (I hate kids shows so I let the little guy use them when he is watching that stuff, sue me). The buttons are perfect. It goes like this: big one = more volume, then power, then smallest button = less volume. I mastered this in less than a few hours of use. You won't use the other two buttons as they will always be on (surround sound and bass boost), so you are literally dealing with big button = loud, tiny button = not loud. I know, this is A LOT to ask.For the manufacturer (NOT THE READERS), this is a nearly perfect product. One suggestion is to make the headphones expandable/retractable, which is usually a default for high quality headsets. By expandable/retractable, I mean add a slider to each side of the headsets just in case there are people with abnormally large or small heads so they can get the perfect fit. The headset fits me perfectly, but they would not work perfectly for a youth or large headed folk. Just looking out. Expand that target market. Another suggestion for the clumsy fingered people is putting a tactile raised dot on the power button to distinguish it clearly for those who cannot master big button vs. small button.I hope this helps.",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is what you are looking for. Period.

    ","I bought this to replace a refurbished RS -120 set that I had bought previously.  I'm less satisfied with this set than with that one on two counts.  First, with the RE-120, all I had to do was remove it from the dock to enable it to work; with the more expensive RS-170, I have to turn on a button at the base and one on the head set.  And second, the five controls on the headset are indistinguishable to the touch so that the headset has to be removed from one's head in order to find the sought-after control.  Also, I cannot discern any improvement in sound quality with this set vs. the far less expensive RS-120, although I'm well please with it on both sets.  If I were starting over, knowing what I know now, I would definitely buy the RS -120 set, which is now priced at only about $55 ($30 less than I paid for a refurbished set four years ago).",3.0 out of 5 stars,I'm less satisfied with this set than with that one on at ...

    ","The poor husband must be going deaf because at the levels the television had to be for him to hear properly, it was too loud for me and that's when we knew it was time to get him some headphones. For the record, I already own the RF version of these Sennheiser headphones, but they were in storage, so I decided to gamble with these being more expensive and get them for his birthday. They are worth every extra penny! The sound coming out of these is EXCELLENT! We have a DirecTV genie, just be sure to hook the RCA cables directly from your digital box, not from the TV, and you will have sound that is simply amazing. I haven't heard sound this good outside of an IMAX theater. He's using these every single day and the cradle recharger is simply too easy! If you're debating between these and the cheaper RF version, GET THESE! As I said before, worth every penny and we couldn't be happier. Now, I'm looking to expand an extra headset for me. I think this base will support up to four.FYI: It is a SHAME these magnificent headphones are getting some bad reviews because people can't figure out how to hook them up. Everyone's setup is a little different and the quality of the sound you get from your source will differ, but if you have a digital box (like Tivo, DirecTV genie or anything like a cable or satellite box) setup is pretty easy. Just remember, avoid those headphone jacks on the tv, if possible and instead, look for RCA (white/red) ""OUTPUT""s on your digital box. Think about like this - you are sending sound ""Out"" of the box and into the headphones base. If you're forced to use the headphone jack on your television, the sound will not be as good. If you're using these without a cable or satellite box, I can't help.Don't dismiss these headphones because some people couldn't set them up. If you have a digital box, like cable or satellite, don't miss out on this sound experience. These are phenomenal headphones and I don't throw that word around. I've written hundreds of reviews and less than 5 electronic items have ever received such raving from me. These are worth the money and worth the time to get them hooked up. I'm not even wasting money or time installing surround speakers in my new living room. I will never be able to replicate and get sound this good right on the ears. If you get these set up correctly with a good source (like digital satellite or cable signal) you're golden!",5.0 out of 5 stars,EXCELLENT SOUND!

    ","First off let me say that I thought long and hard before deciding to spend $280 on headphones. I can't hear as clearly as I once could. Even with the sound turned up, I sometimes have trouble understanding what is being said. My wife has no trouble hearing the TV so we are constantly at odds on how loud to keep the volume. If she is reading a book in another room she is always asking me to turn the TV down. So I decided headphones were more practical and less expensive than a surround sound system that would have provided a speaker close to me. I figured good set of headphones should make the sound more understandable. I plan to use these for TV, DVDs and CDs played through my DVD player.I did a lot of comparison of brands and models before deciding. Ultimately the key deciding points to my choosing the Sennheiser RS170  were (in order of importance to me): 4-1/2 star rating by consumers, digital audio transmission, closed back on earphones, charging/storage stand, reported performance, number of years this model has been sold, well rated high & mid-range sound, frequency response 18Hz - 21,000 Hz,  simulated Surround Sound, ability to add on another headphone set if my wife ever needs a set, quality appearance, battery life up to 24 hours.Quality: The 4-1/2 star rating on the RS170 on Amazon was the highest rating of all the brands and models of headphones that Amazon sold during March 2012.Price: I paid $279.95 on Amazon mid March 2012. I looked up the price history of RS170 by googling ""price history of RS170""  then I clicked on the link to ""Sennheiser RS 170 Prices (headphones) - CNET Marketplace"" then clicked on ""Price History"" and found if I would be willing to wait until October - December I could probably buy them for considerable less but I wanted to use them during spring / summer of 2012 so I paid ""through the nose"" .Brand: I choose Sennheiser because they seemed like the best value and selection for the money. They also make studio-quality headphones so I figured the wireless models might be engineered well. Most reviewers gave the brand high marks for performance, appearance, durability and use.Features: I compared the RS170 ($279.95) to the RS160 ($199.95) and the RS180 ($329.95) on Amazon plus I looked at the specs on the Sennheiser website at [...] All three models use 2.4 GHz digital 'Kleer' wireless technology which is reportedly superior to the brands and models that use 900 MHz analog RF technology which is more susceptible to hiss, noise, and interference. I preferred the convenience of having a charging /storage stand that comes with the RS170 and RS180 over the plug-in charging on the RS160.  I preferred the closed-back earphone design of the RS160 and RS170 over the open-back design of the RS180 because the open-back design would allow an 'echo effect' from the 'lag-time' sound if my wife had the TV speakers turned up. The RS170 was the only model of the three with selectable simulated Surround Sound and Bass Boost. So the $80 up-charge from the RS160 to the RS170 got me the 'easy charge' cradle and docking station with function indicator LEDs, 1/4 inch and RCA adapters in case I would ever need them in lieu of the 3.5mm jack, up to 200 feet more transmitting distance, 4 dB more Sound Pressure Level (perceived loudness), simulated Surround Sound and Bass Boost controlled at the transmitter or at the headset.Shipping: Yesterday I received my headphones (only took 4 days using Amazon Super Saver Shipping - yeah!). Both the shipping carton and the headphone box inside were in pristine condition. Like a kid with a new toy, I had to try them out right away. Since the rechargeable batteries take up to 16 hours to for initial charge (mine only took 8), I put in 2 AAA Alkaline batteries (one per headphone). Connecting the transmitter up was easy - I have a ""line-out"" 3.5mm jack on the TV so I just used the jumper that came in the package that had the 3.5mm jack on both ends. The transmitter/charging stand has 4 LEDs - orange shows when headphones are charging, blue to choose surround sound on/off, another blue one to choose Bass Boost on/off, and green to choose transmitter on/off. The headset right earphone has buttons for headphone on/off, volume up/down, bass boost on/off and surround sound on/off. I am sure that with practice that I'll be able to ""feel"" where these buttons are so I won't have to take the headset off to adjust these controls. The headset is well padded and comfortable although as some others have pointed out I can see where these ""earmuffs"" might be a little warm with extended wear.Performance: Now comes the really cool part...the sound quality is amazing. I have never been so impressed with any product I have purchased. The stereo separation is noticeable distinct and really enhances the enjoyment of listening. I can't hear any hiss, background noise or cut-out. The voices are clear and seem to be louder than the background sounds so the words are easy to understand. My acid test for how well these headphones performed was to try a DVD called ""The Devil's Own"" where Brad Pit plays a character with a heavy Irish brogue. The first time I watched it using the TV speakers I had to strain to understand his dialog but when I watched it again using the headphones he was easy to understand. The engineering that has gone into these headphones is really impressive with the way they handle voices, background sound and separation.Surround Sound: The simulated surround sound isn't that impressive. It does add a bit more depth to the sound but nothing like having real surround sound. I'm sure it is limited by only having one speaker per earphone. True surround sound would need two sound sources per earphone plus some fancy separation engineering. I'll probably use this feature for some of our 5.1 DTS stereo DVDs and music CDs.Bass Boost: This works pretty well. It isn't overwhelming but adds richer bass to the sound without taking away from the clarity of the spoken words. I'll probably use this feature for some TV show,  5.1 DTS stereo DVDs and music CDs.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound

    ","I have owned these headphones since August, 2014. They are easy to use, and the sound quality is excellent. Prior to owning them, I tried out some $20 wireless headphones from a local drugstore which did not work at all, and I also did a jury-rigged setup with a very long, trip-hazard cable linking some headphones I owned to my TiVo. Never again. Both were a disaster.This system is absolutely wonderful for two reasons:First, I have weird hearing issues in that when I am trying to sleep, every little sound bugs me and I seem to hear even a conversation in the next room far more clearly than I have any desire to do, but when listening to TV, I can't understand 75% of what the actors are saying without captions. Go figure. With these headphones, no more problem. All dialog is clear as a bell.Second, I no longer have to drive my husband crazy blaring the TV in order to adequately hear the actors speaking. By the same token, if my husband is watching a program on TV that I'm not at all interested in, I don't have to be subjected to listening to that either.It's win-win.I will say that I was not myself techie enough to install these headphones. My husband is an IT guy and he had to do it for me. So that's one downside for the customer who struggles with techie installations. Other than that, all is great.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful product

    ","I agree completely with the 'button' issue on the Sennheiser RS 170's.  Considering the cost, one wonders why the engineers didn't put any more effort into the design of this critical area.  Other than that single issue, the sound and comfort are superb, they are a good improvement over my previous low-end set and well worth the investment.  In my case, I have a high-frequency hearing loss and these have helped greatly, especially with shows that are heavily accented e.g., English, Irish etc.  The reason I gave 4 starts rather than 5 is that I don't think I should have to modify a product (in this price range) after I purchase it.Resolving the button issue is a quick fix:  Using two-part clear epoxy, place a small dot (just enough to cover the raised icon) on the headsets 'ON/OFF' button located between the volume UP and DOWN buttons.  After placing the dot, turn the headphones so that the 'dot' is facing down and subject to the pull of gravity.  This causes the epoxy dot to take on a raised posture.  Allow it to dry in that position.  Now, when you reach up to adjust the volume, your finger easily locates the raised dot and it's then intuitive that the volume UP and DOWN buttons are on either side of it.Additional comments:Headsets which are used for watching TV could greatly benefit from a MUTE button to avoid commercials.  This would be more effective than constantly adjusting the volume.  On these headphones (with no mute button), the ON/OFF button can be used to quickly turn the headset on and off.  Although there's a slight audio lag when turning them back on, it functions almost as well as a mute button.When the headphones are in use, the base transmitter's ON/OFF button contains a flashing green light that can be annoying depending on the transmitters location.  (For some reason, the engineers felt is was important that the user knows that the headphones are receiving a signal and need to be reminded of that fact every few seconds).  To remedy this, place a small piece of black electrical tape over the ON/OFF button.  The tape won't interfere with the buttons function and it blocks the light.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound - Volume button 'fix' is easy
7,"on February 21, 2018",,"I was hesitant to purchase these due to the various degrees in ratings and because there is an updated version, RS175. Apparently the updated version seems to be inferior and lacking luster in the eyes of most reviewers so I looked elsewhere. Being optimistic, I bought these anyway and I’m glad I did! As a student who studies late at night, NETFLIX and other visual streaming services are pertinent to keeping me focused and on track. Background noise is a MUST when coffee isn’t cutting it. Headphones are also necessary since my wife is a very light sleeper and could hear a moth fart. The RS170’s are nice and light, almost too light to the point that I thought they felt cheap when first unboxing them. They’ve proven to be light enough so they don’t weigh down your head and neck during extended use, but have excellent sound production. They also aren’t too tight on my head, keeping headaches at bay. That being said, the slightest head turning gestures seem to open gaps between my ears and the headphones and allow for ambient noise to protrude. Perhaps I’m being too picky considering my opinions are coming from comparing surround sound isolating gamer headphones... The Surround Sound Simulator and Dynamic Bass Boost features add surprising depth and much needed quality to inhance the listening experience with a strong stereo image. I have yet to notice if using both said features will drain the battery faster than without activating them. Another gripe of mine is that in order to use the headphones, you must turn on the receiver as well as the headphones. When ready to charge/stow the headphones on their receiver/charging dock, you then have to turn off both receiver and headphones. This seems like unnecessary steps for something that could easily be automated with removal and attach gestures via connectivity. Lastly, I’m not entirely thrilled that the only port available for input on the transmitter is auxiliary. For my current setup it doesn’t matter and didn’t sway me from purchasing these, but it is very limited. The accessory box that comes with the headphones does include an RCA male to auxiliary female adapter, as well as the auxiliary cable with double male ends. I fear that I might have to keep this limitation in consideration when looking to upgrade my study area setup. Wrapping things up, all in all I haven’t had any issues with the signal cutting out, charging failures, or concern about quality of sound produced. Just a few slight issues that are worth considering when looking to purchase this product.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall exceptional product, minor gripes from an audiophile"

    ","I had an older set of Senheiser wireless headphones for last several years. My wife goes to bed early and needs total silence. Bizarre as she can fall sound asleep on the couch while watching The Expendables in surround sound... (I disgress). The older headphones had RF noise andsometimes I had to keep my head in a certain spot to hear clearly. The static was sometimes terrible to deal with!These new phones are substantially better so here's the good, bad, and ugly:Good- They are very comfortable to wear even when wearing glasses. They fit snug and outside noise is at a minimum! For headphones not advertised as ""noise cancelling"" they do a great job! Sound quality and simulated surround sound features work well and these suckers sound fantastic. NO STATIC YEA!!! The battery seems to have a very long lifespan too!Bad- They don't actually cut in and out but if there is silence in what you are watching they seem to sense it and go into hibernation mode. (best way to describe it). You don't lose the signal or any audio but there's a definite slight click as it pops in and out of this mode.I got used to it quickly though...Ugly- Initial link up when newly powering on can be tricky. Hitting the buttons seems very hit and miss. What buttons work today doesn't always work the next day. THE BUTTONS ARE HORRID TO OPERATE ON THE RIGHT HEADPHONE. The buttons (5 in all) are in a row and unless you have the touch of a brain surgeon you have to constantly take them off to adjust volume, on/off, surround, and mute features.. Old ones had better functionality in this respect.Overall I love them and will keep for a very long time!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The static was sometimes terrible to deal with

    ","I'm a big movie fan and I love these headphones. I tried other sets before this one and I had to return the due to noise/interference.  Sound quality is superb without noise/interference or lag on this Sennheiser RS 170. I can walk all around the house, and I don't have any interference until I get to the master room, on the other side of the house, 5 or so walls away. These are very comfortable and I can wear them for hours without any discomfort, which is important when watching movies or streaming and entire seasons of a favorite show without getting everyone in the house complaining. Battery life is also great, as the phone recharge every time they rest on the stand.  The only minor gripe with these are the controls. While watching a movie in low light, it is not easy to identify the which bottom is which. It's a small thing considering everything else these headphones do right for me. If you are a big movie fan looking for way to watch your favorite shows or movie with great quality sound, comfortable, and in private, this set is for you if you can afford the price. The price is easier to digest once you realize you are basically getting a private surround sound in a small package. Great product and I would buy again if I ever need a new set.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A must for private listening of your favorite movies or seasons of your favorite TV shows without noise/interference or lag.

    ","My research for wireless headphones brought me to these cans.  I'm a moderate audiophile.  I use them late at night or whenever I want to watch TV and do not want to disturb others.  The sound is contained within the headphones, and I like the range - I can walk around the house and there's no sound degradation because of distance.  Although these are plug'n'play and were very easy to setup, maybe I need to adjust something - when there is no dialogue or the sound of silence, and then dialogue starts back up, at that instant, I can hear the background transmission hiss.  Maybe it's my fault, maybe it's just how the Kleer Technology works, but it's there, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.  The entirety of my ear fits within the circular padding, nothing pinches, no odd-placed pressure points on my ears or from the padding on top of my head - very comfortable to wear for hours.  Sure the buttons on the right can are indistinguishable from each other, but I never use them because I control TV volume with the TV remote instead.  I tried the bass boost and surround buttons once, and both effects stink, I don't use them ever.  But using a straight signal and no effects, these headphones produce clean low bass, crispy highs, and you can turn them up very high without distortion.  I have been using them for about three months with no problems, and don't anticipate any either.  Love these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,hit all of my requirements

    ","Goodness gracious I love these headphones!Now the disclaimer.I am not an audiophile, an electronics or digital geek.  Just call me middle of the road, average joe who needed to maintain peace in the household after a couple years of my wife being awakened by the TV which is on the same wall as our bedroom - headboard to tv.  Trouble.  Combine that with a late arrival male son (computer geek) who has disdain for all but the most expensive gadgets and whose solution to every conceivable glitch I encounter is ""You need to buy a new..."")  It took me a while to figure he had just enough knowledge to be dangerous but more than I.  His initial suggestion was a complete rewiring/remodeling of the house to surround the latest of electronic entertainment equipment and of course all new furniture to utilize this in comfort.How much are you going to contribute, son?  That's what I thought.His over the top suggestion for headphones led me to discover the Sennheiser headphones.  I decided to get the over ear instead of on ear phones and glad I did.  They are so comfy even when you fall asleep wearing them.  Our home has become very quiet as the headphones deliver sounds never heard from the tv.  Suddenly hearing side conversations on the street as the main character walked by was amazing!  Now my wife wants a set for herself.  I love the volume control on the phones and how easy it is to store them on the transmitter where they recharge.  I did have to buy a digital to analog decoder but that was no big deal.  I did order the AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters) as advised in another review but found a cable was included with the headphones, so read closely to what is included in the box before you order something not needed.Another advantage for me is with some hearing loss there was a lot of ""turn it up"" or ""what did he say?"" before the headphones.  With them, the clarity is amazing and those questions have been eliminated even at lower volume.So, my less than technical review says although I hesitated at first based strictly on price I am now very happy and would buy them again.  Every day of use tells me that it was a great purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphone happiness!

    ","Have had headset for about 2 months now.The bad, if you could call it bad, is really just annoying.1. They will make you sweat around the ears, after wearing them for 45 mins or so, if your place is not cold, a problem I rarely have because I like my place cold. My girlfriend will be wrapped up in a blanket while I am in my skivvies.2. You hear a tone every time you fast forward or pause.I took one star for annoyance.The Good.These things rock. I read that someone complained about lack of bass, blah I say. The bass boost button makes a big difference and they rattle my head with volume up.  Details are crisp and the bass booms! They sound better then my wired Bose on-ear headset.I bought these specifically for Game of Thrones as I watch it at night and I was missing details from having to keep volume down. 95% of the time I am watching TV alone, I have the headphones on. I did not realize how many details I was missing from everything I watch.And to address the complaining about power button location. Quit whining. The power button has a raised symbol that you can feel and after a little bit of getting used to you will not hit it.The single works through most of my apartment and gets choppy in the kitchen, which is like a hangman stick pole from the base/sending unit.Payed $120.00 from a amazon warehouse deal btw.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Rock

    ","I hate wearing headphones... but the noise in our world is getting so out of control I had to do something to keep from literally losing my mind.  I have been researching headphones for over a year now and finally decided to take the plunge and spend more than 15 dollars for a pair... The Sennheiser RS-170's are awesome.  No... you will not feel like ""you are there"".  No... you will not hear true 5.1 surround sound... but this model comes close to reproducing sounds accurately. Personally, I think these sound way better listening to music rather than TV for some reason.  Set up was a breeze (I am not sure about people that have had issues... (I literally plugged and played like the instructions say).  the comfort level of these headphones is incredible.  Yes... I can feel them... but they are not nearly as miserable to wear as other closed back types I have had in my life.  As for the controls... yes, they could definitely do a better job of making them easier to feel... but, once you remember where the on off button is (and you can feel that as there is a raised symbol on it) you can easily navigate the volume controls on the headset.  I have large hands so it does take some getting used to though.  So many headphones anymore don't allow you to adjust them for your head... not these...they allow you to adjust them to fit.  I can't speak for the battery life too much... all I know is that I have used them for *hours* without any loss in sound volume or anything of the sort.  I have been as far as 45 feet away from the base unit so far and they don't miss a beat.  I have also had no difficulties with them interfering with my router or internet.  I am *very* pleased with these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,You Will Love Them

    ",While the unit functions as described and is reasonably comfortable I did not like it for the following reasons:1) The design of the buttons on the headset is crazy and it's almost impossible to adjust the volume (on the headset at least) or power them on or off by feeling the buttons... You really end up having to take them off your head.2) Power management is just ridiculous - The base unit shuts itself off for some reason.  So you have to walk over to it and turn it on whenever you want to use the headphones... Then you have to wait a moment and turn on the headphones - which requires a long press on the power button (which you cannot feel - see #1 above).  A switch would be much better for the headphones and the base is plugged in so there is just no reason for it to ever shut itself off... it's just dumb.3) They feel kind of cheap.  Someone else may say that they just feel lightweight and that's good... but to me they didn't really feel like what I expected.4) The combination of #1 and #2 above means that they are difficult for young children to use.I ended up returning them and I'm looking for an alternative if anyone has suggestions.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor design ruins decent function...

    ","Thanks to all the previous reviewers and feedback you’ve provided.  It highly influenced my buying decision and the 4.5 star overall rating for this item is accurate.  Here’s my 2 cents:I'm old school and listen to music via CDs.  I like to listen to my music loud.  Using the headphones in my upstairs den in conjunction with Bose Wave II & TV connected via 1/8"" mini-jack.  Now have ~100 hrs of use.  Bought on Amazon.com @ $198.83 , Free SH, + local sales tax.Pros:• Audiophile quality sound.  Excellent dynamic response.• Minimal distortion, even w/Bose output volume @ 80+.  The 0.5% THD spec quoted by Sennheiser seems legit (I’ve not scientifically measured).• Very low noise.  If you’re using these for CD listening, recommend you re-buy your favorite CDs in digitally re-mastered versions.  It makes a huge difference, and you’ll notice it with these headphones.  NOTE:  The system has an auto-muting function that could activate in between tracks to cut out noise.  Depending on the recording/mastering quality of your music, the circuitry may automatically mute the very, very end of the track (milliseconds of it).• Excellent imaging quality and channel separation. Will sound spatially 2-D separated, distributed and balanced across top your head ear-to-ear, and CLEAR.  (If only for a 3-D headphone, which would require a helmet, lol).  The 2D imaging quality will depend on the mastering quality of whatever music you're listening to.• Natural sounding deep bass, not exaggerated or “boomy”.  Tight and crisp treble, cymbals sound terrific.  This is spite of fact that my old-school, over-priced Bose doesn’t even have bass or treble control, lol.• The surround sound and bass boost enhancement modes are worth the upgrade cost vs  the lower priced models.• Excellent battery life.  My max single-use session is 8 hrs, with no issues or performance degradation using OEM-provided batteries provided.  2-3 hr recharge time.• Comfort.  These are comfortable & light.  No fatigue or stress points on my 7-3/8” noggin.  Standard earphone pads are vinyl padded.  Will feel a little warm at first, but dissipates after ~10 mins.  Not so warm that your ears feel like they’re sweating.  Minimal sound leakage with the vinyls.  But I am considering buying the Sennheiser foam earpads as a change-up option.• Works well for TV audio, but I don’t use much for that purpose.  Unless you’re using for home theater, these are $ overkill for simple TV listening IMO.  Would think there’s less expensive solutions for that application, but I’ve not researched.• Easy, logical equipment setup.  Looks very neat and tidy when everything’s set up.Cons:• The button controls on the right earphone can are not a major Con as some reviewers have cited.  Buttons are indeed small and indiscernible, but just takes familiarization• Headband is slightly bulky in profile.  Granted, there’s wires and circuitry running through it, but design could be more minimized, streamlined and weight reduced IMO.• Range (to be expected):  Base transmitter is located in 2nd story corner room of 2,500 sq ft house having open vault ceiling architecture.  Random drop-offs occur outside house on deck/porch with door closed.  Some drop-offs inside house on 1st level near stainless steel kitchen appliances.  No drop-offs anywhere on 2nd level.  I’m sure I could improve range by optimizing location of transmitter.  2.4GHz spectrum doesn’t seem to penetrate closed doors well, and adversely reflect off metal objects.• No other significant cons I can think of, considering the old days when headphones were tethered to a coiled speaker cord.Bottom Line• These Sennheiser RS-170 wireless headphones have exceeded my expectations.  The freedom of movement is funtastique.  Makes me feel like I’m in my own private little world.• They’re especially worth the $200 if you live with persons who don’t like it when you blast your music ambiently.  You and they will both be happy you purchased.• Don’t know how they perform with MP-3 players, since I don’t have one.PS – I will hook these up to my circa-1980s audiophile system and provide a future update on how these perform under 100-Watts of clean 0.005% THD pressure.",5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones are highly recommended by this Reviewer

    ","These RS 170 wireless headphones offer hours of comfortable over-the-ear wearing without feeling pinched or tired. They provide a remarkably flat and accurate sound reproduction that is noticeably more defined than their less expensive RS 160 siblings. They sound rich and crisp without being overly bright or hissy and they have an extremely clear mid-range that makes them very pleasing to listen to. They may not have enough bass for everyone, but they offer a way to address that.The 170's higher price affords the user not only better sound, but more options, as well. These have ""Bass"" and ""Surround"" buttons on the right earpiece, along with the standard Volume +/- and Pwr buttons. The ""Bass"" seemed most useful when listening to music at low to moderate volume levels without excessive booming or muddying the tracks, while the ""Surround"", IMHO, actually provided an surprisingly enlarged sound stage when watching TV, especially movies with complex and busy soundtracks.The useful wireless range of these is better than the 160's by a good bit. But they still don't like too many walls between them and the base. If you want to use these outdoors for, say, yard work, you might want to think about a wiring scheme that gets the sending unit at or near a window that faces the side of the yard you will be working in. These won't cut it on a ranch or when you're plowing the back 40. Another nice touch is that you can add up to four headsets to the single base station.There are a couple of head scratchers though. For instance, you can only charge the headset on the base station unless you want to remove and charge the batteries in a dedicated AAA NiMH charger (not provided) or use standard batteries. Also, the base station doesn't have any battery power option, only a wired power adapter. The adapter does, however, come with four different pin outs for international use. They are basically all plastic, but they don't feel cheap. There are also replacement earpads and optional audio adapters available from Sennheiser for down the road.If you need or just want to add high quality wireless headphone capability to your Home Theater, TV or audio listening experience and are looking for much better sound than current Bluetooth offerings, the RS 170's will make you glad you picked them up.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and Easy Like

    ","I've been using these for more than a year now, so I have real experience with them. The best feature of the Sennheiser RS 170 is that the sound is generally good as long as you're not listening to quiet music.I should probably state that more clearly -- don't get these if you ever listen to quiet music or listen to music with quiet passages. They squelch at low volume and clip the sound. It's a horrible experience, and it's not configurable. This isn't a range issue as it happens to me within 3 feet of the base unit.Sennheiser has saved a bunch of money by scrimping on the button design for both the headphones and the base unit -- and made the headphones only a shadow of what they could be for usability. The headphone buttons are pretty much useless without taking the headphones off to see what you're doing. The buttons are tiny with no tactile feedback and all crammed together, which virtually guarantees that you will press the wrong button if you try to press any button while the headphones are on your head. The engineers at Sennheiser (who obviously don't use these headphones, themselves) *cleverly* situated the power button between the volume up and volume down buttons so that volume adjustments while wearing the headphones usually just shut off the headphones. That means that you really have to adjust the volume while you're not wearing the headphones.Think about that for a minute.The buttons on the base unit are just hard enough to press, and the base unit weighs so little, that you are forced to hold the base unit down with one hand and press back on the hard snappy buttons with the other hand. Again, this is a usability failure. This means that every time you want to use the headphones, you go through these steps:1. Take the headphones off the base unit where they've been charging and set the headphones down (you'll need both hands free for the next step).2. Grasp the base unit with one of your hands while pressing the base unit's power button with the other hand.3. Pick up the headphones. If it's dark, turn on the lights to make sure you can locate and read the tiny power symbol on the headphones (it's lightly embossed and very hard to see). Press the power button and put the headphones on. That's it. You're done, unless you need to adjust the volume (make sure the lights are still on).If Jony Ive had designed these, you'd just pull them off the charger and put them on. The base unit and the headphones would sense their state and activate accordingly -- and the volume buttons might be a dial, but would absolutely be usable by feel. That's the difference between a company that cares about usability (Apple) and a company that doesn't (Sennheiser).",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for quiet music or music with quiet passages

    ","I bought this along with a second headset so that I could watch my movies and games in our great room without disturbing (or being disturbed by) people carrying on conversations in the kitchen, bar, or breakfast nook (the one drawback to ""open concept"").  I bought the second headset for a guest to use or so that I could hot-swap if the battery on one ran out. So far (about a month) they have worked like a charm! The sound clarity is great; concert Blu-Ray disks through the headphones sound much better than the TV speakers. The headset is comfortable enough wear at least as long as your average hockey game or ""Lord of the Rings"" movie without complaint. I don't notice any perceptible sound delay, voices stay in sync with mouth movements. If I turn up the TV volume and wear one side of the headset off an ear I can tell there is a _very slight_ delay, but you would never notice using the headset in a normal manner. Don't discount this last comment - other wireless headsets I have tried have an encoding / transmitting / decoding delay so long it seems as if everyone on TV is lip syncing a-la Milli Vanilli!Following the instructions I was able to pair the headsets with the base without issue and more than a month later I have not yet (knock on wood) had to re-pair either of them. I estimate that I am getting a good 22+ hours of use per charge which is pretty close the specifications. Oddly, the re-charging process for me is much shorter than the product description indicates. I place the depleted headset on the base to charge before bed and they are fully charged by morning (as indicated by the charge light being off). That is much faster than the ""16 hours"" in the description, unless that is a typo.  I get very good range from them - even running out to my grill to check on steaks, about 90+ feet away through a wall. In fact, the only dropout I have had so far is when my head is within two feet of my active microwave oven.As others have said, the control buttons on the headsets are hard to use while wearing them. At first I had to take the headphones off to fiddle with them, but after I figured out that I like the surround and base boos “on”, I just leave them that way. After a week I was able to find and adjust the volume buttons while wearing the headphones without problem.  The “surround” effect isn't really that noticeable but I like it because it seems to make the quiet dialogue clearer and more understandable. Don’t expect the “bass boost” to knock you over – it isn't a sub-woofer – but it does seem to make lower pitched sounds (think “sports car engine”) more realistic.So far, I am very happy with these headphones and I am even considering getting another set for the bedroom so I can watch TV while my wife sleeps or talks on the phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Sounding, Great Fitting Wireless Headset"

    ","The sound quality of these headphones is excellent.  There seems to be no noise and good clean sound.  The initial setup was pretty painless.  I'll say that the operation of the headphones is a little quirky in that it's unclear to me why you sometimes need to press the power button on the charging/base station and other times you can just turn on the headphones and they work.  I imagine that after using these for a few days or weeks, it will become second nature to get them to work correctly.  Other reviewers have commented before and I concur with them that the headphones should have some amount of adjustment to fit different sized heads.  I'm cursed with a large head and it would be nice to get just a little bit more distance between the ear cups.  Other reviewers have also mentioned the echo or delay in the sound.  I also experienced that and I can see where it could cause some irritation.  I have the base unit plugged in to the exact same place as my previous headphones.  Those headphones had no delay in the audio but the sound quality was marginal at best so I'm willing to live with the delay to enjoy the quality improvement.I bought a second set of headphones to be able to use simultaneously with the first.  It would have been helpful to have a little ""quick start guide"" included with the second set of headphones.  I ended up needing to dig through the documentation to find out how to ""pair"" the new headphones with the old base.  It's easy to do but that seems like a no-brainer to include a little piece of paper with that basic info on it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite perfect

    ","First let me preface this by saying I've had these only a few hours, so I'm basic this review on half an hour's worth of testing via various movies and music.Pro's- Comfortable, even with my glasses on. For me, that was the biggest issue since I have a big head and crappy clunky glasses. I've had several headphones and nothing I've owned previously, aside from earbuds, came close to the comfort level on these things. I'm going to get the Velour Earpads from the 180's once I can afford it and see how that works for me.- Detailed sound. By detailed I mean the sounds are all clearly audible and don't get mushed together. You can separate sounds in a scene, like during the modern Robocop remake, when Robo's fighting the drones in the warehouse, you can hear the music AND the fighting, and you don't miss anything from either.- Ease of use. These are plug and play. The moment you've got the 2 cables (Power and audio) connected and the headset charged, you're ready to roll. To turn it on is easy, and to turn them off is also easy. Turning 'surround mode' on and off is also caveman simple.- Looks. These are clean, no huge logos, overabundance of chrome or other 'LOOK AT ME!' gimmicks. They're understated and classy, which is just how I like my electronics. If I have a stereo, I want to be ooh'ing and aah'ing at the sounds it produces, not it's style.Meh (Middle ground)- The 'Surround Sound' isn't actually very surround and it can be problematic to use. If you're listening to a stereo sound feed, then don't bother with it. It just makes your music or whatever sound very tinny and reverb a bit, like if you were in an auditorium. However if you're watching a movie with actual surround sound, it gives you an even clearer separation of sounds so it fakes it a bit and makes the sound more immersive. However you're NOT going to hear things in actual 360 surround sound.Con's- Feels pretty plasticy and cheap. I can't say anything about actual durability, but you don't feel like you're holding nearly 200 bucks of electronics.- Buttons on the Headset. Bad location, bad format, not easily separated by touching them when they're on your head. You're probably going to be either taking them off to adjust the volume or turning them on/off.- Low frequency sounds. These don't actually have a hugely expanded frequency range (How low and high do they go) and these are easy to bottom out. For instance I FRAPS'd a scene in Bad Company 2 where a satellite hits the ground and that hit the bass limit on these instantly. Playing Dubstep will also bottom them out in short order too.Overall I love the things, but I've never had a Sennheiser product that wasn't awesome so for me that's kind of par for the course. Of course the final question is do I think they're worth the price and I'd have to say yes. They have a great combination of sound fidelity and comfort without costing an arm, leg, and precious organ in the process.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth the cash, worth the hype."

    ","First of all, these headphones have great sound.  I'm no audiophile and I don't own a significant number of wireless headphones so I'm not the best to judge whether they are the best in their class as far as sound goes.  They are decently comfortable, but the cup size is just slightly too small for my ears.  The range works really well for me, through walls and other things with lots of interference.Lots of people have reviewed these features and I find that I'm not going to add anything to them so I will start with what I find intensely annoying about these headphones.1)  No auto off/power-saving on the HEADPHONES.  That's right, you lay down the headphones one day and pick them up the next the headphones will be dead, hope you weren't planning on listening to them.  I'm unable to comprehend why Sennheiser thought lack of power save or auto off would be ok in a pair of battery operated headphones.  The headphones don't even eventually turn off when you turn off the base and there is absolutely no signal.2) Auto-off on the BASE.  You have to turn on the headphones and the base every time you use the headphones.  When the headphones are turned off eventually the base (which is plugged into the wall) will turn off.  If you put the headphones on the charger it will turn off the headphones which means the base will eventually power off.  It does not turn back on when you remove or turn on the headphones, you have to do that via a separate button on the base.  The only explanation I can come up with for this backwards design is that the engineer that was supposed to put the power-save feature in the headphones concluded there wasn't enough room in there for the circuitry so they put it in the base instead?3) Easy to break the ear cups.  If you run out of battery at least you can replace it.  The ear cups twist to the side.  This mechanism can either be really loose and easy to remove or sometimes it is like you super-glued the ear cup on.  If you force the ear cup the little plastic tabs will break and you will need to purchase new ones.  They are difficult to find, take a while to ship and are expensive.  So be really careful.In all I like the headphones and the mobility they provide.  These usability features make the headphones considerably less desirable in my estimation and I wouldn't pay so much for the same pair again.  When I bought one pair I liked the range and quality so much I went out and purchased another pair.  However, if I had used them enough I wouldn't have.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound/range and good comfort the rest of the experience leaves a lot to be desired

    ","I began looking for an audio solution for TV viewing about 4 months ago. I have had some worsening hearing loss for a while now and it has taken me from irritating my wife due to the volume being turned up so loud to really impacting me when I realized I was missing out on a good deal of what was being said on shows/movies.My expectations were not to find something that worked as well or were as comfortable as a wired high end headphone. I wanted something with no static, comfort and with solid sound.The journey that eventually led me to the Sennheiser RS 170 was as follows:1. The Sony MDRRF985RK Wireless RF Headphones: Bought at a club for around $65. These are an RF over the ear model, but they were very heavy, produced static when I moved around, but did produce good sound overall. In the end I just could not handle the noise. My wife made the comment ""you know in electronics you most often get what you pay for"".2. The Sennheiser IS 410 Headphones: Bought locally for around $130. There are an IR in ear ""stethoscope model"" similar in style to TV Ears. The sound reproduction was pretty good, but the comfort of the in ear type phones after an hour was terrible for me. Additionally, due to these being IR it took very little movement (pass my hand in front of the phones) to interfere with the sound. My wife again made the comment ""you know in electronics you most often get what you pay for"".3. Staying with Sennheiser due to the great sound of their wired headphones, I then tried the Sennheiser RS120 Over-Ear 900MHz Wireless RF Headphones. I purchased these for about $90. These surprisingly have terrible sound in MHO (they are Sennheiser's so I expected more) and these over the ear phones have a padding cover material that gets warm and sweaty in less than hour. At any price I could not use these.It was time to break down and spend the extra bucks on the highly regarded Sennheiser 170's, which I purchased here on Amazon.For the money, I could not be more pleased. These have ended my search and work great with minor flaws that I can live with.Pros:1. Fantastic sound at both low and high volumes2. The bass boost and surround sound really work well. Neither are right for every listening situation but where they are helpful, they are very nice to have and make a huge difference.3. The range and clarity are far beyond my expectations. I did not need the range as much as some other reviewers, but these are great. The headphones are very clear and have a very nice sound to them.4. These are very lightweight, especially considering they are housing a rechargeable AAA battery in each side.5. The build quality of the headphones and the transmitter seems very good, and while not terribly important the transmitter looks good too.Cons:1. As others have mentioned, the buttons on the right phone that control the volume, on/off. base boost and surround sound are difficult to discern. The on/off is placed between the volume up and volume down, so I have turned them off a few times when trying to adjust volume. This is not a big deal, but my guess is Sennheiser will improve this in the future.2. These are quite comfortable, but after a couple hours they do tend to get my ears a little warm. I can live with this as it is minor.3. I wear glasses and in general over the ear cans are not great for eyeglass wearers. These do tend to place a little pressure on the temples, but I only notice it after wearing them for a long time. Again, a small thing, but worth mentioning.Overall, I am very happy with these and they are worth every dime. You can spend less, but in the end you will not be nearly as pleased. You can spend the same on TV Ears, but they are IR and do not have digital or Kleer Technology and will not produce anything close to the great sound the RS 170's do.",4.0 out of 5 stars,RS 170 Solution For TV Use
23,"on December 22, 2017",,"I liked the concept of headphones you can sit on a stand which also charges the batteries. No removal of the batteries for use in an external charger.

Voice. For $130 headphones, this is unacceptable. Additionally, the sound is terrible. Nearly devoid of bass. The stand is necessary for operation, you can't connect to, say, your phone and take a walk.

    ","We bought this and an extra headset.  The sound is clear and clean, actually much better than the sound from our elaborate speaker system.  We bought these because one of our dogs freaks out at the telephone ring sounds on certain TV shows.  Have no idea what causes that, but it must be really annoying to the dogs.Sennheiser tech support has been incredibly responsive.  info@sennheiserusa.com.I wrote to them before I purchased because of some reviews here which mentioned interference problems with 2.4Ghz wifi systems.  I promptly received an excellent explanation that allowed me to avoid that issue.When the headset base is first turned on, it will search the 2.4Ghz wifi spectrum for an open channel.  When it finds one, it remembers that and will return there the next time unless you go to some effort to make it find a new one.  If you are not directly managing your home wifi system, this can result in interference problems.  There are actually only 3 wifi channels, although you would expect more because of the channels numbers of 1-11.  In actual use, the signal covers 3-4 of these channels, so there are really only three useful channels: 1, 6, and 11.  If you have control of your wifi setup, set it and lock it on either channel 1 or 11 before initializing this headset system.  (This may be problematic if you live in an apartment complex or have neighboring homes that are quite close.  You may want to download one of the wifi analyzers for your phone first and understand what channels already have strong signals that are not coming from your wifi.  It's possible that the spectrum is too crowded for you to reliably use this headset.)  We had two wifi routers (big house), but I managed to collapse everything to channel 1 and move some essential access to the 5Ghz band, which is generally wide open.  As a result, we have no interference problems.We also had problems getting the two headsets to have independent volume control.  Sennheiser tech support (thank you, Lachlan!) readily provided detailed instructions to resolve this.  (Unfortunately, the Sennheiser documentation is not very well written and actually contradicts the correct setup instructions.)  There is also a YouTube video that explains this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brFXknPUjPcWe did a lot of research before settling on this unit, and we are very happy we did.

    ","Sound is great, however I to have a similiar complaint.  Having the on off botton directly inbetween the increase and decrease volume buttons is very annoying.  Basically you have to take the headphones off in order to increase or decrease the volumne which makes not sense at all.  Had they put a more raised identification plastic then you could identify the buttons easily by touch then you could leave them on.  Also I find the head phones do not automatically power off if the sound stops from my computer after a period of time, you have to manually shut them off, or you will eat through your batteries.  I need to investigate that last statement a little bit more.The sound is good, so I will keep them.  Note if you makes out the volume you will get a hiss.

    ","My hearing is getting worse and worse as I get older.  I bought these for myself with the goal of me being able to use them while watching TV and have control over the volume for myself while my wife has control over the volume in the room.  They have more than achieved that goal; my wife sets the volume at level 6 to 8 to view where for me before it had to be in the low 20's.  I listen with the headphones and can hear better than ever before.  There is no 'leakage' from the phones to bother others in the room.  The sound through them far exceeds what I expected; with the surround on it brings a whole new level of experience to much of what I watch.  The charge when full has lasted through a days sports and evenings entertainment viewing without running out.  I can go to the kitchen or bathroom with them on and they don't drop the signal.  Beer frig in the basement is off limits though; the signal is lost there.  For their purpose and what my initial goal was I am very happy with them.Some notes: I had a bit of a difficult time getting them hooked up as I didn't have an audio output that wasn't in use.  I ended up having to have a friend who is in the business give me a splitter and that has worked out fine.  (These are available on Amazon)  Second, turning them on for use, ('pairing' in their terminology) each time you use them is a bit tedious; you can't just take them off the charger and use them.  You have to go through a process of holding the on button on both the sender and receiver until they fast blink and then keeping them near one another so they can 'pair'.  Not a big thing but it takes some getting used to.  Where others have mentioned trouble putting them on the charger I haven't experienced this.  I just take them off, tun them off, and gently place them in the right spot.  Bingo.  Even the first time I hit is right away.  I think you just need to look at it and understand the concept and go with it.  Finally, and others have mentioned this; the volume controls (design) on the headphones is useless.  I've tried several times and can't get it right to 'the touch'.  I have to take them off and on to adjust the volume.

27,"on January 3, 2016",,Update: concerning the headset shutting down. I replaced the batteries and the system is working fine. I keep the headset on the stand all the time except when I use them so the charge must not be keeping the batteries charged. When put on the stand the charge light comes on and when I go to get the head set the charge light is off. They where completely charged before being installed in the head set when purchased.Update: after using the RS 170 I have reduced the star to 3 which I think is generous. I have found the volume to be so low that much of the programing that comes on I can not hear it well enough to enjoy. The Volume is no were near as good as the RS / HDR120 I have had. In fact  one set is in my bedroom and at such times I have to go to the bedroom to listen to the programing.Amazon says They can't be returned and I can't find a way to contact them via email to ask about repair. I contacted Sennheiser but don't look for any help from them since these were 3 party from Amazon sold by GMartGlobal. Thank you.Update 2018. My review still stands with another problem. The ear pads have pretty much pealed away after 2 years wear. These are taken care of and hung on the stand at days end. Volume is still a problem with me and the buttons are impossible to easily find and press the correct one. Due to these problems I will be looking at other brands when ready to buy next time.

    ","This is exactly what I was looking for in a set of headphones.First, I was looking for something that was wireless.  I have a set of Skull Candy Aviators that I've enjoyed for the past 2 years, but the wire on it was growing consistently more irritating.  When the guy that sits across from me at the office bought a set of wireless Bluetooth headphones...  that was it.  I couldn't take the wires any more.My requirements were:1. Wireless to my head.  That means that they didn't have to be completely wireless, such as Bluetooth.  In fact, what I really wanted was...2. A charging base station that I could plop the headphones on when I went to a meeting, lunch, etc...  to extend the usage further into the day.3. High quality sound.The RS 170's met all of these needs perfectly.  The charging/base station plugs directly into the stereo jack on my docking station, and the headphones rest and charge on the base station.  They connect wireless from there.  The sound is incredible, and the ease of setting them onto the charger is great.So far, I haven't had a day that I couldn't get through listening to them, and on some days that means 8 hours of near constant use.I'm very pleased overall.",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are fantastic.
29,"on November 30, 2015",,"I bought this initially for one of my parents who would get frustrated by ambient conversations and noises while trying to watch shows with heavy dialogue that wasn't always crisp and easy to discern.  I set this up (very easy) and for a year now, my Dad spends about 80% of his tv watching time wearing them.  (Added bonus to him is he can pretend he can't hear other people talking to him.)  My Mom wants to watch the news while doing things around the house, so I got her her own set as well.  They call this ""the best gift ever"".  I then bought this for myself because sometimes I really want to hear the dialogue in real time and subtitles are often wrong or lagging.  I have excellent hearing, but I watch a lot of independent films which sometimes have sound issues.  Also, these are great if you live somewhere where you have neighbors on adjoining walls - if I'm listening to a live show that's rather noisy, I often wear them so only I am enjoying the noise.  I've fallen asleep in them a few times, they are quite comfortable.  The only quirk is I have to pull out the plug in the tv and plug it back in for it to work and I really hate the little tiny buttons on the bottom of one of the ears - they should be raised shapes, not the nonsense there now.  I have another family member who wants these now as well - eventually we will probably have one set per tv.  The best part about this is they work perfectly and only the person watching tv has to listen to it - and they can hear it at whatever volume makes them happy.  Really a great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars,An Excellent Product

    ","First of all I have to say something about the seller, DAHMART the best. I read all the reviews there are always one stars. I have had headphones in the past gave them up they hurt my ears and head went to tv ears as I am hard of hearing and have to have the tv very loud even then I still could not understand what was being said. The tv ears helped a lot but no stereo. I was looking quality pair as the ones in the past were very cheap and you get what you pay for. I came across the Sennheiser RS 170 a little more then I wanted to pay but they did have a refurished pair. As they were a hundred dollars less I went for them. Then I thought I'll get two pair one for me and one for my son, we love to watch action movies together. now here is why I started with the seller. I had ordered on a Friday they came on Monday. The set up was very easy as there was only one sound output on the tv,one had to come off the dvd player. We put Die Hard on It was almost as it I got my hearing back the bass and dynamic was something I have not heard in years even with the action going on I could still hear what was being said. I never once knew I had them on. About half way into the movie my son's pair went out, I had charged them both sixteen hours like it said to do, so we put stander batterys in it started working after he hit them on his hand, they lasted another half hour. I e-mail the seller in five min I had a reply they ask for my phone number I gave it to them. the phone rang, DAHMART was on the line. I told them what was going on, they said don't worry about it and e-mail me a postage prepay while I was on the phone to put on the return, I sent them back on Tueday, Monday I had a new pair in hand. So far I just love them so does my son. I will get back with an update once I have had them longer but for now I see there are only one refurbished in stock I will say go for it. Make sure it's coming from DAHMART. I did go through Amazon so I could use one click. Well I am back 8/27/12 so far so good I I know its not real but the dynamic bass and surround sound is right on the money, I was watching the Hunger Games there were an arrow shot pass the head of someone that had his back to me, it went pass his right ear I heard it go pass mine, I could almost feel the wind off of it. 9-10-12  I am back to edit. I went to see my brother in GA. took the headphones my brother fell in love with them the first five minutes, he got up and ordered him a pair. They came just like mine very quick but I think they may have been the same pair I sent back because it was giving him the same trouble, he looked at them and said I see the problem the battery compartment there is a wire that the battery presses onto but the wire was to high and the + end was going under it. He didn't want to take a chance bending the wire down, I told him to get him a small bit of tinfoil place it on wire when he put the battery in it made good contact all is fine he is happy. ""Up date"" my brother ordered him another pair for upstairs so he would not have to unhook them when he watch tv. 6/19/14 still going strong I use them every time I watch tv and that's every day. I get up and forget I have them on I have sit at my desk over an hour forgetting to take them off.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dynamic

    ","After reading all of these reviews, getting recommendations from family, and a great review on the wirecutter, I picked up a set of these from Amazon this past week. As soon as they came in, I hooked them up and started using them.Pros:Fairly comfy, although the padding could be thicker on the area that rests on the top of your head.Easy setup and comes with an adapter from 1/8 to 1/4 for your receiver.Cons:This is where it strikes out, firstly, the set that I got had great clear sound and dialogue was terrific, except for whatever reason, the right headphone speaker had a mild high pitch background squeal. You could only hear it during quiet scenes or when the audio was muted. I disconnected the audio completely and the squeal remained, I adjusted the volume on the headphones, thinking it was too high and this was basic high volume feedback, nope, the squeal didn't change.Amazon however was terrific about getting me a replacement quickly, but imagine my frustration when the second pair of headphones had another issue. The squeal was gone, but the second pair of headphones had intermittent static which was seemingly caused by what... I'm not sure. Even wit the audio disconnected (again) the headphones would randomly start playing sounds, I can't describe what they were, I'm assuming there was some sort of interference, so you would hear warbling and high/low tones. They could disappear for 5-10 minutes, and then come back, distorting the audio if something was playing. I reconnected my original defective set and these had none of this static, but again, they still had the high pitch noise in the right speaker.I'm fairly disappointed with Sennheiser's quality control, and am now wary of the brand. This is quite surprising to me too because I have used many of their headphones in the past and have had no quality control issues at all. Maybe it was a run of bad luck, but now I'm not sure which set to pick up as I think Sennheiser is the industry leader with wireless theater headphones...",2.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser QA is slipping.

    ","Expected much better, although not sure why since my old Sennheiser headphones weren't that great either.  Thought the newer, more expensive model would be better, when in fact they aren't even as good as the mediocre, much lower priced model I've been using.  Specifically the volume is very limited ...highest output is about half the volume level of my old set of phones.  On the upside, the headphones are made of quality material and they are much easier to re-charge than my old set.  They fit well and don't slide off my head like the old set.  But if it's sound you're after, these aren't the ones to buy.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Mediocre Sound at a HIGH price.
33,"on May 13, 2015",,"While I would say it is everything I expected I wasn't pleasantly surprised.  It performs well, it took some adjusting and set up time (a lot of this not the fault of the headphones and much of it was).  The sound is pleasant and I can now watch action movies with explosions and gunshots loudly without disturbing my neighbors (I live in a duplex)========SOUND QUALITY====================Sound quality is fairly good.  There is an attentuator switch on the back that you mainly you just need to find the right setting for to get rid of background noise.  One thing I will comment on is the background noise.  For these headphones to work optimally you need to have the sound of the sound source turned all the way up and use the headphones to adjust volume.  From what explanation I've received if you try to turn the headphones up they may try to amplify the signal which creates some distortion and a low annoying buzzing sound that is very obvious when the sound is quiet such as during conversations.  This problem is completely gone now that I keep the signal source turned all the way up and adjust on my headphones.  If I turn the headphones up so loud it hurts my ears when there is sound I can hear some background noise when it's quiet, however that is to be expected and would probably be present with wired headphones.  Other than that issue the sound is great, there is adequate bass without the booster on and once you use the booster it will make you feel like your sitting next to the explosion.  Voices are clear and when watching some tv shows I can hear things you would probably never hear without headphones (small conversations in the background etc. it really adds another dimension to the shows sometimes)=================FIT AND DESIGN================The fit is comfortable and the adjustable headband goes from way to small to too big for me which makes me feel like they would fit comfortably on a wide range of head sizes.  The physical design is nice and once you get used to the buttons you can adjust volume on the fly without much thought or effort (I am doing it easily only a couple days in) There are lights on the transmitter that signify when surround and bass boost are on, and you will get a beep when toggling either one of these settings.  The charging base is very easy and pleasant to use and one advantage is these headphones take standard eneloop AAA batteries so it should be insanely simple to find replacements.  You also hear a beep if you try to turn the volume up when it is already at max volume. All these features of the user interface make for a pleasant experience.The only other thing I feel I should mention is the transmitter has an auto off to conserve power.  If the headphones have been turned off for 5 minutes then the transmitter will automatically switch off.  The light under the power sign is actually a button you simply have to hold for a second to turn it back on.  This is sometimes annoying when I have to switch the headphones off, do something, come back later turn them back on and sit down and wonder why there is no sound when I remember the transmitter has turned itself off.  This isn't that big of a deal I am abled bodied enough but if the target use is for an elderly person who is hard of hearing and can't get up to walk over to the TV and turn the transmitter on this could be an issue.The set up took some configuring before I figured all this out and hopefully reading this review can help someone who was having the background noise issue like I was.  There were several other set up hurdles I had to go through but none of those were directly related to the headphones simply configuring it to work wear I can use my sound system when I want, and use the headphones when I want without having to go in and change settings every time or plug and unplug the headphone jack on the sound system.  The solution I came up with was to pass through the audio via hdmi to the TV and hook the headphones to the audio out on the TV (I connect all my hdmi cables to my sound system and then the sound system has an hdmi out to my TV anyways I just had to switch a setting)",4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is pleasant and I can now watch action movies with explosions and gunshots loudly without disturbing my neighbors (I l
34,"on September 29, 2016",,"I bought a pair of these for work, and later a second pair for home. They are that good in terms of sound quality and convenience.Pros:- Very good sound quality.- Very, very good bass with little to no distortion. These will cleanly and stably play low notes that other headphones can't even hit at all. A frequency sweep down to 20 Hz showed no dropoff in sound quality or in volume.- Really good range. I tried walking away from my desk at work and was able to get about 150 feet away and around a corner before I noticed any dropping out.- Comfortable for long wear - these are ""around the ear"" headphones where the cups sit against your head, not your ears.So why not 5 stars? There are a few cons:- When you take them off the charging cradle, you have to press the power button on the base and then again on the headphones for them to connect. I don't know why this isn't automatic, or at least just a single button press.- When the input is very low volume, the signal will drop out.

    ","Now these headphones are truly impressive. I've been using a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 3 (On Ear) headphones, and these new Sennheisers are way better. No more ""crushed ear pains"" after watching a long movie with on-ear pressure. The surround sound is incredible. All aspects of this product are well thought out from the charging base and transmitter to the headphones themselves. The clarity is perfect. Zero hiss or buzz. Feels like I'm in a movie theater now when watching movies. Time will tell if these are truly the best, but the ""Oh Wow!"" factor is pretty high right now.In case you're wondering how I have them connected... and how I'm using them: I'm using an REI DA-21 optical converter to convert the digital optical link on the back of a Vizio TV. This allows the direct conversion of optical digital output, to analog audio without having to jack into a receiver. I'm using this television in my office, and I'm very close to the transmitter when I use the headphones. I'm really happy with this product. Couldn't be better. One more note: I saw one posting that said there were no ear-height adjustments on these headphones, and that is incorrect. There are, you just have to pull down on each side and the ear-pieces and they will click down and adjust for various distances and ear-heights.

    ","I bought these headphones to replace an older set of Sennheiser's. My previous headphones always were a bit big for my head but the sound was great for my imperfect hearing. Also, the volume adjustment was a wheel and I could adjust the sound from each ear.I read many of the comments here before I purchased the RS170, and was concerned about the location of the volume buttons that many complained about. Well, a little ingenuity goes a long way.I loved the sound of the headphones, they fit me perfectly (not too loose or tight) and I can walk around the house or in my yard with rarely a dropped signal. So, it was worth a little effort to modify those confusing up/down buttons.I rummaged thru my costume jewelry and found a loose stone that had a flat side to it. I glued it to the off button on the headphones. Now, when wearing the headphones, I can feel for the stone to push the on/off button. I also use it for reference to increase/decrease the sound. I have no complaints now with the headphones.I would suggest to Sennheiser that they add a slight ""lift"" to that on/off button (similar to braille bumps).The seller was  Amazing Deals Online and I received my order 2 days ahead of the eta. Packaging was perfect.So far, I have been completely satisfied with this product and, as always, with Amazon.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I needed

    ","Update: I'm taking this down to 3 stars because I'm noticing the headphones cutting out very frequently on quiet passages of songs. There's a threshold signal for these to work, and it's fairly high - you need to crank your computer / audio source's volume up and turn the headphones' volume down.The range on these is excellent - I can pick up the signal from my computer anywhere in my home without noticeable delay or jitter. The audio quality of the 'phones is also superb, comparable to the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones I use at work. That said, I have seen them cut out on occasion - worse when I'm sitting right in front of the computer than far away - and think this may be due to interference with the 2.4 GHz band of my wireless network. Additionally, the headphones are for wider heads than mine, and get uncomfortable after long periods of listening. They're also pretty expensive.The UI on these is clunky - there's no toggle for the bass boost or surround features, and the buttons are of course out of your line of sight when these are on your head, so you're left wondering whether these features are on or off.If you need the range, buy these. They transmit a digital signal and can cover a whole house. If you're looking for shorter-range headphones, you'll find cheaper options that offer similar audio quality and more features.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good range when they work - they don't do quiet well

    ","I purchased these as my other pair was not very comfortable (different brand all together all together and much cheaper). Although my cheaper pair had great sound for the price of $35 the headphones themselves were covered in a cheap foam material and also weren't padded very well. After hooking these up and charging them for th required time I was very excited to use as I wear them to watch tv in bed while my husband is sleeping. My tv has both the headphone Jack as we as the Audio out jacks (my old pair only had the capability of using the headphone Jack) which I thought I would like so that I didn't have to get up and physically switch into the headphone jack.. Anyway if you want to use these headphones in the Audio jack you will have to use the controls on the headphones to control the sound which makes it impossible while wearing as the controls are impossible to find without taking them off. I was aware of this from they reviews but I thoufht I would try. They were correct.. It is a poor design. With that being said, I will be plugging them into the headphone jack from now on and using the tv remote to adjust the volume. Poor control design as well as useless ""power boost and surround sound"" buttons that do not make a noticeable change. Didn't matter to me as they sound pretty decent.

    ","Quickly, here's something to be aware of about these otherwise excellent headphones: let's say you're watching a movie during a quiet scene but one with no music—something suspenseful. When the sound drops below a certain point, instead of the ambient sound in the movie that you'd hear from your speakers or analog headphones, you get absolutely nothing, like a switch has been thrown. And it has, because the software has decided not to transmit sounds below a certain threshold. It's way more common and distracting that you might think. Pretty annoying. I've compared these to  other wireless Sennheiser models that transmit an analog signal, and though they have their weaknesses, the at least transmit the quiet stuff rather than delete it. There's no mode I've found to avoid this, and no control that affects what the low-volume cutoff is.I could also pick on the control panel's weird buttons that are hard to find while you're wearing it, but it's not so annoying as the dropouts.To throw in some praise, I love the style of the base, the circumaural headphones are VERY comfortable, and the sound is pretty good when the input signal is loud enough.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very quiet passages ""black out"" altogether"

    ","Feb 10, 2012This is one of the BEST purchases that I've ever made.I have it hooked up to the RCA jacks in the back of my HD DirecTV receiver. This way I can listen to programs without even having the TV on. I can leave the room and roam around the house and still hear the TV show. I can also hear my shows while vacuuming without having to raise the volume of the TV or stereo system.I can't tell you how many times I've missed information that I was waiting for on HLN, CNN, etc. or the local news because I happened to be in another room when it aired. This no longer happens. I find that I am wearing them most of the day!The headphones are so comfortable that it's almost like they are not there. The sound is out-of-this-world! When you are receiving a program in 5.1 surround, you can definitely hear a difference when you add the bass and surround.I also listen to the New Age station on DirecTV while reading. Using these headphones makes the listening an outstanding experience.As far as how far they reach - the furthest that I have gone so far is the mailbox which is over 100' from the unit. No change at all. No static. No loss of ANYTHING.The batteries last FOREVER. As I've said, I've been using them most of the day. I haven't timed it, but I think that I've used them at least 8+ hours a day (am I weird?). They were still going strong when I was finished for the day.I used to miss what was said in a show and had to up the volume on the TV or stereo system, and still missed some of the conversation.

I decided to get a wireless headphone to watch tv at night in the living room without bothering him and had read a bunch of reviews of cheaper and more expensive models. I have to say, I'm extremely happy with the RS 170 and chose it mostly for the ergonomic headphone design that cups your ears and looks more solid than the lower models. It's perfect for my purpose and is very quick to recognize the stationary device and transfer the sound to the headphone. It doesn't lose any connection no matter where I am in my house and it has really prevented some resentment and fights that could've happened over something as stupid as different sleep schedules.

They also have great battery life - I've accidentally left them on for 24 hours a couple times (With no audio playing), and they still had hours of battery life left.  I have yet to actually have them run out of battery power when I wanted to use them, and have used them (With audio playing) almost all day, on occasion.  Good range, too.  I get a strong signal throughout my 4-room apartment.They're not perfect - turning them off manually is a bit of a pain, since both the base and the headset have buttons that have to be held down for a couple seconds, but they automatically turn off if you leave the headset on the charger for a couple minutes.  They also can get uncomfortable after a while.  This seems to be the case of all headphones, and these aren't too bad, in comparison.  I find that switching between have the headphones around my ear and over the ear pretty much gets around most discomfort.I find volume fairly easy to adjust, if I'm careful about the button location, but it's not exactly intuitive.

This cuts out the neighbor's barking dogs and clattering from the kitchen.  The sound is great.  It has decent range, though there are minor gaps while walking to the bathroom which is beyond the kitchen and bedroom so several sets of walls.  The charging stand works great and it pairs with the base unit easily by pressing a button on the charging stand and another on the headphones.  The one thing I don't like is turning the sound up or down on the headphones.  There is a series of buttons on the right ear piece which control (in this order):  Volume Up, On/Off, Volume Down, Surround, and Bass.  These buttons are nearly flush on the outside of the earpiece meaning you can't use the buttons by feel while they are on your head.  To make any of those adjustments you have to take the headphones off your head, turn on the light, push the button you are wanting to adjust, then put them on your head and see if that is what you wanted, then take them off again if you need another adjustment.

46,"on December 9, 2014",,"If I watch TV it is usually after the rest of my family has gone to bed, and since our house is small enough to prohibit a quality sound system without waking everyone attempting to sleep I decided to look into some wireless headphones.  Another reason is my furnace was placed in the middle of my house just off the living room where my TV is, and it gets old having to keep adjusting the TV volume whenever it kicks on.It seems as though with wireless headphones there's no happy middle ground price-wise without running into some quality control issues.  Anything sound of 150 - 200 bucks consistently gets reviews of glitchy performance, scratchy feedback, etc.  The list price on these is north of $250, and the reviews are very positive.I ended up getting one of the best deals on this set I've ever gotten on anything here on Amazon due to an Amazon glitch (they are so awesome...I totally didn't expect them to come through in the sense that I would've been okay if they told me to take a hike).  I wasn't really prepared to spend as much as I determined would be necessary to get a quality set, so I'm happy I was able to get these.I give this 4 stars because:A. Really easy to set up.B. Really comfortable... I've already watched several movies with these, and at no point during a 4 or 5 hour stretch of wearing them have I felt any discomfort.C. They've got great styling, including the charging base.  The black color helps it to blend in on my TV stand.D. They sound good enough for what I need.What I don't like:A. The sound isn't a rich or deep as other headphones I've used, specifically the bass register.  There's a ""surround"" feature that helps to enrich the sound experience, but overall the bass is somewhat weak.  Not a deal breaker, but something to consider.B. The control buttons are difficult to find as they aren't nicely marked with obvious sensory indicators.  On the right ear there are the volume buttons, the power button, and some other audio controls.  They should have a raised groove or something like you'd find on the F and J keys on a keyboard so you know where your fingers are.  These do not, so you end up fumbling around a bit trying to adjust the volume.  Kind of annoying, but not a deal breaker.  I think if I'd paid full price I'd be a little miffed.What I cannot comment on:Battery life... When I'm done watching I place these back on the charging station, and the longest stretch I've gone is about 5 hours (I'll watch TV while working on some woodcarving projects I've got).  I don't know how long they'd go beyond 5 hours.Range... I'm about ten feet from my TV and thus the base station.  I don't expect to ever get much further than that.All in all these are great wireless headphones, with the only real detractor being the handling of the control buttons.  Even the sound can probably be adjusted by messing around with my TV settings...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable...wish the control buttons were easier to use...

    ","A birthday present for She Who Must Be Obeyed, and she loves them.  Fairly easy to set up, even someone not particularly tech savvy such as her was able to get it operational with little effort.  As others observed, the buttons on the side of the ear pad take a little getting used to, but what doesn't these days.  Range is decent, not outstanding.  We have a rather sprawled out house and the headphones will reach most of the main part of the house, cutting out just past our laundry area on the way to the garage.  There are things like a refrigerator and walls between the transmitter and that location, so no doubt some adjustment to the transmitter's placement may help.  However, where it is yields easy access for the primary user and from its location she can go to most of the spots she typically goes while she'll be using them.Was potentially concerned about surround muffs getting hot over the course of a listening session.  But those fears were unjustified.  This headset is even more comfortable than our ancient Sennheiser 404s.  There is also some sound blocking from these muffs, which she likes because then she can avoid hearing me drone on and on about whatever.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!
48,"on January 19, 2015",,"After a week of using these headphones, I find a major drawback to them is adjusting the buttons. For me, it has been a crapshoot to try and adjust them while they are on my head. Taking them off is a big pain since I watch the TV in a fairly dark room and I have to turn on the light to find the buttons, while I pause whatever TV show I am watching. Since I do adjust the sound often enough, it brings down my rating for these headphones. A minor negative issue for me, is the comfort of the ear cups on my head. I find that after two hours I have to adjust the headphones on my head to relieve the pressure of them on my ears. Not a big, but uncomfortable after a while.The sound, and quality, get five stars. Excellent stereo separation and clear as a bell. I have moderate hearing problems and these headphones eliminate the issues I have when listening to TV via my surround sound system. It is a pleasure listening with them. An added plus is the ability to leave the room and still hear what's playing on the TV.If Sennheiser could work out a better button system, it would definitely be a five-star product.UPDATE: I placed a tiny bead of eproxy onto the on/off button, creating a little raised ""bump"" on the button. Now it is much easier to locate without looking. Sennheiser should consider a minor modification like this to it's on/off button to make it easier to locate.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, except for the button adjustments."

We had 2 RS 120 transmitters and 3 headphone receivers that we bought -- I want to say 7-8 years ago, but maybe it wasn't quite that long.  Finally decided to upgrade since these were on close out.The great thing about the channel selectors was that we could run both transmitters at the same time hooked up to different home theater systems.  We can't do that with these RS 170s, which is a bit of a bummer, but not a hugely big deal at this point.The sound is much clearer on the RS170 than we had on the RS120.  We used to get background static interference in certain spots or tilting the head at certain angles.  No problems thus far with the RS170s.  They're very easy to setup and use.

    ","I was looking forward to a great wireless headphone for use with my new TV.  For the price, I was really disappointed in the build quality and design.  First, the brace that attaches to the ear pods is made of plastic, not metal.  After a while they lose their tensile strength and get loose.  When you try to tighten the phones, the band actually kinks because it is only thin plastic.Second, and this one was very surprising, the adjustment buttons are implemented in such a way that they are very hard to access and adjust, even with both hands.  To adjust, you have to take the phones off, and then get a bright light to actually see the buttons.  The buttons are extremely small and hard to adjust if you have normal adult-size fingers.  I have other phones that cost much less that put this product to shame in ease of adjustment.  The only reason I didn't give one star is due to their sound.  They sound great.  So, even with a good sound, they fail in design and build quality.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Worth the Money

    ","Sound quality is excellent with exception of dropouts (addressed below).Buttons are definitely FAR too difficult to use without removing the headset and looking at them carefully.  This is an amazing oversight on the part of the product design team.  Did they do any user studies at all?When I first set up the unit, I placed it above my AV Receiver (no, not covering up the vents).  I use a wireless link to my subwoofer and the transmitter for this link is also on top of the AV Receiver.I quickly encountered extensive drop-outs while listening.  So I unplugged the subwoofer transmitter which I didn't need anyway as I use the headphones only when the speakers are off so that I don't bother family members who are sleeping.  This greatly reduced the drop-outs, but not completely.  I then looked at other possible sources of interference and noted that my wireless access point was very close to the headset base also.  I moved the access point to be on a shelf above the headset base.  Since that move, I have not had another drop-out.I understand the interference problem and have no expectation that the product should be able to deal with all interference.  But it sure would be nice if there was some specific feedback to help the user diagnose the problem.  Perhaps a flashing led that warns of poor SNR?  I'm an engineer, so I was able to work this out but I imagine the majority of consumers would assume the product was defective and return it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,As with any RF product...susceptible to interference
52,"on January 15, 2015",,"This works great.  The reason I did not give it five stars was for two reasons.  First, to turn the tower on and off you have to press and hold down a button.  This sounds easy but the tower is lightweight and tall.  This requires both hands to turn it on and shut it off.  It still doesn't sound to bad unless you have the headphones in your hand.  Secondly, the headphone on and off button is small and between the volume up and the volume down button.  I have not mastered the tactile feel of these buttons so I have to take them off to turn the volume up or down.  To turn off the headphones you have to hold down the button for a second or two so you seldom shut them off accidentally but, if you are trying to shut them off while still on your head, you can accidentally hold down the volume up button and then have to feel two buttons over while the volume is to high to turn it back down.  Better just take them off and make any adjustment.  The buttons are the same color and texture as the case surrounding them so you need good lighting to see which button you want.  If you are in a darkened room, it means getting up, going to the nearest lamp, and find your reading glasses to shut off the headphones.  The quality of sound and the operation of the equipment outweighs these inconveniences and I use them a lot.",4.0 out of 5 stars,This works great. The reason I did not give it five ...

    ","These things are pretty cool, bought them for my 71 year old father who is hard of hearing and he loves them. It has only been a couple of weeks but the battery life so far is pretty good, lasts him several hours. Unfortunately the TV he watches did not have a headphone jack or a L/R audio output so I had to buy a digital optical audio cable for the TV and a converter for the headphones, but they still work great. The headphones can get pretty loud but the soundproofing around the earmuffs meant to keep sound out also does a great job of keeping the sound in. I can walk into the room and it will be completely silent, then when he notices me he will take the headphones off and you can faintly hear the sound of the TV coming from the headphones that are now sitting on his lap, it is hilarious to see his face like  ""huh did you say something"". The most helpful thing about this is that my father is completely technologically challenged, so the fact that you can pretty much just lay the headphones on the stand and let them slide into place to charge is great.",5.0 out of 5 stars,good sound

    ","After reading reviews from various sites and seeing each rate it their #1, I decided to order them.  They are worth the expense.  I listened to headphones that friends bought from competitors and these are excellent in comparison.  These headphones deliver what they promise.  They are comfortable, hold a charge for a long time, have significant range, have better features than the competition, and provide a superior listening experience.  I am surprised how the surround sound adds to the enjoyment of watching a movie.  Bought to help my husband whose hearing is not what it was, I find that I, too, think this is a terrific product.  The only thing I'd recommend for those that buy these headphones is to go to the Sennheiser web site for directions on how to set the system up.  It is very simple.  So, no worries on that front.  I just found the directions that came with the headphones to fall short of the information provided by video on the manufacturer's site.",5.0 out of 5 stars,This product delivers an excellent listening experience

    ","I've only used these for a couple of hours so far and have not been too satisfied. There are several conspicuous problems I will highlight.-HummingIt seems there is a constant humming sound with these. It is not as bad when your source audio is set to max. It also isn't as bad on higher quality media. A blu-ray seems to have less humming than a DVD, a DVD less humming than streaming (Youtube, Netflix,etc). Most of my content is played from streaming, so the humming is rather noticeable.-Sound Drops on Quiet scenesAnytime there is no background noise and it's dialogue between characters that is quiet, the sound drops in and out. This is very annoying as quiet scenes are often the most important in a movie or show and you want to focus. It is difficult to focus when you'rw hearing all sorts of distortion and drops from your headphones. Similar to the humming, this problem is alleviated in higher quality media, but again, I mostly watch streaming media which makes the problem worse.-Inconvenient SetupThe headphones shutdown after being idle. To turn it on you have to get up and hit power on the transmitter then hit power on the headphones. It'd be much more convenient if you could power on the headphones and the transmitter with the power button on the headphones.These are not bad headphones though. Let me share with you what I do like about them.-SoundWhen the sound isn't dropping out our humming, it sounds very good. Bass is powerful, the softer sounds are crisp - you hear everything and it isn't drowned out by one particular sound. Very balanced. Music works much better than video audio on these headphones.-Ergonomic DesignThese headphones feel great. Unlike other posters, I have no problems finding which button to press. It didn't take me but a few minutes to realize the location of all the buttons and afterward I've been able to easily grope around to find them.I will update my review if I manage to find a solution to the humming and sound drops. I already own a pair of Sennheiser HD25-1 II for use with my laptop and portable MP3 player when I want to listen to music. I purchased this headphone to watch movies and play video games on the television. I can't recommend these for any type of video due to the humming and sound drops.What's most disappointing is this is not an issue with the transmission. It's an issue with the design, at least that's my impression. The transmitter never fails to send audio, it just seems as though it's stopping in an attempt to save power. It should be in a constantly active state looking to send any audio. Perhaps I'm misconstruing the issue. Regardless, it's frustrating and I can't recommend anyone purchase these. I will likely return my pair if I don't find a solution to the humming and sound drops.EDIT 6/18/2013I finally figured out how to stop the loud humming on my set. On the back of the transmitter is an attenuator switch. Apparently this needs to be set for 0db when using the RCA adapter and to -8db when using the auxiliary cable directly. My Panasonic television does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack, so the RCA adapter is my only choice.This is very confusing and many are going to think the headphones is defective because of this. Once it's set up right the headphones sound wonderful.There is a barely noticeable humming that I quickly fail to notice. Before the humming was very noticeable and sound would glitch on quiet scenes.I've changed my score to a 4/5. I won't give it a 5 because I don't understand why it doesn't have support for the fiber optical output, that way it would be purely digital. I'm not sure what the main difference is between RCA and Fiber optic and whether headphones would sound much different with the input, it's something I'll have to research a bit more, but it would've been nice to have the fiber optic option on the transmitter.I also think the design of the headphones are a bit questionable. The earcups swivel on some very thin plastic, I worry they might eventually crack. The headphones also are a bit large and when I'm wearing them my ear touches the inside of the earphone, usually more space is created.Still, the sound is wonderful, the battery life is excellent, the headphones are mostly comfortable, even more so due to being wireless and never having to experience tug or cables brushing against you.I got them for around $240. I think that's a decent price for them. They're not perfect, but to my knowledge there is nothing better on the market. The gaming headsets like Turtles have fiber optic and 'surround' but I've heard many audiophiles dismiss the sound quality on gaming headsets. The RS180 is an open headphone, so that's ruled out. Sennheiser has another wireless headphone out with fiber optics, I would be interested in testing that out someday if I see it in an electronics store. The reviews are mixed.If you must have a wireless headphone and don't mind paying a bit more for quality, this is for you. I hope Sennheiser continues to do R&D on Kleer. I think they're almost there, just need a few adjustments for the perfect wireless headphone.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Initial Impressions
57,"on January 19, 2015",,"Pros:  Great sound quality.  Very comfortable.  Sturdy.  Easy to recharge.Cons:  Terrible volume controls.  They are difficult to find as they are small flush mounted buttons on the bottom of hte right ear cup.  You can't tell if you are pushing the up, down, or mute until you hear the result.  You can also turn on or off the surround sound or bass boost while you are feeling for the volume controls on the base of the ear cup.  This is a poor design for this headset that has outstanding sound and is comfortable to wear.  I end up taking the head set off and adjusting the volume controls that I can then see.  An inconvenience to be sure but not one that would keep me from buying these.Also....my Samsung DLP 56"" won't allow you to plug this device into the back of the TV as they instruct if you are using an amp and separate speakers with a HDMI hook up.  The HDMI transmits a digital sound into the TV while the RCA outputs are analog.  So....in this case I had to connect the Sennheiser via RCA plugs into the back of my amp (audio out panel) and I had to run RCA plugs from my cable box and DVD player into the Amp ""audio in"" panel jacks.  It works just fine and the sound is still stereo but additional cables complicated the ""simple"" installation.Even with the installation hassle and poor volume control design, I would still recommend these as great ""TV ears"" because the headset volume is independent of the TV volume.

58,"on January 24, 2014",,"I'll let the true audiophiles argue over the fine points.  All I know is these sound fantastic and I'm in heaven.  I don't have a sound system for my big flat screen TV, and you know how those tiny speakers sound.  Ugh.  And I love music, concert Blu-rays, great movies with even greater soundtracks - my treat before bedtime now is to pick one and put these on.  Dang it!  I never heard half the stuff being played before.  Radiohead live:  I hear every awesome voice in the harmonies, distinctly, every joyful imperfection and perfection. Every layer of sound from the instruments. Joe Bonamassa accoustic Live at the Vienna Opera House - stunning clarity, richness and warmth.  Every string of each instrument being played comes through so clearly! You can not only hear the percussionist shaking a container in the midst of all those instruments, you can tell by listening what the container is made of and what's inside it. Incredible. Pearl Jam concert dvds I've watched multiple times, not even Blu-rays, and now hearing nuances I never did before.  I have a live performance of Ravel's Bolero with Valery Gergiev conducting the London Symphony Orchestra in which I never heard the opening maybe twenty bars, they were so soft.  Exquisite.Now when watching movies I don't have to keep turning the volume way up to hear what they're saying, then back down when the action kicks in.  I hear the whispers, the low asides, the muttered remarks. I can use them with the TV audio playing or not - no echo, no syncing issue.  I watch a lot of Brit TV and movies; depending on the region it's filmed in those accents can get so muddy it's hit or miss on understanding all the dialog.  No longer with these. I like a very warm sound, as high-pitched sounds are like glass breaking in my head, yet I don't like bass that ""booms"". These are the best of both worlds. I've discovered the high notes can be crystal clear without being screechy: SRV wailing away on the high-E string actually sounds good to me now, along with violins in the upper register. I find myself listening to my music files through my TV when the movie's over, via an external hard drive hooked up to a Boxee. They never sounded so good. It's always awesome to hear something new in music you've listened to a hundred times before. What's not so awesome is hearing all the thunking/slicing/blerching/squirting/squishing sounds of battle in certain movies.  Bleeeaahhh.  It doesn't matter now if I turn my head away because it still SOUNDS so awful. The downside to great audio, I guess.I didn't find the buttons to be a pain after the first night;  I just played with them until I got the feel of what was what. I have a problem with headphones of any size or weight causing pressure inside my ears. These don't, I guess because they fit around the ear and not on it.  They're really comfortable, and I have a big head (to hold my big technical brain, as illustrated below).  I only watch TV before I go to bed, so I can't say how'd they'd feel after more than two hours.These are truly plug and go, which was a big deal for me.  I'm a techno-idiot about hooking things up (I need diagrams) and for some reason ""wireless"" scared me.  I was actually looking for wired headphones because I understand ""plug into RCA audio out"" and that's about it. After being assured I would still be doing that with these (whew!) I dove in.  Thanks to some really great reviews in here I got exactly the sound I wanted, the very first time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Aural bliss
59,"on May 25, 2014",,"So i needed wireless headphones so that my wife and I could watch TV without bothering my daughter while doing her homework. These were the only ones that could be connected to more than one headset.  I followed the instructions and pressed power on button on transmitter. LED blinked approximately one blink per second. I then turned on the headset that came with transmitter while being very close. Headset's LED also blinked at about one blink per second. Very quickly they were connected and blink rate was about one blink per five seconds. I then powered off headset and tried to connect to the extra headset. Transmitter and headset kept blinking one blink per second which means they weren't seeing each other. I then went back to directions and found info about ""Associating"" the headset. To do this you have to hold down power on buttons on transmitter and headset for about seven seconds, and then the blink pattern changed and showed that they were now connected. So now if you press the power on button on transmitter one more time it will go into multi-connection mode, indicated by two blinks every five seconds instead of just one blink. Now turning on original headset and it also connected. I know that the directions tell you to turn on headsets first and then the transmitter but now that they have been connected in multilmode I turn them on in any order and they work fine. If you turn off all headsets the transmitter will turn itself off after a few minutes. When I want to use headsets I just press the on button on the transmitter and then press the on button on the headset. The transmitter comes up in multimode (two blinks every five seconds)  whether I'm using both or just one headset.  The quality of the sound and no dropped signal makes these one of the best headphones I've ever used. An extra bonus using these is that dialog is very clear and easy to understand even for my wife and i who have problems with the regular speakers (sometimes we turn on close captions).

It took a couple of minutes, and since then both headphone sets have worked perfectly.  Why the directions do not come with the extra headsets, I have no idea, but it would make things a lot easier.My only very tiny complaint now is that with the controls on top, we have to take the thing off to change the volume.

    ","It is unfortunate when the implementation of a product's controls stands in the way of a perfect score! Engineers and designers have achieved so much in terms of sound reproduction, digital transmission performance, high quality construction, quality materials, and beautiful form but what a blunder in the implementation of its controls! After a dozen or so efforts to learn to use the hard-to-feel, hard-to-operate, impossible-to-see (while listening) buttons on the unit, I abandoned the headphone's buttons to use instead the controls on my AV receiver to tweak the sound that comes from these otherwise amazing headphones. Why would they not include in the design an app and/or simple remote that mirrors the functions of the system's controls?As others have noted, the sound quality is amazing. This is especially true in direct mode where excess circuitry is minimized and only the pure source sound is delivered to the ears. Background noise is well below my hearing range, distortion of the sound source is not detectable by this reviewer, and the digital RF range is all over the house and out into the yard.With hundreds of great reviews on this product already in place, I don't wish to be repetitive. So, let me summarize this way: If I knew then what I know now, I would still buy it but with the same sentiments I have expressed here. It is unlikely the manufacturer will ever read this, so I can only hope that someday Sennheiser will include a simple remote device (perhaps an app) to control the headphones and the base, thus moving their wireless headphones from near perfect to perfect.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Near Perfection But For The Controls

    ","When I was looking for some good headphones to buy, I had narrowed it down to these and the Beats Studio headphones.  The main difference in reviews I read was that the Beats were great for bass-heavy music, but otherwise these were better.  My biggest concern with buying these was that I had no way of trying them out before purchasing them, whereas the Beats I could try out in Best Buy.  However I ended up with these, and am very glad I made the purchase.I HATE earbuds because they don't fit my ears right, are not comfortable, and are bad about sound leakage.  These are very comfortable for long periods of time, although my ears do get a little hot after a while and my earrings sometimes get in the way.  These are inherent to this type of headphone design, though, and I much prefer those issues to earbuds.The sound on these is great.  Also important to me, and something I couldn't find in reviews before purchasing, is that there is NO sound leakage whatsoever.  I can have my music blasting and my S.O. sitting right next to me can't hear a thing.  Further--and this may be a pro or a con depending on your lifestyle--I can't hear much of any outside sound when I'm listening.  If I've got the volume lower I can hear some, but I usually use these when I want to blast music without disturbing anyone else.The sound features are iffy to me.  I don't listen to a whole lot of bass-heavy music, but the bass boost doesn't seem to make a big difference.  I don't notice any difference with the ""surround sound"" feature, either. But I didn't particularly care about these features anyway; all I really cared about was superior sound quality, and these definitely deliver in that aspect.  My music sounds better with the headphones on than it does playing through my computer speakers, car speakers, or iPod earbuds by far.  I do have home speakers for my iPod that deliver good sound as well, but the headphones are still a better option than those because I don't bother anyone else and I can use them with more than just my iPod.My only real issue with these is that when I use them with my computer, every time I turn them on I get kicked off the wireless internet.  This is a fairly irritating inconvenience...but not a big enough inconvenience to make me stop using them or even consider getting other headphones.  The wireless feature of the headphones itself is very convenient; I love being able to get up and get something to drink without having to pause what I'm listening to.  I find the range to be very satisfactory; I only run into issues when I'm very close to appliances or in the basement.  As we are currently living in an apartment, I have no issues at all--even in the kitchen or out on the deck.One big piece of advice, though: don't pay full price for them.  I waited until they went on sale and bought them for $180; I don't think I'd pay full price for them.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Superior Sound Quality

    ","Pros:- Good sound, static free, and reasonably light headset.- Uses standard AAA rechargeable batteries (Sanyo eneloop included)Cons:- Plasticy earmuffs become very uncomfortable (hot and sticky) - ordered RS-180 replacements from Sennheiser directly: 2 pair plus shipping and VAT was $37.80.  Much better!  However, at this price point, they should have been standard.- No convenient means of charging multiple headsets.  I do have an external AAA charger, but it is a little cumbersome to have to R&R batteries every time to charge the additional headset.  Currently my solution is to remember to rotate headsets on the base.  Given that I only have two headsets, it isn't terrible; but it would be a real pain if I had three or four.Minor Cons:- Power on has to be pressed on the base and each headset.  I understand the reasoning that it gives you the choice of which of multiple headsets that you want to use; but it still would be nice if there was a 'master' headset that either turned on or was turned on by the base unit; especially for people that only want one headset.- Surround seems to be more of a reverb function than an actual surround (makes sense given the analogue input).- I also would have liked the choice of an optical input instead of just analogue.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product.

    ","I got this headphones to listen to TV in a bedroom while not disturbing my wife (we have different tastes :)). My TV is 2014 model Samsung. Current Samsung TVs do not have headphone output but do have audio analog output. What that means is that TV volume control does not control this output. These TVs also do not have Bluetooth transmitter.Before getting RS-170 I tried 2 other approaches. The first was to connect external Bluetooth transmitter to audio out and to use Bluetooth headphones. This had 2 problems. I tried several transmitters as well as several headphones and the only one that would not drop connection were Beats Studio Wireless. But what really kills this solution is that external transmitter distorts high volume sounds, and it's pretty bad. I could not find transmitter that was ok in this regard.Second solution was to get in-line volume control and connect my Beats Studios to audio out through that volume control (no wireless). It works reasonably well, but there are two problems. In-line volume control again distorts audio, albeit much less than Bluetooth. And second is that I needed 50 feet audio cable to get around the room, plus in-line control. This creates quite a contraption to deal with and obviously you can't walk around.And now I tried RS 170. Overall this is the best solution that I found, better then the other two. However I have the following comments:  -- Headphones feels cheaply made, not sure how long they will last. Build quality is significantly inferior than Beats Studio.  -- The ergonomics of volume controls is ridiculous, buttons are flush with the ear pads enclosure and it's very difficult to feel them without taking headphones off. Movies and TV shows that I watch often have high dynamic range and I want to adjust volume. I'm learning how to do it by touch and will get it eventually but this should have been designed differently.  -- In my opinion simulated surround makes sound worse, not better.  -- There is very little insulation from outside noise, much worse than Beats Studio  -- To my ears Beats Studio sounds better. This may not be fare comparison because of the price difference but it's still relevant.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but needs few improvements

    ","These headphones have great sound but lousy range. Maybe one room away they cut out. Also, you have to turn on the base unit, and turn on the headphones to use them. The buttons on the headset are real close together and it takes a deft hand to correctly press the button you want while wearing these. The Volume Up button and Volume Down button are separated by the OFF button. (Yep! Happens all the time!) My ears barely fit in the ear piece and I feel the pressure of the foam on the back of my ears when wearing. Whoever designs these obviously have an unusually shaped head because these are hard to get turned to lay flat on each side. (Side note: I previously owned the almost bottom of the line Sennheiser wireless headphones and they had great sound and range. Plus, you only had to turn on the headset to get going. Volume control was much easier. Lightening struck nearby and the headset quit working. That's the only reason I got these... thought I was stepping up significantly - but NOT!)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money. Many design flaws and poor range.

You can mute the tv so that the other person in the room is not bothered by the noise. However, the sound experience you get when you put these on is top notch. We use them for hooking up to our music while doing chores, love using them with our video games and the come in handy for letting the grandkids watch cartoons that we don't necessarily want to hear. Also, my mom is losing her hearing, so I cannot tell you how wonderful these are for her. We can set the volume on the tv at a normal volume for the rest of us, yet turn the headphones up for her so that she doesn't miss a thing. They are super comfortable too. I have been known to sit for hours playing video games and they never bother me a bit. When you put these headphones on you will be in your own little world. Don't buy anything else!

    ","Those of you who have read my reviews will note that I am really interested in high end headphones.  These were rated as extremely good, for the money, in general, great bass, and most importantly, to me, surround sound.Imagine my surprise when I noticed that the unit connects to whatever using a stereo plug!  My Turtle Beach surround sound headphones used an optical input, and even if they are fake surround sound, at least they have the possibility of having legitimate 7.1 given the optical input.  (they did sound great, BTW)  I have tried the Bose AE2W bluetooth headphones, I have tried audio technica, as well as other wired headphones and have had mixed results.so here is the long and short.Positives:  Outstanding quality headphones for listening to music.  the Bass sits in where it is not too over bearing, and yet, there is no question that it is there and thumping.  Sound does not leak as much as others, so in that regard, they are perfect for listening to music when people are asleep in the house.Negatives:  I do not believe the statement when Sennheiser says that these have Surround Sound.  I know what surround sound is, I know what 7.1  is supposed to be like.  These do not do what they say they do.  Enough said about that.My personal rating of 3 sets of wireless headphones.Comfort out of the box:Bose AE2W wins this hands down followed by the Sennheiser RS170 and third is the Turtle Beach XP510Sound  It is extremely difficult to say which sounds better over all, but if I had to do a top down judgement, it would go RS170 first, AE2W second, and XP510 third...  but again, this is a very close contest.Surround  Hands Down, XP510.  The most realistic surround sound in a set of headphones I have heard so far in my quest for the perfect head phones..  RS170 does actually immerse one in sound, so in that regard, it does simulate surround sound.  Bose has excellent sound, and is very comfortable to wear, but does not do surround at all, not even a little bit...  LOLSummary:For the money, you could do worse, but for me, I am still looking for that perfect set of headphones that make me happy about spending more than $200.00.  All headphones that I have talked about here are sitting in my living room right now, so if anyone is wondering, I have experienced all 3 of these, and many more.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These Sound excellent, but they are NOT true surround sound."

    ","I've used a lot of headphones in my lifetime.  I'm not really picky about type (in-ear, over-ear, etc) so they have varied.  For this review I'll be mostly comparing these to the Sennheiser RS 120 as that's what they replaced.  I had the RS 120 for a long time (5-7 years?) and they were used heavily.  I had a couple issues with the RS 120s:-Static interference from the analog signal-Auto volume controlBeing digital the RS-170's fixed problem one.  I haven't heard any interference or being digital, dropped audio.  However I also don't travel far from the base unit.  The second issues is resolved as well.  The RS 120 would take the incoming audio signal and adjust the volume based off of it.  You were suppose to crank up the volume on the audio source.  The problem was if you had something really loud happen on the audio source then something really low...you barely heard it.  I also noticed it would make the static louder as time went on listening to the same thing.  That being said I still liked the RS 120 and considered getting another pair.The RS 170s audio is vastly better then the 120's.  I'm not an audiophile, in fact I'm pretty bad at picking up all that ""lows, highs"" stuff but these just sound so much clearer and I don't have to crank the volume at all.Now on to the cons.  They are minor but as others have mentioned the buttons on the headphones don't ""stand out"".  You need to take the headphones off to make adjustments since you can't easily feel what button your finger is on.  This can be fixed by sticking something on the individual buttons to make them stand out to your finger tips so it's not a huge issue.  I also miss the volume dial from the RS120 but I can understand the change to volume buttons on a digital headset.Secondly you have to hit the power button on the base and the power button on the headphones when you pick them up to use them (as they are in standby mode).  On the RS120s I would just pick them up and they would work.  I wouldn't have to hit the power switch (unless I turned it off previously).  It's kind of annoying.  The base will go into standby after 5 minutes of no audio so if you are away from it and 5 minutes have passed with no sound then you going to have to go back to it to turn it on.  I don't get why they couldn't have had the headset and base come on automatically when you pick the headphones up off the base....Both can detect when a charge is no longer present so just use that as the trigger.Some reviews have mentioned a ""lag"" between what the headphones play and what the main audio source plays.  For instance if you have them plugged into a TV and you can hear the headphones and the TV speakers they are ""out of sync"".  I noticed this with the RS-120 but it was a pretty minor lag (half a second?).  Using the exact same setup except for the headphones being changed to the RS-170s....I don't hear any lag.  The lag is really hardware dependent.  It can be caused by the audio source as well, so I think it would be depend on each users setup.Both the rs-120 and rs-170 were ""closed"" headphones so they don't let in outside noise but the RS-170s seem to be a much better job at it.  They aren't classified as noise cancelling but they do keep out significantly more noise then the RS-120s.So to wrap it up I'd definitely recommend these to others if they wanted a pair of wireless digital headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good headphones, minor complaints"

    ","I could not be happier with these wireless phones.Coming from the highly rated wired Grado, that is my point of reference.Set up:  Simple for anyone with a minimal or moderate level of component stereo setup experience.  I didn't use the instructions.Digital performance:  Perfect.  My initial location was 1 foot from a Logitech Squeezebox internet radio which transmits 2-way wi-fi.  Instant connection.  No interference.  My second location (and the one I will keep, for now) is rougly 3 feet from my Prizm router.  The connection took about 20 seconds while the unit seached for an available channel.  This was evident while music was playing on the phones.  There were several 1 or 2 second ""breaks in the action"" while new digital frequencies were being checked out, all automatically.Audio quality:  Superior to my Grado.  Highs are nicer.  Bass:  I occasionally toggle between bass boost on and off, depending on the source material.  Both settings are very acceptable and well balanced, only depending on taste for bass.Comfort:  Very light.  More comfortable than the Grado.Access to controls:  Those who complained about the controls on the headphone just need to get over it.  If they were knobs, that would add to the weight, possible eventual noise, and loss of form factor.  I find the buttons for changing volume, surround and bass boost convenient.  A few days of wearing these phones, and a few times accessing the control will result in second nature operation.  The is a low level beep whenever the surround and bass settings are changed and when the volume reaches its maximum or minimum range.  Plus, if you are within line of sight of the charging unit, you will see an led indicator when the surround or bass boost are selected.This was definitely a great purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound; easy setup; no noise

    ","I was so disappointed with the RS420 that I left it on a cafeteria table with a ""free - works, but crap"" sign to give it away.I bought this with higher hopes.  The sound is excellent!  The fit is comfortable, and adjustable for my rather large head (7-3/8 hat size is hard to find in many places).Unfortunately, the idiots who designed this apparently never used it themselves.  There are buttons for volume-down, on/off, volume-up, bass-enhance, and surround on the right earpiece in the rear --- and they all feel exactly the same, and are flush to the headset so there is not even any raised edge to feel to tell where one button ends and the next starts.It is essentially impossible to use the buttons when wearing the headset.  I have to set up everything before I put on the headset, and then change the volume at the source rather than the head-mounted controls. :(I am also not very keen on having to manually power up both the base station and headset every morning when I get to work.  Why can't it sense the headset leaving, and power itself up?The sound is good enough that I am keeping it, but the ergonomics prevent me from recommending it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound but Terrible Controls

    ","There are good and bad, but mostly good.First, the good.1) The main reason you buy headphones is sound.  This pair sounds great.  Can't tell it is wireless as it sounds as good as my Bose wired phones.  Love not having a wire.2) The recharging stand is very convenient and the batteries last a good while before needing to charge.  You can also use AAA batteries, but why?3) Once you learn how to use it,  it is fairly easy to use.  But you do have to turn it on and off every time.4) I only stay in the same room, so I can't attest to the distance it will work, but in the room sound is perfect with no hiss or static.5) They include a bunch of different electrical plug adapters to use in different countries, although that is of no use to me.6) They include adapters for the audio cable that you would probably have to buy, although they would be cheap at Radio Shack.Now, the bad1) The paper ""instructions"" are abysmal.  The instructions on the CD are much better but who wants to go put that in the computer?  They need a real paper manual with real instructions written in real English.  But everyone seems to be doing that now.2) The complaints about the button placement are justified.  They are very small, hard to feel and adjust without pulling the phones off.  There were some suggestions online I may try.3) To me, the bass boost and ""surround sound"" are marginal at best.  Plus, once again the buttons are hard to find.4) Like all phones, they can get a bit warm and can give you a headache over time, but that may just be me.5) The echo effect is real, but to be expected.  If this is a bother, and you want to listen to the phones while the main speakers are loud, you can either turn off the wireless phones and listen to the speakers, buy another pair or two for the other person(s) to use or use wired phones.6) These things are REALLY  expensive, especially the retail price at over $270.  I paid $179.95, but I used Amazon points so they were free, sort of.  But you know the price when you buy them so one can't really complain about it much.All in all, they sound really good, especially for being wireless.  They mainly just need to do something about those tiny volume buttons.  But I would buy them again.

    ","They are comfortable. I like the feel a lot. These headphones sound fantastic for TV and pretty good for music. Set up was reasonably intuitive if you have had wireless phones before, if not, they package comes with a disk you can run on  your computer that is explanatory. I was looking for some failure in both set up and using them but found none. They came well packaged, and on time. They transit anywhere behind closed doors in my large apartment. Only complaint I have, is I was not billed upon ordering them and continued to use my card thus risking low funds to cover the purchase as I do not keep track except once a month on my billing statement. You are not billed until they are shipped. I wish Amazon would give us a choice to be billed right away or delay until shipped. Other than that, very happy with my purchase. They are well made. Some complain about the hard to find controls on the phone. No issue if you stick a drop of super glue on the volume or piece of tape to have a feel for the control. These phones sound more full and expansive than the old RS 120 I had. More comfortable as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Old Clown Lips says....

    ","I previously purchased the RS 140 Model about 5 years ago for my father who has difficulty hearing and was turning up the tv too loud.  He loved the product and wore them all the time.  Lately, we were noticing that he was turning up the volume on the headphones loud again and my mother started complaining that she was able to hear them at night.  I decided it was time for a new one.  I found the RS 170 on amazon and decided to let my dad try it out.  And it worked great!  He was able to hear the TV again at a lower volume and even seemed to work ok with his hearing aids.  The device also has a power off at the base which the other one did not.

From what I've read, this is an attempt at power savings, but if you listen to music or dialog that dips to a quiet point, prepare to be distracted and annoyed as the audio cuts in and out.As others have said, the buttons on the headphones themselves are unfortunate. Manageable, but unfortunate.

I connected mine to the headphone jack, so that I could use the volume control on the remote that goes with my receiver.

    ","For a longtime fan and user of Sennheiser products, these are very disappointing. I hung on to these for two days and then returned them.  There are lots of little things that bugged me about these. Opening the box to look at these for the first time, they exuded plastic. Everything looked cheap, as though all of the components were selected based on cost. The only way the phones would attach to my amplifier was via the headphone connection on the front panel, using a wire that was lighter than anything I would ever want to see in my system. The sound was thin and required the bass boost be on at all times. The controls on the headset are flimsy and not usable. If I used those controls I could make them work, but only with great care; otherwise, making adjustments would push the headphones off of my head.

    ","After one day of use, here's my first impressions of the RS170.  I would have waited to publish a review but I have a fix for the volume controls that I wanted to publish asap for the folks who are having trouble operating them.PROS:1. There is no perceptible hiss.2. The sound quality is good but a little different from the sound from my wired Sony MDR-7506 headphones that I was using.  I like the 7506 sound better but the difference is negligible so far.  I'm fairly sure I'll get used to the difference in a few days.3. I can go anywhere in our 3 bedroom home and there is no dropout.  But I'm only concerned about dropouts when I'm watching TV, not when I'm walking around elsewhere.  With respect to dropouts while watching TV, I don't think anyone should worry about it.4. Our Samsung HDTV set has an analog audio out with a fixed volume level, so having volume controls on this headphone is perfect.  No need to buy a device with remote controlled volume as I was thinking of doing.  Plus this set is wireless so it solved 2 problems at once.5. The headphones I received came with 2 Eneloop rechargeable AAA batteries, one for each head piece. Eneloop rechargeables are the best rechargeable batteries that I've found to date and I already have a bunch of AA and AAA Eneloop batteries to use in all of our equipment.  Sennheiser including Eneloop batteries shows their desire for quality.CONS:1. The headphones I received are tight!  I will be contacting Sennheiser to see if there's a way to flatten the headband so there's not as much pressure against the sides of my head.  Aside from the tightness, the headphones are comfortable.2. There was a detectible anomaly in the right headphone during a talking head conversation on a news channel.  This only happened during the one conversation and sounds fine on all other conversations.  But this does show that the headphones aren't perfect.3. The volume up/down buttons are quite difficult to use as many others have mentioned.  But I came up with a fix.VOLUME CONTROL BUTTONS PROBLEM:The problem is that all of the control buttons on the headphone are almost flush with the headphone case.  There is a barely perceptible raised icon on the power button that's between the up and down volume buttons but it is BARELY PERCEPTIBLE.  As others have mentioned, it usually took me about 5 seconds to feel the buttons and then use the volume buttons.  Too time consuming for my taste.VOLUME CONTROL BUTTONS FIX:The fix I came up with is:... a. Get double sided mounting tape that's about 1/16"" thick.... b. Stick paper, plastic tape or black electrical tape on one side of the double sided mounting tape.... c. Cut pieces of the tape to the same shape of the volume up button (triangular) and the volume down button (parallelogram).... d. Stick the cut pieces on tape on the volume up and down buttons.... e. Now it's very quick and easy to feel the volume buttons.SUGGESTION TO SENNHEISER:My suggestion is to include black, precut pieces of 1/16"" thick tape with every headphone set.  In fact, include about 3 sets of the precut pieces since they could wear out or fall off eventually and would be so cheap anyway.  Then the user has the option of sticking the pieces of tape on their volume buttons or not.  It would not take any retooling to modify the headphones so would be very inexpensive to implement. It would stop (or greatly reduce) the complaints about the volume buttons. --- Or, better yet, replace the volume up and down buttons with ones 1/16"" higher. --- BTW, Sennheiser, if you use my suggestion, could you please send me a second set of RS170 for our bedroom?  I'll give my phone number to your tech support when I call regarding the tightness of the headphones. (wink)So far, I like the RS170 headphones.  I'm using it on our kitchen TV set and no more dragging the headphone cable when I need to get something to eat or drink.

    ","I bought the RS 170 system with an extra headset in August 2011. My wife and I have used these to watch TV almost every day since, with excellent results. We live in NY and the range is good for our space, the only thing to note is that when there are more than 2 walls between you and the RS 170 tower, the sound starts to break intermittently.Unfortunately, the system stopped working on mid Jan 2013. I called Sennheiser support and we did some troubleshooting over the phone and it seems that the tower transmitter has stopped working, therefore I sent it in for repair. Is valid to note that Sennheiser provided UPS shipping label, I just had to package it and use the label at no cost.PROS:1- Wireless headsets.2- Digital radio headphones with Kleer technology that are free from hiss and noise.3- Sound quality is good, although a little more bass wouldn't hurt.4- Pairing the headsets with the tower is very easy.5- The charging of the batteries on the headsets is easy to accomplish.6- Two-year warranty for the US.7- Responsive Sennheiser support, they provide shipping both ways if you need to send item within warranty for repair.CONS:1- The sound comes through the TV speakers on certain TVs, and there is a lag of around 1 sec-delay between the headsets and the speaker. I have 2 TVs (living-room and bedroom), with the Sony TV, the sound only comes out through the headsets when the audio-jack is plugged in, whereas with the Samsung, the sound comes out from both thus, I must turn the TV volume all the way down to avoid listening to the eco.2- After 45 to 60 mins of use, the ears start to become increasingly warm to a point that becomes uncomfortable, but we got used to it rather quick and we just move the headset ear-cups to include only half-ear at a time, just to give my ears a break from the heat. This action is not bothersome at all and it comes naturally at this point, but hey, other people might find this rather annoying.3- We must either turn off both headsets or the tower, otherwise they will stay on the entire night. Sennheiser could have included a feature on the tower to turn itself off when no sound is received after 5 or 10 mins.4- Sennheiser claims the system has 260 feet range, but unless you are in an open field with no walls or other obtrusion between the tower and the headsets, this claim is rather inaccurate.5- The system stopped working after 18 months of light use.I will update this review once I hear back from Sennheiser.UPDATE:I decided to bump it up to 4 stars due to the excellent customer service I received from Sennheiser. I got a brand new RS170 replacement on the mail around 8 days after I sent my broken one and they also repaired an extra headset.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for city dwellers
86,"on May 22, 2013",,"I read some reviews about how those headset they have a delay in the sound if you have the tv sound on while listening through the headset and I gotta say I have no idea what people are talking about!!!!, they work just fine and there is no delay in the sound between them and the tv speakers and the sound is damn clear and beautiful and it is worth the money, as I work mostly at night, by the time I am home my partner is already asleep and I never could turn the tv sound up in the living room so I won't wake him up and had to have the closed captioning on which it was not ideal if you are not looking at the tv, so those headset came in handy and I am glad I bought them, I move around the house and they won't cut off and te sound won't fade, now I don't have a big house but it is just good for me when I go to the kitchen or the bathroom and still be able to listen to my tv, the bass is just great, the surround sound is ok, I didn't notice much difference when I had it on and off but that is not a deal breaker for me, and those who said that it would make you hot and warm, I have not experienced that at all, all I gotta say if you are looking for a wireless headset for late night movies and stuff while your family or your other half is asleep then those are the ones to buy, they are a little pricey but worth every penny.",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE THEM

This might be a problem about the wireless connection I guess. I would say this wireless headphone gives me great convenience to let me walk around without taking off the headphone and a nice sound quality for purpose of chatting with your friends or listening to music that always have strong sound. However, if you tend to watch movies or playing games, which may have some period with weak sound, you may find your headphone just lose connection temporally and can't hear anything at that moment (it's really a terrible feeling). In contrast, you can hear everything while wearing wire headphones no matter how low the volume is. In conclusion, it depends on your own situation whether to buy this or not. In my perspective, it's an excellent headphone.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Really an amazing wireless earphone

    ","Bought these to use at the Office when the ambient noise got too high. They sounded amazing and the closed back help filter some of the background sound. However after having owned this set for about 6 months the headset stopped connecting to the base unit. It seems there is some sort of internal short, which appears to constantly drain the batteries. I've tried brand new ene-loops, as well as non-rechargeable to test reconnecting but nothing seems to get it to work. Guess this was the chance I took purchasing it as a damaged box from Amazon Warehouse deals.While the unit itself was very nice, sound and range were excellent, overall the headset is fairly flimsy and doesn't appear that quality control was very high here. Perhaps it was just the set that I purchased and just had back luck. Disappointing coming from Sennheiser though.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent while it worked...
89,"on November 19, 2016",,"I love these, Yes they are a bit pricey but you truthfully get what you pay for when you buy sennheiser, i've owned these for about a year and a half and quality is still top notch, the only thing i've had to do is buy replacement earpads, but that is the great thing about sennheiser, every part on this thing is replaceable. The wireless functionality of this is just poetry in motion, i can walk across my house while still listening to whatever i am watching and there is not drop in quality, volume or otherwise. The only con i have about these is that the bass isnt as juicy as i would like it to be but without an amplifier that's a bit understandable. I have fallen asleep multiple times with these on and the way that they are designed when they bend the plastic parts will just pop out before anything breaks and it is as simple as pushing down on them to pop them back in place.

90,"on February 10, 2012",,"I bought this in hopes that it would help my hear TV.  My hearing aids don't help that much---especially if there is other sound sources in competition---like someone talking  or the dishwasher running---almost any sound from another source will destroy the TV sound for me.  Over time I have almost stopped watching TV all together because I miss so much of what is being said that I can't follow a program.  That's all changed now.  I've used these for just over a month now and hear everything crystal clear.  The earphones are terrific---crystal clear ----no distortion---no interference---no problem of any kind.  I don't wear them with hearing aids---no need for the hearing aids now.  Volume is adjustable on the phones without affecting the TV volume so my wife can listen to the sound from the TV at her desired volume and I set my earphones for the volume I like.  I hear everything---sounds I've never been able to hear before---and in full stereo ----much more distinct than ever before.  Good as the earphones are they don't totally block extraneous sound---so I can tell when someone else in the room is speaking to me.  I am totally pleased with this system.  When I first received them I plugged the tower in to the audio out jacks on my TV----I was satisfied with that though I noted a very low electronic sound occasionally when there was no sound coming from the TV.  That was irritating but whenever the TV sound resumed everything was OK again.  Then later, I plugged them directly into the Dish Network Satallite receiver and found the sound from that source was much cleaner--crystal clear ---no more problem with the occasional 'buzz'.  I usually don't turn on the Bass---or the surround features which I think would be really neat for listening to music-but so far I haven't used them much for listening to music because  I don't have a central receiver where I could select from a variety of sound sources-----I  expect this system would be fantastic for those that have such systems.

    ","If you've done a minimal amount of homework on these then you know there are two issues / flaws1. If used in conjuction with the TV speakers there is an echo effect.  This was a non issue for me as I bought them specifically so that I could watch TV late at night after my wife has gone to sleep.  If the sound on the TV is off there is no issue at all.  However if you were to buy these to up the volume for someone that is hard of hearing, they may not fit the bill.2. the control buttons (volume, power, etc) on the headphones were put in stupid places.  I agree that they should have put more thought in where these buttons are but after a week of using them you begin to memorize the placements so for me this issue is tolerable.The sound quality on the headphone is fantastic.  My tv is connected to a simple sound bar and sub, which is better than the TV's speakers but definitely not suround sound quality.  if my wife would let me get away with it, i'd order another set and we'd both use them instead of listening through the sound bar",5.0 out of 5 stars,great product

    ","I upgraded to these headphone from the HDR 120 mostly because I wanted to add additional head sets and I do not like how the HDR 120 have some sound quality issues based on RF technology.The sound quality of these headphones is really great. Everything is very clear no matter the position of your head. These headphones are also very comfortable, much more so than the HDR 120. They stay in place even when moving around. The range is also good. I can walk around my apt without a performance loss.Consider this, however, as others have stated there is an ""echo"" between the TV and the headphones. which is annoying for watching things with other people not using the headphones. This issues does not exist with the HDR 120s. The fake leather ear cups get warm after wearing them for a bit of time. I also really hate how the base station does not come on automatically when a headset is turned on.The biggest complaint is that the buttons on the headphones are nearly impossible to use without looking at them. This means it's really difficult to adjust the volume without taking them off first.

    ","I have two RS140 wireless systems that have been in use for 5 plus years. I recently replaced a bad 140 with the RS 170. RS 170 provides wonderful sound quality improvement and marginal broadcast range decrease. I was expecting headset improvements beyond RS 140 sound management and ergonomic features. I think minimalist is the best way to describe the RS 170 downsized over the ear features; boarders on uncomfortable. One must remove the headset to make adjustments to volume, on-off switch, bass and surround sound control interface. Small finger tips are a plus to make the button interface. Earpiece pads although soft are on the small side and put pressure on ear surfaces never touched by the RS 140 earpiece. Headband adjusted to full extension just barely allows the ear cushions to extend over the ears. I was used to wearing a hat in my shop with the RS 140 headset to listen to music and audio books; can't do that with the RS 170. The headset band has fewer and smaller cushions which touch the top of the head in very small locations thus no support over the full pad surface. The head band also incorporates a 3 pin electrical connector which provides electrical hookup when headset is placed in the storage cradle. Unfortunately the connector is placed right in the middle of the head band and sits very close to the skin of ones head. I sweat when I work. I sweat when in hot weather. I wear ball caps with the usual button on top. I trust that the corrosion resistance of the metal conductors is adequate to resist skin salt, moisture, and oils. I trust that connector pins are strong enough to resit force of hair, skin, and hat material interface and in addition the tight fitting connector cradle interface. As for the price of this system I would say that this system was never designed for the comfort and functionality that as an adult and long time user of Sennheiser products has appreciated over the years and would expect to be incorporated in a new design. Great listening but marginal adult fit and function.",4.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT SOUND MARGINAL FIT AND FUNCTION

    ","I bought this to replace an older Sennheiser wireless headphone unit that I've owned for many years.  I had high hopes because this new model uses digital technology that promises better sound quality and hopefully longer range.  I was disappointed.  Here's why:1.  Annoying hiss in the background.  At low volumes, there's an annoying hiss that always present on the headphones, even when the transmitter is off.2.  Annoying LEDs.  This unit and the base has a number of very bright and annoying LEDs.  Even worse, they often flash, rather than remaining solid.  Since I use these at night to watch TV while my wife sleeps, the flashing lights from the headphones and the base unit are incredibly annoying.  I was able to mostly solve this problem by the use of LED DIM stickers, but it's just annoying.  If you don't plan to use these in the dark, this may not bother you.3.  Too small:  The earcups on these headphones are much smaller than on the older model, which makes them unconfortable to wear for any substantial period of time.  I'm a relatively tall man, and so if you've got a smaller head, this won't bother you.4.  Annoying controls:The older model didn't require you to push a button on the base unit to listen.  You just had to turn on the headphone and start listening.  This new model requires you to hit a power button both on the base unit and the headphones to get started.The actual control buttons on the headphones are very difficult to identify and push while wearing the headphones.  The older model had a rotary dial for volume and a movable switch for power, which made it very easy to operate by feel alone.  These new ones have five buttons (power, volume up, volume down, and two sounds related buttons) which are all in the same general area and which all feel relatively similar.On the plus side, the sound quality is very good when the volume is up loud enough to cover the hiss, and the range appears to be as good as the old model with no static at the fringes.Overall, I don't like these new ones at all, and will probably return them before the return window closes.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too many negatives; the older model was better

    ","These headphones were part of a mission to be able to watch TV and play video games while my daughter is in bed without waking her.First off, I live in an apartment which means I don't have a huge home theater setup. I only have the audio from the TV which, as most people know, needs to be turned up louder if you want to really hear dialogue clearly on some models. I also play the drums in a band and have been playing for over 17 years.I read reviews on all the other models Sennheiser had because from everything I've read on other brands, they seemed to be the best at making quality home theater headphones. These stood out because of both the Bass Boost and the Surround Sound feature. I considered the RS 180s, but I wasn't going to use them for music and I'm not an audiophile although I admire every aspect that goes into being one.These are simple to hook up and easy to use. If you have a family member that is like my wife with super sonic hearing and like the television at low volumes (about 22 on a scale of 100), then these come in handy for when you actually want to hear the television instead of using it as background noise.These headphones far surpass the quality of sound that comes from my television. The sound is very clear, dialogue easy to understand, and the bass boost isn't so overpowering to drown out the other frequencies but powerful enough to boost put more oomf in action sequences and sound effects.After 5 months of use, the battery life is still perfect on these, I don't have any issues with the headphones cutting out randomly, and once my 18 month old is down for the night, I can turn the volume on the tv all the way down, stay up, and watch what I want knowing it won't disturb her or my wife.

Only problem is, hubby's chair is more than a foot away from the unit and we all know men can't walk that far, so it doesn't get used as much as it should.  When it is used, he can hear nothing else said or going on around him so if you're looking for that type of device, this will be perfect for you.

    ","I am a big fan of Sennheiser headphones. I've had three pairs over fifteen to twenty years (each pair bought to replace an older, worn out pair). I only use them to watch TV. If you are using headphones to listen to music, this review may not apply to you.I needed to replace my old RS130 (a TR 130 transmitter with HDR 130 headphones). The transmitter died after about 8 years. I decided to upgrade to the RS 170. The sound is great, but not really noticeably better to me than the RS 130.Here's my buying advice for wireless headphones for TV watching. Get a set of headphones that1) take standard batteries (AA, AAA, etc.)2) has a user-replaceable battery3) works even if you are not in “line of sight” of the transmitter4) has a transmitter that is either always on, or can be turned on by turning on the headphones5) is instant-onSenneheiser’s RS 120 (they don’t make the RS 130 anymore) has all of these features, and was $100 rather than the RS 170’s $275. I like the HDR 130 headphones better than the new HDR 120’s. I’m using my old HDR 130’s with the new TR 130 base, and the HDR 120’s sit unused.More advice: buy two sets of rechargeable batteries and a battery charger. I don’t use the charger on the base. When the batteries go dead, put them in the charger and replace with a set of freshly charged batteries. This way, the headphones are always sitting on the table where you watch TV and you can pick them up at any time without having to get up and take them off of the base. The batteries go dead maybe once a month, so it is less hassle them getting up every time you want to use the headphones.The problems with the RS 170’s are1) The base must be turned on separately each time you want to use the headphones2) You have to hold the power button on the base for 3 – 5 seconds to be sure it is actually powered up3) You have to press the power button on the headphones for 1 – 3 seconds to be sure they are powered up4) The buttons on the headphones are hard to manipulate by touch alone5) The connection between the headphones and the base is susceptible to interference (the headphones cut out around my microwave)6) The HDR 170’s power button doubles as a mute button (I don’t know what the practical use of a mute button on a set of headphones is. I just take off, or turn off, the headphones)7) The pairing between headphones and base can take several secondsMost of these problems are about convenience. If something like the RS 120 didn’t exist, the RS 170 might be OK. However, given that the RS 120’s are so convenient (and so much cheaper), it makes the RS 170’s seem like a mistake. After a couple of days of trying to adjust to the RS 170, I ordered the RS 120 and waited to compare the two. This gave me more time to try to adjust myself to the RS 170. When the RS 120 arrived, I hadn’t used the RS 170 in a couple of days because they were so inconvenient. I couldn’t get the RS 170 to work. After several minutes, I figured out that this was because the batteries in the HDR 170 were dead. This took a while to figure out because the lights would come on and I thought that it was a base-to-headphones pairing problem. This sort of confusion does not happen with the RS 120s.Once I got them both working (the RS 120 took no time at all to get working), I compared the sound. The sound was very similar.I returned the RS 170 and am very happy with my TR 120 and old HDR 130.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Right for TV. Get the RS120
107,"on February 22, 2011",,"I am replacing Sony MDR-RF5000 wireless that wore out after many years, so much of my review will be a comparason. Chose the Sennheiser RS 170 based on the reviews.  I find the 170 to be much lighter weight and a far more balanced frequincy response, older headphones tend to be bass heavy.  They are comfortable but the opening surrounding the ear should have been a little larger, however, I will admit that my head and ears are above average size, so for most people the fit should be good.  The ear cups twist off and are made to be easily replaced when they wear out, the part number is supplied in the manual.  This is a big improvement over the Sony.Right out of the box the base and headset are pre-matched so they are plug and play.  You can add up to 4 headsets but each must be paired to the base.  Instructions are clear and easy to follow on how to do that.  Before first using them, you must charge the batteries for 16 hours.  I have run them for 12 continuous hours with no problem, then it usually takes half the run time to recharge, in this case 6 hours.  The Sony ran on two AA and only lasted 8 hours, these run on two AAA and last 24 hours.  Plus they put one battery in each ear cup for balanced comfort, Sony could learn from these guys.Reception is clean with no hiss or distortion and the range is excellent.  I've gone about 150 feet into the back yard with zero loss of signal.The buttons are small but workable while wearing the headset.  They are grouped vol+/power/vol-, then a gap, then bass/surr.  So you can work them by feel.  The power button is multi-function. Press for on or stand-by mode, hold the button for 1 second to actually turn off.  Same with the base unit.Overall I am happy with the 170 set.  I would recommend them and believe they are worth the cost.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall Very Good, ear cup could be larger"

    ","I don't know why there are so many negative reviews about these headphones, but these headphones are great.  They produce deep rich bass and great surround sound.  When not using those added features they still have great sound and great range.  The signals travel through walls and allows me to go throughout the house listening to music.  I listen to various genres of music, including jazz, rap, classical, hip-hop, and new age and they all sound fine with these headphones.  Set-up is very easy and, although these headphones have a flimsy feel, they are durable and lightweight.  The only real con about them is the auto shut off seems to want to shut them off at the slightest dip in sound.  Therefore, if you are listening to something that is low it may appear that they have turned off.  If the next song takes a few moments to start the song volume will appear to gradually increase from an automatically determined low setting in anticipation of needing to shut off.  Other than that, they are great and worth the price paid.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Headphones

    ","I have to say that I ordered these headphones based upon the many good reviews that have already been posted and they have lived up to my expectations. They are lightweight, comfortable, and the sound is fantastic. I played through several songs such as Def Leppards ""Pour some sugar on me"" to the Beatles singing ""Let it Be"". Both were in the FLAC Audio format. There was no background noise even as I wandered through out the house. I had to go outside to go out of range of the base station and when it happens the music simply stops. Take a few steps backwards and the music will continue. The sound during movies was fantastic. For me I purchased these for work since my job demands that I listen to recorded phone calls. Voices sound absolutely fantastic on these headphones and because they are so comfortable I can wear them all day without feeling the pain in my ears that I have become accustom to.

111,"on May 14, 2013",,"I had research several other brand names before settling on the Sennheiser RS 170 Digital Wireless Headset. First thing I realized was how much I had been missing as far as dialog, background sounds and music. Trying to watch television at night had always been a problem. With our schedules being different, I would watch television late at night. The only problem was if the television was to loud it would wake up my wife, if it was to low I could not hear nor could I understand the dialog. So the search was on and after 3 months I decided to try the Sennheiser wireless headsets and from the moment I placed them over my ears I was amazed at the quality and the comfort. Now mind you they weren't a $75.00 dollar set or were they a $500.00 set of headphones, but for the price I got a quality set of headphones that were easy to set up with a full two year warranty. My wife tried them and she was also amazed at how much we were missing, We have a 60 inch Samsung Smart TV with a Several Hundred dollar sound system hooked up to it, we watch movies constantly. And it always seemed that we could never agree on a volume level. Well with the Sennheiser RS 170 headphones you can have a total of four sets of headphones and believe me it is wonderful to be able for everyone to be able to listen at their own desired volume level.

    ","This is our third pair of Sennheiser wireless headphones. The last one, RS 120, served us well for many years, and just recently succumbed to the constant abuse. So I bought RS 170 thinking that I am getting a decent upgrade.As far as the sound quality goes, RS 170 are pretty good - this pair has probably the best sound I've heard from wireless headphones. I won't dwell on the details - other reviewers have covered that. Unfortunately, the rest goes into ""how come they haven't thought about that"" category.Sure, RS 120 is not without problems - for example, in an apartment building you might have a lot of interference, to the point where you might not be able to use it. On the plus side, they are really easy to use - just pick it up from the stand and flip a switch. You can do it with one hand - a big advantage when you have an infant in the other hand.Which brings me to RS 170. It's a bit too tight to put it on your head with one hand. To make it work, you must press a button on the base. Since the base is pretty light, you must hold it with your other hand. Now, you need to press the power button on the headphones. It's nearly impossible to find by touch - the power button and volume control buttons are small and located close together. Sure, if you use it long enough, you can probably master that skill - but really? how come they haven't thought about that?Also, if you happen to sit on a couch with headphones next to you and base off - you must stand up and walk over to turn it on. There is no way to turn it on remotely. Another strike against it.Unfortunately excellent sound quality is getting cancelled by terrible usability. I am sorry to say that this pair definitely doesn't worth the price. After some time I had to return it and get another pair of RS 120 instead.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, bad ergonomics"

    ","I have read the other reviews prior to this purchase and was impressed with the various pros/cons listed.  I had considered this set and the RS 180s after trying out several sets of less expensive models from different brands.  The lower priced sets all had bad reception, hissing noises and other poor sound quality.  These Sennheisers are absolutely top notch.  Crystal clear sound, great range and were very easy to setup.  The dynamic bass and surround sound features are nice and definitely can add to the program you are listening to.  While they do not completely eliminate ambient noise, the do a pretty good job of it even with the volume turned down pretty low on the headphones.  I recently watched about 4hrs of DVR'd programs and the headphones were comfortable for the entire time.  Some of the reviews mention the button size/location as a problem.  Once you learn the locations I don't consider it a con, just something you have to get used to doing.  The buttons are not huge so if you have big fingers you might find it a little hard at first.The best part of these is absolutely the peace and quiet after my family has gone to bed.  I can easily watch any movie, TV show or listen to music without worry now.  My wife, while initially apprehensive about the purchase due to cost says they are worth twice the price.  I have not heard one complaint about being up watching TV or movies since I started using these and that makes them priceless to me :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Domestic bliss for late night TV watchers - Great headphones & worth every penny

    ","UPDATE:Ok, got the replacement headset and after setting it up and charging the batteries, I was disappointed to hear the same low grade constant hum. Just to be sure, I again, moved my Oppo BluRay player and the headphones over to my older Yamaha DSP A-1 and there is no hum. I also plugged a wired pair of headphones (Steel Series Flux) in to my Pioneer Elite SC-57 and didn't hear the hum. So it seems like it is definitely a combination of the wireless tech being used by the RS 170s and the 'noisy' D class amplifiers used by the Pioneer AVR. These headphones are definitely going back. I'll be trying the Sony MDR-DS6500s next to see if its all wireless tech in general or just Kleer's wifi tech. I'd be interested if anyone else out there has tried this pair of headsets with a D class amplifier and noticed the same hum or if the manufacturer has any comment on this (assuming they even bother reading these reviews :)).====================================================================================================================================Recently ordered these headphones to watch movies after the family heads to bed. Read quite a few of the reviews already posted for the RS 170s here on Amazon and the overall score for this model was so high I thought I'd give them a try.The two main criticisms of this set from what I've read in the reviews seems to be audio ghosting due to latency transmitting/receiving/decoding the audio via wifi and the ergonomics of the buttons on the ear cup. I'll address those from my perspective first.With regard to the audio ghosting, I didn't have an issue with this, but my use-case is seemingly different than a lot of others. I'm not using these headphones as a volume enhancement while someone else in the same room listens to the audio over the speakers. I use the headphone jack in the front of my receiver which cuts the audio output to my speakers so I never encountered this issue and I didn't feel the latency caused the audio to desync from the video in a way that was distracting.As far as the ergonomics of the buttons on the ear cup, I can see why people have a problem with this. The  buttons are very similarly shaped and flush with the ear cup molding. The power button positioning in between the volume up/down buttons is a particularly bad decision. Having said that, I didn't find this to be a big issue. The buttons, while similar, are still distinguishable by feel in my opinion. I don't have any real need to switch the bass boost or the surround emulation on and off often during use so I basically just turned the headset on, turned bass boost/surround on or off depending on what I was doing and then never had to mess with them again. Additionally, the volume (at least when plugged in through the headphone jack) was controlled by my receiver, so there wasn't any need to use the headphone buttons anyway.Ok, so the two major issues that people seem to keep bringing up, I don't think are a big issue. So why the 2 star review? Well as the review title states, these headphones produce a low grade whine that can be heard during breaks in dialogue if there's not much other background audio or movie score. During action scenes or even scenes with moderate audio levels, you can't really hear the whine, but there's absolutely no mistaking it when you get to dramatic, dialogue driven scenes. I'm kind of surprised that never came up in any of the 20+ reviews I've read on this unit. That's an absolute deal breaker for a pair of headphones in my opinion...especially at the $200+ price point. What's even worse is that the base apparently stops transmitting if the audio level is sufficiently low. Makes sense. Constantly transmitting/receiving data is a power drain and can kill your batteries more quickly as well as eat up more electricity. The problem is, that makes the whine even more apparent as it cuts out between dialogue or things of that nature. The sum effect (for me at least) was that I initially thought the signal was being dropped. That REALLY got me going as I was standing 10 feet away at first with a clear line of sight to the base. Realizing it was the base cutting the transmission due to low audio levels made me feel better...that is, until I realized it was making the whine that much more noticeable.As I previously mentioned, this issue never came up in any of the reviews I've read to date so I thought I'd do some investigation and make sure it was the headphones. It wasn't the BluRay discs. I played multiple movies all of which were high bit-rate transfers of movies that I'm very familiar with and have never noticed any whines or other ambient noises that weren't obviously and purposely engineered in to the audio. My BluRay player is the well regarded Oppo BDP-83 and I use HDMI out for audio. One of the possible culprits was my receiver. The headphone jack is a seldom used and different audio output and I have a Pioneer Elite SC-57, which uses a D-Class amplifier. One of the more notable downsides to D-Class amps is that they're a relatively 'noisy' technology. So I took the same movies and the Oppo player and hooked them up to my old Yamaha DSP-A1 receiver which uses Class A-B amplifiers using the coaxial digital audio output from the Oppo. Guess what? Still hear the low grade whine. Admittedly, it seemed a touch better, but still no denying it was there.I'm hoping that I just got (un)lucky and got a defective unit since no one else has mentioned this whining and I can't imagine anyone thinking that would be acceptable under any circumstances, much less a $240 pair of cans, so I'm going to get an exchange on these and will update this review with my results.Some other notes (many of which are why these headphones got an extra star despite failing to do what they're primarily supposed to - deliver a quality audio experience):* Build quality is very good. The headphones seem very sturdy and the ear cups and padded headband are very comfortable.* The headphones and base look good. The black and grey finish and clean lines looked right at home on my Salamander AV rack with all my other components* Setup was straight forward and easy* Range was very good, allowing me to wander around my house, but as with all wifi tech, your mileage may vary.* Good directionality when using the surround mode. Bass was a bit clipped, but very respectable for a pair of headphones and good enough for me to enjoy the cannon broadside in Master & Commander and the explosions and plasma blasts in Transformers* Not having the headphones turn on automatically when lifted from the base is a little annoying, but not the end of the world (imo).* only having RCA or headphone jack input is a little annoying. RCA is junk and the headphone jack requires that I have a wire and plug sticking out of the front panel of my receiver. I have in-wall wiring and gone through some effort to neatly tie off and run my wiring so having that eye sore of wire hanging down the front of my receiver was a bummer.Again, I'm hoping I just got a bunk pair and will be doing an exchange, but I'm not counting on that fixing this issue. I'll be updating this review with my results.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Incessant whine is a dealbreaker

The transmitter is just a bit forward of centerpoint of the house front to back, and when I am at the very back of the house, no signal.

119,"on January 20, 2011",,"Although made in China (rather than Germany), the RS170 system seems to be a very well-made product that stands up to the traditional Sennheiser brand quality standards and reputation I've become accustomed to over many years of using their professional and consumer products.  The RS170 was well-packed, received in excellent condition, and proved to be relatively easy to set up and operate, although it is very sensitive to the level of the incoming signal.  Even with a switchable signal level matching ""pad"" and a good internal limiting/AGC circuit, it can still be easily over-driven by feeds from many devices, resulting in the possibility of some audible clipping, compression, and signal distortion.  Input level properly adjusted, the sensitivity and selectivity were great.  The overall signal response was very good, with or without the bass boost on, and I noted no audible signal dropouts or phase distortion as I moved about the room I was using it in.  The only real complaint I have is that even though the headset is lightweight and very well-made, it can still be cumbersome and difficult to wear for any length of time without eventually becoming downright uncomfortable, at least to my ears.

    ","I am not much of an audio-buff, so I don't have anything enlightening to say about all the technical nuances of this product. But here's what I will say.I often use these headphones some 12 hours a day. I would say that I have been averaging about 6 hours a day of using these things. Sometimes they are on my head almost all day. Being able to walk away from my computer monitor (a movie or a skype conversation with a friend or whatsohaveyou) is incredibly convenient. I haven't even had to change the batteries yet, and there has been no drop in performance.I have heard a couple people call these things flimsy. They are not. They are intentionally made to be lightweight so that they do not fall as hard, or take up as much weight on your head. They are fine. They fit the ear well.One tip I do have is this. There will be a mild static-y sound if you have to turn the volume on the headphones up a lot. What you should do is turn up the volume all the way on the media device you are using, and have the headphones on low. Then the static is imperceptible. It could be annoying if you are listening to something that is still king of low when your media player is on maximum, or you are unable to do this altogether- so keep this in mind before buying the product.The only flaw in design is the minor inconvenience of not being able to remotely turn on the charging tower remotely from the headphones. It isn't too big of a deal usually, since when you go to pick up your headphones, the tower is right there to activate. Another thing i have heard is irritating to some is the volume controls on the side of the headphones, how one must take them off to change them. Well, I use them so much I can do it without looking, and it will just require you to fiddle with them for a bit to get coordinated.I don't usually go much more than 30 feet from the computer that these are connected to... but don't have any unrealistic expectations about being able to do yardwork and listening to your music without it cutting out all the time (or stopping altogether). If you really have to go that far away from the station, then maybe there is something more high-powered that you need. I don't live in a two-story house, so I am unable to say how well it would work for a larger house.I haven't ever used any other wireless headphones, but these have served very well for me, and when I am alone, my ears feel naked without them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,8 months of use and no problems yet

131,"on October 13, 2015",,"I have been using wired headphones with my AV setup for a while now, but decided I wanted the freedom of wireless.  I bought these headphones because of the high Amazon review scores and other top reviews online.  Others have clearly had better luck than I do, but I have significant noise problems with these headphones.  For my setup, there is a constant buzz whenever any level of sound/music plays which stops about a second after the source is muted.  With relatively quiet music, the buzz is noticeably constant.  I can only imagine this is due to some type of wireless interference.  I disconnected my wifi thinking it might be interference, but same problem.  I tried plugging into different sources, but same problem.  Different locations in the house, same problem.Addendum:Given all the glowing reviews, I decided to return the first pair and ordered a second pair that seemed much quieter at first, but ultimately exhibited the same problem.  In short, I can't turn the headphones up to anywhere past half-volume or there will be a buzz during quiet music.  At half-volume, they sound great and I've decided to keep them.  I turn up the volume at the source instead.  Given my setup, this is fine, but it may not work for everybody.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Others have clearly had better luck than I do

If you need to lower sound use the headphone buttons, not the source. If you lower the sound levels too far the transmitter starts to cut out.Other that that, pairing was easy and I love the quality of the sound, and the comfort. Plus it looks sweet.

133,"on March 16, 2014",,I actually bought these wireless headphones for better viewing of foreign films on TV which can be a little hard to hear unless you crank up the volume.  Even then I could tell that I was missing a lot.  (I am not hard of hearing)I chose the RS170 model over the RS160 and RS180 because of the control buttons right on the earpiece.I have not been disappointed.  Sound is excellent and I am amazed at everything that comes through on these movies now.  And it is not just the background and music but the dialog comes through and is much easier to hear and understand.  Also if you are viewing any action movies or TV programs these headphones really bring those alive too.  You can always depend on Sennheiser for a quality product.  I highly recommend.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hear what you are missing
134,"on October 13, 2011",,"My sony headphones wore out and a new set of Sentry Wireless headphones lasted only a few days.  I decided to purchase a more expensive set of headphones as I have a hearing problem and use them daily to listen to the TV.  I decided upon the RS 170's rather than the open earphones of the 180 as other reviews spoke about the sound delay from the TV speaker being annoying.  My wife listens to the TV speaker with normal volume and it does not interfere with my listening at all.  The closed earphones do make your ears warm, but not that terrible.  The sound controlls are flat, but you get used to them and simply remove the headphones for a second to place your fingers in the right areas.  Yes, you do have to switch the headsets on at the base each time you use them after charging, but you just turn them on each time you take them off their charge base. All the controls work great and the sound is also great - nice volume controls.  Chargeing the Sony was a nightmare compared to these Sennheiser's - could never get the Sony on the base correctly and very annoying while these set very easily and when the charge light goes out they are fully charged.  I have used them up to about 4 hours without a battery problem.Are the earphones worth the money - yes, so far are excellent.Would I suggest them to a friend  - yes, are comfortable, sound excellent and no outside interfering noise.

    ","These headphones are great! I am happy with the sound reproduction, and I love that I can wander around the house and still listen to my TV program. It cuts out a little in the laundry room but does fine as far as the fridge. The sound is unrelated to the volume I have set on the TV. I usually listen with the TV volume all the way off while the kids downstairs are sleeping, although I can also use the headphones while someone watches with me. This was not true on our old TV; I probably hooked it up differently this time. On the old TV I had to reset the headphone volume based on how loud the TV volume was set.Previous reviewers mention that the controls are hard to manage without looking. This is absolutely true. In three months of use I have  kind of memorized the feel of the controls, but I usually still have to look. I think I will glue plastic dots on the buttons. Hope it doesn't void the warrantee. The ""no-feely"" controls are not a deal-breaker for me, but I originally bought the headphone for my 86-year-old father and he would never have been able to manage these controls.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Really great wireless headphones for TV watching freedom

They are comfortable and easy to use.  The only improvement I would suggest is that they figure out a way to allow the user to locate the buttons on the headphones without taking them off and looking at them.

    ","I have had a hearing problem for years.  And it has been getting worse.  Loudness was not the problem and I was beginning not to understand certain words.  So I was having to use close captions on my TV. A friend had a pair of Sennheiser headphones as he listens to the business channels and it was getting on his wife's nerves.  When I was at their house he had me to Sennheiser RS 170 Digital Wireless Headphone with Dynamic Bass and Surround Soundtry them and then loaned them to me for 10 days.  Well I was amazed as I don't have to wear my hearing aids to hear with these on and can understand what the people are saying.  So I ordered Sennheiser RS 170 Digital wireless Headphones.  They are so great.  They have a setting for Surround Sound and Dynamic Bass.  The Bass part is great as I hear better in the lower tones.  If there is anyone in the family that doesn't want to hear the TV program that you are watching, you can hit the mute button and only you will be able to hear the program.

    ",I am very hard of hearing and purchased these to replace a set of Sennheiser's that fit into the ear and I have to be directly in front of the unit to get a connections.  The sound coming from the RS 170 is really great and they are pretty comfortable but as mentioned in many other reviews it is VERY difficult to turn them on or change volume with the headphones on my head.  Whatever idiot designed these should have made the on/off higher than the two volume + - controls on either side and also added something to the base/surround should buttons so they are easy to find.  Sennheiser needs to read these customer feedbacks and make some cosmetic changes and they would have a five star product instead of a four.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound but controls suck
139,"on May 22, 2013",,"I am using these headphones with a Yamaha RX-A2000 receiver with Yamaha's Silent Cinema technology and the two combined are much much more than I could have possibly expected.  The sound quality is amazing and comparable to all but the best hi-end wired headsets.  I love the fact that I can take the trash out to the curb and not miss a beat of the audio of what I'm watching.  I like the dynamic bass, but I prefer having the surround off; probably due to my receiver already adding in its own surround.  The quality of the surround atmosphere these phones paired with my Yamaha create is simply amazing; not quite as good as my 9.1 surround, but certainly closer than I thought possible.  My problem of the old lady yelling at me to turn it down late at night is finally resolved!  The only issue I have had is some interference with other wireless devices.  I had problems with devices not connecting to my router only when the headphones were in use.  I emailed Sennheiser about this issue and received a reply in literally like 2 or 3 minutes which really impressed me.  I was told what I could try to alleviate this problem and it greatly reduced the issue.  Overall great product and great customer service!",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these things
140,"on October 20, 2015",,"These are awesome headphones!!  The clarity of sound is amazing and the connectivity (inlcuding through walls) is great!  The cradle is also a very convenient feature as it makes the charging of the headphones easy.  The headphones are easily adjustable and are great to a touch.  I've had many headphones and these are by far the best.I could only think of two drawbacks, which are relatively minor.  As some of the other reviewers have noted, the buttons are positioned so closely together that it's hard to operate them.  This is not a big deal for me, though, as I don't adjust the volume all that much.  For those who do, this would be kind of annoying as it's really easy to turn off the headphones as the power button is located right between the up and down volume buttons.The second drawback is that after wearing the headphones for an hour or so, my ears start to sweat and I need to take the headphones off for a few seconds to ventilate them.  This apparently happens because the headphones padding is made out of leather that, by the way feels very nice, but does not really ventilate.Overall, I'm very impressed with the quality of the headphones which have exceeded my expectations!",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are awesome headphones!
141,"on December 26, 2011",,"This is my 3rd set of wireless headphones; but, my 1st set of Sennheiser.  I got tired of the problems with my other sets (both still working) and purchased the RS 170 in Sept 2011.  These are the best set I've owned.  Other reviews cover technical aspects well, on which I relied before purchase.  I'll confine my comments to length of use prior to recharge, recharging, effective distance, comfort - areas where I found other reviews unclear or contradictory - and recommendations.  Comparisons with my previous sets are based on new, out-of-the-box, performance for all.Length of single sitting use:  My previous units' batteries would be discharged after 6 hours (old set 1) and 8 hours (old set 2) of continuous use after a full charge.  For the Sennheiser RS 170 set, I've not yet fully discharged the batteries during a single sitting (including falling asleep with them on resulting in a total continual running-time of between 10 and 12 hours).Recharging:  Just hang them on the base unit and the charging begins; indicator light confirms charging - when light goes off, headphones are fully charged.  To date, it has never taken more than a few hours to fully recharge after long use (charged during sleep so I haven't timed it - always fully charged the next morning).  After a typical shorter use time (of 3 or 4 hours) they are recharged in about 1 to 2 hours.  It has never taken the 16 hours noted by the mfg.  (My previous units required much longer and 24 hours or more to fully recharge after becoming discharged).I can't explain why the RS 170 plays longer and charges faster than my previous sets, which also used AAA NiMH batteries.  Probably higher capacity batteries and better charger but I don't know.Effective distance:  Haven't exceeded it yet out to about 70 feet; but, obstacles like walls and appliances do reduce reception distance; similar to my previous sets.  Haven't encountered any problem with interference.Comfort:  Excellent.  Firm enough to stay-put while doing other things; but, they do not produce pressure discomfort on my ears or head (both of my previous sets did hurt after awile).  Closed ear cups do cause some sweating after a couple of hours but not enough to be a problem (for me) - it gets to above 80F almost daily at my location.  OTOH, the ear cups block much exterior noise making it easier to hear audio/dialogue, reduce distractions, and enhance listening.  With them on, I can still faintly hear the phone ring.By 'closed ear cups' I mean soft oval pads on the headphones that produce a partial-seal around the ears.  These pads cover the majority of my ears but not all.  They fit up against the lower part of my ear lobes - even so, good fit and comfortable.  As an aside, the most uncomfortable set I've owned were open-style with no oval pads.  These applied pressure directly on the cartilage portion of the ear and would become quite painful after a couple of hours. They would also fall off during even minor head movement and/or activity.Recommendations:  I agree with previous commenters about the control buttons on headphones being difficult to use. Larger 'feeler-bumps' on the buttons would correct this. I disagree with others about changing to wheel controls - which, in my experience, are prone to corrosion and failure.The RS 170 price is steep; but, I have been pleased.  I use these every day (helping to justify the expense), the sound quality is great for my uses, and I highly recommend them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fine Wireless Headphones

I bought them because I wanted to try something other than bluetooth and my other pair of Sennheiser headphones were a great purchase for the price. I have found myself regretting not going with bluetooth for wireless headphones because multiple times I had wished that I could have taken them with me or connected them up to my phone without dealing with the wiring in my desk. The biggest issue, though, is that there is some low-end filter that will completely block sound if it's below a certain level. This means that if I'm listening to a song or video that has quiet parts, those will be completely muted. The only way to get around this is to turn the volume up.Pros:- The charge lasts quite a long time. I can go all day at work on one charge.- I can't go all day with the headphones on my ears without them hurting, but they are comfortable for a solid hour at least.- They have never failed to pair wit the charging station.- Both the charging station and the headphones look good.- Sound quality is good. The bass isn't very strong, though.- Good job at isolating the sound within the headphones.Cons:- The biggest con for me is that there seems to be a low-end filter that blocks out quiet sounds. This means that if I'm listening to a song/video and have it at a low level then the headphones will completely block out part of it. The only way to get passed this is to turn up the volume.- Once you plug these things into something, it's meant to stay there so if you want to swap between different sources, it's a hassle.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good but....

    ","This is my personal thought and I apologize for my english. I bought this set and try it for a while but at the end I returned it. The first time I put it on I was not happy, my ears were very uncomfortable compare my Sennheiser HD518, even the top of my head after a while started bothering me. It took days to feel this headphone more comfortable but at the end I was almost fine.

The control buttons on the headphone are a little bit tricky but I was able to manage them decently as soon as I remembered their location. What made me decide to return this product back was the turning on and off of the wireless signal during songs with a couple of second pause in the middle and that was quite bothering me. Two thumbs up for Amazon, it took it back with no problems.

    ","I recently bought these headphones because I was in the market to do something to get rid of all of the wires that were on my desk. I have always been skeptical of the wireless headphones because I always thought they lost sound quality and didn't allow you to really move around while wearing them. But after lots of reading reviews, I decided to jump on these. When I got these, the setup was a breeze.. the hardest part was taking everything out of the box (there are quite a few accessories/pieces that come with it). I plugged one end into my surround sound headphone jack and the other into the charging/wireless base, and then plugged the power cord in.. thats all you have to do to set up the wireless base! I let the headphones charge overnight so that they would be fully charged and in the morning I started to play some music with them. Let me tell you, I was blown away with the sound quality that came out of the headphones! I couldnt believe that wireless headphones could push out that kind of sound quality. The KLEER tech that Sennheiser puts in their headphones really works. The only time I really noticed any fuzz is when my headphones were turned all the way up.. so I just turned them halfway down and turned up the sound on my surround sound receiver.  Next thing to test was how far I could go without disrupting the signal. I walked throughout my house without any disruption, several walls in between me and the receiver. The comfort factor of these headphones are awesome. They put enough pressure on your head to allow the headphones to stay on without moving around, but not too much to where it hurt after awhile. I wore the headphones for several hours and barely felt anything when I took them off. I am so amazed by these headphones and recommend them to anyone and everyone.

    ","These sound good and the connection is much better than RF Sennheiser's I've owned in the past, but the quality of the ear pad is SOOOOOO poor they are uncomfortable.  The pleather doesn't breath at all and then the padding within the pleather compresses so easily that even my big ears are swallowed and lay against the driver inside the headphone.  The felt inside the pad is SUPER thin so your ears are getting pressed against hard plastic.I'm surprised the pads are so cheezy for a headphone of this price.Sennheiser's recommendation on an audiophile forum I participate on was to look into replacing the RS 170's pads with the RS 180 pads that are felt and ""may"" be better.  $30 later, I'll know if that's any better...they have been ordered.Come on Sennheiser....you're working way to hard to make your customer not pay for the next level up.

167,"on January 21, 2015",,"I bought these headphones to use at my desk at work.  I work in a quiet cubicle setting, so I wanted something that wouldn't leak sound to my coworkers to hear.  At the same time I didn't want anything noise cancelling, so that I could hear my phone ring and people trying to get my attention.  These headphones did exactly that!I did a lot of research on what headphones to purchase and decided to go with the Sennheiser RS 170 headphones.  I wanted a good wireless set because cords are just annoying and limit mobility at my desk.  I've walked around a little bit through the office and the signal starts to cut out about 30 yards away.  I think the price is pretty good at $180 compared to any beats or bose wireless that go for twice as much.They actually look better in person than in the pictures.  They're not the best looking headphones, but they're not too bulky and the matte black finish on them is pretty nice.  The charging dock is a really nice feature as well.  I use the headphones all day (8 hours) and charge them when I leave work.  They are extremely comfortable as well.  I don't like the feel of on-ear headphones at all and earbuds are fine for a couple hours, but then they start to get annoying.  These over-ear headphones feel great without being too big or weighing that much.  There isn't too much pressure on your ears either unlike other over-ear headphones.  I would strongly suggest buying the velour RS 180 earcups and switching them out with the standard fake leather RS 170 earcups though.  The fake leather ones compress against your head more, are much hotter, and less comfortable.  The velour earcups are well worth it.  After a couple hours of use with them your ears still start to get warm, so I would just remove them for 5-10 minutes and then I was fine.  These are still the most comfortable headphones I've ever used.  From what I've heard the RS 180s are open-air, which vents out the heat even more, but people around you can hear what you are listening to as well.  That's why I didn't get the RS 180s.The sound quality on these are great as well.  I'm not an audiophile, but I thought they were very good.  The surround sound feature on the RS 170 is really nice.  I only listen to music with my headphones, but I always have the surround turned on.  It adds more sound coming in from the side, while with surround off you only get sound more towards the top.  I find it quite appealing with music.  The bass feature is nice as well.  Without it you can barely hear any bass.  With it on the bass is more audible and crisp.  One of my few complaints is that the bass should be stronger.  I don't like a blaring bass on my headphones, but even with the bass feature on it wasn't enough.  I like to hear a good thump when I listen to rap and especially electronic music.Overall, these headphones are extremely nice and I would recommend them to anyone who wants a good pair of wireless headphones.

168,"on January 17, 2015",,"I bought these as a gift for my dad, who is hard of hearing.  He likes to watch television, but the volume has to be up so loud that it drives my mother crazy.  I was a little concerned because he has an old tube television set, and it doesn't have many input/output options.  I also needed something that was fairly easy to use.  These were perfect.They came with the option of connecting the transmitter/base unit using a headphone jack or the red/white audio cables. (The cord from the base unit has a headphone plug, or can plug into an extension cable with the red/white component plugs).  I ended up connecting the base unit to the cable box, which worked beautifully.The volume is terrific for him, and he can leave the room and still hear the audio. He likes to use them when he uses the treadmill, also- perfect since they're wireless. Prior to this, he couldn't hear the television over the noise from the treadmill.When he upgraded to a more modern smart television, I switched to connecting the base unit directly to the television with the headphone plug.  Same great performance.They were very easy to install, and have gotten a lot of use. He finds the headphones comfortable, and even when the volume is up loud enough for him, it's not evident to people around.  The television volume can be on or off. He also has had no trouble with the control buttons (they're located on the side of the pair of headphones), and small buttons can be a problem for him.

    ","Great headphones, except:1. Sound cuts off at low volume music; 2. Continuous low volume single tone noise in both channels. This also stops when the sound cuts off at low level passages.Changing the signal source, repeated pairing of the headphones with the transmitter and shutting off all radiating equipment (wi-fi, phones, etc.) do not resolve the issue. These problems are not present when using my wired Sennheiser headphone.I use the headphones in the following setup:Signal sources: Headphone outputs on two identical Mac Pro 4.1 computers, Denon AVR-2313CI receiver, Revox CD player. All outputs set around 50% of full volume.Transmitter attenuator: -7dB. Headphone volume set at high.I made some measurements on the Mac Pro using various iZotope plug-ins. The sound cuts off when the input signal falls under -55dBFS. This cutoff level is independent of signal contents and waveform (I measured it with music, white noise, sinus, square and sawtooth signals). The frequency of the single tone noise is 1260 ± 5Hz (I measured it in comparison to a signal generator test tone). Its level is estimated as approximately -53dbFS.The headphones were less than 6 feet from the transmitter during these measurements.At higher levels the sound is good and without significant distortion. Bass emphasis, surround sound settings do not effect the problems.At present the unit is barely usable because of the 55dB dynamic range that cuts off all pianissimo passages and also because of the constant 1260 Hz whistle.Since I was unsure whether it is a general problem with this model or it is just my unit that is defective, I e-mailed the above to manufacturer's Technical Support first around January 7, than on January 16th. Although Sennheiser appears to be rather responsive to customer's complaints, I have not received any response.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Decreased dynamic range, whistling noise at soft passages"

However, there is one slight issue which does not disturb me very much but somehow detracts from the perfection of this item.  When I watch TV with my wife and I am wearing the headphones and she is not, I can distinctly hear an echo which worsens as the TV external volume is increased. I do not hear this at all when I'm watching by myself and turn down the TV volume to zero.  However, if the tv volume is turned up you will hear a distinct echo which becomes more troublesome as the volume is made louder.  This is not a huge problem if you don't pump up the volume and eventually you may not even notice the very slight echo.  It's not a huge deal and I don't want to make a federal case of it, but it may be an issue for purists who tend to watch with a partner who likes to pump up the volume while you wear the headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic headphones with one caveat

    ","I have only tried using the RS170 with my PC, but so far it's great.Sound Quality: 5/5The sound quality of the RS170 is by far the best I've experienced in a wireless headset.I've tried almost all the <$200 headsets and sound quality is almost always lacking.People who say they have ""hiss"" problems need to turn down the volume on the headset and turn up the volume on the source device. The headset only hisses when the volume on the headset is turned all the way up.All in all, good crisp highs and lows. 320kps music sounds great, along with all movies and shows that I've watched so far.Comfort: 4/5The headset is a little heavy, but the ear-cuffed style helps hold it up on your head.I love that the headset comes with the ear-cuff style as they are easily the most comfortable style.There's a lot of padding around the cuffs and the cuffs are large enough to cover even the biggest of ears.It's not going to look sexy, but it's damn comfortable.Range: 4/5When it comes to wireless headsets, you're never going to find great range with great sound quality.It's a tradeoff, and you need to decide which is more important to you.I live in a medium sized suburban 1-story house, and the range reached almost fully across my house.But the further you go, and the more walls you pass through, the worse the sound quality will get.If you get this headset, you must understand that it's meant to be used in the same room as your source (TV, PC, etc).As long as you use it the way it's meant to be used, you'll love it.Features: 5/5The added charging station is a godsend. I can't undervalue the fact that I can just place the headset on the charger when I'm done, rather than having to hook it up to a cable each time. Also, when you place the headset on the charger, it will automatically turn off if inactive for a few minutes. No need to manually turn off the headset and charger separately. The controls are easy to use on the headset once you get used to the placement of the buttons. The headset is also extremely easy to set up with any device.TLDL: You might spend a little more than you were hoping, but this headset is well worth it's $.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly What I Was Looking For!

    ","I've owned Sennheiser headphones for 15 years -- and I love the overall brand. I've owned previous versions of their wireless headphones and have always been dissapointed. They'd have low grade hiss and would lose signal very quickly. Not anymore. The RS-170s offer flawless playback and sound. No changing channels, no tuning, they just work.The sound is what you expect from a mid-to-high end of Sennheiser cans -- really good. Clear vocals, crisp instruments, and good bass. These are not heavy heavy bass headphones but if you like heavy bass there is a bass boost button that definitely kicks it up. I've experienced a little distortion on the low end with some deep strong bass with bass enhancement turned on.The surround mode also works well although I prefer my music to come to my ears like it was intended so I don't use it.I can walk around my house without the signal dropping.Some have reported a slight drop of signal every once in a while. I haven't had any of that in two weeks of regular usage.In the end, I spent extra on these with the hope that they stood up to the reviews -- and they do.

    ","Okay, I'll start out by saying that I have a pair of V-Moda Crossfade M-100 headphones that I used quite a bit (though I later returned them because they hurt my ears). The Crossfades are very nice, had clean bass, and are travel-friendly, but they're also corded.Unfortunately, I don't always have the luxury of sitting in one place for long, so I needed something that would let me move about and do stuff. That's where the Sennheiser RS170 headphones come in. They're much more comfortable than the V-Moda Crossfades, they sound great, and they have better range and clarity than the Sennheiser RS120 headphones I've used in the past. They also look really nice alongside my home theater equipment.The surround setting does provide additional depth to the sound stage, but I don't always use it. The bass setting provides a nice boost, so I use it about half the time, but it can sound ""boomy"" (compared to the Crossfades) on bass-heavy tracks. It's best used for music that doesn't already provide a lot of bass.The batteries provided with my RS170s are AAA Sanyo Eneloops. This works out well, since I use Eneloops for most of the battery powered electronics that I own, so I have plenty of spares available when I finally wear them out. They'll hold a charge for a very long time, much longer than any conventional NiMH or NiCd batteries.The range on the RS170s is pretty good. I get occasional cutout when I'm about 50 feet away, but that's after the signal has passed through 2 layers of drywall, an OSB sub-floor, carpet + padding, and 2 more layers of drywall. It would be great to have more range, but it's rare for me to bring the RS170s upstairs with me anyway, so I'm not disappointed.The control buttons, located on the right side of the headphones, were tricky to locate at first. They could definitely be designed better (tactile dots, round & raised buttons, or something else), but I figured out how to locate them quickly with a little trick: I put my index finger behind the headband, my middle finger in front of the headband, then use my thumb to work the buttons. From back to front, they're ""vol +"", ""power"", ""vol -"", ""surround"" and ""bass"". It didn't take long to get comfortable using the buttons once I got the technique down.The only feature I *really* wish Sennheiser had provided would be the ability to power on the base from the headphones, as opposed to having to travel to the base to turn it on separately. Since the base is AC-powered, I'm sure they could've provided some way to monitor the power-up of the headphones to avoid having to turn on the base separately. Maybe Sennheiser will add that in the future, but that's the only real negative I can think of right now.Overall, I'm quite happy with the RS170 headphones. And Sennheiser, if you ever add a base auto-power-on feature, I'll swap you for my existing base. :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best wireless headphones I've owned so far

187,"on September 10, 2014",,"I was really concerned about interference with my wifi devices prior to buying this headset.

I will say that I read the manual that came with the transmitter/headphones so we did everything in the order specified.  Charge the batteries, turn the transmitter on, then the headset, then the sound source. There are guidelines for distance from metal and electronic devices (my husband is contemplating DBS so the headsets may be a problem in the future). I plan to buy a second headset.  I already read the instructions for adding additional headphones.  Not intuitive but straightforward steps. I'm wondering if some of the reviewers who had negative comments treated this like ""plug and play"" (which it is) without realizing that there is a sequence for doing things.  The manual that came with mine is about 38 pages long.

    ","I bought this to upgrade from my RS-120 and 130. (One of the headpieces broke in half). What a disappointment. You can't walk far out of the room with the base, without losing the signal. Unlike the 120/130, you must turn on both the base and the headset each time you use it. Volume is almost impossible to adjust with the headphone on your head. There are buttons for +/-, which are not discernable with a finger touch. The wheel on the 120/130 made much more sense. Frankly, I would like the old sets that were sold with earpieces that cover the entire ear. The new 120 ""on ear"" ones will not stay on when walking around, bending, etc. I should have just returned this 170, but will use it in the bedroom.

    ","I use the headphones for watching movies in my living room.  Usually, I have someone in my living room crashing on my couch/floor, and the walls in my apartment aren't very good for stopping sound (I can usually hear my neighbor listening to Filipino shows on Sundays).  Now I don't have to worry about waking up my friends in my living room, or hearing my neighbors while I'm watching my movies (and vice versa).The system is easy to set up:  just plugged the 3.5 mm cable from the transmitter to my TV, plug the transmitter into the wall, put the batteries in the headphones (I actually used my own alkaline batteries right away vice using the rechargeable batteries supplied because I wanted to use it right away; it's a 16 hour charging time for the batteries and I couldn't wait to try the headphones).  The buttons are easy to find and use on the headphones:  located on the bottom of the right speaker.  From back to front (getting smaller as they progress), you have the Volume+ (triangle shaped and the largest), the Power button, the Volume- button, then a gap before the surround button and the Bass Boost.The sound quality is pretty good; bass boost isn't thumping, but it does a good job; surround sound really makes the listening experience better for movies.  The only problem I noticed was a small, high pitched sound, probably from the receiver in the headphone, that would go off when receiving sound, especially noticeable when all the sound stops from a movie.  The remedy was pretty simple, turn the headphones up; didn't notice it after that.  Because somebody had mentioned it in their review, I decided to test if there was an echo when simultaneously using the TV speakers with the headphones; there was none, so listening with others watching without headphones isn't a problem.  I can also walk around my whole apartment (even though I only have a one bedroom), without losing sound.Overall, I highly recommend these speakers, especially if you live in an apartment complex and want big sound without bothering your neighbors.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome

However when many instruments introduced, I have to turn off surround sound, or sound is overwhelming, and it's hard to distinguish anything, even at lower volume. Watching the movie is the same thing. I saw Star Trek, and it's really not surround sound per se. The sound is only augmented to be louder and comes from 4 smaller but louder points instead of 2 centralized quieter points, but no surround sound effect one would get from the speakers. I am not expecting speaker surround sound, but some has to be present, since the headphones are advertised as such and that is why I bought them.

    ","The Sennheiser RS 170 is the first pair of wireless earphones I've owned. The sound quality is very good. There is absolutely no hiss that I can hear. I can put them on and wear them sitting here at the computer or in washing the dishes.  The negative observations are what has been stated before.  There is a significant echo. I live alone so can turn the volume down when near the speakers, but when any friends come over I won't be able to use them and the speakers. I have hearing loss so watching a movie without overwhelming my friends with the volume was one reason to purchase them.  The remark by the Sennheiser representative is wrong. The phones may be closed in design but you have to put the volume really low on the speakers, or high on the phones to get past the echo.  The buttons were not well thought out.  The power button is located between the up and down volumes and without removing the set to see what I'm doing, I'm as likely to turn the unit off as to change the volume.  As a rule I don't make changes with the volume after it's set, so the design flaw is minimal for my usage.  The range given is supremely optimistic. I can go to the three surrounding rooms with no dropout, but any other rooms and the phones are clicking on and off.  Perhaps 40 feet then a wall stops the transmission.  Having stated all the negatives I need to say if something happened to the phones, I would go out and buy the same set again tomorrow.  The clear, well balanced sound is impressive to hear. The volume doesn't decrease as one gets further away; it is simply on and off, which is easier on my ears.  I may eventually run a hard wire to connect the Sennheiser to a more central location in my house.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Shorter range then expected

206,"on January 16, 2014",,"My husband and I are sharing the one charger/transmitter base and using separate headphones receiving the same audio. This allows for him to play his games, explore YouTube, etc. without distracting me, and when he calls me over to show me something or when we play a turn-based game together, I can slip on the other pair. He used to hate switching back and forth between headphones and speakers because it would involve changing out plugs at the back of the tower. The other thing he enjoys is hooking the transmitter up to his iphone and listening to the radio while he does the dishes, laundry, or other hands-ful tasks, cord-free. The signal is strong throughout our small apartment so we can move about freely.Neither of us is an audiophile, so I can't comment on how Sennheiser compares to other brands or how this model compares to more or less expensive ones, but we like it. We did our research and learned that Sennheiser produces a large proportion of the headphone models that get top critical reviews (3-4 in every list of top 10, I'd say), so we felt safe picking this set. The quality suits our basic needs in a set of headphones, they're adjustable and comfy to wear for extended periods of time, and they're really easy to use (if difficult to set up the first time for single-source, dual-receiver).My husband's hesitation in picking wireless headphones was that the sound quality would suffer, and we picked high-end headphones with good reviews hoping to avoid that problem. The industry seems to have figured this out and we are very satisfied with this set. If you want something more mobile, I would look into a different kind of product, since it would be impossible to take the transmitting tower on, say, an airplane or road trip. It really is a stationary base unit. But if you are thinking of linking it with your TV, desktop computer, or maybe stereo system, the headphones will probably pick up that signal throughout your house.One last note on the noise-isolating feature: I have been a longtime addict of noise-isolating earbuds, and they have served me very well on airplanes, long bus rides, in libraries that should be but aren't quiet, etc. The noise-isolating feature of these headphones is moderately good. It doesn't compete with good earbuds that more completely block off the entire ear, but compared to other headphones, they provide a good, comfortable seal and adequate noise isolation (so that my husband can't hear me with them on most of the time, but they wouldn't block out a crying baby). Compared to noise-cancelling headphones, which my husband swears by, these win hands-down. Noise-cancelling is a joke because only predictable, repeating sounds can be analyzed and cancelled out, so any conversation, music or intermittent noise comes through clear as day. I understand the merit of blocking out the sound of *being in an airplane* or *being in a car on the highway* but those sounds don't bother me in the first place. If you are looking for headphones that will block out your siblings or your neighbor's nocturnal chihuahua, noise-isolating is what you want to look for, and these headphones do a good job of that.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Convenient

210,"on January 15, 2012",,"In summary, I ordered the RS-170 headphones as an upgrade to my previous Sennheiser 900Mhz set, and they've exceeded my expectations.I listen to TV while moving around the house, and my previous headphones had an annoying hiss and limited range that limited their usefulness.  The reviews suggested the 2.4Ghz digital units were better in both of these aspects, so I gave them a shot.  In the end, my new set provides clear, high quality audio with only a brief dropout every several minutes.  I attribute those rare dropouts to circulating around WiFi routers, the microwave oven and to the far side of the house.Things to consider:1) I'm not asking these to produce music at an audiophile level -- my $400 in-ear headphones do a considerably better job of accurately recreating the soundstage.  The RS-170s will recreate the notes with reasonable accuracy, but they don't produce the space between the notes or the richness of timbre that give me the 'you are there' feeling.2) Because of the price at the time, I cheaped out and bought a refurbished set for 2/3 the price, and that was a mistake.  They had VERY limited range, to the point where with line-of-sight and no other interference, I couldn't go 10 feet from the transmitter without dropouts every several seconds.  I decided to return them and ALMOST gave up on the idea of upgrading, but in the meantime the price of a new unit had dropped to almost the same cost as the refurbs.  I took a shot and bought a brand new set, and they're the ones I'm reporting on above.  My advice to others who are scratching their heads about lousy range is that there may be a quality control problem that lets substandard units onto the market.  Operating properly, they're capable of good performance at least at a 60-80' range through walls with interfering devices present...that's what I'm getting.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best I've Heard

Having never owned a set before, I wanted to make one purchase and be done.  My primary use for the RS 170s  is laying in bed late at night while my wife is sleeping.  First off...this part is easy.  She has no idea as far as sound what I am listening to.I keep the headphones and transmitter hooked up and hidden behind the TV and no one would be the wiser.  The over-the-ear cup design is a bit small for my ears and if I watch TV for close to 2 hrs (a Movie) my ears start to get a bit sore.  This could be just for me though.The Charging is quite simple, as long as you remember to put the headphones back on the cradle each day.  Even then, I had mine die just last week, instead of being without my headphones and going to another room when my wife fell asleep, I simply pulled the rechargable batteries out and replaced with standard and was back in business.  The next morning I replaced them back and got them back charging.The BEST part of these headphones...THE SOUND!  Having never worn headphones for a TV, I had no idea the standard speakers and what I was hearing everyday while watching TV was so muted.  I was amazed at the detail and clarity of sound I picked up when these headphones went on.  You know that feeling you got when you watched the NFL for the first time in full perfect HD???  Same with these headphones.  I was blown away!I love these headphones so far.  Have had them about a month so not 100% sure about durability but so far so good.Oh...I can also walk all over my house and listen to what I have on in my bedroom just like I was standing right there 10 feet from the TV.  My house is not huge, but through 3 walls and close to 75' is how far away I could freely move.

213,"on November 28, 2012",,"The performance of these headphones is shockingly good. The sound quality is excellent, and doesn't seem to be affected by their distance from the base.

There can be only one explanation for this technology (like those 64gb micro-SD cards...how do those exist?!?): WITCHCRAFT.I have two gripes. One, the base and the headphones have to be turned on separately. They don't pair like blue-tooth units, rather every time you turn them both on they locate each other. The pairing is entirely automatic and only take a few seconds, but it would be nice if I could turn the whole thing on with one button.Second, comfort. Disclaimer: I have a giant head, if your head is normal-sized, this probably won't be a problem. For me, the way those pads are shaped only their bottom corners make contact with my skull. All the weight (which is actually very, little - these are surprisingly light) sits on those two points, so after an hour or two I get two little sore spots on my head. All that means is that I have to adjust the headband position every once in a while. Again, not a deal-breaker, just a little annoying.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Witchcraft! (4.5/5 stars)
214,"on December 3, 2013",,"I don't know why it took me so long to figure out the setup of this. Setup is easy after all is said and done. But it's frustrating getting to that point.I bought another pair separately with no transmitter. I needed to connect the transmitter to my receiver and then both headphones to the transmitter; it required a bit of research on my part. It didn't come with a manual - I had to download it online. Hmph.I had to read several reviews and user comments, AND the manual AND the manual for my receiver, before I could figure it all out. The manual for this was not the best written. I guess there's so much confusion and vagueness because it can be used in a variety of different setups and everyone's setup is slightly different.Let me attempt to simplify it for those of you who are in the same boat as I was.This connects to a receiver through the AUDIO OUT. The red and white cables it comes with will only work with analog inputs, so another words, if your cable box uses digital audio cords like optical or coaxial cables to make sound, your SOL (er...out of luck). You need to have a receiver that has a digital audio out, and will need to buy another digital audio cable for this to work. I can only use this with my TiVo component because my TiVo just so happens to split my cable (so I can watch cable tv through here or on the comcast cable box - different input), and is connected with a component video/audio cable, not HDMI ; Long story why that is. Plus, my older Onkyo receiver unfortunately does not have a digital audio out, only an analog out.Because my receiver sadly has no digital audio output and because my HD cable box runs through the receiver with digital optical audio and HDMI, I can't use my headphones for the Comcast cable box. I suppose I could connect the analog audio transmitter directly to the cable box, but then I can ONLY use these for cable then. I'd have to switch it if I want to watch TiVo. Not very convenient.You can still use this for digital audio even though your receiver does not have the correct output if your components themselves have digital audio outs, but you will still need the cable to do this (sold separately) and, the space can't already be occupied if you have it running through a receiver like I do. Fortunately, like I explained before, my TiVo has analog cables running from TiVO to the audio input on my receiver and allows me to run the analog audio out from the receiver to the wireless headphone transmitter (no new cable necessary) - thus allowing me to have sound coming out of my home theater system speakers and the headphones at the same time, and I don't have to buy another digital audio cable. Plus, I can watch cable or recorded shows with TiVo. Just can't watch in pure HD. Oh well. I have to physically switch the cords if I want to watch a DVD with this. Meh, not worth the effort. Not worth it to me to buy a whole new receiver with digital out either.About the product itself, the sound is great, the battery life is long, the padding and all is comfortable. I agree with another reviewer, these get a little heavy on the head after a long while wearing them, but not too bad. You can easily adjust for head size. There's a slight bit of feedback when turned on but no sound (i.e. the TiVo is on pause). A low hum. You don't notice it once the sound comes on. I guess this can be a good thing to let you know your headphones are ready, however.It takes a little while to get used to feeling for the right button on ear. I've often pushed power when I meant to lower the volume. A tad annoying but I'm getting skilled at knowing the difference the more I use them.Range is excellent. I can easily walk to the kitchen or the bathroom and not miss a beat.Headphones comes with eneloop rechargeable batteries. I luckily just so happen to have an eneloop charger because of my DSLR flash. If you wish to recharge the batteries in other ways than the transmitter, you will have to purchase this separately. But it's nice knowing it's not a Sennheiser brand battery and I can easily find replacements if necessary.Most of all, I'm so pleased to have these for the purpose of not disturbing a sleeping baby, but not sacrifice sound quality! Plus, they're not so noise canceling that I don't still hear the baby cry. Best practical use for me.To pair multiple headphones, you have to hold both power buttons (on headphones and transmitter) at the same time for 7 seconds and then wait about 30 more seconds, and they will be paired. Again, took me a while to find this in the manual and figure it out.Once I got the setup all figured out, life was a breeze. I'm so glad I got these! Worth the effort.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Idea for watching TV with a sleeping baby!
215,"on December 29, 2012",,"We use the headphones for the TV with an extra set. They almost never have the sound of the TV on in the house. Open sound it too distracting. Also this sound is so good that it does help my father with his hearing to understand the TV voices. He says that now the TV shows just has to get rid of the background music, but that is beyond the headphones capacity. These are the best sound for wireless. I choose wireless because I can walk around the house and do the dishes and be on the computer while listening to the TV. Really, I don't have to be sitting in front of the TV for a game or the news. It takes a little practice to bet used to the new buttons for the headphones to pickup the signal with two, but not bad. I like that I can use rechargeable AAA batteries rather than the private batteries that used to be used. The earphones that cover the ears are good for sound and it helps hold the headphones on my head, which has rather small hat size. The headphones that have a flat ear piece tend to slide off my head if I lean down toward the floor. They are pricy, but worth the wireless, great sound, great pickup signal, convenient battery, sturdy construction but don't abuse any electronics. Save up and get them.

I use them as the only sound output for my tv....mostly because I live in a small apartment and it drowns out all the ""neighbor noise"", keeps from advertising what I have, and allows me to listen at any volume without disturbing anyone else. There are a few things that I had to tinker with but overall very satisfied. When I first plugged them in there was a pretty decent buzz - but after turning the tv volume up all the way I was able to turn the volume all the way down on the headset and there is no buzz whatsoever. Very comfortable. I was almost worried they were too loose, but after extended wear they feel great. The height adjustment is also very stiff so, but headset is a little flexible. Battery life is excellent - I've done some all day movie marathons and never had the batteries die yet. Some other reviews complain about the flush volume buttons but after a while you get used to it - although I am curious whos decision it was to put the power button between the up/down volume buttons. I would only rate them a 3/5 for music listening....sure the volume can get as loud as needed but the bass leaves a bit to be desired for a full music effect regardless of genre (prefer my in canal ear buds). But for tv/movie listening I'm completely satisfied!! Another handy tip is when turning them off you have to wait a few seconds before replacing the headset onto the charger or the base will turn back on. You also have to turn both the base and headphones on each time. I would also suggest attaching the base via tape/ect. to wherever its going to keep it from sliding around when turning on/off.

    ","This unit replaces my old Sennheiser wireless unit and I liked the old one enough to buy Sennheiser again.  This new unit seems more comfortable (though is a bit heaver), and the sound seems better than the old one produced.  This unit rates very highly among such wireless cans but, of course, cannot compete with the best of the high-end wired headphones available.  That being said, my guess is that this unit will be a pleasure to use by the great majority of purchasers, myself included.  The range of this RS 170 is very good, and there is little distortion of sound - and you can listen for extended periods of time without listening fatigue.  Four stars instead of five ONLY because sound quality of headphones, however they work, is the most important criterion for me in rating, and one could opt for the best wired high-end phones, which would rate 5 stars.

    ","When I finally decided to order some wireless headphones for the living room, I did my research.  These were a bit over my target budget at the time, but thanks to the reviews here on Amazon I decided to give them a shot and I am extremely glad that I did.I ordered this set back in August of 2010, as sort of a birthday present to myself.  My wife and I had discussed getting some headphones for the living room so that when I wanted to watch TV or play a louder game at night I wouldn't annoy the neighbors, or her beauty sleep.I almost immediately decided to look for wireless headphones for the convenience of not having the cord to deal with, or worry about a new kitten chewing through.  Also for reasons of convenience, I knew that I wanted a rechargeable set so that I wouldn't have to deal with battery swapping.My past experiences with wireless headphones were never good as they were fraught with low usage times before needing to be recharged, static from being too far from the receiver or not being 'tuned' to the receiver properly and having to be manually adjusted.  I was quite pleased with what I saw when I ran across the Sennheiser RS 170 Digital Wireless headphones, as it seemed like these wouldn't have any of these issues.  I am pleased to say that my experience with this set of headphones has been the exact opposite of my earlier experiences; these work fantastically and exactly as advertised.Not only do these auto-tune, sound crystal clear and have a full rich sound (better than my TV's build in speakers) but they also have a long battery life (I have used them for upwards of 12 hours out of a full day, without recharging, with no issues; they have a 24 hour estimated use time) and I haven't experienced any of the ""echo"" or ""out of sync"" sound issues that some people have reported, although it should be noted that I don't use these in conjunction with sound from my TV... it's either one or the other for me.getting these ready for use was extremely easy.  Simply plug the base/tower into a wall outlet, insert the battery packs (yes, they're removable/replaceable) and set the headset on the base/tower.  Let these charge overnight and they're ready to use.  Once they're ready, plug them into your sound source (mine plug directly into the rear of my TV, int he headphone jack), power on the base and the headphone, and you're good to go.  There is a one time Pairing that needs to be done, that was very quick, easy and detailed in the manual.As for usage, there are 5 buttons on the headset itself for quick and easy use.  The power button, which doubles as mute if you tab it instead of hold it.  The volume up and down buttons to the front (volume up) and rear (volume down) of the power button.  The two remaining buttons are what control the SRS Surround sound toggle and the Bass Boost option (these buttons can also be found on the tower/stand); I keep both of these on by default.  The power button has a small divot on it, that you can easily feel with your hand without looking, which goes a long way in helping to learn where each button is.  Once you have the feel of them down then making adjustments on the fly is quick and easy.The range on these is great.  I've not had any issues with the sound cutting out when I walk across the house.  I live in a 2.5 bedroom apartment, which is relatively small compared to most homes, but fairly large for the area we live in.  Passing from one side of the house in the living room through the Den/PC room, Kitchen and then into the Master bedroom doesn't affect the sound quality in the least.Long story short, I would recommend these to anyone that wants a good set of wireless headphones for general use music/movies/games.  They are WELL worth the money.If I could change one thing about them, it would be to add a microphone for gaming, but that's now what this model has been designed for ;)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best audio purchase I made all year

    ","To start out I'm a mild audiophile and after reading all the positive reviews on the new Sennheiser wireless cans I had to check them out. I took the set out of the box and snapped in some alkaline batteries so I could listen to music before I charged the supplied AAA's. I have to say I am impressed, these headphones produce an awesome clarity for wireless cans, no buzz or clicking like older models or inferior makes. I have the Monster Beats by Dr. Dre (Studio)(until I return them to the store of purchase), but started thinking I wanted wireless after hearing they have improved sound quality. The Sennheiser RS 170's blow them away. The Beats sound muddy and the high's are too bright compared to the Senn's. For $300 the Beats are not up to par and I'm still not sure what I was thinking when I bought them (impulse buy I guess). I found the RS 170's for under $230 with next day shipping here on Amazon. The RS 180's are an open back or I would have purchased them. These Senn's are perfect phones for the money and hands down better build quality than the Beats. The Beats are glossy black (cheap looking) and if finger prints drive you crazy like me then you will hate them. The Beats are just cheaply built for the $$$ and the cell phone mic cord had a bad end out of the box. The Monster Dre beats are also known for cracking and breaking at the top band and I can already see where they could break. I should have known as Monster product quality has slipped in recent years. The Senn's are a mat black that look and feel like high-end cans should. The control buttons on the right side are not as hard to figure out as some reviewers have stated.  Also you can barely hear what I'm listening to on the Senn's compared to the Beats which you can hear every word, even if they are at only at a standard volume level.They also perform great with movies on my BluRay and just regular TV as well. The Dynamic Bass and 3D Surround Sound is great while watching movies!The only issue that I have found is that the advertised distance of 260ft. is true line-of-sight only. I can get 30 feet through wall until they start cutting sound on and off randomly.

226,"on May 22, 2012",,"I have been using RS170 wireless headphone for a few months now, and find it to be a great-quality wireless headphone. The range isn't as great as my old SH RS130, but as long as you stay within ""reasonable"" range or better yet stay right in front of the base unit no further than 15-20 feet, the sound quality stays excellent. My only complaint about this unit is the way that you turn on the base unit. Unlike my old Sennheiser RS130 wireless headphone, the RS170, as far as I learn from using and reading the user's manual, has to be turned on at the base unit, and then turn on the headphone to connect to the base unit. That means Users have to walk over to the base unit to push the button on the base unit to turn on, and back to the headphone to push another button to connect. The old RS130 only needs me to switch the on button at the headphone to automatically connect to the base unit, eliminating the need to get to the base unit to turn it on and start using the headphone everytime. I almost hate to say it, but if I knew before hand about having to walk to the base unit to turn on and connect everytime, that would have been a deal breaker for me.

I printed out pages 6 thru 28 to cover all the necessary instructions. Regarding the echo; for us it only comes up if the tv volumn is high and we can hear the tv and the headsets.  We have a sony 46 inch Bravia tv and it has options that allow us to turn off the tv speakers and just go through the audio system speakers.  So just switch off the tv speakers which allows you to turn up or down the volumn on the tv which also turns the volumn up or down on your headsets.

The Surround Sound is nice, but in some scenarios, vocal/speech in a scene or show can seem a bit ""echo-ish"".Design flaws are the only reason I could not give five stars. The control buttons are on the right ear cup, and sit somewhat flush with the exterior of the cup.

    ","The sound quality and range is excellent.  The price is pretty decent for wireless headphones that you can add additional headphones to.  I would have preferred the RS 180, but the open sound would not suit my purposes at this time.The biggest problem for me with the RS 170 is sound gaps in songs where there is a pause or a low sound.  The best example is for classical music when I'm doing homework.  This is a hard problem to illustrate so I'll do my best here:I notice this only with instrumental music- for me that includes classical, folk metal, soundtracks and things like this.  Because this type of music often involves just a few instruments that don't have a lot of bass and have sharp stops and starts, you hear static during these silents pats.  The same thing happens in quite scenes in movies where there is mostly just dialogue happening and not a lot of other background noise.Now, it's entirely possible, that the headset I have is bad and this is something I'll have to check with Amazon/Sennheiser when I get time in the next few days, but for now.One thing that helps minimize this problem is to have the headset volume low and the stereo/computer/tv volume high.I've tried plenty of other wireless headsets though so I can say with confidence the RS170 is leaps and bounds ahead of its competition.  I think if it was $200 it would be an excellent value, but at it's current price, it's decent.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price.

If only a simple knob was used I would not have to take off my headsets to know which button to use to make an adjustment. Many times when I tried to guess I ended up pressing the wrong button, including shutting the headsets off with the ON/OFF button smack in between 'louder' and 'quiter' buttons.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Please go back to the knob for volume control!

They're comfortable. I'm able to leave them on even when I walk across the room, and the sound is great. When these are on, I can't hear any external noises.The only advice that I have is to make sure that the volume is turned down on the headphones themselves.

And the headphones fit comfortably without feeling awkward or heavy.My major concern was whether it would work OK with other WiFi devices operating nearby - such as DVD player with Wi Fi internet connection - since they both operate in the 2.4GHz frequency band.  I inquired with Sennheiser and they informed me that that the headphone system actually looks for other signals in the same frequency range and then selects a different channel from the one the WiFi is running on.  Sure enough, the product worked as advertised.  I could stream movies from Netflix through my DVD player and listen through my headphones, with the DVD player and the headphone base station being right next to each other.  No problems in this department :).With regard to sound quality, it quite clear and good enough for TV.  The bass boost is a little ordinary - while it goes deep, it does not have a great transient response (i.e., sharpness to bass notes).  I didn't check out the surround sound simulation mode to any great extent and cannot comment on that.  The buttons being next to each other needs some getting used to - not very ergonomically located.  It would have been much, much better if they had put the volume control on the right ear cup and the bass and surround sound simulation button on the other.All in all, a very good pair of headphones and nice for TV viewing/listening.

What means is that if 4 persons of a family are sharing a base station to watch movies, they have to listen at exactly same volume level, same SRS, and Base settings. If one person muted his/her headphones, it mutes every body. I don't think this is technology limitation, rather a design flaw made by SENNHEISER!

I am able to listen to the phones from any room in my  house, through closed doors and even outside from about 100 feet away from the source. I agree that the buttons are hard to find.

On the negative side I find the push button controls on the headset cumbersome at best. If you have lost the feeling in your fingertips as have I you must remove the headphones to adjust the volume. For some reason, yet unknown, the transmitter believes there is another set of headphones and it set itself up in multiuser mode. I'll have to check it out and re-pair the units.

261,"on October 6, 2011",,"I got these headphones to replace the dying Bose QC 2 headphones I got used from my parents.  I have been looking for wireless headphones for a long time, but all the ones I could find got fairly negative reviews.  When I discovered these, I had to get them.  Overall, I'm very impressed.The Pros: - Comfortable.  These headphones are very comfortable.  They are a bit warmer on my ears than my Bose, but I got used to it.  The padding around the ears is very soft.  It seems to me, though, that the padding on the top of the head is a different material and is softer. - Great sound.  I'm not sure how sensitive I am to sound quality, but to me these headphones offer fantastic sound.  There are also two options to change the sound quality - Bass and Surround Sound.  The surround sound mode definitely changes how things sound, but I wouldn't say it enhances the listening experience.  I normally leave both modes off, and occasionally turn on the bass. - Fast charge.  After several hours of use, these headphones take less that 30 minutes to charge. - Volume controls on headphones.  The biggest gripe about my Bose was the lack of on-headphone volume controls.  The volume controls on the RS 170 are a bit difficult to control without looking at them, but I got used to it pretty quickly. - Passive noise reduction.  These headphones cut out way more sound than my Bose (active noise cancelling) headphones ever did, which is an unexpected surprise.  I have some quite annoying and loud neighbors, and I can barely hear them at all with these headphones on, even without sound.  Once the sound is turned on, I can't hear them at all. - Range.  I've only used these in my small apartment, but when 20ft away, there is no noticeable decay in sound quality.  I imagine the range on these things is even better.The Cons: - Difficult to adjust.  The headband is hard to adjust, but as I only needed to adjust it once, it isn't a big problem. - High pitch noise.  These headphones emit a high-pitched noise when playing any sound.  It only occurs when sound is actually coming through the headphones.  I only noticed it right after whatever I was listening to went silent.  However, if you turn up the volume on whatever is driving the headphones, and turn down the volume on the headphones, the intensity of the sound decreases to the point where it is inaudible. - Turning them on.  I don't understand why Sennheiser decided not to have these headphones automatically turn on when you take them off the charging stand.  However, while you do have to turn on both the transmitter and headphones, it is not really that difficult to do.  I find that, as my hands are already near the charging stand to pick up the headphones, hitting the power button on the stand is not a nuisance.  Also, I hold the headphones by the ear pieces to put them on, so I just hit the power button on the headphones when I put them on.  I've gotten it down to one fluid motion now.About the delay: I have never tried listening to these headphones at the same time as the sound is coming through speakers, so I can't speak to the delay issue many other reviewers mentioned.  However, when used by themselves, there is no perceptible delay with these headphones.Overall Impressions:  These are outstanding headphones.  The only cons are either a non-issue or are easily rectified.  I would highly recommend these to anyone whose looking for quality wireless headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding Headphones

It wasn't noticeable when listening to music but very noticeable and annoying during quiet parts of songs or movies and when wearing the phones without audio playing. The buzzing only ceased when I turned off the transmitter so I assume it was some sort of interference problem.

Surprisingly, when I walk into my kitchen which is only 20 feet away the reception completely dies. This new Kleer tech doesn't seem to handle walls as well as the older RS120 did.

    ","These headphones are the first of their kind for me. I have never bought over the ears headphones so I cannot compare it to other headphones within its range. I own a Etymotic pair of earbuds I bought years ago, which I thought were excellent, but that's it.Before I give my review, I would like to pay homage to Amazon.com for making this purchase an even better deal that it seemed. I originally got these for $240, but I have since noticed that the pricehas dipped to $170. After a phone call that required a supervisor, the $70 difference was credited to my account. Top of the line service for a top of the line retailer.Previously, the cheapest price I have found for the RS170 was $200 at Crutchfield (but I don't trust them give the myriad negative reviews).Now onto the headphones.I was looking for: A comfortable pair of-preferably wireless-headphones primarily to (1) Watch TV with at night when the wife is asleep and (2) for immersive PS3 gaming.I personally do not care much for loudness as much as I care for crisp, clean sounds being produced.These headphones are unbelievable. Are there better headphones out there? Absolutely, but seriously doubt it within the $200 range. The sounds produced areso clean, so rich, so vibrant, may it simply be a conversation, bullets flying all over the place or an orchestral piece. While playing Uncharted 3, the beautiful soundtrack was almost leaping off the screen for me.The build of the headphones is impressive. Plastic yes, but sturdy and looks valuable. These are by no means cheap looking. Very comfortable as well.Other reviewers have mainly complained about three things (1) Wireless interference. I have not had the wireless feature affect any of my household appliances, yet. I never lost the internet signal.(2) The ""Surround Sound"" button doesn't really function. I personally DO feel the ""Surround Sound"" feature to be adding a difference to the listening experience, especially in gaming. (3) The location of the controls on the headset. Seriously, I have never had to take the headphones off to adjust anything on it. No learning curve. As long as you know where the buttons are generally located, the controls will be obvious. There is a tiny engraving on the power button between the + and - volume buttons, making it very easy to 'feel' where you are. I do not imagine users to constantly play with the other two buttons, the Surround Sound and Bass buttons, but again, once you know where all the buttons are, you will not need to take the headphones off.For anybody on the fence, for the current price of $170 (mind you, I wasn't going to return these for $240), this is an absolute bargain. This is probably my first ever 5 star review.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon makes the experience better!

    ",Bought the head set for listening to TV. Sound quality is fine however the controls are not use friendly at all since you can't distinguish which buttons you are pressing while the headphones are on your head.you can't feel where the buttons are or tell one from another.I have an earlier model that has better buttons which you can turn one way for increasing volume and the other way reduce it.This headphones have no noise interfering that the analog version suffered from so this is a positive. But when spending this much on headphones you expect that more consideration for the usability would have been given.

Takes a long time to charge, and a big hassle overall. I don't use the base charger at all now after trying it for a couple of days. Swapping batteries is much easier.I love this headphone, very good sound. Also very comfortable.Con:There is one glaring problem. Quote from another review:""The other annoying problem is once you turn off the headset, or turn off the input device at the transmitter, the system reverts to standby mode within 5 minutes.

Most annoying ""feature"" that is actually trash and decreases ease of use big time.

Easy to use and provide a surround sound like experience. Like any headphones they do get a little uncomfortable after wearing them for too long.  But they don't bother me much unless I want to lay down. The one downside is the controls on the side are hard to use without taking the headphones off. But I rarely need to change volume anyway.

The store manager suggested a ""piggyback cable"" between receiver & DVD player & connecting RS 170 to cable. This works great. Next was trying to figure out how to get the HDR 170 headphone I purchased for my wife working, which was another major event. I still don't understand the process of using both headphones to watch DVD together. If/when you turn off headphones, they revert to ""default"", or single use.

    ","The sound is good and they're reasonably comfortable.User interface is reasonably good, although it's sometimes a little annoying that the tower goes off if the headphones are off for a while... not even sure how long it takes.  I suppose you could just leave the headphones on when not in use.  Otherwise you'll have to walk back to the tower to turn it on.The range seemed great at first but it's actually not good enough to use throughout all areas of a normal sized house unless the transmitter is right in the middle of the house, perhaps.  That will often not be the case, though, since the transmitter must be close to the audio source.  And for whatever reason, the source might be on one side of your house.  I find that the signal starts to drop intermittently at about 40 feet under normal conditions -- and normal conditions in most houses involve walls and corners, etc, and maybe even a closed door sometimes.The headphones do often interfere with my laptop's wireless internet signal, especially if I am near my laptop.

    ","My wife's hearing is not what it used to be. After some research we got these so we can watch tv together. The headphones work out great for us. Our only problem was hooking them up to our AVR/TV system so that we can watch together. If we plug them into the front of the AVR then the speakers turn off and I can't hear. There is no place on the back of our AVR to plug them in. We finally plugged them into our sat tv box. Now we can watch tv together. If I am not watching she can mute the sound on the AVR and still get sound through the headphones. The only problem is when watching DVD's or Roku.

    ","I've had these head phones for a few months now, and I'm generally impressed with them.Easily the thing I love most about these headphones are their clarity.  I've had experience with various analog wireless audio products at at my job, and all the products have suffered from noisy channels and sub par audio quality.  These are digital, so I don't have to worry about variable sound quality.  These always have great quality.  Either you hear great sound or the signal drops completely and you hear nothing.The range on these things is pretty good.  When I first got them, I tested them out in an office with lots of walls and metal door frames.  I was able to get about 50-55 feet while moving before the sound cut out.  I was able to get up to around 70 if I stood still.These headphones also reproduce bass very well.  When I showed these off to my coworkers, they were amazed how much it seemed to put out (even more than some less scrupulous women).I also like that these come with all the necessary cables and adapters.  It's nice to know they're thinking about the consumer on this one.  You're able to just hook this thing up right out of the box with no last-minute rushes to Best Buy or Radio Shack to buy randomly overpriced parts.The charger is nice for this unit.  Easy to use and seems to charge fairly fast.  The battery life on these things is pretty impressive.  I can go days without recharging them.While the unit is great, it's not without its faults. Particularly I find the auto off function irritating.  If you don't have an audio signal going to it (like if you turn off your receiver or TV), then it'll turn off after a few minutes.  It's not a huge annoyance, but I does kinda bother me when I have to get my lazy butt off the couch after getting comfortable because it turned off and I didn't notice.The headphones do occasionally hurt the backs of my ears if I don't tilt them at just the right angle.  It might be because I have slightly larger ears than normal, but it still is a strain when sitting for long periods of time.Although the volume control on the headphones is nice, I wish they had positioned the buttons better.  The power button is between the up and down volumes, making sightless operation kind of hard.  The Up volume button is big and easy to use by touch alone, but I often find myself taking off the headphones to take the volume down.  if they had separated them from the other buttons it would have been perfect.Overall a great product.

I have used Sony headsets in the past, but I used to always get static and end up shifting my position on the couch to try and get a clear signal. These headphones not only avoid static completely, but I am free to move anywhere in my entire house without any interference or background noise.Pros:1) Excellent sound quality.2) Comfortable to wear for extended periods (with pads on the headband as well).3) Battery has lasted an entire day for me (and advertises approximately 24 hours).4) Has an extremely far range and the signal transmits through walls without interference.5) You can add additional headsets to one base station.6) These are closed headphones so they do a fairly good job of blocking out outside noise. (I have a very loud air conditioning unit near my television, and I have to listen hard to notice the air conditioning noise while watching TV with these headphones). This also means they do a decent job of insulating the noise from the TV so you do not disturb the family while watching movies late at night.Cons:1) The base station only has a 3.5mm ANALOG audio in. (This may be a problem if your TV only has optical/digital audio out. In that case, you will need to buy an additional converter box.)2) You can only charge one headset at a time if you use multiple headsets with one base station.Note: Others have found the controls on the headset difficult to use, but I have not experienced that problem. The power button has a noticeable indention, with volume up located directly above and volume down directly below.Note: Others have complained about having to turn the power on at both the base station and the headphones.

    ","I was looking for headphones for casual home AVS use with the following requirements:  * connection via standard audio out or digital audio out  * wireless digital transmission with good signal strength  * good audio quality for AVS, but not necessarily audiophile perfection  * convenient rechargable design  * comfortable over-ear designThe RS-170's meet all these criteria and I am very happy with them.  They connect via standard audio out and a fairly complete collection of connector adaptors is included as are a collection of AC power connector adaptors for various countries.There is no provision for connecting to digital audio out to these headphones, but that is OK by me.  To use digital audio out, additional circuitry for decoding, converting and conditioning (Dolby, DTS support, etc) the digital audio signal would be needed in the base unit.  This would undoubtedly add significantly to the product cost.  As an aside, Sony made headphones with digital audio input, but I see that product has been discontinued - maybe not enough demand for it.These wireless headphones communicate digitally in the 2.4-2.8 GHz band. Because they are digital, there is no annoying hiss commonly heard in analog wireless headphones.  Most home LANs operate at 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz but I have not seen any interference between these headphones and devices on my network operating in the 2.4 GHz band.  The RS-170's auto select the actual operating frequency in the 2.4-2.8 band is it is not suprising that they play nicely with LANs (as a side note, you can and probably should specifically select the LAN operating channels in your router to help avoid conflcts - if for no other reason than to avoid conflicts with your neighbors' networks).  Sennheiser's choice of using 2.4-2.8 rather than the 5.0 GHz or 900 MHz bands is a good compromise since the higher the frequency, the more limited the transmission range.  These seem to work for me to up to a distance of about 40 feet through several wall without any dropouts and because they are digital there is absolutely no hiss (in analog headphones hiss increases with distance from the transmitter).  This is perfect for me since I don't need a range of more than about 20 feet.The sound quality of these headphones is in my opinion consistent with their price and good enough for me.  They sound good for most audio material but the true audiophile would probably look elsewhere (and would probably not want wireless headphones anyway).  But if you are in the ""99%"", not the ""1%"" (however you want to define it) these are probably more than adequate sound quality for you.The RS-170 base/transmitter unit is also a charging station for the headphones.  Whenever the headphones are placed back on the base unit they automatically recharge.  This is very convenient.  The two included rechargeable batteries are installed into one of the headphone earpieces - nice touch that the batteries are included.The over-ear design helps reduce ambient sounds (like a washing machine or dishwasher).  Does it absolutely cut out or cancel all ambient sound?  No.  These are not noise-cancelling devices and that's OK by me.So why are these ""almost"" perfect for my needs?  As others have noted, the controls on the headphones are a little inconvenient to access and are not easily distinguishable by touch alone.  The headphones have volume up and down buttons on them, but I always have to take them off in order to locate the buttons and make volume adjustments.  If I try this while wearing them I am just as likely to hit the on/off button, the surround-sound button of the bass-boost button.  Most important, the power on/off button is sandwiched between the volume up and down buttons making it easy to turn off the headphones while trying to adjust the volume without looking.  I think more ergonomic and functional controls could have been designed.  Nevertheless, I am willing to live with this inconvenience since I don't need to make adjustments very often.One other design feature that could be better is the power controls.  You need to turn the base/transmitter on/off using a switch on the base unit and you need to turn the headphones on/off using a switch on the headphones.  I would prefer a base unit design that is always ON and in standby mode and that automatically switches from standby to operating mode whenever the headphones are switched ON/OFF.  It would also be possible to have a headphone design that automatically turns itself ON when the headphones are taken off the base unit and turn OFF whenever they are returned to the base unit (although admittedly there might be some issues when several sets of headphones are used with one base unit).Finally, a word about sound synchronization.  A number of posts complain of a synchronization problem between speaker and headphone sound.  All my AVS component outputs are HDMI and they all connect into my Samsung Smart TV.  I feed the digital audio OUT from the TV into my audio receiver and I feed the analog audio OUT from my TV to the RS-170 base unit.  For me there are no noticeable sync issues between the headphones, speakers or video image.  I think problems are more likely to arise if you connect an output from your audio receiver to the RS-170 base unit.  With my connection scheme, the headphone volume is independent of the speaker volume so I only have to mute the audio receiver to use the headphones without the speakers on - I don't often have to make headphone volume adjustments.All in all, I'm very pleased with these headphones.  They are a bit high in price but in this case, in my opinion, you get what you pay for.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for my needs, almost..."

    ","I bought these phones for TV viewing by my wife who is moderately hard of hearing. They replaced an analog pair of Sennheisers that served her well for several years, but she was bothered by a hiss that is apparently endemic to analog phones. This digital model is doing the job. High quality clean hiss free sound, but ...1. Maximum volume was a little too low unless I cranked up the TV to a volume level that was a bit too high for me. This had not been a problem with the analog phones. I solved it by buying a separate ""Rolls"" headphone amplifier. That did the trick, but added nearly 50 bucks to the deal.2. Operation of the digital phones was in some respects a step backward from the older analog pair. It's discussed in other reviews, but taking the phones off the cradle and putting them into action on this newer digital set requires two button pushes -- one on the base unit and one on the headset. Not a big deal, but slightly annoying, and a couple of additional steps not required by the analog model.3. The headset has several buttons -- the most important being the volume control. The older analog phones had a little ribbed wheel that was easy to turn while wearing the headset, but could sometimes be moved unintentionally if the user leaned too far back in the chair. Sennheiser remedied this by having two volume push buttons. They are not marked with a tactile bump or special shape, so it's necessary to remove the phones, change the volume, and then put them back on to see if you got it right. What a pain in the a**! Sennheiser, what were you thinking?If I had it to do all over I would probably buy these again, but I would also give the competition a closer look.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good -- But With Important Limitations

306,"on February 10, 2013",,"I bought these headphones to replace my old RS 130's.First let me say that these phones are being used in a work environment that has large machinery in it and consequentially moderate noise, requiring earplug use.  The 170's are not meant to reduce noise, however, they do keep out some noise and so they sound very good.  As for signal loss, I can place the sending unit behind a folding door, with machinery between the unit and headphones and still get reception (with no or VERY little loss) up to over 130' away.  In the open with line of sight I get over 200' even with electrical equipment nearby.  I'm very satisfied with these results.  For my use, the bass boost works well, adding some bass but not overpoweringly so.  The surround is not so effective, it seems to add an echo effect for me, I leave it off.My only major complaint is stated by others also.  The control buttons on the headset are difficult to find when wearing them.  Some form of dimple on the volume buttons would help a lot.I would recommend this unit for factory use if your employer allows it.I would have given this a 4.75 star rating if I could for the control buttons, but otherwise I feel it is deserving of 5 stars.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones In Factory Work Setting

    ","If you are looking for a set of headphones that a will amaze you, then look no further.  Sennheiser has the answer to your TV hearing problem.  My wife was trying to make me deaf as she watched TV.  She could not hear many of the words and she would always ask me, ""What did they say.""  I knew that I needed to find a quality set of headphones that would allow her to hear the TV (at a reasonable volume) and also allow me to lower the volume at the TV set.  After much research I purchased this particular model for several reasons.1. I like the quality of German-made products.2. These headphone are very soft and comfortable to wear, however, after three hours of  wearing them, you will need to be lift them off the head for a moment or two.3. You can link up to four headphones and the charge up quickly, even after six hours of  usage.4. The sound quality is excellent and the SRS is acceptable.  It gives you the simulation of  sound coming from all directions.  My wife says that she can hear water running or people  walking on gravel, as these are low sounds that she cannot hear otherwise.  Our ONLY dislike is the volume control buttons.  It is difficult to adjust levels while wearing the headphones (buttons are too small).  Sennheiser could have improved this by a simple dial-type volume control that would allow easy adjust without taking the headphones off.  My wife loves these headphones and as soon as I can afford it, I will purchase the HDR-170 headphones to compliment this SR-170 system.D.Z.

I've never had expensive headphones so I can't compare them to another set, but these things sound incredible!!

    ","I've now had a month with the RS170 unit.  I hope this review is helpful.I live in a small NYC apartment, and prefer to watch TV/movies and listen to music with headphones so as not to disturb neighbors.  I had been using a wired sony set which was great, but I wanted to kill the wire.  I have a Sony KBR LCD TV with Denon AVR sound system.I got the RS170 and charged them up overnight.  I didnt need the manual except to figure out how to put in the batteries.  Very simple once you know how.The sound quality is excellent, certainly for watching TV/movies.  With them on, no sound escapes.  I detect absolutely no hiss or static, and no cutoffs (of course my apt is only 500sq/ft). It is NICE to be able to move about the apartment and keep listening sans cord.  The bass and surround features are nice for movies. They are comfortable and dont 'press' on your head like a vice.  I've worn them thru 3-4 movies (>6 hours) with no discomfort.  Charge seems to last at least a day.My only cons (minus one star) are:  1) they really should have put some nubbins on the + and - sound buttons as they are hard to find when wearing the headset.  Fortunately I adjust volume via the Denon unit so this isnt really an issue, but it is definitely an oversight on Sennheiser's part.  And, 2) the earmuffs do not adjust up or down (I was quite surprised at this) like almost all other earphones.  I have a round head, so they fit just fine, but if you have an oblong head, the earmuffs might not reach down far enough (i.e., you can't 'extend' them or push them 'in' towards the headband).  If concerned, you might want to try on at a store.But, I am very happy with my purchase - the RS170 perfectly meet my needs and expectations.  I highly recommend them if your needs are similar to mine.** Review Edit/Update:  I have now realized that the earmuffs DO in fact adjust in/outward.  I hadnt pulled hard enough.

343,"on December 24, 2011",,"Sennheiser RS 170 Digital Wireless Headphone with Dynamic Bass and Surround SoundI have owned many different brands of wireless headphones over the years and they were OK at best.(Sony, JVC, others) When looking at buying a new set, I was pleasantly surprised the new technology had discovered a way that didn't hiss and make static noise when you turned your head in certain directionsThese Sennheister RS 170 sound great!... clear as a bell, no distortion and no hiss between songs and a true joy to listen to all types of music.The headphone controls are not easy to feel when you are wearing them, but you can feel the center switch, (the switch to mute or on,off).  If they would design the buttons with more predominant touch feel surface, or just spaced them a bit, it would be easier to adjust while wearing.this is not a issue that should keep you from buying them.

    ","These headphones are absolutely amazing. The sound quality is head and shoulders above any others I have owned, wired or wireless. These are extremely comfortable, although their large size may make listening to music in bed a bit awkward. They have great range, even through walls. If they ever do cut out, just stand still for a moment and the sound will return within a few seconds. As mentioned before, the sound quality is unbelievable for wireless. The surround sound simulation is really what set these apart for me. Every now and then, a particular song or two may sound bit strange with the surround sound or bass enhancement features, however, this is rare and can be remedied simply by disabling the feature. My only major gripes are with the volume control buttons and power indication light on the headset. If you enjoy listening to music or watching tv in the dark, you may want to consider placing a small piece of dark tape over the power light; the blinking can get annoying. The volume control buttons are located on either side of the power button and are hard to distinguish without looking. This, however, can be remedied by attatching some sort of raised surface, such as an additional layer of rubber, to the buttons. As a whole, I would absolutely recommend this product. If you can find a good deal like I did (about $250 or less), these are a great buy or anyone who wants studio quality without breaking the bank.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, some very minor flaws"

Unfortunately, Sennheiser did not retain the simplicity of use on these new headphones.  The setup is strange, requiring ""pairing"", similarly to Bluetooth.  And, to top this off, the system defaults to only one headphone per transmitter (it is possible to use more).  Why would they want to do this?????

    ","I have had two sets of these Sennheiser headphones for more than 4 months and would highly recommend.  We have been longtime users of Sony wireless headphones and were content with those, but the sound quality had begun to deteriorate (or our expectations got a little higher.)  I've been happy with other Sennheiser equipment, so I was willing to make the higher end investment when replacing the Sony headphones.  These are well worth the extra money when we consider how regularly they are used.I bought one pair for our main HD tv and the set works very well. The sound quality is perfect and the ear cups really block out external noise and voices (sometimes to my wife's frustration.)  After a week, I bought a second set for the computer/gaming room after I was reassured by vendor support that there wouldn't be mixing of the two signals.  The transmitter bases are only a few feet apart and separated by a wall, but there have been absolutely no crossed signals or interference between the two sets of headphones when they are both being used.  The first set is used in our front room for TV and BluRay viewing.  The second set is used for computer/PS3/music and are regularly used when working out on the stairmaster with excellent results and rugged usage. The signal range is good but is lost when you are more than a few rooms away from the base.PROS:- stylish looking black base and headphones- perfect signal strength with no static (either receives signal or doesn't)- no mixed or bleeding signals from two sets of headphones- rechargeable battery life is good and lasts more than a day, when you just leave them on- easy to hang the headset over the base for charging without any tiresome jiggling for a perfect fit (like our previous Sony headphones)- headset fits comfortably when working out or just sitting on the couch- plug and play setup with no tuning required to get signalCONS:- power/volume controls on headset are not intuitive and take a little bit of familiarity- not cheap, but worth it",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones.

On the headphones there's three buttons all in a row, touching, close to flush with the unit, with very little tactile feedback between them.  The first is lower volume, the middle one is power (!), and the third is raise volume.  For such a common operation, this is an amazingly difficult and error-prone arrangement.

Why buttons at all -- why didn't they just use a wheel like in their older models?  A wheel is much easier and less error-prone.

    ","What can you say about Sennheiser, they are a proven quality audio brand. The RS170 is the 6th generation of wireless radio transmitted headphones. The first versions (rs110-rs140) had a little buzz with the sound but was not that bad. On these RS170 there is no loss of audio quality, no buzz. Its almost perfect. Keep in mind I strictly listen to music and these work great for me. These work great with my situation, I work in a architectural studio in where I have to move around a lot making models and it is amazing not tripping over my cord.Overall easy to set up just plug in and play, takes about 2 second to sink with the headphones. The soft leather padding is a very nice touch, very comfortable for long periods of time and is able to block out most other sound in the room. The extra bass feature sounds nice and is not distorted. Surround Sound is ok for music but I only use it if I am watching movies because it sound good for being a simulated SS. Battery life is amazing... I have never ran the battery out yet and its been 3 months of constant listening.If I were to pick one thing that I dont like is the buttons on the headphones.

    ","I have 3 issues with the product that make me sorry I bought it.First, after having been a satisfied Sennheiser RS140 user for years, I ordered the RS170 after the old headphone plastic band broke.  However, I found that the RS170 uses a different technology which results in a very annoying echo when the TV internal speakers are on.  If I mute the TV, the echo stops.  If I press the around-the-ear cups tightly against my head, the echo stops.  I have not been able to find a combination of earphone volume and tv volume that stops the echo but allows other non-headphone viewers to listen.  I would guess the problem is that the KLEER technology used in the RS170 delays the wireless signal enough to make echo noticeable, much like bluetooth speakers can.Secondly, the need to power on the RS170 transmitter with each use, and then subsequently remove/power-on/pair the headphones are extra steps that were not required with my old model.  With that, I just picked up the headphones and put them on my head.  Both transmitter and headphones powered on automatically.  And because the transmitter is so light in weight, it takes two hands to power it on;  one to steady the stand to keep it from moving and one to find/push the power on button.  I would like a 'permanent power on' option, perhaps a slide switch.And finally, I know the RS140 head phone volume control wheel sometimes caused an inadvertent change in volume if the back on the headphone came in contact with the seat back.  However, the new design of 3 small up/off/down buttons which are very close together makes it difficult to be sure of which to press without taking the headphone off and looking.  A small gap between the buttons is needed to be able to distinguish between functions.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Echo and other problems.  Sorry I bought.

445,"on February 22, 2011",,"At the age of 65, my hearing has really dropped off in recent years.  A a result I had been turning up the volume on the TV more and more, which was becoming a serious problem for my wife, who has good hearing.  But even increasing the volume did not allow me to hear everything being said on TV.  So after some research, I made the investment in the RS170.  I chose the over-ear headphones because I don't like earbuds.  Great decision.  Now I hear everything being said on TV and my wife can enjoy the TV at a normal volume.  The range is fantastic.  I hear perfectly in any area of our two-storey house.  Controls are a bit tricky while wearing the headphones, so I just take them off to make adjustments -- a small price.  And I only have to adjust the volume once per TV show.  The sound quality is excellent -- terrific for music.  A very minor problem is a little heat around the ears.  Since we're TV/TiVo  junkies, we watch four to five consecutive hours on weekends. I just take the headphones off for a minute between shows and heat no longer is a problem.  Very easy to set up -- didn't have to use the install CD.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect.

    ","Price increased from $169.95 to $279.95 in 3 months.  That's a 39% increase!I bought 2 sets with transmitter and charging base in October 2011 and they were worth the price then.

    ","As a point of reference I have owned the 580s and the 280s. The 580s I loved though perhaps a bit high on the mid bass.  These sound worse than the 280s.  The tin/""Im cupping both of my hands together like im holding a ball and talking into it"" is really bad.  I know. Your probably reading this thinking no way.  Your source is bad.  You don't have the attenuation on the right setting. You havent listened to them long enough. You haven't tried it with the bass feature on....I have. You have the surround setting on (I dont) They just dont sound good.Many hear something with good highs,hear the crispness of something, and immediately identify it with good sound.  Dont get me wrong: For movie dialogue these will do great.  But there is no bass.  No bass whatsoever. Maybe once and a while if the soundtrack has it it will come forward, but the raspy/""Im cupping my hands together in a ball and talking into them"" is very noticeable on these cans. if your looking for a nice pair of headset for movie dialogue, than these will not disappoint.  But in terms of audiophile headphones....Ill just put it this way:  The 7 dollar Philip headphones that I own are preferred to these for listening to music.Then you might ask: Why all these positive reviews. Maybe your just a picky buyer...Granted! :)  I am a picky buyer, but I am also reviewing them from an audiophile perspective. Its important to keep perspective in mind when reading headphone reviews. The majority of these reviews are saying outstanding....Its because this isn't marketed for music. Its being marked for wireless headphones, of which the primary aim is to deliver clear crisp audio without any cords, which is exactly what these do. But while crisp may be a good thing for the audience these are being marketed to, its not a good thing for someone who gets on Amazon and says "" I want to find an amazing pair of audiophile headphones with good highs, mids and lows for music listening. Hey these have great reviews.""  If thats what your looking for these will disappoint you more than the 280s and no, they are nothing like the 580s. Nothing at all. (for those without any reference to the 280s simply take your hand and cup them together like your holding a baseball and talk into them...or empty a can of soup and talk into the can...that may be a better analogy. Sorry for being cyinical.... I simply had high expectations for these....And its not to say the other reviewers on here are incorrect either....It is to say that if your an audiophile reading this page you have to keep in mind that these are aimed at a different crowed. People of this crowed are hearing crispness, are happy with the wireless technology and are calling it good.  But these are 100% not even remotely close to the 580s...and yes even the popular philip earbuds for under 7 dollars on amazon have a better frequency response with lows than these.  Im looking at the tower right now and bass is on while writing this....Idea: There are bluetooth transmitters out there. Sure you can only go 30 ft from the TV, but thats still a lot.  You hook up a 3.5mm male rca adapter from the tv to a bluetooth receiver, and then power on your blue-tooth headphones and you have established the exact same thing with better sound quality for the same price or a little more or less depending on what you want.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"No Bass, not audiophile quality: More ""tinny"" sounding than the 280s"

    ","I've been using the Sennheiser RS 170s for a little over a month now, and while they generally meet my needs, there are a few caveats. First, the positives: these have to be some of the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn - they're lightweight, the earcups are large and the headband is snug without being too tight. Given the transmitter's limited hookup options, integrating the RS 170 into an existing home theater setup is a breeze. Sound quality is decent, and range is far better than I'd expect - I was able to get about 80 feet away before the signal broke up, and there were plenty of walls and obstacles in the way to further complicate things.Now for the negatives: these are still wireless headphones. While the sound quality is acceptable, don't expect anything on par with your reference wired cans (a fact that's a tad disappointing given the hype and the high price point). Seeing as these will only accept an analog input, hooking them up to anything other than a home theater receiver's headphone output will probably prove to be a huge pain. Also of note - the RS 170s are highly sensitive to changes in the level of the input signal. Every time I change the audio source, I find myself having to rebalance volume levels on both my AVR and the headset itself. If the RS 170's transmitter came equipped with a Toslink input, getting a line-level input into the unit would have been greatly simplified, and it would be far easier to enjoy the unit with modern components like game consoles, DVD and Blu-Ray players. While the virtual surround and bass boost functions are nice, your mileage may vary - I ended up turning both off as they seemed to muddy most program material.If you're looking for a simple, no-frills wireless solution for occasional non-reference listening, the RS 170 system should fit the bill nicely. However, in the last year or so, enough other contenders have entered the marketplace that you may want to do a little research before making your purchase.

    ","I just upgraded to a Samsung LED UN46D8000YF 46 inch 3D HDTV and for wireless headset audio, the TV feeds an Atlantic Technology Audio Transmitter which in turn wirelessly feeds this Sennheiser RS 170 wireless headset via an Atlantic Technology Audio Receiver. I can mute the TV and listen via the headset, which my wife appreciates. And all of it works like a dream! The headset works as advertised and is very comfortable to wear. The buttons on the headset are set up such that you have to take the headset off to make changes, but that does not happen often enough to be any real hassle. The audio is clear and crisp, and the charging stand is so easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!

    ","I usually use skullcandy hesh 2 headphones but I wanted a wireless pair to use with my TV because I live in an apartment and I don't want to disturb my neighbors with movies at night. I figured I'd get sennheiser rs wireless headphones after I did a lot of research and everything said to get digital headphones to avoid static and interference. Well, sennheiser is supposed to be a great brand as far as I know and the reviews all looked good so I sprung for the 170 with surround sound and bass boost over the 160 without it.For nearly $200 I expected to hear a big difference between these and my hesh 2's that only cost me $30. The sennheisers buzz constantly and whenever the movie or TV show quiets down it's very noticeable. I flipped the switch on the charging transmitter thing from 8 to 0 and now the buzz is much less noticeable, but it's still there faintly, slowly driving me insane. I can tolerate it, but for the price of these headphones I don't feel you should have to tolerate anything like that. I'll give them some leeway since wireless headphones appear to be an imperfect technology.I can use them. I like that I can hear my TV over my air conditioner when I use these, but I can still very clearly hear the a/c with these on, they don't block sound out, just a heads up. I like that they're wireless, but if you're looking for sound quality I don't think these are your best bet. You could buy a long cable and just plug in some wired headphones and get much better sound quality for a whole lot less money. I find myself wandering from room to room listening to my TV with these and then I realize I'm not even watching the TV show I'm listening to, but it's nice to be able to make dinner and still hear my TV so that's a bonus IMO.Also, They are bit too big for me so if I move my head around they slide off and let in a lot of external sounds because they aren't tight enough to block it out which isn't ideal, but I think I have a slightly small head so probably not an issue for most people, but if you're built small these might slide around on you.Update: I moved the headphone dock/transmitter about 5 feet away from my roku and it hasn't dropped the sound at all since. I still don't think it's some incredible sound quality experience, but at least it's not dropping sound all the time anymore.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality doesn't justify the price but they work okay

I can walk awaw from the televsion with the headphones into a different room or even the second floor and still hear the sound.  Amazon had the best price and I had them within two days.

    ","The sound of the RS 170 headphones is good quality. It's not as surround sound as you might think with a surround sound button. My cheap Sony's had better quality but they didn't last long at all. The big problem with the RS 170 is the button controls. They lined 5 buttons lined up in a row. You don't know if you are pressing volume up/down, headphones off, surround sound or bass. It's very frustrating when trying to readjust the headphones to whatever you are watching. Based on that, and it is a biggie, and the fact that headphones for this price should sound better, I can only give it three stars.

I have hoped I would get used to it, but man, it's annoying....The base unit shuts itself off when no signal is detected, but it does NOT turn itself back on when a signal returns.  This woudl be perfectly understandable if the base was running under battery power, but it has this ridiculous ""power saving feature"" even with it is running off of AC.  The only way to wake up the headphones is to turn power on at the base unit. Sennheiser claims this ""energy saving feature"" is required by law.  Knowing government, I'd almost believe that.  But I don't know of any other unit that does this - just Senheisers...My solution is laughable.  I have relocated the base unit next to where I work.

I have to be in the immediate vicinity of the transmitter, or everything breaks up...so for the money I paid for these, they are pretty unimpressive.

Although Infrared (IR) connectivity provided a better and higher sound fidelity - but you have to be in the line of sight, you can't move around or can't turn your head.

582,"on December 1, 2014",,"I received these in a timely manner.  Transit packaging was secure and nothing was broken or missing.  The ""manual"" that comes with it is actually a DVD that is inserted into a quick start guide.  The printed guide itself is quite minimalist.  A picture on each page with one sentence of direction printed in about 50 languages.  Needless to say, set up was a bit of trial and error.  I haven't had time to sit down and watch a DVD.  I guess I would just have preferred the directions be given in writing.Out of the box, I set the head set on the tower to charge.  I think the manual said it should charge for about 16 hours, but the charging light went out after about an hour.  I believe in the end that I charged the headset for about 6 hours before using them that night in bed.  My purpose for this purchase was so that I could watch tv in the evening without disturbing my tenant.The system looks very elegant.  The headset itself is comfortable.  The parts are all plastic of course, and with that, I felt they were a bit cheap in construction given the price of these headphones.  The head set is comfortable, and with snug adjustment, I was able to move around a bit without their falling off my head.  I was even comfortable when I eventually laid on my side in bed while watching tv.I felt the sound quality was good as I was better able to hear the sound from the programs I was watching.  But I must say, I don't know how these would be for serious music listening.  Since the plastic feels so flimsy, I can't imagine a broad variation of sounds be carried over these headphones, as that would be missing much of the music.Given this muddy review so far and the fact that I've only had them for a week,  I would still recommend them if you're in the market for wireless headphones for tv viewing.

    ",If you are looking for a headphone that reproduces excellent sound than you have found your product!  I use it for the nights I want to either watch a movie or play my PS3 and don't want to to sacrifice the sound. I have a new baby in the house and hell to pay if I wake her up!!  lolWhen I play the PS3 it is incredible how good you hear the details of the game.  It is just like hearing it through my Sony surround sound system! Bass is awesome too!!  You can walk all over the house and not miss a thing!  Movies are just as good!  It is very easy to use and almost dummy proof.  The only drawback is after time the headphones do get a little uncomfortable.  I am very satisfied with them!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sound!!

    ","HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  As a night owl with a family, I've been using wireless headphones for about 8 years now, since the earlier days of RF cans.  THIS IS THE BEST OVERALL SET I'VE EVER USED.I've mainly used Sony (3 different models, including the Sony MDRRF970RK 900 MHz Analog RF Wireless Headphone and Sony MDR-DS6000 Wireless Surround Digital 2.4GHz RF) and a few others, including Sharper Image's bluetooth set.The Sennheiser RS 170 has almost all the best features of the others, and nearly none of the problems.RANGE and CLARITY:  Hands down, the most important issue in wireless headphones, and this pair EXCELS way beyond anything I've used.  I get clean signal over 100 feet away, through a brick wall.  I get clear signal while using my microwave (unless I'm standing within 1 foot of it).  Always fast to pick up the signal, with nearly ZERO interruptions in signal after months of use (the Sony DS6000 may edge this pair out for sound quality, but has serious problems with intermittent signal interruptions).SOUND QUALITY:  The second best sounding pair I've ever used.  With bass boost and surround on, this is a VERY PLEASING set of headphones to listen to, particularly for television and movies.  Combined with it's incredible clarity of signal, I've never had any complaints about sound quality with this pair.  The Sony DS6000 does have a slightly more natural feel and a little more depth to the sound, but the signal is not always as clean, so it often sounds a bit worse than the Sennheisers.EASE OF USE/FEATURES:  This set has button controls on the right earcup for power, volume, and to turn on bass boost and surround sound.  The power button is a good and bad thing.  You don't have to worry about the annoying temporary loss of signal that some models have when their auto off switch gets triggered because you moved around.  However, you have to remember to turn them off when you're done.  Fortunately the battery life is very good, so even after leaving them on overnight, I've still been able to get several hours of use out of them.  It should also be mentioned that the buttons are a bit small and close together, but after a little time, I got used to them and had no trouble operating them.  The power button has a contoured on/off icon so you can find it by touch which lets you find the rest by touch as well after you memorize the order they are in.OTHER:  MULTIPLE PAIRS CAN LISTEN TO THE SAME TRANSMITTER!!!! Hallelujah!  I bought an extra set of the headphones as a standalone purchase Sennheiser HDR 170 - Headphones ( ear-cup ) - wireless - radio and now my wife and I can watch TV together after the kids have gone to bed without worrying about waking them up......... THANK YOU SENNHEISER!!!!CONS:  Other than the price being on the upper end of the spectrum, there are only two problems that I can think of.  Small one first - the gap in the padding at the top, where the charging contacts are, gets slightly uncomfortable after an hour or so.  If you make sure to size them one click looser than usual, this will not be a problem.  Second, the lack of input options..... this is a big one and was almost a deal breaker for me when I was researching this purchase.  It ONLY has a 1/8"" inch (standard headphone) input;  no RCA, no optical (?!?).  In this age, not putting an optical input into an audio product at this price range is almost a crime.  I sincerely hope Sennheiser fixes this in the next model upgrade.SUMMARY:  BEST RECEPTION, nearly best sound quality, ONE TRANSMITTER for MULTIPLE HEADPHONES, good (but not great) comfort, could use an optical input, largish price tag (especially if you buy additional headphones).HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST OVERALL SET I'VE EVER USED EVER.

    ","First I'd like to say I have been into home theater for about twelve years. Other than my blu ray player I don't have the best money can buy but it's by any measure a very good system i.e. Oppo BD 83 blu ray player, Toshiba Regza 55 LCD TV, Yamaha RX-V 465 receiver,Infinity speakers.  Because I live in an apartment and have had complaints from neighbors about noise I reluctantly entertained the idea of headphones. So I did some research and decided on the Sennheiser RS 170's.Since I have never owned headphones before the only comparison I can make is to my standing home theater system. Well, let me tell you that I now prefer to watch all my movies with these RS 170 headphones. When I have to watch movies without them because of other viewers I do so reluctantly.  Only if I could play my standing home theater system at theater level volume would it outperform these headphones and mainly only in the bass area. I get a much better experience with these headphones than I do with my regular system at lower volumes.I've been using them with the surround sound and bass boost feature for about three weeks and I am still amazed at the quality of the sound coming out of them. I have to remind myself that I'm not listening to a full blown theater system. I have watched movies with very strong sound codecs like The Dark Knight, Apocalypto and Shooter and I have been blown away by the sound range these headphones are capable of. I actually do not miss my regular system at all and I'm amazed I can say that since I was very reluctant to use headphones to begin with. Now my neighbors are happy and I'm also happy. A great solution.I would have absolutely no hesitation recommendin",5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm A Convert:  Highly Recommended

    ","Pros:- Noise and interference free in a highly RF-active environment (an electronics-heavy office)- Comfortable- Great sound quality, with a bass boost that doesn't totally muddle the sound if you use it- Pretty good range, event through wallsCons:- You have to press the power button on both the phones and the transmitter to restart the system, rather than a tension-driven switch in the head rest turning the phones on when you wear them.  It is a real nuisance.- Auto-shutoff instead of dropping into low-power standby mode means you have to ""reboot"" the system if you leave it for more than about 5 minutes (the manual says 5 minutes to shutoff if the phones are off or out of range, and placing the phones on the charger turns them off)- Even though I followed the manual instructions to ""pair"" the transmitter and phones, it still takes about 30 seconds to ""reboot"" the system and for the pair to establish contact, and the phones to start producing sound outputThose cons are enough to ding two stars for me, because I use these in an office environment where I really just want to be able to take the phones on and off without restarting the system after every meeting.My now deceased Sony IF630Rs behaved exactly how I think such a system should (phones turn on when you wear them, the base doesn't need to be rebooted).  So far, nothing compares to the IF630Rs, even other Sony products (which function as wireless phones ought to, but sound awful). Once they're up and running, the RS 170s sound great, but their usability is really below par considering there are (were) other systems that provide the desired user experience.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound great, usability is not so great"

    ","The headphones have the sound quality I expected (quite good) and the wireless feature is nice. However, there are two annoying bugs that I am a little frustrated with. First, the headphones turn off each time they are docked so that you have to turn on the base station and the headset separately each time you want to listen to them. Second, when the sound is very low or goes silent briefly the headphones ""skip"" a little. This is not a problem for most of my library of music but I notice it when a song is fading out at the end (the headphones will stop playing prematurely once the sound is low enough) or when there is a brief silence in the middle of a track.

    ","My boyfriend usually stays up later than I do, watching TV & movies. We'd both get frustrated because I need the volume low to sleep, he needs it higher to hear. We've gone through 4 different headsets before and he never liked the sound quality, the ease of use, or how they'd fit on his head.

    ","Why does one have to turn off and turn on the device each time? I used to have a Sony Virtual Surround Sound headphones before I bought this. They turn on automatically the moment you put them on your head and off the moment you take them off.Moreover, the on/off buttons for this Sennheiser headphones is located in a very inconvenient location, between the volume up and volume down buttons. So it is very confusing if you turn down the volume or you just turned it off!Sound quality is ok but the surround sound effect does not seem to be working or something, even when you turn on the ""surround"" button.The volume up and down buttons should be ideally like a turn wheel rather than buttons.

    ","Rating it 5 stars due to the fact that got them for less than 200 usd,  now don't get me wrong i'm sure these are some awsome headsets but by paying 300+ for them you are giving away 100 to seenheiser.The sound it's excellent, clear, loud . All you can expect from a top headset. Now the range itsn't that great but i am able to walk around my entire house without interference. So range may not be the best but it's pretty decent and for my usage it's just perfect.Battery life is awsome  it takes a while to charge but once charged  can be used  for 24 hours.  Nice looking, very comfortable and really really light. Now i see other people saying the buttons are not very recogniceable but it's just a matter of time untill you get use to it.Also these headsets are close sound which means that you will be able to listen  to your stuff without having anyone else next to you listening to it.

    ","I use headphones almost all day, specially at night to not bother my family. I watch a lot movies and series and music on my laptop and TV, so I've tried many headphones brands, and Sennheiser is still the best. I first started with a RS120 which I enjoyed for years without losing the signal at any time as I move around my house and my office without interference, but my headphones got a little damage, so I decided to take the step to the RS170 because I figured that the newaudio performance will improve the sound experience.They are lighter and support multiple receivers at the same time, which is very useful when you have devices that shut off the speakers when headphones are connected. Is the most comfortable to wear headphone I've ever used. but I have been a little disappointed compared to RS120 experience:- Maybe it's my imagination, but RS170 seems to have less volume power compare with the RS120.- The buttons on / off and volume adjustment (along with Bass and Surround) are poorly placed.- Is supposed to use a new technique that does not compress the sound, and thought that, would sound even better. I can not compare because my RS 120 are spoiled but I swear the 170 sound like the 120.The Dynamic Bass and surround effect is really noticeable, so I love the new improve.Finally, I'd like to note that sometimes I had to change the frequency in my old RS 120  to avoid interference problems with reception but with the RS 170 no.In conclusion, in my opinion the headphones are still a little bit overpriced, but of course, they still sound better than many competitors.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Ultra sound quality

    ","These are used for two reasons.  1 - when my wife or daughter are using the treadmill and also want to watch TV.  Treadmills are notoriously loud - well at least the one we have is.  These headphones help them hear important dialogue that they would normally miss while treadmilling.  They watch lame shows like Soap Operas and reality TV involving hillbillies and red necks.  2 - I use them when watching cool things like NFL football.  We have two TVs in our living room (no, we're not rich).  During football season I will use the second TV to watch football while my wife and daughter are watching their ""awesome"" shows on the other (and might I add ""bigger"") TV.  They don't want to hear the game and I don't want to hear their hillbillies so it's a perfect solution.The glorious sounds of the NFL are made even more glorious with these headphones.  And if my wife needs to say something to me (usually about the show she's watching) I can pop the headphones off and give her a few seconds of attention... roll my eyes (when she's not looking) and get back to my game.For technical data, see other reviews.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Problem solver

    ","These headphones sound really great and given the digital transmission they always sound great as long as you are within the range limit. They block outside sound quite well and are very comfortable.The parts are mostly plastic so a the build is somewhat cheap. The charging receptacle on the base station has recessed down into the unit. For now it still makes contact with the headphone recharging contacts but I am worried that I might have to do some repair work after a while. I haven not yet had to replace the batteries within the unit but I am glad the are replaceable if I need to do so.I do get disconnected from my WiFi network from time-to-time as a result of the headphones. Not very often, but very irritating if you are in the middle of doing something. Usually I have to turn off the headphones, or dock them, to make my network reconnect. I do understand that the commercial frequency spectrum is limited but regardless it is very irritating when it happens.I do like the that the audio cable is a standard 3.5 mm jack so I can connect devices other than my computer to the base station. The power connector can also be disconnected which makes for easier setup. The blinking status light on the base station is annoying but I can turn it away from my view.Overall I like being cable-less. I can wander around and keep the tunes going with without struggling with audio cables  Ordinarily I could forgive the aforementioned downsides but given the price I would like some kind of resolution for those irritations.Edit: When I had 2.4 GHz WiFi the headphones would frequently disconnect. Since I have switched to 5 GHz WiFi things have been significantly better.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound as long as you can avoid interference

Though I can plug them into the VCR jacks on my Denon receiver I cannot get the digital audio from streamed movies through Apple TV . The only way they currently work is plugged into the jacks on my cable box which works only with cable but not other sources. Perhaps a Blu Ray player might provide conversion of digital audio to the analog required by the wireless headphones.Also, I get a clicking interference between my headphone and the speakers which provide audio for my company.The up/down volumn buttons on the headphone are awkwardly separated by the on/off button without having sufficient feel. The three buttons together feel monolithic.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's OK, but"

I hope this gets fixed in the replacement model.Also regarding user experience, controls on my old RS140 gave tactile feedback, so I could use them with the headset on. Not so with the push-button interface on the earpiece of the RS170. Buttons are small, and you have to take the headset off to be sure you press the right ones.

    ","I bought the Sennheiser RS170 to replace my existing Sennheiser RS130. My previous headsets will very well designed, very comfortable with easy to use controls -  the only problem they had was intermittent static which was very annoying at times. When I saw the new digital wireless headsets I thought great, problem solved and I bought the system. Well the audio is great as advertised and no static BUT did they ever screw up the controls. THey went from a nice easy to use Volumn control wheel to separate + and - buttons with the on/off switch sandwiched in between them. THe original On/Off switch was stand alone and you actually had to move it not push it. I'm now constantly searching for the right button to push and have constantly pushed the on/off switch by mistake. EXTREMELY ANNOYING!

    ","I ordered these Senhheiser HDR 170 after my HDR 140 gave up after more than ten years of daily use watching television.  I was expecting the new 170s to be great based on my experience with the 140s.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.The issue is not sound quality, the sound on the s170 is superb.The problem is with the controls.  This is a perfect example of designers trying to make something look pretty and sleek at the expense of user friendly interface and usability.My old 140s had three controls on the top rear of the right ear phone, nice, relatively large, wheels that were easy to find and easy to use.  Roll the wheel up or down to change the volume.  Another for balance.These easy to find and use controls are gone with the 170s.  Instead there are five, count them, five tiny buttons on the bottom of the right ear piece, all set in a space of about one inch.  Trying to quickly adjust the volume for commercials or other loud passages is impossible.  The little buttons are essentially flush with the case of the ear piece.  Thus just finding the five buttons is difficult much less trying to feel out which one is the volume button.  Oh, and the “OFF” tiny button is BETWEEN the Volume Up and the Volume Down buttons.  How utterly stupid is that?  Did I mention the buttons are tiny.I am truly unhappy and disappointed with these new 170s and will probably return them if I can get my 140s working again.  Someone at Sennheiser needs to take a course in user interface, and Sennheiser needs to boot the cosmetic designers out.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Poorly Designed Controls

    ","Excellent headphones which I enjoy very much. It's almost unbelievable that wireless headphones canproduce such a sound. Watching a HD concert on the TV I almost thoght I was in concert hall.Not only the sound is great, also the outside noise reduction very good.However, the controls of the headphones did not meet my expectations and they do not fit to the overall excellent qualityof the product. The control are positioned very badly forcing the user to remove the headphones in order to increase/decreasethe volume, or activate/deactivate the 3D, or Bass options. Most ridiculous, the on/off button is placed between the volume""+"" and ""-"".",4.0 out of 5 stars,Review for Sennheiser RS 170
1304,"on April 6, 2013",,"I didn't know what to expect from these, but I was expecting a lot given the price. I was disappointed to hear line noise in both cans, clearly audible at any volume level (with either attenuator switch position), and any source, when the volume of a song or movie dipped low or went momentarily silent. Was it interference? I don't know. Sennheiser claimed a defect and said I should send them back, so back they went. I decided I was paying too much for the wireless element, and losing out on quality of sound and build for the speakers and connections. I bought a pair of HD 558s instead, and they sound pretty amazing. Now I'm looking into an amp to drive them, because my laptop headphone port is pitiful. Sennheiser makes a good headphone, but I can't necessarily recommend these, since my one pair were ""defective"" and I had to send them back. While the music was playing, though, they did sound great to my ears, and movies were fun to watch.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Line Noise, Had to return them"

1319,"on December 26, 2010",,I recently purchased this product and am very pleased with it.  Some specific comments:Ease of set-up - straightforward.  Took a few minutes to read and set up to connect 2 headphones to the transmitter.  I did wish they included the manual in the box.  The main manual was on a disk provided.  No big deal.Range - I saw some negative reviews about this.  But I did not see any problems.  My house has 2 floors with a basement.  The transmitter is on one end of the middle floor.  I can go anywhere on the middle floor although it does drop out on/off briefly at the opposite end of this floor.  It also loses contact when I go to the opposite end of the top or bottom floor.  But this goes beyond my expectations....Quality - excellent.  3D surround is very cool.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased

    ","There are many Sennheiser products that are quality products. This reputation prompted me to make a purchase of the RS 170 Digital Wireless Headphones, needed on a very short-notice basis. The headphones were to play a very significant role in our production efforts to impress a client. The headphones made a very dismal showing. Their range is far less than advertised and featured substantial inconsistencies in reception. Obviously, they were a huge disappointment and a costly purchase, considering their complete ineffectiveness. These headphone may work fine within the confines of a room in a modest-sized home, but are rendered practically useless for commercial purposes.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones do not live up to billing

    ","For many years I used a pair of Sennheiser TR-140's.  They were great headphones except for the design of the volume control knob.  Like many users, I used these headphones to watch TV in bed without disturbing my spouse.  On the old model the volume was controlled by a knob that was poorly placed and would always bump against the pillow suddenly turning the volume way up... or way down.When I heard that Sennheiser had finally redesigned the volume control, I was excited to get a new pair.What a disappointment.They are well made, sound great, work well, get great range... all the signs of a quality product.  But there are two glaring problems with these headphones.POWER SWITCH ON TRANSMITTER:  With the old ones, the only power switch was on the headphones.  I just hit the power switch on the headphones and I was good to go.  With the RS-170's there are now two power switches you have to turn on each time you use them.  This means I have to get out of bed and go over to the transmitter (which is plugged into the cable box across the room) and turn the transmitter on... every time I want to use them.  This was not a design improvement.POWER SWITCH / VOLUME CONTROLS ON HEADPHONES:  The buttons on the new model are tiny...  They are all on one side of the headphones... and the Power switch is located in between the volume up and volume down buttons.  On the older model, the power switch was on one side.. the volume control on the other. I don't understand the benefit of putting the power switch in between the tiny volume buttons.  It is really easy to turn them off when you are trying to adjust the volume.I believe Sennheiser would benefit by conducting some market research with the types of customers who really use their products and in a real world environment.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Button design / placement is terrible

    ","If it weren't for Sennheiser's quality control I would have given the RS 170 four stars mostly for sound and range capabilities which are excellent.  Unfortunately, however, Sennheiser's quality control on this product lacks greatly and as a result gets 1.5 stars deducted.The headphone's headband should be flexible but these flexed to the point where the plastic actually separated from each other causing gaps and giving them a very cheap feeling.  Within three months of owning the headphones one of the plastic battery covers which the ear pads attach to broke and as a result now easily fall off and within six months of ownership the batteries stopped charging.As a result of the RS 170's poor quality, in the first six months of owning the headphones I've used them maybe 15 times and for the last six months I haven't used them at all because they are more trouble than they are worth to keep them in one piece and working.For just under $200 I had high hopes for the Sennheiser RS 170s but after about a year of very light use I have to give them only 2.5 stars.

    ","I bought the Sennheiser RS 170 digital, wireless headphone based on the strong ratings of the product posted here, despite a few warnings about echo.  The ""echo"" problem arises when using the headphone while also driving the room loudspeakers.  The sound emitted from the headphone is delayed a bit compared to the sound from the room loudspeakers due to the time it takes to convert the analog sound output to digital and back.  This is a necessary tradeoff for the crystal clear sound this digital headphone provides -- and crystal clear sound it DOES provide.My old ears miss a lot of dialog on movies streamed from the internet, even with a good surround sound system.  Most of the movies I watch do not offer the option of subtitles, so no help there.  I've tried the 900 Mhz headphones, but didn't like the background noise and signal dropout that is characteristic of analog RF headphones.  Turning the room loudspeaker volume up helps, but drives the rest of the family out of the room.I experienced the ""echo"" problem right away when I plugged the analog audio output of my Samsung HDTV into the RS 170 transmitter.  I agree with those who claim the echo is unacceptable.  I can't imagine anyone being able to ignore it.  The RS 170 blocks out a lot of the ambient sound, but not enough to eliminate the echo effect unless the room speakers are turned way way down.The solution to the ""echo"" effect is to program a 100 ms delay in the sound routed to the room loudspeakers.  This insures that the sound from the loudspeakers matches, in time, the sound from the headphone.  No more echo.To insert the 100 ms delay, one must have a receiver-amplifier with the ""lip sync"" feature.  Many quality AV receivers have this function.  Mine is the Yamaha RX-V665.  The lip sync function allows you to specify the number of milliseconds the amplified sound to the surround speakers is delayed.  100 ms worked perfectly to eliminate the echo.For this to work, the source of the analog sound signal to the RS 170 must be available BEFORE the signal is amplified by the AV receiver.  That rules out plugging the RS 170 transmitter into the headphone jack on the front of the receiver-amplifier.  Fortunately, my Samsung HDTV provides the analog audio output jack needed for input to the RS 170.  The headphone jack on some TVs should work as well.  The digital (optical) audio output of the TV goes to the Yamaha where the sound is amplified and delayed the necessary amount before driving the surround speakers.What's nice about this solution is that even when you are wearing the headphone to hear the now intelligible dialog of the actors, the sound from the surround sub-woofer can still be heard and felt.  Others in the room can adjust the volume of the room speakers to taste independently of my volume controls on the RS 170 headphone.One last point.  One reviewer complained that the RS 170 has no mute function.  That is not so.  By momentarily pressing the on/off switch on the headphone, the sound is muted.  Pressing again brings the sound back instantly.  You need to press and hold down the on/off button to turn the headphone off.  Muting the room loudspeakers needs to be done separately.In any objective review of a product, there needs to be some mention of disappointments along with the delights.  Right now, however, I haven't experienced any.  Even the price is reasonable when considering the capabilities of this product.  If and when I encounter a letdown, I'll update this review.At this point, I strongly recommend the Sennheiwer RS 170 digital wireless headphone.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Echo problem solved

    ","I just love these headphones. I also own Sennheiser's HDR 65 and HDR 140. My only complaint is there is no hard-copy user manual, just a CD or online. There is a quick guide, but it is only a picture guide with almost no text. The sound quality is great. Periodically, I have to turn off the headphones to verify what I am hearing is actually from my TV and not somewhere inside my apartment or just outside the door. I was watching the FX cable show 'Damages' and heard voices just outside my apartment door and after taking the headphones off I realized it was from the show. It was a scene inside the law office and evidently the voices were from people supposedly standing behind the people in the scene. The headphones might not have actual Surround Sound but they sure sound like they do and I didn't have the simulated Surround Sound turned on. Also, they seem to have noise canceling, even though its not stated. When I use the microwave with the headphones on, I can't hear the beep when I push the buttons. Again, I had to take the headphones off to tell if the microwave was working; it was. Even if I don't need to wear the headphones, I do when I what to hear the best sound.There is no interference from any room in my apartment and or outside for about 50ft.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these headphones.

    ","After watching the setup instructional video on YouTube (and on the company's website) we were still unable to get these headphones to charge for the first time. The charging light on the charging cradle would not come on. Finally we plugged them into a different electrical outlet without attaching them to the t.v. system and they started charging. I also reviewed the set-up PDF manual that is on the included DVD. It has the same pictures as the enclosed set-up guide, but has more detailed instructions. This still didn't help with installing the headphones, though. Finally after trying to plug them into our t.v. and our sound system, we tried plugging them into the DVR. VIOLA! The headphones finally worked! The fit and sound are great. It's as good as our 5.1 surround sound system. So, in summary, the set-up process is horrible (so I deduct two stars for that). However, once up and running, the stereo sound and fit on the ears are excellent. Sennheiser needs to do a better job with it's set up instructions. If I can set up a whole t.v. entertainment system but not these then there is a problem.TIP: The mute logo will appear on your t.v. screen if the volume is up on your t.v. and the headphones are in use. To get rid of that icon on your t.v. screen, just set the t.v. volume switch to zero. The volume on the headphones will not be affected by this. The volume on them is controlled on the headphones themselves.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: The initial set up was baffling, but the headphones are excellent once they are working."

    ","I was very excited to be receiving these headphones in the mail from Amazon, however, there are some design flaws that you should factor in before purchasing these headphones. I ended up returning these to Amazon after getting frustrated with these quirks. Instead of just saying ""they sound horrible"", I'll try to provide more detail on why these Sennheisers are not worth your time.Cons:- These run on the 2.4ghz frequency, and with a 260ft range, they are pretty powerful. Unfortunately, most home routers do most of their work on the 2.4ghz frequency. They knocked out the wireless internet connection in my house, and it took me a couple days to realize they were the root cause. I have dual-band (2.4ghz and 5ghz) wireless N. If you disable your 2.4ghz band and just rely on 5ghz for your wireless internet, most cell phones & tablets (as of 6/20/14) do not support 5ghz. I did a number of tests with the headphones on and off and determined it was knocking out wifi signal in my house and also for my neighbor! Keeping the Sennheiser charging station next to my computer (on wifi) was enough to completely kill the wifi signal. I tried different wifi channels on the router, and no luck.- There is a whirring mechanical noise every 15 - 25 seconds when no audio is playing. I don't know if this is interference or an issue with the speakers. Noticeable at all volumes when music is not playing.- At low volumes, you can hear static behind your music, especially when there is a pause in the music or a song is just starting.- At very low volumes, the music will cut in and out. Not a huge deal because you probably won't be listening at lowest setting. Just something noticeable if you try.- As others have said, the volume up and volume down buttons are on either side of the power button. This is very annoying, especially because the buttons have no texture, no spacing, and no distinct way to tell them apart while wearing the headphones. Take a look at a picture of the buttons on this headset, and you'll see what I'm referring to. You have to take the headphones off of your head to change the volume. On multiple occasions, I have accidentally turned off the headset instead of changing volume. Big design flaw on Sennheiser's behalf.- I liked the idea of having a wireless base station to recharge the headphones on. No messing with USB cables to recharge! However, each time you use the headphones, you have to re-link them with the basestation. You have to push a power button on the base station until it starts flashing green, and then push a power button on the headphones until they flash green. It sometimes takes a few tries. These are definitely not the type of headphones you can just pick-up and start listening to. I've also found I have to perform this step each time I lock/unlock my computer. Relinking these things will get annoying after the first day if you intend to use them on a computer.- Minor con, but still worth mentioning: When the basestation and the headphones are connected, the basestation will keep flashing a bright green light. Not a huge deal if you can cover it up or turn the basestation around. It was distracting when I had it next to my TV console, and very annoying when it was on my desk next to my computer. Ended up putting black electrical tape over the LED.Pros:- Comfortable- Recharging station (no usb wires to mess with!)- Overall feels solid and a quality build- Batteries came pre-charged in the box :)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Read this review before buying

I have an older set (Sennheiser TR 120). The volume is so great that it will blow your ears off.

I have looked everywhere for the TR 120  and the only one I could find was the RS 120.

    ","The TV stations that Comcast sends my way have varying levels of audio. That is not a problem with a headset such as a Sony, for example. You simply reach up and adjust the volume using the single control. With this headset you have to remove it from your head and look for the correct button, of a group of buttons, to push the right one depending on whether you want to change the volume up or down. All the buttons of the group feel the same to me so it is a nuisance to use this headset.There are other nuisances as well such as turning the headset and the transmitter on and off, pairing etc. I have only myself to blame for making this purchase. Had I read the reviews, as I normally do before buying anything, I would have known this is not what I want.I had been using a Sony headset which is perfect for my use. No on and off or a bunch of controls. Just lift it off the charging stand and slip it over your head. The negative is that some of the black coating on the surface next to the ears comes off and sticks to the ears. Naturally I could not see the black specks but, by golly, my spouse could  and pointed this out to me in explicit detail and with unrelenting frequency. Her advice was what caused me to try a different brand. Now I have gone back to the Sony and black specks are welcome, at least by me..I have had the Sennheiser headset too long to return because I had a difficult time getting it installed and working. I had to refer to the Sennheiser CD and the TV manual numerous times before finally getting the right combination. The sound quality of the Sennheiser if just fine. It is all the nuisances that turned me off. Goodbye Sennheiser and welcome back Sony.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Sound, Lousy Controls"

    ","I did a lot of research and thought these would work for me - they didn't.  I didn't need high fidelity headphones (hp) because I was mostly going to use them to listen to TV.  Turns out, I should have saved my money.Pros:  Sennheiser has a great reputation.Cons:  Here we go....- They are too small for my head.  Granted, I have a big head, but the earpieces don't extend down far enough to cover both ears.  I always have one side pinching down on an ear.- They are too tight.  I can only wear them for about 30-45 minutes before they become uncomfortable.- The power button and other controls on the headset are almost worthless.  It's almost impossible to differentiate the volume button from the on/off button from the pwr button, etc.  I have to take them off my head to use the buttons.  It could have been a simple zero-cost fix to design them better, but they chose not to do it.- The ""squelch"" (for lack of a better word) is annoying.  There is a certain amount of background hiss during dialogue on the TV.  I can live with that.  What's really irritating is when there is a break in the dialogue.  The noise reduction kicks in and the headset goes totally silent.  Then, when the dialogue returns, there's a slight delay before you hear anything because it takes about a second for the noise reduction (NR) to shut off.  You end up missing the first word or two when the dialogue returns.Sorry - I wish I could write something positive about these phones.  I think I paid around $175 for them and I'd gladly sell them for $50.I still use them - only because I can't see buying another set.  I'm not a rich guy.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money

    ","Before purchasing the Sennheiser RS 170 Headphones, I read many reviews.  This product sounded excellent, so I went ahead and purchased it and connected it up to my television set.  The sound is wonderful!  There is a great dimension in the sound and there are many sounds I  had never heard on my television before using these headphones. And, they are very comfortable to wear.  However, I feel there is a design flaw in that the volume controls, on/off control, surround sound and bass controls on the headphone are very difficult to locate without actually taking off the headphones to look to see where they are.  The controls are pretty much flush on the bottom of one headphone, and it is difficult  to locate the desired controls easily.  I have had these headphones for about a week now.

    ","The Sennheiser RS170 has great sound and great fit if you stay in the house with limited walls between the transmitter and headphones.

A surveilance camera keeps you guessing who the indivisual is. Why are the improved version technology inferior to the predecessor? If the RS120 had the fit and ear pads of the RS170 it would be superior even with less quality sound.  Sennheiser, you've given us a stronger, faster runner without the endurance to finish the race.

    ","I bought this only a little over 30 days ago and already I have had too many issues with it. As other reviewers have mentioned your ears do get too hot while using them but that is minor compared to the fact that the sound cuts out on a regular basis when there is no sound coming from my TV. I know this is to save on the batteries but it does it so often that it becomes extremely annoying very quickly. Also, there is a hiss and some tiny noise coming from them intermittently but again often enough to annoy the crap out of you. Lastly, just today I started getting the right earphone slowly dieing. It would produce some sound then diminish, then completely cut out. I know it is not my tv as I would disconnect the headphones then test the tv out on my regular speakers which work fine. I turned the headphones on and off and the problem resolved itself for a while but returned a bit later again. I could continue to trouble shoot this but lets face it. I shouldn't have to troubleshoot something that is only 1 month old and cost over $200.00 at all. Also, the base is so light and plasticy that it feels cheap and you have to use 2 hands to turn the thing on as the unit otherwise moves  so much you can't push the button on the front. Since you have to turn it on all the time that becomes an annoyance as well. Putting the button on top would have solved that issue without changing much. These products nowadays are all so crappy that it is almost impossible to find something that works well for over a month. Even though this unit is over a month old I'm still returning it. It's better to pay a restocking fee and at least get some of my money back than keeping it and annoying the crap out of myself for another 6 months and getting nothing but aggravation from it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Piece of absolute Junk

    ","I've only had the RS 170 phones for a few days.  I had expected to rate them 10 stars because of the excellent crystal-clear sound; but I believe they have a flaw that may render them unacceptable for some people (see CONS, below).  I'm giving them 4 stars because they are so good - I should probably rate them either excellent or ""not acceptable"".Here is my take - you may not have the same experience or have the same needs or expectations.TYPES OF WIRELESS HEADPHONES:  For those that don't know, there are broadly 3 ways by which wireless headphones receive their signal:IR (infrared)  --  these use a line-of-sight signal and avoid radio interference.  They have the disadvantages of short range and reduced mobility (you have to remain within sight of the base station), but they usually do produce a clean sound.900 MHz  --  these are analogue radio headphones.  The main disadvantage is susceptibility to hiss and other noise, especially when you move your head or move to another room.2.4 GHz --  these are digital radio headphones, like the RS 170, and are more likely to be free from hiss and noise.I bought the RS 170 phones to replace cheap ones I've been using for late-night TV, and which operate on 900 MHz, providing constant hiss, much worse when I move about.The RS 170 sound brilliant.  I've used them for late night TV and movies, and for music (radio and CDs) allowing me to move to other rooms in the house.  They're comfortable to wear and I'm sure they'd be great for use on a treadmill or working out.  All over my home, and in most of the garden, the sound is crystal clear with no hiss or extraneous noise.  Except, that is, for the echo ...CONS:  Having read scores of reviews of wireless headphones, it seems that some people buy them to listen to movies/ music without disturbing other people.  For that these phones are brilliant.But some people buy wireless headphones because they have hearing loss (or just want the clarity that headphones provide) and use them to watch TV while their spouse listens through the TV speakers.  The RS 170 phones seem to operate with a slight time shift (delay).  If the loudspeakers are also on, albeit at low volume, the effect of the time shift is to produce an ECHO - this is very noticeable with dialogue, and is really annoying.It might mean that if you listen to movies/ TV, and have the sound coming through the TV speakers as well, the RS 170 phones may not be acceptable.If you turn the TV speakers down (or ""mute"") you won't notice the effect, but then no-one else in the room will be able to hear anything unless they have headphones as well.The RS 170 are of a  ""closed"" design, which means that sound is not supposed to leak out, and in combination with the comfortable ear-pads, they greatly attenuate ambient noise - but they don't eliminate ambient noise completely (they are not ""noise-cancelling"").  I wrote to SennheiserUSA yesterday morning, and received this prompt response:  ""The RS 170 should block out the sound of the TV speakers. Check to  see that you have them on correctly so that there is a nice seal to  block out ambient noise.  Let me know if you have any additional questions.""  Eric Palonen  Sennheiser Headphones + Headsets  1 Enterprise Drive  Old Lyme, CT 06371""It's true that the ear-pad seal does greatly attenuate ambient sound, but it does not eliminate it.  The problem is so serious that I cannot use the phones to watch TV if my girlfriend is watching also.The more expensive model RS 180 is an ""open"" design - the echo problem is likely to be even worse.  The more I think about this, the more I am torn -- if you have hearing loss, you might not notice, or care about, the echo.OTHER FEATURES:-- sound:  The quality of the sound is better than I'd expected.Listening to movies, I hear subtle sounds that I can't hear with loudspeakers.  I can only describe the sound as crisp and clean with adequate, but not booming, bass.I listened to some classical music CDs (Elgar) with delicate sounds as well as a full orchestra and timpani.  The detail is excellent; even when I walk up my driveway the sound eventually cuts out, but there is no hiss as far as I can tell.  My previous headphones were all hiss and crackle as I moved away from the base.-- price.  These are expensive, and may not be discounted for quite some time.-- buttons.  Lots of people criticised the prior design (RS 130/ 140) because the rotating volume control could catch on a pillow and move.  The RS 170 has buttons for volume, mode, plus bass and [faux] surround sound.  The disadvantage of buttons is that they're hard to find by touch alone.  I think a lot of people will wind up taking the phones off to press the buttons.  One advantage of the design is that the volume-up button is closest to the front and it doesn't take much practice to find it with your right thumb or finger.  The BASS and SURROUND controls can be activated from the base unit.-- bass.  The bass is not intrusive, even with the ""bass boost"" engaged.  Fine for me, but some people like exaggerated bass for rock-N-roll, and they may find the bass to be light.-- surround sound.  It's simlated surround sound, and I haven't used it enough to have an opinion.  I think I shall wind up not using it (just like the CNET reviewers who tested the prior model RS 130).-- charging batteries - yes they need 16 hours for first charge, but it only takes a moment to slip in standard alkaline batteries (just don't leave them in when you put the headset on the charger).-- connecting - connecting is very easy - I took the time to route the wires through the coiled conduit.  Some people will want to connect to a TV set.  I connected to an AV receiver (I used ""tape monitor out"") so I can quickly switch between TV, radio and CD player.  I also connected them to my iPod, but somehow that seems like a tautology.-- range -  Sennheiser claim 260 feet range.  My house was built to defeat cell phone signals and may not be a good test.  They work all over the house and in some of the garden and the driveway, but they do cut out at much less than 260 feet.  That may just be a feature of my house.  I didn't buy them for extreme range and I'm very satisfied.In summary I think these phones are great - they so enhance the experience of watching a movie that I'm not sure I want to forgo them when watching movies with my girlfriend.  The echo problem may be a deal breaker for some.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pity about the echo ...

    ","We've tried in earnest to locate the down volume while wearing the phones but find it impossible to isolate it from the other buttons. We're pretty tech savvy, my husband having worked as a TV engineer for twenty-five years and I being an IT Specialist, but we find it's a real hassle to remove the phones, turn on a light and look for the button every single time we need to turn the audio down, which happens frequently. Our other issue is that the transmitter powers off when the phones are turned off, which must be done to conserve the battery charge. This means you must get up and turn the transmitter on before each use, something we're unaccustomed to doing since the advent of remotes. The positives are a comfortable, isolating feel, but the isolation has also proved an issue when we want to make a comment while watching. We hadn't considered this so I mention it here.We wish we'd found these problems in reviews before we bought these. Sennheiser tech support refuses to acknowledge any design issues at all.

    ","Well I'm definitely not a hardcore audiophile, but after hours of research and multiple headphone purchases I've found one of the best pair of wireless headphones out there. Take some of the reviews people have posted about these with a large grain of salt, I discovered after reading every electronic/pc mag review like cnet and sites like wirecutter that a lot of folks are pretty ignorant about tech details or make them sound more complicated to use than they are. So here's the bottom line if you don't want to do as much research as I did or don't care that much, take it or leave it.Go wired if you want the best sound at similar price points, they will always sound better. I tried Sony cans from Costco and Best Buy and ordered several more significantly expensive pairs of SH and didn't like them as much as the RS 170. First off, in a small-ish niche market of wireless headphones, SH is king. End of story. Sony and others don't compete. If you want a cheap, decently functional pair for under $100 get the Power Acoustic Farenheit. If you care about good sound enough to spend over $100 but less than $200(which I did) then serve up the SH. I got the only pair of used like new RS 170s on Amazon for $140 and it was a steal, to me they sounded as good if not better than other SH costing 2x - 3x as much. Even new they're not quite $190, which I would spend if I had to buy another pair after hearing how insane they sound. The sound is phenomenal, the range was excellent, no dropouts on full charge wandering all over my house, upstairs, closets etc. The bass boost/surround sound functions to me were very noticeable, accurate and added a critical extra dimension of sound with no distortion, especially when watching action flicks, I would watch a 5 minute action sequence with them off and on to observe the difference and that was a deal maker for me and why I didn't go with the also discontinued SH 160, although they were slightly over $100, as they lack those functions. I just leave them on all the time. The ear pads fit perfectly and top of phones are padded where they hit your head. Super comfortable through a 2 hour+ movie. A lot of people complained about sweaty ears which I never really had a problem with. Another gripe was the controls being clustered too close on the back of the right earphone cup and having to take them off in the dark to adjust. Seriously, if you can't figure out the work around you should probably wear a helmet and bubble wrap in public and never be allowed to drive a car. It's not a great design for sure, but after taking them off twice to look at the buttons I had it mastered. There's no need to touch the bass boost or surround sound buttons, and the power button(in the middle of the volume buttons) has a raised symbol on the back you can easily feel and avoid without taking the phones off. Even if you accidentally hit it, just tap it again to turn the phones right back on. Not a problem. The volume up button is the farthest left and the largest button so very easy to feel it out. Not a valid reason to avoid these awesome headphones. You do have to turn them on at the base and on the headphones themselves, but really not a big deal at all. I ran the headphones off and on for 20+ hours before needing a recharge just to test them. Connecting the base to the TV took less than 5 minutes, super simple setup. I really wish I had bought these years ago and am actually strongly considering buying a backup set before they becomes obsolete as this model has been discontinued for awhile. A bonus feature is that Amazon offers 2 months of product support on these, which is pretty awesome for a discontinued item. Avoid the RS 175 that replaced these for almost $100 more, they sounded inferior to me. My only gripe was that when I kick back the recliner seat in my couch the headrest pushes the headphones forward a bit. I'll get over it I guess;-) Basically, if you care enough about sound or find you have a need for these in the first place you'll probably be fine spending what these cost. Buy a used pair on Amazon or overstock, you won't regret it for a sec!**Note that I ordered a second unit from same seller, as the cost of a 2nd pair of headphones only was almost as much as getting the base unit, so I figured I'd have a backup if the first base station breaks and 2 sets of headphones I can pair to either base. The unit came with functional headphones and a non-functional base from the same seller, so I'm returning for an exchange before all of them are sold out and more expensive to buy. Time will tell if it was a fluke**",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser rocks!

    ","From a respected name such as Sennheiser, the user friendly features of this headphone was one of the biggest dissapointments I have ever found in an audio device, and I have been buying electronic items for 60 years.  The respected name of Sennheiser has been greatly compromised.  It was obviously to me that their engineers totally forgot or ignored the public when the developed this system.  When compared to their own HDR-120 which I would give 4 stars to it fails miserably.  There was absolutely no thought given to controls when this disaster was conceived.  The HDR-120 has easy to use controls, but this unit has controls which are virtually hidden and impossible to 'feel' while using them.  The volume is set way to low from the factory, even at the highest setting, it is weak.  I'm not to keen on their charging/transmitter either, however it's irrelevant to the product because I would not even use the headset if it were offered to me as a free gift.  Buy the HDR-120 (I have 3 of them now) and forget this RS-170 model.  NOTE: Evidently the business I purchased this from knows what a loser it is because they gave me a 100% refund immediately.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Forget the RS-170 high priced headset

    ","PLEASE SEE EDIT at the bottom of the review BEFORE you buy.I purchased the RS 170 for my wife, for use with her PC. We have a mostly wireless office, due to the fact that we have cats and cats seem to love anything resembling a cord.I did a lot of looking and reading reviews. I looked at all of the Bluetooth offerings and the other wireless offerings, like this one. I really thought I would go with Bluetooth, but what I found was a big discrepancy from very high end, (Expensive) sets, to very low end and low quality, sets. I know the Sennheiser name and their quality first hand and eventually I came back to this set.My biggest concern was interference.As I say, we have wireless everywhere in the office. Two wireless mice, wireless keyboards and a wireless router. None of them have ever had an issue with each other, but I was concerned about some of the comments of people having issues with wireless audio.There are no issues. None at all. The base unit is sitting on the desk right next to the wireless mouse and keyboard. It is within 6 feet of the wireless router also and the headphones are crystal clear. Let me state that again. Crystal clear. Absolutely no background noise at all.I had to use a splitter, from one jack, to two, so I could keep the regular speakers and still have the headset. I plugged it in and turned on the base first, then the headset. The sound is really very good, but I want to mention something here that seems to be left out of many reviews. That is the source of the sound. I think some people have high expectations and they are disturbed when they don't hear the kind of sound they are hoping for. Well, consider the source. What kind of audio output do you have to begin with? The sound is only going to be as good as what you put out from your device, to the headset. In my wife's case, the PC has onboard sound, with absolutely no adjustments, other than volume. No equalizer, nothing. So my expectations were not high, but this set of headphones exceeded anything I expected. They are clear as a bell and the sound is much better than the desktop speakers. We did turn on the extra bass, for deeper bass sounds and it did a good job of enhancing without killing the bass. We did not like the surround sound at all and turned it back off.My other concern was range. Our office is in the back of the house and I knew my wife would want to be able to wander around while listening. Well, the range is better than I expected also. She left the office, went through the kitchen and out to the garage and closed the garage door. She still heard crystal clear sound, with no interruption, even while she was in the garage. This means the signal had to go through the brick wall of the garage. That is amazing to me. She also walked all around the ranch style home and found no place where she had any problem at all. Even in the front bedroom inside the closet.The headset itself is light weight and the full sized cups allow for over the ear use. The cups are very soft and the pressure is light, so they do not hurt the head. I would not want to run with them, but I would want to sit and listen for a couple of hours, no problem. The volume controls have the on/off button centered between them and I think that is a mistake, but it's so minor compared to the positives, that it is nothing of consequence.We love the headphones and are very glad we chose a good name with good quality.All I can say is that the RS 170 was worth every penny for us.EDIT. 02/15/15 The unit has died already. Not the headphones, but the main transmitter tower unit. Will not communicate with the phones any more. Past the 30 day warranty, so now I can't do anything.

    ","Let me say that the main reason I bought these headphones was for watching movies with out hearing lip for having my home theater too loud.I enjoy using the surround feature and the Bass boost for movies. I have a high end home theater and I do not miss it as much as I thought I would. Does the Bass feel like my two 1,000 watt powered subs. Of course not, but the bass is very good.The main time I would use the headphones is times when I have my system very low so the headphones sound much better then my system when it is played at a low decibel level. While I have a movie in I can walk all over my house and it never breaks up. The sound is crystal clear all over the house.The closed headphones are a nice feature so you can shut out most noise but you can still hear someone calling you if needed.The only problem I have so far is an occasional sound dropout. I moved the transmitter and manually paired the headphones. Since then I have had no problems but it is too soon to be sure if it worked.I highly recommend these headphones for watching movies. I am not a music guy so I could not comment on that.7/14/10 I would like to give a quick update. The sound from the headphones for movies is still great. I do not get any sound dropout when I am close to the unit. I do tend to agree with a previous post that the range is not great. My house is decent size and when I go to some rooms the sound does drop out.",5.0 out of 5 stars,much better then expected

    ","I was very impressed with these headphones except for a critical flaw which made them completely unacceptable for almost every listening situation. With wired headphones, the analog signal goes into the cable and immediately comes out of the earphone. With this set of Sennheiser wireless headphones, the analog signal enters the transmitter and after a significant delay in time comes out the earphone. How much time? I did not do a scientific measurement but I would say the delay is somewhere in the vicinity of a quarter of a second (250 milliseconds). The delay is very noticeable and makes lip sync on a TV appear to be slightly off. If the TV is playing through speakers in the same room that you're listening with these headphones you will here a very perceptible and annoying echo. Don't even think about using these in a recording studio or professional application due to the sound delay problem. About the only situation that is acceptable is casual listening to music where there is no sync or echo issue.The headphones have barely any background noise (very good) and the frequency response seemed to be smooth and natural. I'd say these are excellent sounding and were it not for the delay I previously described, I would love to have them. As they are, I immediately returned them.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound with a critical flaw

    ","After hours of online research I decided to go for these Sennheiser RS 170 wireless headphones. I purchased them through ProAudio (Amazon) who I highly recommend however the headphones themselves do require some adjustments. I'm aware there's a newer version the RS 175 which I decided not to buy for a few reasons including higher cost but after living with the RS 170s for some time i'm guessing the newer version would have likely been worth the extra $$. Overall I like them, they do sound great, however here are the things I do not like about them.1. They fit tight and the vinyl ear cups cause my ears and entire head to sweat, even when its cold in the room!2. Trying to locate the miniature switches on the headphones while they're on my head is impossible. They're far too small, the on off switch is between the volume up and down button so I continually would switch them off each time i tried to adjust the volume till I finally figured out that they need to be removed and adjusted while looking closely at the headphones. This means if the room is dark that the light needs to be turned on, this is a hassle.3. The range is not anywhere near what they're advertised. They cut out as i walk across the room in front of and near to the transmitter.I've tried moving the transmitter (base) but they still do it.4. Each time I want to use them I need to first turn them on at the transmitter base, then again on the headphones. Why they require two on-off switches is perplexing as my old RS 120s (which i used for years) are much cheaper (especially now) and these have just the one switch.Other than these things they work quite well. None are deal breakers for me but when added together means I cannot rate them higher than 3 stars. Still if you're like me and need to save some $$ over the newer RS 175 then these are a fine choice. Hope that helps!",3.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound although needs some modifications.

    ","Got these 3 years ago and I love them as much today as I did when I bought them. I bought them because I wanted something to use when playing games at night and I don't do any of the voice chat stuff. They also seemed like a great alternative to using the surround sound at night when watching movies because of the kids and a sleepy wife. Here are some notes I have from over the years:Pros:-- They come with rechargeable batteries that last a decent amount of time. Plus, the stand charges those batteries so all you have to do is remember to turn them off and put them on the stand when you're done listening. Worst case, keep two AAA batteries around just in case.-- Movies sound great as does music.-- Volume controls on the headset are a nice compliment to volume controls from your audio source. Bass boost and surround sound mode can be changed from the base unit or the headset.-- No wires and a decent range means you can go all over the house and keep enjoying the sound.-- Padding is comfortable. I can wear them for hours without a problem.Cons:-- Wireless is awesome but don't go too far. Mine work everywhere in my 2000 sq ft house but not very well outside. I never intended to use them while mowing, gardening, etc., but sometimes you randomly remember to check the mail.-- Don't forget to turn them off because they WILL stay on and burn out the batteries if you don't-- A newer audio source is preferred. I have a Yamaha receiver from 2001 that I use and that still works great, because most newer TVs have limited audio out options, but you will hear static from the source if there is silence in your audio selection-- Audio source in must have a 3mm line out or a stereo (red & white) output to use the provided connections.Hope this helps.

    ","Here's my situation. When using the TV I spend most of my time gaming and playing single-player games of multiple genres: shooters, adventure games, RPGs, etc. I sometimes also watch TV shows and movies. My setup consists of a gaming PC hooked up to a TV, as well as a bunch of consoles. I personally do not like using speakers of a TV, because it's just not as clear as a headphone. I am not an audiophile, but I do appreciate clear sound without any noise, and I do appreciate convenience.A while back I've borrowed Sennheiser wireless headphones that were analog based (900 MHz). They were very convenient and great, but had an annoying hissing noise. Now that I don't have them anymore, I decided to get something similar but without the hissing noise. Enter the RS170.I've hooked it up to my PC to test. Ideally I would use audio out from my TV but it turns out my current TV doesn't do that.. oh well. The nice thing is that the headphones come with an adapter for audio out from a typical TV, and that's a great thing.I'm not very sensitive to input lag, but I was still initially worried about having some kind of noticeable delay when gaming, since this is digital based. Thankfully, this is not the case. I haven't noticed any lag. Maybe there is some, but it's not noticeable at all for me. I've played Bioshock Infinite on this to test, as well as Rogue Legacy, Typing of the Dead, among others.The sound quality is great. I have pretty much no complaints. The bass boost is a nice feature but I don't really use it that much as I'm satisfied with the bass level. The surround feature isn't that amazing because in the end it's still virtual, but it's a nice touch for when you're playing some games. It adds a tiny bit of depth. I find that with 3D games like Bioshock infinite, it's nicer to have it on.One small issue I had is that there's sometimes a noticeable ""wake-up"" delay. If for example your audio source is completely silent, then it starts playing something, you'll notice that the first 100-200 milliseconds of the sound aren't audible. This isn't that much of a big deal, but it can sometimes be annoying when gaming. I think the headphones do this in order to have them go into a power saving mode when there's no sound.The battery life is satisfactory. I charge it every night after I'm done with it. I've had the headphones on for the entire day, and it was still running fine when I'm done. The batteries also use standard AAA batteries and they're easy to replace, and that's very important for me, because it ensures longevity and I bought these headphones with the intention that they will last long.The headphones are very comfortable as well. I like the type of headphones that cover your ears, and these headphones do exactly that. With long stretches of wearing the headphones they still feel somewhat comfortable for me.My biggest complaint would be that the wireless station switches off automatically when the headphone is switched off (this happens for example when you're charging the headphones), and that you need to lug yourself over to switch it on everytime you switch on the headphones. It's kills the convenience. Previously with the analogue sennheiser headphones, the wireless transmitter switches on automatically whenever there's audio, and that was great because you can simple switch on the headphone from your seat and they will work. Not so with this headphone.It's still not a very big deal however and I'm still very satisfied with these headphones.My second complaint is that it's sometimes hard to tell which button on the headphone does what. A few times I switched off the headphone when I actually wanted to increase/decrease the volume. It's slightly annoying but I think I'll get used to it.Overall, if you want a nice headphone to use with your TV, get these. They're great and they will satisfy you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A great set of headphones that are good with both TV, movies, and gaming. Great sound quality, comfort, and battery life."

    ","I've been watching television with hardwired Sony Studio Monitor headphones for years.  I just find the sound quality so much better than anything any TV or audio system I've owned produces.  This works fine down in my man cave where no one cares about the extension cord for the headphones running across the floor and where my TV doesn't go mute when headphones are plugged in (it's a programmable feature of the TV), but in the master bedroom it's another story.  There a wireless alternative is necessary, but the Sony TMR-RF970R I tried first (admittedly several years old) always sounded tinny - no bass to speak of, no control over anything but volume.  Hard wired headphones were not an option for the bedroom TV because there was no headphone jack.After reading several dozen reviews for these and other wireless headphones, I opted to spend the big bucks on the Sennheiser RS170s.  Per suggestion by other reviewers, I temporarily loaded a pair of alkaline AAA batteries into the headset so I could listen to them right away instead of waiting 16 hours for the rechargeable ones to charge for the first time. I selected the music channels available with my cable subscription and Wow!  Do these sound good!Do they sound as good as my hardwired Sony Studio Monitors?  Absolutely.Is there sufficient bass for me to be able to enjoy rock music?  Yes. (with bass boost set to ON)Do they let me listen to TV in the bedroom via headphone while my wife listens to the TV speakers?  Yes. (I plugged the unit into the RCA output on the back of the TV.)Can my wife hear what I'm listening to with the TV volume off (as in she's trying to sleep while I watch TV)?  Not unless I have the volume blasting, but even then, it's nowhere near as bad as her having to listen to the TV speakers.  99.9% of the time, with the volume I've normally got the headphones set to, my wife hears nothing from the Sennheisers.Is there echo when I listen via headphone and my wife listens to the speakers?  Yes, but...  1)It's not really annoying to me, after all I've had that experience with the wireless Sony too.  2)It's only slightly out of sync, so it's barely noticeable.  Sounds more like reverb than an echo.  3)I can always turn the volume up slightly on the headphone so that it overpowers the audio I'm hearing from the TV.  Problem solved.Are the volume controls difficult to find when the headphones are on your head?  Yes, at first.  (But you soon figure out where the buttons are by touch.)Is there a noticeable hiss during quiet passages either on TV or in say classical music?  Not that I can detect - unlike the Sony Wireless phones these replaced.Would I have spent this kind of money to simply replace my Sony Studio Monitors?  Probably not, it may not be worth the incremental expense for that purpose only.I read that the base station for these can drive up to 4 headphones, so when my wife needs headphones to better hear the TV, then I'll get another pair for her to use, and we can both benefit.I love these headphones!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderfully comfortable, great sounding solution for these aging ears."

    ","I am so very disappointed with my Sennheiser RS 170 wireless headphones costing $238. Such a bad design in so many ways, mediocre sound, high price, short range, and overall poor quality. Among the deficiencies1) the sound controls are five micro buttons all clumped together +, on/off, -, bass, surround on the right side of the headset. When the headset is on, and you can't see the buttons, it can take around five seconds to figure out the correct button to push, and often that's a guess, not much differentiation between then. And being so small, I can't push with thumb or fingers (and fingers are in awkward angle to adjust the controls). I need to slide with my fingernail, hope I have the right spot, and then try to push the slick curved plastic in, without my finger nail sliding off onto another button. Half the time I am force to take the headphones off, find the button visually, again I must push with fingernail as the buttons are generally too small to hit only one of the buttons, then put the head phones back on to see if the button did what was intentded. Still not the right volume, repeat up to several times. 30-40 seconds to change the volume -- if watching a film or TV that means repeating that section since you could not look at the screen while fiddling with the buttons. Exasperating!2) the volume controls are not continuous. Only fairly large jumps in volume are provided. Sometimes I cannot get just the right sound level. Often, too loud or too soft to make out detail are the options one has.3) The lowest volume selection is too loud for my taste in may situations. I have to put in ear plugs to reduce the sound -- which brings in its own distortions. And not exactly an elegant fix. Not a clumsy work around that I would expect with $238 headphones.4) the over ear design is a total waste -- the worst of two worlds -- the discomfort and sweaty ears of over the ear design with NO reduction of or shielding of outside noise. The foam around the ear pieces is cheap, flimsy, very light foam with no sound shielding properties.  I had expected the design or similar of another pair of Senns I had (wired --but wires shorting within a year -- another story of poor Senns quality) which was a dense foam that molded to the shape of head- and had a bit of pressure to create a tight fit. A bit uncomfortable, but they blocked a lot of ambient sound. These 170's nada  -- not a bit of sound shielding. But I still get sweaty years and the weight of a full around ear headset.5) bass turns to fuzz base at medium to higher volumes. Like a cheap, 20 year old broken car radio.6) You have to go walk over to the base station in order to turn the unit on after a prior use. No button on the headset to do this. What a waste and perversion of wireless design.7) Distance is not very good, even with line of sight. 20 feet past the base station and the sound goes out. One reason I went with the more expensive RS 170 was the extended range. I fear what the lower models allow in terms of distance.8) No manual. Nothing of substance to get started with, Just a disk.  As the sole documentation its a joke.9) I am listening to Mahler's 5th at the moment, and testing against my medium price B&W speakers. Not in any way are these headphones are in the same league with good speakers (other wired headphones have been promising in this regard.)10) the surround sound sounds cheap, inauthentic and clumsy.11) The high volume is not very loud. Perhaps not an issue with the majority of users, but I bought these to dampen loud outside sounds. I thus had planned, as I have done with other headphones, to wear earplugs, tightly fit, and then turn up the sound so I could hear. Sound is not loud enough to do this -- though far cheaper head sets allow this easily.12) the headphones don't allow for width of head adjustment. They are fairly loose (and I have a medium to larger head)and can fall off if one bends over to pick something up.13) the recharging cradle is ok, but can take 5-10 seconds to seat it properly.14) battery life between recharges is not great.These are an overpriced, poorly designed, mediocre sound quality, not very usable wireless headphones. Consider these headphones ONLY if $200 means nothing to you, and you revel in mediocracy and love frustration when trying to turn on or change volume.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bad Design, OK Sound, Worth $40 not $238"

    ","I researched a lot of different wireless headphones. I kept coming back to Sennheiser because I have several of their corded headphones that all work great. I was very pleased with the aesthetics of these headphones. I'm also pleased with how well they work after I got through some initial set-up issues.After initial set-up I found that the sound kept dropping out. While watching a TV show the sound would periodically stop. I read through the entire manual online and also searched online for this issue and possible solutions. The key thing I found is that you need to turn the volume up on your source at least to 50% to avoid this problem. You then use the volume control on the headphones to reduce the volume you hear. Apparently the unit shuts off momentarily if it doesn't detect any sound. You avoid this problem by making the source volume high. Some people even recommended making the source volume 100%. I've been using 50% on my TV and max on my iPhone with no issues now. Once figuring out this problem they work great and are worthy of 5 stars.The headphones themselves are definitely 5 stars. However I'd give only 1 star to Sennheiser's documentation provided with the headphones. This key instruction for turning up the source volume is not readily apparent in their literature. In fact, it's not even listed as a possible cause for sound dropping out in their troubleshooting section. The printed instructions provided are only pictures to show you how to set things up. The manual itself is a PDF loaded on a DVD that's provided. I don't understand why they did that with the manual when they did provide a large safety booklet that's printed in every known language.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Convenience

These headphones are comfortable and sound nice except when a loud sound occurs like gunshots in a movie at which point the whole thing starts throwing out static. It's consistent behavior across BOTH headsets I own. I am pissed. $500 for garbage.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Incredibly Flawed

    ","I have been trying various wireless headphones for years. Every one I purchased fell very short of my expectations. I wanted really good sound, decent isolation (so I don't hear too much ambient noise), and easy operation.There are two types of wireless headphones: infrared and radio. The infrared devices require both the transmitter and earphones to be line-of-sight. One device has to ""see"" the other for reliable performance. The infrared devices I have tried, when they worked at all, had inferior sound quality. The radio devices worked on various bands available for consumer devices. None of them were truly interference free and had scratchy sound or static. So going in, my expectations weren't very high.Sennheiser has a reputation for building excellent sound devices. I spent a decade as an audio engineer and found Sennheiser microphones to be the best of the best. I also used Sennheiser wired headphones, and they too were wonderful sounding and very rugged. This past experience is what excited me when I found the Sennheiser RS 170 Digital Wireless Headphone with Dynamic Bass and Surround Sound.SETUPThe quick start guide is very low on information. I followed the instructions (inserted batteries, plugged in audio, and charged the headphones for 14 hours). I lifted the headphones from their cradle (very nice looking and secure for the phones) and put them on. No sound! I checked the connections to the back of my multimedia receiver and they looked fine. I started digging. The RS 170's come with a CD that has the user manual. From reading that, all seemed ok. The little green lights on the charger and earphones blinked and then went out. The instructions had no information about what those lights mean.It turns out that the problem was all my fault. The tape monitor outputs on my receiver didn't send any audio. I plugged the base unit into a music player and without any fuss, I was greated by wonderful sound. So, the moral of this story is to just follow quick setup and then enjoy music, assuming you connected the transmitter to a live sound source.There is one semi-confusing part of setup. The AC adapter out of the package has no AC plug. It turns out that a variety of plugs for various countries are provided. These plugs are located in one of the small boxes in the package. I had to hunt a bit to find them. Once found, the correct plug simply clicks into place on the AC adapter. That's it!SOUNDThe main reason anyone buys headphones is sound quality. The RS 170 lives up to Sennheiser reputation. The quality is absolutely brilliant. Highs are present and there is no distortion. Bass is realistic and at least for me, adequate. The so-called surround sound feature does add a bit of additional ambience as though you are listening to speakers in a concert hall, but no real sense of surround.The range is fine. I could get perfect quality several rooms away from the transmitter. I didn't try to find the limits. My main use is to listen in bed so I can watch TV and listen to music without disturbing my spouse.There is one situation where these headphones can have a problem. If you are listening on your headphones and someone else is listening to speakers in the same room, you will hear the speakers (faintly since the headphones have very good acoustic isolation)a fraction of a second before you hear the sound in the headphones. This is due to the delays in digitizing of the signal and then converting back to analog in the headphones.That delay can be thought of as the sound of quality. Sennheiser uses a very high quality system to digitize and transmit the signal. You can easily hear the results. These headphones are expensive, but they are well worth the price. I don't think you will find anything better. These headphones sound every bit as good as a wired pair. You can't give higher praise than that!",5.0 out of 5 stars,You won't believe these headphones are wireless
1660,"on December 18, 2014",,"PROS:* Sound quality. In word, it's superb. Clear mids, highs, and lows* Comfortable, even after hours of wear (aside from mildly sweaty ears)* Blocks external noise very well, but don't expect it to block out lawnmower men buzzing away outside* Excellent range--I can travel a good 100 ft from the base before losing audio quality (and that's with concrete walls)NEUTRALS:* The charging/control base is awkward and light (I can't tell you the number of times it's accidentally tipped over)* The cables are shorter than I would have liked* Although it does have beautiful sound quality, it did have some issues with interference which caused staticCONS:* The controls on the headphones themselves are awkwardly placed and difficult to adjust while wearing* Often needs to be re-paired with the base if the battery drains completely* Turning on the headphones does nothing if you don't turn on the base power (can be annoying if the base is across the room)Overall, though, these are great headphones despite its quirks.

They sound fantastic, feel great, and most importantly, no having to dead with the cords. Nothing more annoying then the headphone cable getting caught under the wheels of you chair. I need a drink, I just get up and go down stairs and get one without having to stop what I'm listening to. I think when I purchased them they were like $400 - $500. I remember not being able to justify the price, but I did. It just goes to show when you buy quality stuff, it lasts. People praise the cheap stuff and I can see why, but they don't last like the quality stuff.

    ","Imaging that you have to watch your movie like those old day French Charlot movies (speechless). My wife always complaint that I've the TV too loud. That's why I need a headphone so I can enjoy my movie without chasing after the subtitle.For the price of $280, I have to admit that it was a hard decision to make. However, I've finally made up my mind to purchase it, and I am glad I did. Since it is wireless, my biggest concern is the sound quality and the static, which is the most complaint on other products.- The sound quality is digital and excellent compared to my AKG K240 Studio Professional wired headphone. Thanks to the crystal-clear CD sound quality of the Kleer Audio Technology.- I've noticed that some of the side conversations or background sounds are now clearly stand out and noticeable to me. For i.e., the conversation between the coach and the ice-skating athlete before getting into the ring while the introduction is announced loudly.- The ear pads are extremely thick and soft. It's much more comfortable for long hour wear than my AKG K240. I will not wear it for in-home workout dues to the sweat level.- I have no problem to walk around my over 3,000 sq/ft house without losing the content conversation of my movie. However, it lost connection when I stepped out of my front yard because there are two walls in between and the closed front door behind (There are only about 50 feet away from the transmitter). The distance range specifies on the product specifications is referring to ""line-of-sight"". You go figure!- What I like about this Kleer Audio Technology is that the sound just got cut off from the headphone without any white noises. And it will pick up the audio again when I am back into its range or line-of-sight.- Now, with my wireless headphone on, I can tuning up my volume a bit louder, and my wife still can join me with her low tuned volume TV speaker. I've learned from other reviews that some TV brands may disable the speakers while the headphone is plugged in. Both my Samsung and Sony TV allow me to share movie with my wife on the speakers.- It's a very smart design to have the volume of the headphone tuned back down each time it got powered on again. The purpose is to prevent us in accidentally exposing to the loud noise if by any chance the headphone was tuned to max. It does not bother me since I have to adjust my volume on each movie anyway.- I have not experience the echo on the sound delay. Maybe the TV speakers are being tuned too loud, I guess?I initially was thinking about getting the RS160 model or waiting for promotion. After about two weeks of on-and-off researching, I accidentally tumbled onto the Amazon UK site, which has this RS170 model on sales for £149. Amazon Global Priority shipping is inclusive in the price. I'm amazed that it took them only 3 days to deliver my order. Good job Amazon!If you're care about quality, you won't be regret with this Sennheiser RS model wireless headphone.",5.0 out of 5 stars,You Have the TV too Loud!

    ","Like with everything, you can only expect it to perform correctly if it is installed and set up correctly, I read so many reviews both positive and negative, but owning several SENNHEISER products i decided to purchase.As soon as i got the unit i read swiftly trough the user guide and UNDERSTOOD the way the KLEER works, so i was ready to install it properly, basically the best way for you to install the Head Phones(HP) is by connecting it to a LINE OUT of your TV or Optical player, NOW here is the IMPORTANT bit, if you connect to cable or sat box make sure ITS IS GROUNDED!!!! if it is not properly grounded you will get a low sounding humm, this hum is from the frequency interference that is.. well the best way to think of it is like an ECHO that has nowhere to be absorbed, so it is picked up. ALSO the reason why you want to connect to a LINE OUT is because this is a constant STEADY signal, hence the KLEER processor does not have to deal with amplified variable signal and try to balance it, also if you hook it up to the HP port, a lot of those ports have small pre amps hence the 8db switch in the back which helps bring the GAIN of the signal down. So you if you have to connect to a HP port, like iPod Tablet and so on, make sure you turn the volume ALL THE WAY UP and switch the 8db cut, you will enjoy beautiful uninterrupted sound with no clicks cracks or ""dead' spots!In a few words connect your HP to a steady source signal that is designed as LINE OUT. make sure your cable/SAT box is grounded, and enjoy the beautiful rich sound!!Don't hesitate to purchase the RS 170 or the 180, for me the 170 made sense because it was closed back and no sound leak..THEY SOUND AMAZING!!!!P.S I used 2 AAA batteries to set up and test before I charged the batteries that come with the unit, which is also flexibility, if you bat goes down just throw in a couple of AAAs and keep going, AWESOME!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"If Installed right THEY WORK RIGHT,"

    ","I have a set of two RS 170s, two RS 180s, and one base.  I have owned them for two years and I use them every day.  Although there are differences between the two models I am well pleased with both headset types; each actually have their own advantages and I use both equally.  I will be investing in another base station and RS 180.  A second base station can be used to listen to a different sound source, so different members of a household can tune into different sound sources at the same time.These have been a remarkably good, lasting investment.  Pair either with two Sanyo Eneloop AAA rechargeable batteries (eneloop XX 950mAh Typical / 900mAh Minimum, High Capacity, 4 Pack AAA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries).  If you use non-rechargeable batteries take care not to use the charging holster included with the base station.  Also take care when taking the earphone pads on and off the headset to access the battery; the connector tabs won't survive carelessness.Similarities between both models:- Sound Quality:  For most people both models will provide supremely good to near flawless sound quality. To experience better sound quality you would have to 1.) be an audiophile with perfect hearing and 2.) have a wired, studio headset.  Range:  Both headset models run concurrently off of the same base station.  I have found in practice both have a range of ~50ft / 16m line of sight, and approximately 25'/8m through walls.- Sound Source:  Anything that can connect to RCA stereo jacks or a stereo headphone jack. This includes nearly all video gaming platforms, mobile phones, tablets, AV receivers, etc.- Sound Level:  Both headset types have volume controls on the headset; (both also have an on/off power button)- Comfort and Fit:  Both headphone models share the same headset frames, differing only in of the fabric covering the over-ear padding and two comfort pads where the arch of the headset frame contacts the crown of the head.  The RS 180 has a faux-leather type covering helping to seal out ambient noise.  The RS 170  has a high-quality, breathable fabric covering.  I find both headsets equally comfortable, and I can either nearly all day long with little to no breaks.  They are as comfortable as you could expect a headphone to be.- Privacy:  The RS 180 has the edge, but when used judiciously both headsets can be used without interrupting someone sleeping two to three feet from youDifferences-  The RS 170 has left / right balance controls, which may be useful to those with hearing impairments affecting hearing one ear more than the other-  The RS 170 allows more ambient noise.  This is not always a bad thing;  it is actually useful for someone trying to hear a phone or doorbell ringing in the background.-  The RS 180 allows less ambient noise, and in place of left/right balance controls, it has separate buttons on the headset for 1.) surround-sound boost  and 2.) bass boost.Speaking for myself, I'm blessed with extremely good hearing and have been labeled an audiophile by others.  I use both headset types equally;  when I can afford to be immersed in sound I use the RS 180, and when I need to hear more of what's going on around me, I use the RS 170.Speaking for my boys, who love video gaming, they use the RS 180 when they're not collaborating, and the RS 170 when they need to collaborate.  I can govern the maximum volume through the source-device sound control, and except for this constraint, my boys can use whatever volume they are most comfortable with through the headset volume controls.I am well pleased with this investment and, as mentioned, I will be buying more of the same.",5.0 out of 5 stars,really good stuff

    ","I just picked up a pair of Sennheiser RS-170 wireless headphones after researching for a while now. My final choice was going to be either these or the Japanese import Sony MDR-DS7100, 7500, or 6500 headphones. After reading tons of positive and negative online reviews of all four headphones, my gut instinct told me to just get the Sennheiser ones even though they don't seem as fancy as the Sony ones that were created to process all those audio options such as DTS-HD 7.1. I bet those Sony ones are good too, but these Sennheiser headphones are pretty awesome. I used to have Sony wireless headphones that processed Dolby Digital and DTS sound (I forgot what they were called but they are about 4 years old) - these headphones were overall satisfying even with the occasional hissing, crackling and interference, but the Sennheiser RS-170 headphones are so much better.Simply plugged into the headphone jack on my Sony HDTV, the Sennheiser RS-170 headphones provide impressive sound. I tested the sound with a bunch of Blu-rays:1. Tron Legacy: most of the Daft Punk song scenes; Sam entering the grid world scene; the Frisbee battle scene2. Matrix Reloaded: Neo vs Seraph scene; the highway chase scene3. Lord of the Rings: Return of the King: the final battle with the elephants; Witch King fight scene4. Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom: the dinner scene; the rollercoaster mine car sceneThe features on these headphones have a Surround option and a Bass option. So long story short after testing all the combinations (Surround on/Bass on; Surround off/Bass off; Surround off/Bass on; etc.) with the volume tweaked to your preference, the setting that I stuck with to have the best overall combination of an amazing surround sound/bass headphone experience was ""Surround on/Bass off."" While I did like the bass during action scenes if no one is speaking, the bass is a bit overpowering mainly if characters speak during those action scenes - the bass will make it seem that the dialogue is at a lower volume. So with the volume turned further up and the Bass option turned off, everything is more balanced - amazing surround sound in my head (left, right, behind me, far, close, tons of depth), decent bass, and totally clear dialogue. All the Blu-rays I tested sounded excellent with Return of the King, for some reason, being the one I had to tweak the most. Horse galloping, elephant stomping, and the Witch King's morning star all seemed a bit muffled with the Bass option turned off. Tron Legacy and Matrix Reloaded sounded amazing with the ""Surround on/Bass off"" option. And an older movie like Temple of Doom sounded pretty good too - testing the quiet and loud scenes - all sounding great.No hissing, crackling or anything negative sounding (so far). The design of the buttons are not a big deal as all the other reviews complain - the hard-to-find buttons are certainly not a deal breaker. These headphones are light and super comfortable - even with wearing glasses.I would give these headphones 5 out of 5, but I basically take off half a point for the Bass option that overpowers dialogue when there is dialogue spoken. If there is no dialogue during the action scene, then the Bass option does sound pretty good. These are definitely the best headphones I've ever tried with great surround effect, super comfort, and no audio interference!I rate these headphones as:4.5/5",4.0 out of 5 stars,SENNHEISER RS-170 Review

    ","I've had the pleasure of using these for a few months now.  My initial reaction upon listening to them the first time was joy and surprise.  The sound quality really impressed me, given that they are wireless.  That impression hasn't really changed.  I'm still very impressed.  I have noticed some low-volume hiss during quiet passages in the audio, but I honestly can't say if that's due to the headphones or my computer.The headphones themselves are comfortable to wear for a while, IMO.  The around the ear design is nice, and the cups are well padded.  Earbuds can become painful to me after a while, but this design does not.  Granted, my ears get warm after extended use because they are covered (imagine wearing ear muffs inside for a while), but it's not really uncomfortable.They are very easy to set up, but just be aware that they only have one input that is a stereo analog input (that is stated clearly in the description, but I think that it bears repeating).  So, make sure that your TV (or whatever you want to connect to) has a stereo analog output.  This can be either a headphone jack or left/right RCA jacks.  If your TV only has a digital audio output, then you can't directly connect these to it.I also like that they are rechargeable, and that the headphones rest on top of the stand that also charges them without any other cables to connect.  Very, very convenient.Pros: - Excellent sound quality - Comfortable to wear - Easy to set up and use - RechargeablePossible Con, at least given the price of these: - No digital connections.  If your TV (or whatever you want to connect) only has an optical audio output, you can't directly connect these headphones to it.In conclusion - these are comfortable and perform very well.  The single analog connection is a bit limited given the high price, but if you have the means, I recommend these - they do sound great.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"High quality sound, easy to use, no digital inputs"

    ","I now own my own pair of these RS170 headsets and I can tell you they are really the best wireless units I have ever owned. Everything GOOD in these reviews is accurate.Namely: The clear reception is excellent - The sound acoustics are really good - The range of the unit.I also own an older Sennheiser wireless in the RS100 model which is also good but these are clearly better.As for the push buttons on the side of the headset to control several things but especially volume, it is true that by finger feel it is difficut to know where you are.Here is how you solve this ""minor"" issue. I took some vinyl black plastic electrical tape. I cut it into very small squares approx. 1/4"" x 1/4"" Layered 4 squares on top of each other near the + volume button and another set near the - volume button. I feel for the tape and then slide my finger down from that and I'm on the right button. The on/off - bass - surround buttons, if I need to push them would only be a once or twice occasion so I can take off the headset for that or push the buttons on the transmitter tower which duplicate the commands.If you want to do something different with the volume buttons, another thing would be to put a small dot of black or clear silicone in the middle of each button. Then you have another method for letting your fingers do the walking without removing the headset for volume adjustments. Don't let this button thing turn your head. It's simple to resolve and the balance of these quality headsets is certainly worth your serious consideration.One notation: Like others have said, the surround sound feature is not impressive. Good if it were better but not a deal breaker.Go for it!",5.0 out of 5 stars,RS170 - Best Wireless Headset You Can Get

    ","The Sennheiser RS170 Wireless Headphones with Cradle is a nice luxury when you want to enjoy your music without the complaints of housemates with poorer musical tastes.The primary usage for me is to hook the base up to my PC, pick a playlist and wander the house working on projects with my own personal soundtrack. For this purpose, these headphones are excellent. They fit well, tight enough to stay put on my head but not tight enough to cause discomfort with extended usage. The only problem I encountered with long usage is sweaty ears (these things don't ventilate well). The headphones do a great job at blocking out most outside noises, so don't expect to hear your spouse or kids if they walk by and ask you a question (this is both a plus and a minus). The sound fidelity is on par with what you would expect for expensive headphones - clear across all the spectrums (at least the ones I could hear). I use a standard pair of headphones while I listen to music at work, and listening to the same music on these brings out so much more of the sound that my work music now sounds like a AM radio broadcast by comparison. Truly phenomenal sound.I've started using these for TV viewing as well. I scoffed at the idea initially, but when I got the kids tucked away one evening and tried these out with the TV I realized how much audio I was missing.  The biggest issue with TV usage for me is having to move the base between my TV and PC.  If it came with two power cords this dual usage would be much easier.Other reviewers have complained about the range of the headphones but I did not have any problems picking up a signal throughout most areas of my house. The only areas I experienced signal dropouts were at the farthest reaches of the house where the signal would need to travel through many walls and floors. I'm generally not going to wander down to my neighbor's house with these things on, and given the price I'm not going to use them while I mow the lawn so this range is fine with me.In summary the headphones are very comfortable and put out fantastic sound with a good wireless range. The base has great flexibility to hook up with a wide range of devices (PC, TV, MP3 player, stereo system). The drawback (other than sweaty ears) is the steep price.************UPDATE*********I've now used this product for a year and a half and the headphones and base unit are still working great.  In addition, I have seen no wear marks in the surface of the headphones or degradation in the sound quality.  Still extremely happy in this great product!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Superior Quality and Range

    ","Wireless headphones have three main features: sound quality, wireless range, and comfort. Sennheiser scores well but charging issues and poor user design prevent these wireless headphones from receiving a four- or five-star review.I asked a friend to help me test the headphones because he has a larger house and a mother-in-law who lives with his family; the situation provided a much better opportunity to test the headphones' range and charging life.Here's his feedback:My 80-year old mother-in-law occupies the second floor of our home. She's generally good to have around the house. Our one problem is that her television is located directly below our bedroom and she is very hard of hearing. She watches Turner Classic Movies late into the night...I bet you already see our problem.Our solution (besides sleeping pills) was to purchase wireless headphones for her late night video encounters with Bogey and Rhett. We chose the Sennheiser RS 170 wireless headphones.Like all such headphones, they operate on batteries (in this case, rechargeable AAAs). The headphones come with an elegant docking station that is used to connect to just about any music device that has a line out jack. The headphones recharge over a few hours while sitting atop the docking station.I'm no audiophile, but the sound is clear and crisp. The signal is easily picked up throughout our 2,800 two-story home. Outside the house, the signal is good for about 60 feet. The headphones include several power attachments that can be used around the world. A CD instruction manual is included that covers several languages. The headphones include adjustment buttons for volume, bass, and surround sound.  As with most wireless units, they cover the entire ear with ample padding. It's tough to hear external sounds while listening.A couple of criticisms:First, the sound adjustment controls are located near the bottom of the left ear cover. The buttons are small, low profile, and really require you to remove the headphones so that you can see which button you are pushing.The second issue, and it's a big one, is that the headphones only seem to last a couple hours before a recharge is necessary. An even bigger problem is that the headphones seem to drain battery power even when turned off.  Unless the docking station is also powered-down, the headphones seem to constantly try to receive a signal from the docking station. Maybe we are doing something wrong, but the answer sure isn't clear. The rule seems to be...if you aren't listening, make sure the headphones are recharging on top of the docking station.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Charging issues and poor design detract from quality sound and comfort

    ","I've been using the RS 170s as my headphones in the office and they've been great, but I'm not sure if I'd want these to use at home.Pros:+ Clear digital sound.  No hissing.+ Good Sennheiser sound quality.+ Really cool charging station.+ Decent bass boost.+ Comes with two rechargeable AAA batteries - one for each speaker.+ OK range.  I was able to walk about 30 feet away before it started to intermittently cut out.+ Comes with cheapo NiMH batteries to get you started, but...+ Amazon's low self-discharge AAA batteries work great in these.  I've had no problems with charging using the dock.+ Comes with all sorts of international power adapters.  These headphones are a bit bulky for travel though.Con:- Slight delay in audio.- Maybe it's because I'm used to the sound of my Grado SR60s, but the RS 170s sound kind of claustrophobic and ""in my head"".  The closed design doesn't help either.- Two power buttons: one on the base station and one on the headphones.  Ideally, the headphones should just turn on when you remove them from the base station and turn off when you dock them again.- No way to charge headphones while using them.- Only OK range.  About 30 feet.- Useless ""surround"" feature.  It's just very, very heavy reverb.Basically, I would recommend these mostly as headphones for music or for general computer use.  They might be ok for movies depending on your tolerance for audio delays.  The delay is short, and most noticeable when quick, percussive sounds are supposed to be matched with visual cues.I highly recommend getting two low self-discharge AAA batteries like Eneloops or Amazon's Basic brand.  I'm using a pair of AAA Amazon Basic batteries and they charge just fine with the dock.  They last considerably longer than the included NiMH batteries.My biggest complaint is the two power buttons.  It's a little confusing sometimes because the headphones might be off, but the base station is on or vice versa.  It'll take a few back-and-forth button presses as I alternately turn them off and on again before I manage to them both on and sync'ed.Despite the minor issues, it's really nice to be able to get up and walk around while wearing headphones at my desk.  The sound quality is great, and aside from the delay, I can work around or get used to the other issues.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for music and general computer use, not for games"

    ","The Sennheiser RS-170 digital wireless headphone set is a high quality product. All needed cables are supplied. The power ""brick"" is compact -- about the size of a typical cell phone charger. The headphones, which have a AAA rechargeable NIMH (included) inside each earpiece, must be placed on top of the base unit in order to charge.Pros:- Excellent sound quality without bass boost and surround sound- Surround sound effect works well, bass boost is reasonably subtle- You can walk around the house and do chores while listening to high quality sound!- Sound quality does not deteriorate with distance- Nicely shaped and padded cushions- Cushions on headband are an unusual and welcome feature- Adjustable enough to fit my big head and my wife's small head- Lightweight for its size and the strength of the materialsCons:- Controls on the headphones -- power, volume, bass boost, and surround sound, which are all located on the right earpiece -- are difficult to use without taking the headphones off. Only the volume up control is large enough to be easily manipulated, at least for someone with large fingers.- Despite their weight and cushioning, I wouldn't want to wear the headphones for more than about an hour. This is more a limitation of this headphone type than it is of the RS-170s.- Simply placing the headphones on the base unit does not guarantee that the headphones will be charged -- you need to jiggle them a bit and make sure the charging LED lights up.- Sound interruptions occur intermittently, regardless of distance from the base unit. I didn't do a scientific count, but I estimate that I experienced an interruption of 1-3 seconds every 10-15 minutes while sitting at my computer no more than two feet from the base unit. This is annoying, but not annoying enough to seriously affect my assessment of the headphones.- Size adjustments on the headband are not easy to make accurately and I suspect that the adjustment mechanism will wear out relatively quicklyI tested the range of the headphones by walking from one end of my apartment (the bottom floor in a ""double"") to the other, going to the basement laundry area, and stepping outside. There were no significant sound interruptions until I stepped outside and walked a few yards from the door. I suspect that the problem was more the intervening walls than the distance, because I was not as far away from the base unit as I would have been in my living room. Reception was fine in the downstairs laundry area, however. Note that because these are digital headphones, they don't gradually get fuzzier as you go out of range -- instead you get dropouts, sort of like on a cell phone.When evaluating the headphones' sound, I used them on my computer, plugged into a good quality sound card, and listened to music and watched videos. I turned off the equalization on the music software and all of the software-controllable enhancements on my sound card (including surround) to get the best possible idea of what the headphones actually sound like.After some experimentation, I found that I liked the sound best without surround sound, at least while listening to music. (Note that the headphones are stereo, not 5.1 or 7.1, so the surround effect is simulated.) Jazz in particular sounded best without the headphones' electronic fiddling. Still, the surround effect adds depth and liveliness to the sound, and that goes well with mid-fi videos. I also liked the headphones better without bass boost -- in fact, I find the headphones to be a bit too bass-heavy even without the boost. On the other hand, this is a matter of taste; my wife preferred the sound with both surround and bass turned on.I compared the RS-170s to a pair of old-fashioned AKG K260s, nice headphones that cost about $150 when I bought them 20 years ago. The RS-170s definitely sounded better, but the comparison wasn't entirely fair -- the AKG's are not very efficient and so even with the system volume all the way up they were not as loud as I would have liked. The RS-170s did not have that problem.Caveats: I have not tested battery life, nor have I specifically checked for interference from electrical appliances, although being within a couple feet of a microwave while cooking does seem to cause dropouts. I didn't actually measure how far I could walk from the base unit without losing signal.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, reasonable range, difficult buttons"

    ","Ater using this product for a few weeks, I planned to come here to say that they work great!That hasn't changed, they do. I originally thought that they would be most useful for watchingtv in my bedroom, when the A/C unit was on. They are great for that! No more blasting the tvwhen I want to watch a program and be cool, too!. The sound is wonderful for listening to music.I can put the music station on or a concert DVD in and listen, even on the porch or in another part of thehouse. This is wonderful!I have also used them for listening for a segment I want to watch on the news, while I am busyelsewhere. No more sitting waiting endlessly for them to tell me about the traffic, or earthquakeor whatever the news I want might be. Today, I am using them to keep track of Hurricane Irene andwhat she is doing, where she is hitting. I am not in the line of fire myself, but four of my kids are.This helps me to know how they are faring.I have used these to sit on the front porch and listen to music and read. The neighbors with their lawn mowersdon't disturb me in the least.This is a great product, good range, wonderful sound and a very useful item!! Do I recommend them?Absolutely! I am thinking of getting each of the kids a set for their Christmas gift. If you havebeen hesitating, stop. Try them soon .",5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely useful~

    ","I tried using these headphones for gaming and for listening to music videos I found online. The sound quality is better than the one you'd get with regular Walkman headphones, but somehow I get the impression that if I take the regular ones and press them harder against my ears, the difference is almost gone.These headphones are too heavy to use for gaming, and the connection between the computer and the transmitter is not wireless, which is inconvenient if you move your laptop around. Therefore, I could only recommend these as an attachment to your stereo system, TV, or such like.The transmission range of these headphones is very impressive. I can turn on the music on the second floor of our house, put the headphones on, and listen to the music on the first floor in the kitchen while I'm cooking. The sound quality is very good and you can hear the music perfectly without any extraneous noises even in a situation when you are separated from the source of the sound by numerous walls, doors and considerable distances. Since the headphones work best with a stereo system and a TV, I will now be able to listen to my favorite TV shows while I'm in the kitchen. Normally, I have to turn on the sound to the point where the TV bothers everybody else in the house, but now I'll be able to hear what's being said on TV without bothering anybody else.Overall, this is a very good product unless you were hoping to use it for gaming. It's quite easy to install and not hard to use. The headphones are quite big but they sit on your head very comfortably and don't slip off no matter what you do.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent Quality But Not For Use With a Computer

    ","These Headphones replaced Sennheiser RS 120. The Sennheiser RS 170 Headphones are Excellent Wireless Headphones. In comparison to the RS 120 , the  RS 170 are light years ahead. I was often irratated with the screeching ""feedback"" HISS while watching a movie  listening to music. If you bent over to get something the RS 120s will fall off my head onto the floor and sometime spilling the batteries onto the floor. The RS 120s do have better range than the  newer RS 170. Connect these to a high quailty Receiver such as my DENON AVR 3311ci while listening to your favorite music while walking around your home, Watching a Movie or TV or simply to tune out the world have a nap and not be disturbed your surroundings.PROS:* Very Confortable to wear (even more Confortable than My Sennheiser HD595s)* Very Clear Sound, close to wired Cans* No Hiss like analog headphones* Longer Listening time  on batteries than Analog Cans* Bass Boost ( rarely need to use this feature )Cons:* Surround featureThe price have come down since I paid $250 for them.

    ","I was excited about getting to review these headphones, because it gave me the chance to compare this Sennheiser unit with my reference cans, the wonderful HD600s. They were Sennheiser's flagship model until the 650s and then the 800s were introduced.If you are an impatient review reader, I'll just shoot you the bottom line first: these are terrific headphones. I loved using them, and I thoroughly enjoyed the music and movies I heard through them. They are easily recommendable, especially at the Amazon price. Get some, even if you don't think you're one of the obvious candidates for such equipment (i.e., you like to listen late at night in your apartment, or are hearing-impaired and need to turn the volume up, etc.).After setting up the headphones in my living room (which was easy), the first thing I noticed was that I really, really like being able to move around with the phones on. It is a huge kick to go freely from one room to another, check the mailbox, go out onto the patio, work in the back yard, without worrying about the wire. It's great being able to take your music along.The second thing I noticed was that the sound is quite good. There's no static, no hiss. No fading in and out of range. It's either there or not there (if you get far enough away) and it's advertised as ""CD quality."" My technical explanation for this is below, so you can skip it if you like. Here I will only explain how I tested the cans. First, after hearing a few cuts from Tish Hinojosa's classic ""Culture Swing,"" I decided to dispense with doing a 50-hour break-in. As with speakers, some sort of break-in run probably helps, but the sound was just too clean, musical, and involving right off the bat. Great bass, crisp vocals. Everything I wanted to hear. Why wait?So I proceeded to do A/B testing of the RS 170s against my HD600s. I used only the headphone jack of my Onkyo receiver, set to Pure Audio. It was converting the digital signal from my Oppo universal player on an HDMI feed. At first I couldn't believe my ears. The RS 170 sound was warmer, with fuller, better-defined bass and slightly more vocal presence. Then I realized that the RS 170s were delivering a higher SPL than the 600s when the receiver was set at the same volume level. (I did not use the level adjustment on the headphones at all, although that would have simplified the testing procedure.) So I went back, carefully adjusting the receiver's SPL levels for the RS 170 and the 600s so they were similar. I generally listened to no more than 45 seconds of a selection, then immediately switched cans and replayed the same clip.Now the differences were more subtle. Although the RS 170 bass often still equaled or bested the 600s, from mid-range to treble the 600s also showed their strength. With ""L'Orchestre de Louis XV,"" the rich orchestral colors of Jordi Savall's ensemble came through strongly, the solid impact of drums and low strings creating a vivid sound picture in both headphones. But in Stephen Hough's new Hyperion CD of the Chopin Waltzes, the sound of his Yamaha piano in the upper registers was better defined and more musical, less ""plonky"" or plastic, through the 600s. On track 3, the melancholy A-minor waltz, there was a greater sense of continuity, of musical flow, to the piece's meandering lines and smoky colors. When I sampled tracks 2 and 3 of Paul Simon's ""So Beautiful or So What,"" the 600s produced more individualistic sound from the lead guitar on ""Dazzling Blue"" and more nuance (and thus emotion) from the vocals throughout. The HD600s brought me closer to the artists and what they were trying to express. But these were subtle differences, and if I hadn't had the HD600s at hand, I wouldn't have picked up on most of them. Many times the great performance of the RS 170s just swept me away, and I listened to complete selections with enormous pleasure.When I turned to a movie, the Blu-Ray of ""U-571,"" I tried out the RS 170's surround-sound emulator. The first two scenes of the movie offer a variety of sonic mixes, including frantic activity aboard a German sub as it endures depth charges from a British destroyer, and the sounds of party conversation, a swing band, and dialogue at a gathering on an American naval base. The surround emulator was fun, especially during the depth-charge scenes. It boosted bass but never swamped the dialogue. So I might find it useful for movie watching. The RS 170s also have a simple bass boost button, which appears to amplify the bass line without making the balance grotesque or introducing distortion. I have no idea whether it will satisfy bass freaks.In short, get the RS 170 if you are attracted to the idea of wireless headphones at all. You won't regret it. If, on the other hand, you want the absolute highest fidelity, then get one of Sennheiser's top-line wired cans. You won't regret that, even if you pay more.Now: a few extremely simplified words about Sennheiser's ""Kleer"" wireless digital transmission technology. It works on the same principle as WiFi at a Starbucks or on your home network. Since the transmission is digital, anything transmitted that's not a ""one"" or ""zero"" can be flagged as noise and eliminated. Hence, no hiss, no static. Since the sample rate for the transmission is the same as for Redbook CDs, Sennheiser can advertise it as ""CD quality"" transmission. This is its greatest strength, and also its ultimate weakness. That's because the RS 170 does not accept a direct digital feed from your TV, disc player, or receiver. That's probably a marketing decision, because not all TVs have digital outputs, and consumers might be confused or put off by a product that wants to be plugged into a digital out. It's simpler to plug it into the headphone jack on your laptop, TV, receiver, or player. But since that's an analogue output, the RS 170 has to build in an analog-to-digital converter in its base, which converts the signal to digital, and a digital-to-analog converter in the headphone unit, which converts the signal back to analog so that the tiny speakers in that unit can play it into your ears. This additional set of conversions inevitably distorts the original digital information (remember, it's already been converted once). It's highly dependent on the quality of the converters in the RS 170s, not to mention the quality of the little headphone-jack amp in your receiver, etc. So it's never, ever going to sound just as good as a wired headphone with similar driver quality would if it were plugged directly into your receiver's headphone jack. Now that super-high-resolution audio has arrived via Blu-Ray, SACD, and hi-rez downloads, so-called ""CD quality"" is no longer the state of the art (I will spare you the rant about whether it ever was).OK, sermon over. Bottom line, you are inevitably trading off some audio quality for the convenience of wireless. This will not change until Sennheiser (or Grado or AKG, whoever) markets wireless cans that will receive direct digital transmissions of the higher-quality audio formats now available. Don't hold your breath. Buy the RS 170s and enjoy yourself.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Superior Wireless Sound and Convenience

    ","Overall I am very pleased with the quality of these headphones, as typical of all Sennheiser products I've purchased. I haven't had any of the problems that some people have complained about in their reviews, such as poor range or audio delay. However there is one critical flaw that keeps me from rating these headphones higher. Once the headphones are actually playing noise, I lose my wireless internet connection about 70% of the time. I have tried multiple wireless routers, many wireless adapters, and have adjusted every setting I can think of (such as manually adjusting the channel and positioning of the wireless components) and nothing has worked. Also the wireless adapter and router are not very far apart, only about 25 feet away separated by 1 drywall.I contacted Sennheiser tech support and they basically told me to reset the router, but this is a very temporary solution if it works at all. The worst part is that it doesn't seem to happen all the time, which is especially frustrating. I finally broke down the other day and bought a wireless router that has 5 GHz frequency (as opposed to 2.4 GHz) but this was an expensive and unnecessary upgrade that could have been avoided if the claim that ""KLEER technology will not interfere with wireless networks""  was true. If you use a wireless internet connection on a 2.4 GHz frequency (like most people do), be VERY cautious about purchasing these headphones.The two star rating may seem harsh but I specifically ordered these headphones because they were advertised as not interfering with other wireless networks, which turned out to be false. I will adjust my rating if Sennheiser tech support ever actually contacts me with a viable solution.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Beware of Wireless Interference

    ","These are the best wireless headphones I've experienced.  The wireless transmission works perfectly; I'm able to roam all over my 1400 square foot townhouse without any loss of signal or degradation of sound quality.  The headphones themselves are well made, though a bit plastic-y.  As mentioned by others the control buttons are a bit frustrating to begin with, but you quickly learn which button does what after a short while -- usually after turning them off accidentally several times. Though I'm happy with the Sennheiser RS 170 overall and may keep them, I've only given them a rating of four stars after comparing them to a pair of wired Beyerdynamic DT 990's which are in a similar price range.  The RS 170's sound good, but the Beyerdynamic DT 990's sound fantastic.  This may not be a fair comparison, but if you are looking for audiophile sound quality you may want to look at a pair of wired headphones in the same price range and use a long extension cord.  However, if wireless convenience  is paramount then the Sennheiser RS 170's are unbeatable.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best Wirless Headhpones, but Not Quite Audiophile Quality Sound"
1679,"on August 10, 2011",,"I couldn't wait to get this set of Sennheiser wireless headphones!  My neighbors homes are very close to mine, and I have always kept my television and stereo turned down out of consideration for them.  This has made things slightly difficult for me at times and wireless headphones are the perfect solution.  I do have a set of headphones with an extra long cord, but they are useless if I want to move around.The Sennheiser RS170 wireless headphones are very high quality and exceeded my expectations.  The sound is very clean and clear (most of the time) and they are incredibly comfortable.  There were a few things that I wish were different, but overall they are very nice.  My son uses Sennheiser products in his recording studio and had nothing but good things to say about the company.As most reviewers have noted, the manual for the headphones comes on a CD and is quite lacking in details.  Most of the setup was very easy, but it was important to note a tiny switch on the back that you flip depending on if you are using stationary equipment like stereos and televisions, or if you are using mobile equipment such as an mp3 player.The power supply came with an assortment of attachments so you can plug it in no matter what country you live in.  I've never seen a setup like this and quite honestly, I liked it.  It was easy to pick my plug and snap it in, and I tossed the rest of the attachments.  I wish more items came this way, it would be easier for travel.Pros:*The sound is rich and full, and the surround sound offers home theater effects without the home theater.*They are lightweight and despite covering the ears very well, they do not cause my ears to sweat.*The range is quite far.  I've not measured it, but I can go all over my house and have even worn them outside in the garden - though admittedly it's not far from the location of the base unit.Cons:*The control buttons on the headset feel awkward to use.  I generally take them off to make adjustments.  Though I tend to set it and forget it :)*Some programs I've watched sounded ""tinny"", or there was a slight sound of distortion in the background that didn't seem it should be there.  I found info in the troubleshooting guide regarding volume controls that might help if it happens again.*Every now and then, I experience a disruption in the connection.  It's very brief, maybe less than a second, but it is noticeable.  This occurs while I'm sitting just 10 feet away and I am not moving around, and there is nothing in between the base and myself.I think the retail suggested price is a bit too much, but the Amazon price for this item is more appropriate in my opinion.Would I recommend this to friends and family?

    ","I am and have been a big Sennheiser enthusiast and frequently use my classic wired audiophile HD 580's for critical listening of favorite lossless tunes in my collection.  I have never been a fan of wireless headphones, but took a chance on Nov 09 Black Friday, when Amazon had the Sennheiser RS 130 Wireless Surround Sound Headphones (900MHz, analogue fm) for $49.95.  We have them connected directly to our television panel for private listening and they do an absolutely amazing noise free, hassle free job....I would never guess wireless could be so good!Since that time I noticed Sennheiser introduced a whole new line (RS 160, 170,& 180) of wireless phones that looked to be a even better wireless implementation using the Kleer technology (digital 2.4MHz)....likely the reason the RS 130's were closeout priced.  Well recently I had a chance to pick up the Sennheiser Wireless headphones RS 170.  They are impressive to say the least....pretty much on a par with my trusty HD 580 wired set.  The freedom of no wires and true HiFi sound is so enjoyable.  They work flawlessly through out my whole home, including out on the patio.The only problem I encountered initially was with the dock/transmitter ""charge"" light that is supposed to extinguish when the batteries in the headset are fully charged; my light never went out.  The headphones still performed well; none the less it still bothered me enough to troubleshoot a bit.  Batteries seemed to fully charge ie measured the expected voltage.  I tried cleaning the contacts yielding no improvement.  Finally I tried a set of Tenergy 1000 mAh NiMH AAA rechargables (vs the GP Industrial 600mAh NiMH included with the RS 170); they charged right up and the charge light extinguished as it should.  The easily changed batteries are under each ear piece; in fact one could use Alkaline batteries in a pinch if desired (but obviously not to be used with the charging dock).  The fact that the 2 batteries required are in each earpiece makes the headset very balanced (my RS 130's had both batteries in the left earpiece); the headset is very light weight and comfortable for an extended period.As others have mentioned the buttons on the headset could have been better placed, and tactually designed; I typically take the headset off when I want to adjust the volume or select the optional Bass enhancement and Surround functions, so I know what button I am pressing.  The other annoying problem is once you turn off the headset, or turn off the input device at the transmitter, the system reverts to standby mode within 5 minutes; Sennheiser calls it energy saving mode, ie the reason the headset has the ""Energy Star"" seal.  This means you must not only turn the headset on, but actually return to the transmitter location and turn it on as well, which becomes quite an annoyance.  My RS 130 wireless automatically synced back up to the transmitter (which is always on) whenever you turn them on, or pick them up from there charging dock.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Wireless has Arrived w/Kleer digital

I haven't done any experiments with battery life (putting them on the charging stand/base unit every night gives plenty of juice for use throughout the day), but the batteries appear to be standard rechargeable double-AA's.  If you want longer battery life, feel free to swap in your preferred brand or to keep a spare set charging.Set-up is a breeze.

    ","Some of the negative reviews here are just mind-boggling to me.  I was given a pair of these for my birthday from a friend who had just upgraded to a newer set of headphones.  He had owned these for about a year and a half prior to giving them to me, and had nothing but great things to say.  He gave them to me with no box, instructions, etc.  (He didn't keep them)  He didn't even really tell me how they worked.  But within 15 minutes of plugging them in for the first time, I had them mastered, and was already experiencing some of the best audio I've ever heard from headphones.  And they have become the new go-to for the audio aspects of all my entertainment.  (I use them for movies, music, computer work, etc.)The first impression for me was excellent.  The transmitter, while a bit larger, is compact enough that it won't become an eye-sore, and can easily be placed out of sight and out of mind when needed.  And the headphones themselves are incredibly comfy.  They're also lightweight enough that after a few minutes, you could easily forget that they are on.The headphones have five buttons on the side (for powering on/off, bass, surround and volume) and they are quite easy to memorize and use while wearing them.  I've seen a few negative reviews that complained about the buttons being difficult to use while still wearing the headphones, but I didn't experience the issue.  After a few quick glances at the layout the first time I put them on just to know which buttons were where, I had them down, and can now easily adjust the volume, bass, etc. without taking them off.The sound quality is absolutely fantastic.  Very much like listening to a good-quality surround sound system.  I have not experienced any of the common sound complaints some people have reported.  (My only slight issue is that when things are played at very high volume, they get ""crackly"", but it's almost exclusively when they are at volumes that are too loud to comfortably listen to, anyways.  So it's not an issue.)The range is also quite good.  I have tested the range extensively, and am able to have the transmitted plugged in downstairs, while still being able to hear the signal through the headphones upstairs on the opposite side of the house.  (Although it has cut out once or twice briefly while testing, but never for more than a few seconds, and that was only when I was very far away from the transmitter.)Honestly, I think these could be the best headphones I have ever personally used.  I have a friend that had recently purchased a hyper-expensive set of ""Beats"" headphones that cost twice what these headphones cost, and I honestly find these to be a far superior product.  Easily worth the $200 pricetag.I couldn't recommend these headphones enough.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Phenomenal sound quality, easy-to-use, intuitive system... Great product overall!"

The range on these is very impressive.

    ","I have had many sets of wireless headphones, and I have never been able to find a set that I like, until now.After a ton of research on wireless headphones, I asked for these for a Christmas gift. I want to start off by saying that these things are extremely comfortable.  They put one rechargeable battery each side, so the weight is very balanced.  You really can't even tell that they are on your head, the cushions are very comfortable, and the headband is decent. I love the ability to recharge the headphones, right on the base, rather than trying to replace batteries all the time.  These are much simpler to operate than other sets that I've had. The wireless connection is digital, so you don't have to try to match the channels,  you don't have to dial in the frequency, ""fine tune"", it automatically does everything.  Though I haven't tested it completely, I was able to walk around my entire house, first floor, and second-floor, and it never once made a noise with static. I can't wait to try these outside, walking around the yard doing yardwork. Lol.  It has a surroundsound button, and a bass boost button, and they work very, very well. The transmitter base also has the ability to add multiple sets of headphones. In this case you do get what you pay for, and sadly I've already spent probably double this amount, trying to find a pair that I like. My search is officially over.I actually had a set of the RS 120's, Which I bought used on eBay, they were much better than other brands that I have tried, but still had issues with static, and even once in a while dropping the connection completely. The batteries had to be replaced, they didn't have the recharge function, and they didn't last long.I had a set of Sony's, nothing but static, and they did not sound that good. That particular set of Sony's was known to have problems, So I'm sure that there's other sets of Sony's that would work fine, but I wasn't taking any more chances.To sum up, highly recommended, best set I've used thus far, can't wait to really put them to the test with a movie, or game.  If you're looking to spend some money on some headphones, I suggest saving the extra hundred bucks and getting these ones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Received as a gift, and so far I'm loving it!"
1690,"on February 18, 2012",,"What I like the most is the IDEA of this product - the freedom to listen to music without bothering others AND without being tethered within a radius of the amplifier.  Very liberating!  I found that in a building with metal in the walls , I could move 3 rooms away and even outdoors before beginning to lose the signal from the base.  The peformance should be even better in wooden structures.  I also found the fidelity to be excellent, with treble/bass and volume comtrols built into one of the ear units.  The rechargable batteries (included) are kept charged when the earphones are stored on the broadcast base (which is ultimately plugged into the source by wire).  The entire unit is slick and handsome, with an air of high quality Teutonic engineering. I recommend it without reservation with the caveat of potential hearing damage from ANY kind of earphones unless the volume is kept really low.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Product Idea, Great Design & Execution"

    ","I am a long time Sennheiser fan, having used their products for many years for home theater, iPhone, PC gaming, and DJ applications. This is by far my least favorite set of Sennheisers, and I returned them back to Amazon.1) There is no excuse for the lack of optical connections in 2013. I get the feeling these headphones were designed in 1995, given they have a standard Yellow / White cable and a 3.5mm standard ""small"" headphone jack connector. These are the lowest end connectors on the market.Most of you buying these headphones are likely looking for home theater applications. And most receivers / TVs sold in the last decade use ""optical"" connectors, which are based on optical fiber. Using an optical connector, I have much more control and far superior sound compared to the connectors sold with these 170s.2) The build quality is disappointingly cheap feeling for such expensive cans. Very plasticy and pretty ugly. I do appreciate the light weight, but the ugly looks are not appreciated given these are on display in the living room.Look, Sennheiser has never been known for having good looking headphones. But the lack of optical connectivity is the reason whey I sent these back. I rarely return items so I questioned whether to give these one star....but figured that was too harsh.",3.0 out of 5 stars,I have used Sennheiser for 15 years and this is the first disappointment
1692,"on July 11, 2011",,"I got these so I can watch TV/movies without disturbing others if I get up early or stay up late.  A couple issues that others have had aren't problems for me.  The buttons are well laid out and easy to manipulate.  The each button is a different sizes, in groups of 2 and 3, and the power button has a raised icon.  The volume buttons are on either side of the power, so they're easy to find and use.  The bass/surround sound buttons are easy to distinguish, but it takes a little while to remembering which is which.  The easiest way to change the setting is to hold my hand with fingers up and the palm towards the headphones.  I can then use the fingers to hold the phones in place while I press up on the buttons with my thumb.There is a very small delay that results in echoing when the loudspeakers are on at the same time.  The delay can be increased if the sources aren't the same (e.g. loudspeakers from satellite box, headphones from TV).  This could be distracting if you intend to use the headphones because you want a higher volume than the rest of the viewers.  The delay isn't enough to produce noticeable synchronization problems between the audio and video, so they work great for solo listening.There are no range issues inside the house (whether upstairs, in the garage, or in the basement), but a brick wall directly between the headphones and transmitter can cause it to drop when outside.There was a minor piece missing (cable dresser), but Sennheiser customer service sent me a replacement with no problems.  However, I needed to use email to communicate because I was on hold waiting to talk to someone for over a half hour before accidentally hung up.  It was a toll call (if I didn't have Google Voice), and didn't bother to call back.The only issue I have is a minor discomfort that I have with all headphones.  My ears stick out enough that my antihelix rubs the speaker grill. They start to hurt after a few hours, but not enough that I'll quit wearing them.  Slightly thicker padding (even as an option) would be nice.  Normally, I use Sennheiser earbuds, but it isn't worth $500 to me for the matching MX W1.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with purchase

    ","I admit that when I purchased the RS 170 I loved it. It lasted me a year and a half before the base no longer would charge the headphones. I requested warranty work and after a couple of weeks I got a replacement back. The upgraded version was even better, they had taken care of some of the annoyances from the older model and I was stoked. That was until 6 days after the warranty expired (2 years from original date) about 5 months after I got the replacements they just stopped charging one day. Replacements only have a 90 day warranty so I was screwed and now with the money to spend on a new product, well if the new RS 170's are only lasting 5 months I think it would be better to spend my money elsewhere.I even decided to look at the 'higher end' Sennheiser ones and, well, the reviews are even worse. Take a look at the RS 220 and see the complaints there. Sennheiser's quality is going away and it breaks my heart to have to find another brand out there. I'd pay twice what I paid for these just for reliability, alas it's beginning to look like the warnings about buying high quality audio products manufactured in China vs. Germany rings true. The upgrade I was planning to purchase is certainly not going to be a Sennheiser.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Gread sound, questionable construction"
1694,"on April 21, 2015",,"I bought this item last month (from Amazon.fr) and using it very frequently since we have 2 kids sleeping early at home. I was using Philips SHC 1300 before which works with infrared. Of course these two cannot compare each other since they are not in the same category. In terms of sound quality it is really impressive and very clear, bass is OK not tooo much but in the perfect level. If it was a little more, that might irritate your ears. No hiss or static sound at all. Sound level is more than enough. You can watch action movies and listen music at your desired level of volume easily. Bass boost doesn't increase a lot but as I said it is enough for me. Although you don't feel too much difference surround mode works fine. Because in some of the headphones if you turn on surround mode sound makes echo and you loose the naturality of the sound.Generally complaints are due to the button orientation on the right ear cup. However it is very easy to get used to. Not a big deal at all.It is very comfortable to wear. Not too heavy, I ear almost all night long and not irritating at all.My only comment / disappointment will be on the range. In the specs it is written 80 meters. However in my house it is hardly more than 10 meters (without walls, 7-8 meters with block walls in between). I searched a lot before I buy this headphone and rarely people were complaining about the range. However I have a big disappointment. I leave in a 4 bedroom villa 2 storey high. At ground level, from one side to another is around 7-8 meters and if I enter the room at the far corner sound gets cut. Our walls are not concrete but mainly block wall. Still it gets cut. If I go out to the garden, which is not too big, If i stay behind the wall side of transmitter it gets cut but distance I am talking about is less than 5 meters. Basically penetration of signals through walls is very disappointing. However in the open space of house that is OK (up to 10-12 meters only).If range is not big issue for your this is a perfect headphone with a perfect sound quality. I definitely suggest. In terms of hearing the details bass and effects of an action movie it is even better than a home theater because you hear all the details much more closer.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect sound with little range
1695,"on October 10, 2012",,"Overall I'm happy with the purchase though they are not perfectPROS--Outstanding sound quality in the mids and treble.  The best of any wireless headphones under $300 to date. If you like classical, jazz, blues, or most rock these will serve you well.-Great soundstage for closed headphones even without the simulated surround sound turned on.-KLEER wireless technology is NOT a gimmick.  There is no hissing, popping, or interference with other wireless devices because -they operate on the 5.8ghz band and not the 2.4 which most modern wirless headphones do.Light and comfortable-The simulated surround sound is nowhere as good a on Dolby 5.1 or 7.1 cans, but it does help with movies or games.-Having the charger inegrated into the transmitter is a great touch and guarantees you'll never have to worry about plugging in or charging your set.Cons--Questionable build quality.  The headband is very, very flimsy and can be twisted with ease.  The speakers themselves will twist and torque the headband if you hold the set by one speaker.  The headband pads are liable to become slightly unseated if the headband is stretched when putting it on.-Poor Bass.  While these headphones give great mids and highs, the bass is very weak, even with the bass boost on.  If you turn up the bass in an EQ it is liable to distort quite a bit.  DO NOT buy these if you need heavy bass for hip hop, R&B, or electornica.-Lack of digital/optical audio input.  In 2012 on a $250 set of headphones like this that is unacceptable.Overall I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend these for someone who needs wireless for TV, Movies, or non-bass heavy music.  The build quality is disappointing but since these are not headphones you will ever leave the house with that shouldn't be much of an issue.  You simply cannot find better audio quality in a wireless set at this price...PERIOD.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Overall with a few Caveats
1696,"on December 10, 2014",,The sound is great. The connection was difficult because I thought the volume on your TV needed to be turn down. But once I turned up the TV volume I was able to hear sound through headphones.Which defeats the reason I purchase these in the first place. I am hard of hearing while my husband isn't. Now that the TV sound needs to be turned up I get an echo effect. I hear the sound from the TV and then ever so slight delay I hear it from the Headset.  This is annoying so I actually had go turn off the speakers to the TV to fix this. Now with the speakers turned off my husband can't hear the TV. To solve this problem we'll have to purchase a second headset. I read a review where the TV sound could be adjusted by Milliseconds. But my TV doesn't have that feature. Also after wearing the headset for a while my ears started to hurt and I got a headache. I tried adjusting the headset in many ways on my head but still my ears hurt. Not sure if I like these yet. I've only used them once on the day I received them. Will have to give them another week before deciding.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Volume control not as expected.

The volume controls on the side of the left cup were not the easiest to use by feel, but I basically just set the volume and leave it. Some people have remarked that the relatively flat buttons make it safer to lie down with the phones, since moving your head with the earlier design also resulted in changing the volume without meaning to. As for the ""surround"" sound effect generated from two channels, I didn't notice much, if any effect when listening to music and I only watch movies on my home theater, with real surround sound.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great comfort, range, and stereo - surround? not so much"

Where did the money I spend on these actually go?  - The silver siding looks okay, but I think it's a design flaw considering how that area is prone to scratching.  - Connecting, I find myself having to reconnect the headsets regularly.

1699,"on May 20, 2013",,"Review of Sennheiser RS 170Wireless Audio Tech Perfected!Sennheiser RS 170 is a mid end wireless headphone set. It retails for Rs.16990 in India or $279 in USA. It comes with a transmitter which needs to be plugged in to play. It uses Kleer wireless transmission technology which indeed ensures that there is no hiss due to wireless. I can vouch for this.I will cut the fluff right here. And move straight to the point. I will compare these  to my Audioengine A5 and Monster Turbine earphones.Setup:Audioengine A5 with DS2 stands through Asus Xonar DX sound cardRS 170 through Asus Xonar DX sound cardMonster Turbine earphones through FiiO E11 amp and ipad 3I know this isn't exactly Apples to Apples but this is how I regularly use them. So this is a more practical approach.The speakers and earphones are a couple of years old. So properly burned in. The headphones are brand new.Also, these are my first pair of headphones though I have owned several speakers and earphones in the past.Mids/VocalsMT 10RS 9AE 7These earphones are mid range based. The mid range is awesome compared to my Audioengine A5 speakers. My earphones are a bit better though but I can't say that with certainty. The vocals are crystal clear and ideal for low volume as well as high volume listening.HighsAE 10MT 9RS 8The highs are there. But they don't have the same impact as my audioengine speakers. Some people may find this laid back flavor to be more appetizing to their taste, especially those who listen to a lot of highs, but I don't because my music has few highs and I want them really sharp and to stand out. Perhaps these are even more neutral than my bookshelves, but I can't exactly say about it. But the highs are definitely there, clear and crisp but laid back to some extent. Good but not ideal for my tastes. But for music with a lot of highs this will mean fatigue less listening for hours!Lows depthAE 10MT 9RS 7.5RS with bass boost 6Being bookshelves Audioengines have deep bass unlike these headphones. The bass is next to non existent but unless bass is all you want, it shouldn't make that much difference because the other plus points cover it up. Also, it may be tough for headphones to compare with other audio solutions. The bass is there, but definitely not prominent unless you turn on bass boost when it doesn't become prominent but still isn't tight nor deep. Bass is a let down but nothing to be a deal breaker unless you are a bass head.Lows tightnessMT 10AE 8.5RS 7RS with bass boost 5.5The bass isn't tight nor punchy but it does compliment the music without overpowering it. So if you want mid range focused music which has everything else laid back and balanced, then these are ideal for you. But don't expect thumping bass.Lows QuantityRS with bass boost 10MT 8.5AE 7RS 5With bass boost turned on the bass is there. The mid range is still clear. But the emphasis is on bass and mid range equally. However it isn't tight or thumping bass. But compared to other wireless headphones in the market I doubt there is much to complain. Even compared to other wired headphones under $200 few others will probably satisfy everybody. And bass from most gassy headphones will probably be bad as well, so these are much better in that respect.ClarityMT 10RS 9.5AE 7.5The clarity is very good. Something which sennheiser can boast of these being wireless. It is much better than my speakers in this regard.ClearnessMT 10AE 9RS 7There is a certain clearness which the headphones just perform average at. Compared to my speakers and earphones the music just doesn't sound as clear.WOW factorAE 10MT 8RS 6Now this is something which speakers naturally do better at. However, I have read online that the RS 180 has a certain wow to music which the RS 170 lacks. Although I haven't heard the 180 I guess I still agree. There is a certain wow factor which is missing. They do a good job for headphones but lack a certain X factor in their texture and music. Maybe burn in might help. But I a, not sure, I doubt it infact. Nevertheless, these are great headphones and AE have a wow factor only with high volume listening which isn't allowed at home. For low volume listening these compete or even beat my AE which is what I do most of the time. This is subjective though based on preferences and reference points. Some people like flat or natural music or even studio monitors while others like Bose :)RS 170Without amp directly from iPadPretty bad, don't like them one bit.With E11 amp from iPadPretty decent, worth it.With my sound cardGreat job, but not perfect due to above reasons, but definitely good.Surround Sound FeatureThere is an awesome surround sound feature which converts stereo to surround sound. I love it.Movies 11/10A perfect home theater experience IMO! Can't be better for the price I guess. Besides, this is virtual surround sound but certainly doesn't feel like it.Music 8.5/10Doesn't work that well with music but some songs do perform much better with it switched on. Certainly a nice addition to the package.Bass Boost FeatureThis is something I haven't experimented too much with but have been dissatisfied with whenever I tried. For one, the bass becomes overpowering which I don't like. Secondly, the bass is still not tight or thumping bass so that doesn't help in anyway. I usually keep this on. But reviews online rave about this feature and most bass heads are satisfied with it. Even the mid range stays clear though.Surround SoundI would like to emphasize that the surround sound literally feels like a home theater within your head. That is perhaps the best thing that has ever happened to headphones IMO!Overall features 9.75Overall performance 8.5Overall 8.25 because volume controls are awful, in fact unusable.ProsComfortableLightWirelessBetter priced that competitionHas awesome surround soundHas bass boostLong battery lifePretty lookingUpgradable with other Kleer headphonesConsTransmitter is too lightBoth the transmitter and the headphones need to be switched onAwful controlsAverage bass and bass boost",4.0 out of 5 stars,Wireless Audio Tech Perfected

I also usually control the Roku with an app on my Ipod.  That also stalls and quits working sporadically.  With the headphones turned off everything works great.I am going to try replacing the Roku with a version I can connect with an ethernet cable and see if that solves the problem.

    ","I am not a music buff and I am not an expert on sounds, but as an average Joe, I enjoy and appreciate good audio from my headphones. And this Sennheiser RS 170 Digital Wireless Headphone delivers it!1. THE SOUND: The audio quality is excellent. The enclosed headphone captures the all types of sound very well. I was able to hear all the background vocals, instruments, noises, and subtleties with ease. The digital sound is crisp and clear. Immensely enjoyable.2. THE WIRELESS: When it comes to the wireless capacity, each user might have different experience since it depends on your home. I live in ~1900 square feet (2 floors, attached garage) home. I was able hear the sound WHILE moving around the house (everywhere) without any drop in the sound. So when I was doing chores in the house (moving around floor to floor), I was able to enjoy the music without any drops. HOWEVER, when I was outside of the house, the sound was fine ONLY when I was still, but when I walked around outside of the house, the sound dropped frequently. If you want to use it outside, then you need to move the transmitter (and the music device) outside of your home and connect it to the outside outlet.3. THE HEADPHONE: It is comfortable, adjustable, but bit heavy (it has 2 AAA rechargeable batteries  - 1 on each side). So you need to get used to it. It has power, volume, dynamic bass boost, and 3D surround buttons on the right side of the headphone - which are small buttons, but great option. Since it covers your ears, it may cause you to sweat a little if you move around.4. THE TRANSMITTER: The transmitter comes with many options (power plug accessories for international usage) and cables for different electronic devices (TV, iPod, CD & Radio Player, etc). There is NO battery option for the transmitter. It needs to be plugged to the outlet all the time to be used. Also, the transmitter is used as rechargeable station for your headphone (the headphone has 2 AAA rechargeable battery on each side), which is an excellent idea. Also note that when you use the headphone - you MUST power on the transmitter AND the headphone each time you use it. There is no auto-power on.Overall, I LOVE this product - yes, it is a bit pricey, but it is a quality built and can be used with many electronic devices in the home. My wife loves it, when I go to bed she puts the wireless headphone on and watches TV from the bed - enjoying its undisturbed sound without disturbing me!

    ","Great headphones. I use to use the RS120 analog model for TV & movie listening and it worked well enough, though you could hear hiss and interference, especially when moving around. The RS170's are a major upgrade. None of the hiss and interference of the analog model and more clarity. It's a well engineered and well designed product (with a few exceptions regarding having to manually power on the base and headset).The clarity and lack of interference is because the headphones (according to the manual) claim that it transmits CD-quality uncompressed digital audio.Yes, it's expensive, but if you use it a lot then it's worth it.I use mine by plugging them into the headphone jack on my Denon receiver when I don't want to use the speakers hooked up to the receiver. I then check to make sure the receiver is at an appropriate volume and that the transmitter and headset are both on. The green LEDs on the both parts will flash slowly.By the way, these are a ""closed"" design so noise from around you is greatly attenuated. This can be a plus or con. The RS120's I used before were more open.The digital transmission does create a slight delay, but it's unlikely you'll notice it unless you also have the TV speakers on.Also, I find the range perfectly adequate for my needs.Oh, they also came with 2 high-quality AAA Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries. Including batteries of this caliber shows you they're serious about quality.TIP: To turn on the transmitter and headset, HOLD the power buttons down for about 1 second. Because the power buttons are ""multi-function"" buttons, how long you hold the button down changes the function.UPDATE 2013-12-20: I'm lowering my rating to 4 stars. I have had some issues with this that I never had with the RS120, and that's getting no sound from the headphones. These are not as dummy proof to operate as the RS120s.

Big disadvantage is that in order to adjust volume I have to see buttons therefore I must take the phones off my head each time I adjust sound, which makes using these phones very inconvenient. There are two buttons ""Bass"" and ""Surround"" on the phones, which make very little change of sound if any and can be excluded because multitude of buttons makes control even more difficult. When I take the phones off the base I have to manually turn on both transmitter and phones. They must've switched on and off automatically when phones are taken from the base or put back.

    ","I read many reviews of these headphones both glowing and critical and I do not recall reading anything about the buzz that comes through when music starts. If you are listening to something soft and relatively quiet you will hear a very audible buzz that begins before or when the music starts. If the music pauses the buzz will stop and the headphones will become quiet until the music resumes...and the buzz returns with it. If the music is quiet the buzz actually overpowers it. I've tried these on 3 different sources and the buzz is present in all cases. A song that easily demonstrates this weakness is Windham Hill Sanctuary Disk 2 (Electric) - Track 12: Pittsburgh 1901. The intro is a very subtle build up that is largely low frequencies but very quiet - the buzzing completely destroys the effect and is much louder than many points in the actual track.I wanted these closed headphones to create a quiet listening environment so I could listen to music at a lower volume. Unfortunately these do not work for this application.I bought these through an authorized Sennheiser dealer yesterday and I am returning them tonight. I think I may be expecting too much from wireless technology.EDIT:I returned the headphones today and discussed the issue with the fellow audiophile working in Magnolia HiFi. He did a quick search on the web and found various reports of the buzzing issue. Here's one I found when I got home: [...] They describe exactly what I experienced. Bottom line: lots of people have noticed and complained about this issue...just nobody on Amazon I guess. So be aware that this appears to be a function of the design and not a defect of the pair I bought. FWIW...I exchanged the RS170s for a pair of Denon AH-D600 phones. Yes, they cost twice what the Sennheisers were but they are the best I have heard and also have excellent sound isolation.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Nobody else hears the buzzing?

    ","This review is more for the layman and not the audiophile. Audiophiles will find something wrong in anything that is introduced into the market because I've found that they are looking for perfection and it just doesn't exist. I know, I've read reviews by these folks and I have a tendency to take parts of their reviews with a grain although they do give me much needed information that a ""regular guy"" usually doesn't submit in a review and that I require soo ... much respect and thanks to the audiophiles here!I bought this, the Sennheiser RS 170 Digital Wireless Headphone System, to replace my Sennheiser T150. My T150 started to fall into disrepair so I researched out a better system than an infrared one (stay away from infrared!). I settled on the RS170 and not the RS180 because of the bass boost after reading reams of reviews comparing the two. I finally compared the two technically on Sennheisers website to educate myself as to the differences. I discovered what those technical differences were and decided on the RS170s based on my personal listening preferences, which is basically what the differences boil down to. I'm sure the RS180 is as quality a product as the 170s, I just like my bass and money :O)After buying and receiving it via an authorized Ebay seller of Sennheiser products (for the wonderfully low price of $188.00!) I've used it for about a week now. I was impressed with the packaging which is very protective of the contents. My RS170s were brand new and unmolested so I followed the instructions for wiring and battery charging. After waiting the 16 hours of initial charge time I couldn't wait to put them on. Wow! Just ... Wow! The difference of sound between the T150 and the RS170 is miles apart! The surround sound is awesome, the bass boost is very impressive. I'm just in awe of the technology required to achieve the low end that is conveyed in such a small speaker unit in them. To qualify myself, I am a mobile DJ and have been since 1988. So, even though I'm not an audiophile, I know a thing or two about audio reproduction and sound quality.I have a pair of hardwired Pioneer DJ Headphones (HDJ1000, discontinued) and the quality of sound absolutely rivals my Pioneers and I would deem them slightly better! And my Pioneers are no slouch! With my RS170s I can ""crank it up"" almost as much as my Pioneers and I can not detect any to very little distortion at the highest volume setting, just like my Pioneers. I'm using my Pioneers as a comparison model because, well, I've not heard anything in my life that can compare and I've sampled many dozens of brands and models!I'll use a 1 - 10 system of scoring;• The highs are crisp without being ""screeching"" and searing your brain, 9 of 10.• The lows hit hard. Not like a real sub woofer based sound system would but for headphones they do impress, 9.5 of 10.• Surround sound is very, very nice, 9.5 of 10.• Volume max is fairly loud. I doubt anyone will crank them up as loud as they can go simply because it will damage your hearing but if you like it loud I give it 8 of 10 because they could be louder. Again, I would think very few of you would listen at the higher levels and I seriously doubt many of you will go beyond the level of ""5"". At volume levels of 5 and 6 they sound fabulous!• Physical comfort is a 7.5 of 10. They are a bit snug and cover your ears completely so you won't hear much outside of them, such as the wifey trying to say something to you (I consider this feature an 11 of 10 lol!), but the padding and synthetic covering are very, very soft. I do love the fact that you can take the ear padding off and replace it with a simple twist and that Sennheiser offers replacement pads! I find that after some listening time (an hour or so?) I have to grab them and pull them apart off of my ears for a few seconds because of the pressure. This could be because of my head size but I doubt it as I wear a 6 7/8ths hat size and the circumference around my ears isn't much bigger. So if you're sensitive to this you may want consider compromising and doing what I do, pulling them off for a few seconds, as the overall quality is worth it to me. There are times when I don't even notice this for a while until I do take them off to do chores or what not and then I can ""feel it"". It would be nice if these were adjustable in that way, hence the lower score.• Same soft padding/covering on the connecting bar going over the top of your head. As a DJ this is imperative and noticeable since wearing headphones is constant, 10 of 10.• Recharge time after the initial 16 hours is a 9 of 10. They recharge very quickly. Less than an hour.• Listening time is outstanding, 10 of 10. I've yet to discharge the batteries completely and I use them for hours at a time. Sometimes 10 and beyond! I suspect that volume levels and the other optional settings could discharge the batteries faster but I do have them always set to surround and the bass boost is turned on with the volume set at around 2 or 3.• Wireless distance is impressive as well, 9.5 of 10. I can walk outside and still receive a signal through several walls for about 40 feet. I can go use my restroom and still get a signal, about 20 feet and several walls. Quality of sound does not decrease with this, maxing out the listening distance!• The transmitting unit does look very attractive sitting on top of my entertainment center, 10 of 10. Easy to see indicator lights to see what settings you have on/off. I personally like their ""look"".• The control and setting buttons on the headphones itself is something I'm still getting used to. The buttons are close together but they are a decent size. Sometimes I go to turn the volume down and will mute it instead as the mute button is in between the volume + & - buttons. Behind those are the surround sound and bass boost buttons which are smaller. It's a matter ""reading braille"" with this but I suspect that this is something that I will get used to, 8.5 of 10 for now with a potential to move up in score.• Sennheiser customer service ... is something I've never had to employ as every Sennheiser product I've ever used has performed as described and adequately. So I can't give a score on that. YMMV ...Overall I can find nothing to be unhappy about with the RS170s. I am thoroughly satisfied with them. The products on this level are pricey for those who have to save the money needed to buy something with their price tag but I can say that they are worth every penny! The prices here on Amazon are very decent and there are authorized Sennheiser dealers on Ebay, where you may find slightly better prices. If you're looking to pinch that penny a little harder and don't mind some minor cosmetic flaws then I would urge you to consider buying a set used. I considered this option myself but when I found the unit, that I bought for the price I bought it at, new ... I couldn't resist! And I'll not be returning them unless they catch fire or something crazy like that! ;O)As mentioned above I have only had and used mine for about a week now. If I feel the need to edit this review I will but once I've made up my mind about something I usually don't change it unless I'm compelled with a very good reason. Suffice it to say that if my RS170s continue on as described above there will be no need to edit. I will try to remember, at the six month mark, to come back and at least edit it to say: Still going strong! ... and/or any other pertinent info.I'll check in from time to time, looking for any questions anyone may have and I'll answer them to the best of my abilities.

    ","Unfortunately, none of the digital headphone systems will allow you to watch TV with your loved ones.

    ","I bought these headphones as it seemed they'd have very little sound delay.  They combined the words 'digital' and 'uncompressed' in the marketing speak, making me believe I was getting something that would work significantly better than the highest quality bluetooth phones.  I planned to use them for watching movies.Other reviews talk about a sound delay.  The sound delay is definitely way bigger than it could (should?) be.  For 44KHz samples, and since these advertise 'CD' quality, the A-D D-A process should add at most a couple of sample period's delay to the signal, and certainly not anything noticable to the human ear, we should be talking hundreds of microseconds (1/44100 of a sec), not the 50mS that some people are experiencing.  This isn't actually such a problem for me, as my media player (Asus O!Play) lets me compensate for this by advancing or retarding the sound.  Other commenters have said this conversion delay contributes to the lag, but that's not it.  Unfortunately Senheiser are also buffering the sound, presumably chopping it up into packets prior to radio transmission.  This is the only explanation I can come up with, just like an mp3 player does for it's encoding blocks (which will add a further delay if listening to such material).  So this isn't the final story, and it seems there's another generation of devices that needs to get introduced before we finally get wireless movie sound that anyone could consider 'videophile' (if such a word exists).But the above isn't the reason why I'm seriously thinking of returning these.  It's the sound drop-outs during quiet periods.  How incredibly stupid to produce a pair of phones at this price, and add a feature which changes the sound representation, but not provide any means of disabling it!  What exactly were they thinking?  ""Oh let's save the user a tiny amount of electricity by stopping transmission"" or was it ""Let's save the user a bit of bandwidth in on their 2.4GHz wifi network so their in-house internet data transmission runs just that bit faster"".  No, my mistake, it was to save a bit of batter powery in the receivers, because 24h listening time on one charge is only just enough right?  Myself, I just prefer about 4-5 hours listening time WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTIONS.  Is that too much to ask?  For Sennheiser, the answer it seems is yes.Another review mentions the switch at the back of the unit which he says switches the above feature off.  It does no such thing.  All the slide switch does is introduce attenuation on the input, presumably you switch on attenuation when you're driving the transmitter from a headphone socket and switch it off when driving from line levels.  In practice it may reduce the problem because it increases the level of noise on the input of the transmitter.  The transmitter sees some nice static and then says 'ah, ok, there's sound there', and continues to transmit during the quiet periods regardless.  So what you are doing is chucking more noise into your sound loop for the sake of keeping this pile of junk happy.  And there was me thinking that noise was the enemy in my audio setup, and buying components to reduce it every step of the way.So really, to enjoy a movie without drop-out you need to:a) Use the headphone out socket on your amp exclusively, you can't use the line out adapter provided because you need to adjust the level.  That means ugly clutter permanently stuck in the front of your amp.  Bit of a shame when they put so much effort into the look of the RS170, I feel.b) Find quiet moment in the movie, people talking with no background music is the worst affected.c) Crank up the volume on your amp, fiddle with the switch at the back, whatever, until the dropout goes away, or just crank up the volume until you hear noise when the movie isn't playing, that tends to do it.d) Reduce the volume on the phones so you don't deafen yourself.It sort-of works OK like that, but I get the suspicion the dynamic range will be adversely affected.  If the next gen. has HDMI/spdiff pass-through for people who want digi all the way to the phones then this kind of thing won't be available to you, so let's hope Sennheiser see sense and stop this kind of nonsense in the future.The other problem noted by others is that stupid 'on' button.  They should have put it on the top of the unit, because you pick the phones up with one hand, and then you still need two hands to press that button.  If it were a router form factor you'd be able to put your finger on top of it to hold it steady while you pressed the button.  In this case, I guess you try to put fingers either side of it, or else you super-glue it down to the shelf it's on.  Again, what on earth were they thinking?  Did anyone try the thing out before they shipped it?  It should really, really have switched itself on when you picked up the phones.  Even my £15 battery charger knows when I take the batteries out, was that so hard?On the plus side the phones are comfortable, but then so are all my other high-end phones (I mean the ones I spent more than £50 on).  There's a little more pressure than I'm used to but that helps to block external sounds.  You won't hear much when people talk to you with them on, even if you pause a movie but that's not a con.Hope this helps.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed given the cost

    ","I bought the older Sennheiser wireless headphones (analog) two years ago. I wore them almost every day and liked them, except that the volume control wore out. I took it apart, cleaned it, and it worked perfectly after that.I bought the HDR 170 two months ago. The sound is better and they are comfortable. However, I have three complaints. First, the volume controls are difficult to use. There are five buttons - up volume, on/off, down volume, surround, and bass. No problem if you take off the headphones and look at the buttons, but while you're wearing them you can't feel which button is which, so I turn the headphones off when I want to change the volume, etc. Sennheiser should have made the buttons feel different.The second problem is that the range is shorter. With the old analog headphones I could go in the backyard to hang laundry and the sound was weak and scratchy, but I could hear it. With the HDR 170 headphones the sound switches on and off annoyingly. Our house isn't big, if you live in a big house you might lose reception in some rooms.The third problem is interference. When I'm in the kitchen and switch on the microwave oven, the headphones shut off the sound. Even small electric motors such as my desoldering iron make the headphones switch off.I listen to podcasts and audiobooks so sound quality isn't important to me. If you want audiophile sound quality, buy the HDR 170. If you want range and lack of interference from appliances, stay with the older analog headphones.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor range compared to analog models

In the end I chose it because of the KLEER Technology and the fact that it had a charging base station (missing in the RS-160) and was not as expensive as the RS-180. The sound quality is great. No disturbance at all. The range is great too. I can listen to the radio or listen to music while moving around our house (2 levels) without any disruption or disturbance. I would highly recommend this product.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality and range and super easy to use!
1734,"on February 8, 2015",,Great headphones-comfortable with excellent sound.  I especially like using them while playing blu-ray discs.The only small negative-I had a bit of trouble with the set-up.  I think the instructions could be a little clearer.The headphones are well worth the price.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones

    ","I've only had the RS 170 phones for a few days. I had expected to rate them 10 stars because of the excellent crystal-clear sound; but I believe they have a flaw that may render them unacceptable for some people (see CONS, below). I'm giving them 4 stars because they are so good - I should probably rate them either excellent or ""not acceptable"".Here is my take - you may not have the same experience or have the same needs or expectations.TYPES OF WIRELESS HEADPHONES: For those that don't know, there are broadly 3 ways by which wireless headphones receive their signal:IR (infrared) -- these use a line-of-sight signal and avoid radio interference. They have the disadvantages of short range and reduced mobility (you have to remain within sight of the base station), but they usually do produce a clean sound.900 MHz -- these are analogue radio headphones. The main disadvantage is susceptibility to hiss and other noise, especially when you move your head or move to another room.2.4 GHz -- these are digital radio headphones, like the RS 170, and are more likely to be free from hiss and noise.I bought the RS 170 phones to replace cheap ones I've been using for late-night TV, and which operate on 900 MHz, providing constant hiss, much worse when I move about.The RS 170 sound brilliant. I've used them for late night TV and movies, and for music (radio and CDs) allowing me to move to other rooms in the house. They're comfortable to wear and I'm sure they'd be great for use on a treadmill or working out. All over my home, and in most of the garden, the sound is crystal clear with no hiss or extraneous noise. Except, that is, for the echo ...CONS: Having read scores of reviews of wireless headphones, it seems that some people buy them to listen to movies/ music without disturbing other people. For that these phones are brilliant.But some people buy wireless headphones because they have hearing loss (or just want the clarity that headphones provide) and use them to watch TV while their spouse listens through the TV speakers. The RS 170 phones seem to operate with a slight time shift (delay). If the loudspeakers are also on, albeit at low volume, the effect of the time shift is to produce an ECHO - this is very noticeable with dialogue, and is really annoying.It might mean that if you listen to movies/ TV, and have the sound coming through the TV speakers as well, the RS 170 phones may not be acceptable.If you turn the TV speakers down (or ""mute"") you won't notice the effect, but then no-one else in the room will be able to hear anything unless they have headphones as well.The RS 170 are of a ""closed"" design, which means that sound is not supposed to leak out, and in combination with the comfortable ear-pads, they greatly attenuate ambient noise - but they don't eliminate ambient noise completely (they are not ""noise-cancelling""). I wrote to SennheiserUSA 2 days ago, and received this prompt response:""The RS 170 should block out the sound of the TV speakers. Check tosee that you have them on correctly so that there is a nice seal toblock out ambient noise.Let me know if you have any additional questions.""Eric PalonenSennheiser Headphones + Headsets1 Enterprise DriveOld Lyme, CT 06371""It's true that the ear-pad seal does greatly attenuate ambient sound, but it does not eliminate it. The problem is so serious that I cannot use the phones to watch TV if my girlfriend is watching also.The more expensive model RS 180 is an ""open"" design - the echo problem is likely to be even worse. The more I think about this, the more I am torn -- if you have significant hearing loss, you might not notice, or care about, the echo.OTHER FEATURES:-- sound: The quality of the sound is better than I'd expected.Listening to movies, I hear subtle sounds that I can't hear with loudspeakers. I can only describe the sound as crisp and clean with adequate, but not booming, bass.I listened to some classical music CDs (Elgar) with delicate sounds as well as a full orchestra and timpani. The detail is excellent; even when I walk up my driveway the sound eventually cuts out, but there is no hiss as far as I can tell. My previous headphones were all hiss and crackle as I moved away from the base.-- price. These are expensive, and may not be discounted for quite some time.-- buttons. Lots of people criticised the prior design (RS 130/ 140) because the rotating volume control could catch on a pillow and move. The RS 170 has buttons for volume, mode, plus bass and [faux] surround sound. The disadvantage of buttons is that they're hard to find by touch alone. I think some people people may wind up taking the phones off to press the buttons. One advantage of the design is that the volume-up button is closest to the front and it doesn't take much practice to find it with your right thumb or finger. The BASS and SURROUND controls can be activated from the base unit.  With only a little practise, I can now find the buttons by touch; they are well designed, in my opinion.-- bass. The bass is not intrusive, even with the ""bass boost"" engaged. Fine for me, but some people like exaggerated bass for rock-N-roll, and they may find the bass to be light.-- surround sound. It's simlated surround sound, and I haven't used it enough to have an opinion.-- charging batteries - yes they need 16 hours for first charge, but it only takes a moment to slip in standard alkaline batteries (just don't leave them in when you put the headset on the charger).-- connecting - connecting is very easy - I took the time to route the wires through the coiled conduit. Some people will want to connect to a TV set. I connected to an AV receiver (I used ""tape monitor out"") so I can quickly switch between TV, radio and CD player. I also connected them to my iPod, but somehow that seems like a tautology.-- range - Sennheiser claim 260 feet range. My house was built to defeat cell phone signals and may not be a good test. They work all over the house and in some of the garden and the driveway, but they do cut out at much less than 260 feet. That may just be a feature of my house. I didn't buy them for extreme range and I'm very satisfied.In summary I think these phones are great - they so enhance the experience of watching a movie that I'm not sure I want to forgo them when watching movies with my girlfriend. The echo problem may be a deal breaker for some.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound - pity about the echo ...

    ","They are BIGThey are HEAVYThey are TIGHTThe pads are not thick enoughAfter watching one movie with these on my left ear hurt because the phones are so tight and the metal under the fabric lining pressed against the upper cartilage. I have not experienced this with any other phones.I found myself continually trying to adjust the fit of these for more comfort, and to no avail. They are too tight no matter what you do.The plastic pads feel hot against the skin. I was aware of some light sweat below the pads, even in a cool house. I'm a bit apprehensive as to what they will be like in the summer.Besides the issues of comfort, the control buttons on the phones have no tactile cues. You need to remember the positions of the buttons and what they do. The only raised glyph is on the ON-OFF button and you need to locate that and go from there, feeling for the flat button surfaces. Why anyone would want to turn the phones off and on while wearing them is beyond me. Seems like the volume controls are more significant while worn.The sound quality is fine for me, but with the comfort issues I don't think i'll be putting these on for pleasure of listening, only so that I may watch while others have quiet.I really did NOT expect to find such ergonomic issues with these top-of-the-line phones from such a well respected company, and I bought them online without trying a pair on.

    ","I bought these expensive wireless earphones. Here are my complaints after a year or more of use every day.1. The design is terrible. Every time you pick them up you have to push a tiny button on the charging unit so that it starts to blink. Then you have to push an even tinier button on the headphones and hold the headphones near the charging unit so they will sink. These buttons are rediculously small and hard to see or push. About 30% of the time, the button on the charging unit doesn't work until you unplug and replug the power cord to the charging unit. All in all, a very poor design. They fit comfortably and when they work they work fine. But whoever designed these was a typical designer - make it pretty but who cares about the user?2. After a year of use they started ""eating batteries."" Every couple of months they would stop working and I'd open them up and the batterie would be leaking all over the inside. I kept cleaning them off with baking soda and putting in new batteries, different brands of batteries, brand new batteries, you name it ... but it kept happening. Finally I just got fed up with them and through them in the junk drawer. I went back to my Sony wireless earphones which cost a third of these monsters and have lasted for 10 years. With the Sony earphones all you do is pick them up and put them on and they work every time.Do not buy sennheiser products. They are overpriced and poorly designed...in my opinion.
