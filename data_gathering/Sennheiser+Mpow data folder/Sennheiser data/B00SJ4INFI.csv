    ","I’ve been having an awful time trying to hear the dialogue in television shows and movies.  Some degree of hearing loss on my part contributes to the problem.  And we’re all familiar with bad sound from modern television sets.  Poor acoustics in the room can add to difficulty hearing what’s on TV.Another part of the problem is the heavy-handed approach television and movie producers use with respect to the music and sound effects in their productions.  Pushing audio levels to the max is the new normal, often at the expense of speech intelligibility.  These “hot mixes” cover up voices and seemingly nobody cares.  Perhaps you’ve noticed this same phenomenon at live music performances where inexperienced sound board operators have no clue about protecting the vocals from being lost under the instruments.Also contributing to hard-to-hear television programs, studios don’t always achieve clean recordings of actors’ voices.  They’re using wireless microphones hidden inside clothing, wigs, etc.  Too often the result is muffled or off-mic recordings.  One would think production facilities in the 21st century would be capturing squeaky-clean dialogue.  Not so much.Any reasonably good headphones, wired or wireless, will help solve some of the issues I mentioned.  Bringing the sound up close to your ears eliminates bad sound from inadequate TV speakers and from poor room acoustics.  Headphones can’t correct poorly recorded voices but can improve your chances of understanding what the performers are saying.Having a background in professional sound recording, I tend to look at audio equipment as tools for specific applications.  To match my application of improving TV sound, the RS-195 has two particular features that convinced me to purchase it over other products:  Personal Hearing Profiles and Sound Optimization for Speech.Personal Hearing Profiles have a variety of settings (A through G) to shape the audio response characteristics for sound that you find most pleasing and/or intelligible.  After trying them all, I selected setting “E” which rolls off (decreases) bass to give me a better balance of lows and highs, based on my hearing needs.  Sennheiser’s lawyers told them to say:  “This device does not replace or function in the same way as a hearing aid and is not a medical product.”  So I’ll just say it aids my hearing enough to make a noticeable improvement.Profile settings shift the bass and treble to varying degrees.  Sennheiser puts it this way:  “We were able to build unique sound settings that are perfectly adapted to the needs of individuals with mild to moderate hearing loss.”  This may not be the product for people with severe hearing loss, but if you can try a pair it could be worth the experiment.  For those with no hearing loss, full-range frequency response can be selected.How effective is Sound Optimization for Speech?  Frankly I wasn’t expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.  With the press of a button, voices seem to come forward out of the noise.  This is digital signal processing that, in effect, re-mixes the sound track to emphasize voices.  Sennheiser says:  “Speech intelligibility is improved as annoying noise is reduced.”  They’re right about that but perhaps too modest.  This is audio magic, achieving complex audio processing not ordinarily heard in consumer electronics.  The annoying noise that’s being reduced is the overly-loud music and sound effects that are no longer allowed to make us struggle to hear what’s being said.  Now I can comfortably listen to TV for hours at a time and can hear voices and subtle details better than ever.Sound Optimization for Speech would have been enough digital signal processing for me.  Happily, Sennheiser includes a second processing mode they call Sound Optimization for Music Reproduction.  When activated, sound from the RS-195 becomes significantly fatter/fuller.  The effect is dramatic and, to me, very satisfying.  Keep in mind this mode works in conjunction with the Personal Hearing Profile.  That’s a good thing.  It’s a better experience listening to my favorite music through a sound system adjusted for the way I need to hear.  I wear the headphones while on the treadmill . The music sounds so good, my workouts are lasting longer all the time!After several weeks of ownership it occurred to me that I hadn’t tried Sound Optimization for Music Reproduction on movies.  Very nice results and, as with music listening, the sound becomes more full and dramatic.I recommend the RS-195 and intend to buy a second set for the bedroom.",5.0 out of 5 stars,RS-195 Review by a Retired Audio Recording Engineer

    ","I5 years ago I was diagnosed with 65% hearing loss--I now have severe hearing loss.  My major problems are understanding the clarity of speech and identifying direction and identity of sounds. Could only watch tv and not listen to it because none of the speech made sense.  I bought a bluetooth hearing aid transmitter to use with my high tech $10k hearing aids and found that the bluetooth transmitter did not work to improve clarity and the bluetooth transmission would break up as soon as I tuned to walk away from the tv.  So, I had to sit still in front of the tv.I received these Sennheiser 195's today.  It took me,  (a 61 year old who is afraid of electronics),  1/2 hour to set up the headphones.  Loading the batteries is easy.  The headphones are so comfortable.  The volume and on/off buttons are conveniently located. All of the hearing modes work so you can customize your hearing experience.  I can hear through upstairs walls,  downstairs walls and about 50 feet outside so far.  I intend to keep testing the outside line of sight  distance.  There is a little sporadic breakup in transmission when standing in front of a microwave.  To make a long story short,  I recommend these headphones.  I can hear tv  so well with these headphones.  I am so thankful that tools like this are available to help the hearing impaired as well as to provide a more  enjoyable hearing experience for those who hear well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,THANK YOU SENNHEISER  !!!!!!!!!!

    ","If you are having difficulty listening to the dialogue while watching your TV, then you definitely need the Sennheiser RS 195 RF Wireless Headphone System. It is specially designed for people with hearing impairment with 7 selectable mode to suit individual needs. In addition, you can also choose to enhance and optimize the headphone for speech or music listening. With the Sennheiser, I no longer need to look at the sub title and I can now just sit back, relax and enjoy the movie. Listening to music with the Sennheiser is also pure joy. I would strongly recommend the Sennheiser RS195 RF for those with hearing impairment.

    ","I have had these a few weeks now and am overall very happy with them.  I have moderate age related hearing loss and on the verge or needing hearing aids according to my audiologist. Since I am retired, having ""good"" hearing is not important to me.  Especially when I consider the high cost and hassle of fooling with the darn things. The only important deficit I notice is not being able to understand the dialogue on the TV. Maybe 6 years ago I bought 2 Sennheiser Headsets (840 series.)  I got both the infrared version and the RF version.  I prefer the RF version as the sound does not cut out when you turn away from the TV, or when something comes between you and the base station (like a bowl of popcorn.)  The thing I did not like about these stethoscope-looking headsets is that they never remained pointed down the ear canal. They would always slip a mm or 2,  and transmit the sound up against the soft tissue of the ear. I was constantly fiddling with them.  When one of my 840s finally broke I was excited to buy the new RS-195 I had been reading about. These are a big improvement. They don't need constant adjusting so the sound goes down the ear canal. The RS195s are a big jump forward in most respects. They have more adjustment to fine tune for the type of hearing boost you need. They also block out other sound in the room. They are not capable of playing as loud as the 840s but I do not require that with my level of hearing.  The 840s had a volume dial that went from 0-6.  I would say the RS195s max volume output (with speech correction on) might be 4 on that same scale.  The rechargeable batteries seem fine for my purposes as they have never failed even after many hours of use. The only minor complaint I have  is that the top of your head gets a little sore after a while. This is a complaint that I have had with every headphone I've worn.  If you have more profound hearing loss, these will not help you.  Many reviewers have complained they don't go load enough. If that is the case you may be better buying a less expensive normal headphone and look for one that says it can play LOUD.  Make sure it is an over the ear version so you can keep that loudness too yourself.  Also put on the closed caption option on your cable or Netflix systems.  If you want to see if they will work for you, make sure there is a good return policy.  Amazon is usually pretty good about that.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great if you have ""moderate"" hearing loss"

    ","The 'personal' settings are very nice, but if a little more LOUD is needed it is best to go to the other setting and use as regular headphone. The sounds are excellent. The headset is a perfect fit and should fit all heads without putting rolled up washcloth under head band to hit the ear. There may be complaint about cost. If one must replace headsets more than every 8-10 years the problem is with the manufacturer. The cost to purchase the split adapter is very high (to change to analog), but if it is possible to purchase this item (perhaps from Sennheiser  is advisable) do it before it becomes obsolete.There will always be the usual interference depending on exactly WHERE one is standing (outside); the interference indoors does not exist and the interference OUTside is not STATIC, it is just the usual dead zone.Make the investment for pure sound.The FIT is perfect, the SOUND is perfect, controls are easy to operate from head or terminal. Nobody could ask for more.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow.

    ","I've had to wear hearing aids for about a year now.  I had to spend about $5,000 for the basic hearing aids and then another $200 for a streaming device to plug into the optical output.  Then, I have to play with the app on my phone (play with the app is true....this particular app is rated 1 star) to get it to stream a tinny sound from my TV.  I can't outline how many frustrating hours it took to get this marginal device to work.THEN!!  I discovered the Sennheiser RS 195 RF wireless headphones!

    ","Pros:I love these for the great sound.  The ""Speech mode"" is _really_ effective; I was surprised and impressed.  For me it's the killer feature, because my hearing isn't great, and I have a hard time understanding speech on the TV.  I agree with the other revewiers who say this is a ""headphone for the hearing impaired"".  It's worth the price.For music the sound is also really great (in ""high dynamic range"" mode).  Even with my poor hearing I can tell a big difference between this and other headsets.The battery life seems pretty good.  And I really like that the batteries can be removed for a quick change if you've forgotten to recharge, or need to use them all day.Noise isolation is also superb.  I must take them off if somebody wants to talk to me.Cons:The ""330 foot"" range is totally BS (or at least, only exists under ideal conditions).  In my home the maximum range is around 25 feet with 1 intervening wall.  This is after following the advice on their website to reduce interference.  At 25 feet with 2 intervening walls I need to turn off my Wifi to avoid interference.  Note that the signal doesn't degrade gracefully:  rather than gradually increasing amounts of static, you start getting intermittent sound, then it just shuts down.  (This is typical for digital transmissions, and whether it's good or bad is a matter of taste.)It's really annoying that you have to press the On button for several seconds before it turns on.  Every. Single. Time.  Designers, please stop doing this to us!The latency is noticable (but not severe), around 100ms.  Fortunately my TV has a setting to adjust for this.While the Speech Mode is really great, the other numbered modes are pretty lame; they sound just like different levels of high/low balance.The charging stand isn't designed very well; it's extremely difficult to put the headphones back on the stand with one hand.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Outstanding sound, Speech Mode, noise reduction.

    ","1.  ECHO -- Echo [apparent when TV volume is up] cited by others is sometimes a bit annoying.  This did not happen with the Sony r.f. [radio frequency] RF headphones I formerly used [audio was very good but ear cushions were falling apart from old age].  Turning down the TV helps but this is a limited fix if you don't want other viewers in the room attacking you.  These units are sold with a promise to improve speech intelligibility for those with hearing problems, which they do admirably.  The delay might well be due to the signal processing done to accomplish this speech intelligibility improvement.2.  CLOSED HEADSET -- The headphones surround and enclose the ears [soft padded cushions rest on skull] rather than resting on the ears or inserting in the ear canal.  The good news is that they block ambient noise [washing machines, other audio sources, background noise, teenagers] and don't irritate the ears themselves.  The bad news is that some may find them a bit warm in the summer or when wearing them for a long time.  This is not a product fault but just a characteristic of this style of headphone.  Basically it's a matter of taste and personal preference, but I find they enhance the audio experience and fidelity [when not using the signal processing which enhances speech intelligibility at the necessary expense of some fidelity].3.  NET-NET -- I'd recommend them to a friend.  I feel that they are well designed technically to do what they promise, are well build and sturdy, and improve my audio experience [I have some diminished low and high frequency hearing loss -- as people age, they naturally lose increasing amounts of high frequency sensitivity, which makes distinguishing some consonants - like b,c,d,f,p,s,t for example - difficult, thus making speech intelligibility problematic, especially in the presence of background noise or foreign accents].  Aging is not for wimps, but then again being an ""elder"" is an honor that understandably takes work.Cheers.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Headphones that Help Dialog Understanding When Needed

    ","I almost gave it five.  For sound, I'd say a five.  I went to this from an RS 180. I noticed the improvement.  I wouldn't say overwhelming but maybe a little more solid bass and a little more clarity in voice. I know that because there was a word in a movie I couldn't hear until I used these.  Didn't happen much but I guess that is an indicator of improvement. I didn't give it a five because I find the headphones a little too tight and a tad less comfortable than the RS 180.  Maybe that's part of the tradeoff for a closed design but these also don't have as soft a material around the ears as the RS 180 had.  I've gotten used to it but I find my ears sweat a little more. It's been worth the move because of better sound and clarity.  It would have been even better if the fit and comfort were just a tad better and, of course, that can vary from person to person.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Five Quality Sound - 4 Quality Fit Compared to RS 180

    ","The volume and audio quality of my RS 195's were both acceptable before attempting to use the ""mode"" and ""personal hearing"" functions. After paying over $362 for my RS 195's I expected that those functions would further improve the quality of the audio.  The opposite was true because activating those functions, in any combination, limited the volume to an inadequate level and degraded the audio quality which I had experience before I activated the functions.

    ","Nice quality setup, comfortable head set, easy set up.  Two stars for the hearing impaired, maybe a great unit for everyone else!If you need hearing aids for everyday living with significant hearing loss, these may not be for you DESPITE the descriptions of ""enhanced speech"" and other functions.  Sure, the balance adjustment is nice.  However, when you use ANY of the hearing enhancement programs or the music / speech selections there is a severe limitation in the available volume.I have been using wireless headphones in the evenings to listen to TV / iPad for years.  I prefer my hearing aids out to rest my canals.  Sennheiser is my preferred provider and I have a couple of their $100 range wireless sets that work fine but purchased the RS 195's for enhancement of speech distinction.  With high frequency hearing loss, as I turn up the volume speech gets ""bass heavy"" with the less expensive models.I installed the 195's to a separate amplifier in place of my Sennheiser TR 120's.  Everything worked except the volume was quite low even if the amplifier volume was max out and the headphones were on full volume.  I could barely distinguish speech because the volume was so low.  If there had been any ambient noise, I would have required cc to understand the news program.  All the adjustments worked and it didn't matter if I used the RCA or the optical inputs.The Sennheiser web site was very good and prompt help.  They told me if I turned off ALL the enhancement features [there is a mode button that you can push and hold that turns off all these features] that the volume would be restored.  It worked as promised HOWEVER, that turns my $371 headphones into a $100 unit.  My hearing is not keen enough to distinguish optical from RCA inputs.The help site agreed that the description of this product should have been more forthcoming about the volume issue.

    ","Performance was a serious disappointment. These headphones will not deliver above modest volume even when turned up to its highest setting. Adequate for dialogue, but for audio accompanying action scenes, the audio level is very poor, and that's being charitable. The unit is somewhat klunky in size and configuration. Product feels cheaply built.  Buttons on the headphone are difficult to distinguish by feel.  And headphones do not easily fit onto the base station for recharging. Two hands are required, and the process of seating the headphones onto the charging pins is not smooth. Also, be aware this product can connect to audio source equipment only by means of lower performing RCA inputs or disappearing optical connections.  If you have a new generation preamp such as the fairly recently released Marantz 7703 you will be for forced to use sennheiser's older RCA connections because Marantz no longer includes any optical outputs with this preamp. Hopefully Sennheiser's replacement for this model headphone will improve on its volume and other limitations (unlikely) and lack of HDMI connectivity. Even with this product on sale, I'd recommend avoiding the headphones.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor audio level, klunky design and limited connectivity"

    ","After all the reviews and Youtube commercials, I have to say I am a bit underwhelmed. I chose the 195 because it was the top model. However, I m wondering if I would have been better off with the 175 instead. At least that has Bass Boost. This product has line level at best, and the sound is not nearly as robust as all the reviews would suggest.The construction is pedestrian, plasticie and not that comfortable. I was tempted to buy a line level amplifier after 10 minutes. This would have given me louder fuller sound that I expected. Trying to find a splitter for my Optic out for my TV was much harder than I thought. I eventually have to buy a powered Toslink S/PDIF 1x2 Splitter. The $9 passive splitters are a complete joke. Somehow I was expecting to be confronted with a gripping sound that justified going with Sennheiser-This product is over priced, should sell for $100. The fact that they have 4 models in this lineup is nothing more than a pure marketing ploy that is dubious at best. If they spent less money on differentiation and offered 2 models, they could save resources to make them more impressive products.Sony's Bluetooth with Bass boost is better and delivers a more impressive alternative. I originally replaced my Bose On Ear Soundlinc headset for this Sennheiser. I am beginning to regret it. I am not hearing a nuanced sound, clarity, and separation that sparkles, or any of the welcome artifacts that take advantage of a headset closed environment. They just built a headset that barely justifies being on my ears. I always take steps to avoid the dreaded buyers remorse. For the most part, my preparation pays off. Most people write, ""I really wanted to like this..."" I want to say that my preparation succeeded. Best advice to anyone wanting to buy this product is to ignore the 'name brand' and go out and try the alternatives in person first.

    ","These are great headphones for watching action movies privately. The sound signature seems to be designed specifically for this purpose. Bass is intense breathing life into action movies that other headphones seem to fall flat on.That being said, they really are only good for watching movies. I found the different sound signatures that can be selected on the front of the unit to not be useful (I do not suffer from hearing damage and thus don't really need to adjust the sound stage).These headphones are also not great for listening to music with. The bass overwhelms in most music types and even throttling down the lower frequencies using an equalizer (Spotify on iOS has one, for example) only turned the bass down a bit... it was still overwhelming and lowering the bass altered the sound stage and made the song sound strange. These remind me of beats headphones with the amount of bass they produce.Battery life overall was good and reception was mostly clear. I did occasionally notice micro dropouts while using the headphones when the base station was located close to my wireless router. Moving it a little further from the router seemed to eliminate these dropouts though.Overall these headphones really only seem to accomplish one goal: to watch TV with. In that case, they perform well. I otherwise wouldn't recommend them for anything else.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for movies. Music, not so much (unless you are a bass head)"

    ","Bottom line, if you have severe hearing loss and are looking for a great unit, buy the RS120. This was my second try to upgrade my existing RS120 wireless headphone purchased in 2011. I have severe hearing loss, and have been completely pleased with the RS120. Previously, I tried the RS180 and now the RS195 in an attempt to upgrade my experience. Both the RS180 and RS195 a very nice units, well built and what I have come to expect from Sennheiser. I like their sleeker charging bases as compared to the RS120, although both headsets suffered from poor design on volume and tuning controls on the headset as compared to the RS120 in my opinion. The bottom line for returning both was that I was unable to get the volume high enough to adequately hear the TV. By comparison, I can tune the RS120 to about half way on a full charge and listen to the TV very comfortably. As the charge fades I have to gradually increase the volume but rarely had to max out the volume control. I was never able to get anywhere close on either the RS180 or RS195. So I bought another RS120 (having damaged my existing headset a month ago--still works, but the left side won't stay in place). It came in yesterday, charged it overnight and am extremely happy again. Kudos to Amazon for their return pollicy. I hope Sennheiser continues to make the RS120 or maybe increases their volume controls on their newer products for folks like me.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice unit, but not for severe hearing impaired"

    ","Sound quality is good--not great, and volume is sometimes inadequate, which for a product that will be used by people with hearing issues is a problem. The digitally processed sound is a little muddy, and voices have that squeezed quality you often here from digitally processed sound. On the plus side, there's no static or interference. Build quality and fit are so-so, a bit underwhelming for a premium product at a premium price,  There are five obvious design shortcomings: Note that I've already been through two of these units, and both have the same problem--the headphones lose sync with the base station. The only solution, per Sennheiser tech support, is to unplug the base station for 15 minutes, which resets the unit. So the first design shortcoming is that there's no reset button or manual reset procedure. Letting the unit sit for 15 minutes while trying to watch a program is annoying. The first tech support call the tech told me the loss of sync was due to power-line fluctuations. The second tech support call the tech started spouting jargon and was so condescending I told him I'd call back to talk to someone else. I still don't know what the problem is, exactly, but the second design shortcoming is that this unit is much too sensitive to environmental issues and doesn't recover gracefully. I'm going to hook up a power-line conditioner to try to smooth out the power to the unit to see if that helps. The third design shortcoming is inadequate volume even at the maximum setting. The fourth design shortcoming is the absence of a USB connector for firmware updates that might correct the previous three design shortcomings. Fifth design flaw is that if you have a device that puts out a sound format that the base unit doesn't recognize, the base unit gets scrambled and you have to unplug it for 15 minutes to get it working again (see above, no reset switch). Playing a DVD through a DVD player not putting out a signal the base unit like will scramble the base unit. Hint: All audio from all equipment playing through the TV must be, if available, set to send PCM signals to the base unit.  This unit has promise. I suggest waiting for v2.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Wait for v2

Picture on instructions do not reflect what you see.  Also the on switch on the ear phones is small and not obvious.  Instructions said turn on and hold 2 seconds but do not show where switch is - on side and not where controls are.  With an optical splitter it installed and worked as advertised using a sound base.  Head phones fit nicely on my large head.  The unit looks and feels high quality.  Looking forward to using this after I take out my hearing aids.  About to order a additional one for my wife.  They do not have stand alone charging units for spare head sets.  Also the cables are very stiff.  Would be nice they were ore ""limp"" or pliable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Instructions need a tweak.

    ","The Sennheiser RS 195 wireless headphone system is something that I wanted for a couple of reasons, one for the clarity, and one for the peace of mind for someone else in the household.  Sometimes at night I like to listen to television, but it can be heard in other rooms.  To solve that problem, I simply am turning down the volume on the television, but still can hear any program with wonderful clarity.  I was a bit worried about setup, but it was actually quite easy.  It’s a plug-and-play system that even anyone who’s tech challenged can manage.Easy of setup sometimes bothers people (it does me) and can be a barrier to even considering a purchase.  There’s a quick start guide with excellent visuals that were a big help.  I pored over them even before attempting to set up and then read the even more detailed manual.  Probably the hardest thing to manage will be putting the batteries in each can.  I was thinking I’d be running into problems with my television, but was pleased that there were connection options for both analog and digital, including cables.The directions are especially detailed and easy to follow, something I certainly appreciate.  For example, the instructions are so detailed there’s even written and visual ones for one of the more intuitive controls, the volume (+).  There is also a CD if you prefer to access your instructions in that manner.  It’s a simple ten step process that isn’t intimidating, something I found easy to accomplish.  They are in three formats in 15 languages for everyone’s convenience.I was tempted to shorten to lengthy charge time of sixteen hours, but waited.  Normal charge time is 8.5 hours.  The headphones just sit on the stand when not in use, ready to be powered up.  After the charge, I made personal adjustments I did quite a bit of experimenting.  FYI, it you wear hearing aids, you’ll need to removed them because they will squeal.  I was able to walk all through my house and still have the identical clarity I had when I was standing next to the set.  Mind you, I have a post and beam structure and not a one of my Bluetooth-enabled devices have been able to challenge it without some sore of cutout.Balance control is not an issue, but I selected my own “personal hearing” mode.  For example, I can opt for a better listening profile if I want to listen to music.  On the other hand, if in this household we need better “speech reproduction” this too can be selected.  If we both want to watch television and the hearing aids are off, one can wear the Sennheisers for that clarity it offers.  There’s no muddling of sound and everything comes through quite nicely.  There are three modes to select from, each one designed to optimize the listening experience.  The mode can be changed on either the transmitter or the headphones.The sound is everything I expected it to be and the clarity is amazing.  Everything about the Sennheiser RS 195 was well-designed and well-executed.  The setup is so easy we can easily move it from one television or music set up to another.  The look is not eye-popping, but everything else makes up for the clunky look.  I wasn’t so sure that I’d fall in love with the Sennheiser, but even my husband was enamored with them when I had him test them out.  Can’t get much better than that.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser is right ... there's no missing a thing with these awesome headphones

    ","The thought that was put into these RS 195 headphones and the related sound quality is impressive. In straight ahead ""headphone mode"" if you will, the sound is clear, rich and powerful. The ""speech mode"" is as described, bringing dialogue to the forefront. The ""enhanced"" music mode doesn't over-boost the music, it's very rich especially for some recordings. NOTE: In modes besides ""normal"" headphone, the volume will be limited electronically. I believe Sennheiser did this for two reasons. First to protect the listeners hearing. It seems (to me) that the volume is limited up to about 85db and this coincides with the idea these phones have addressing hearing issues, hence the listening modes. Second reason I believe is (possibly) liability. A propitiatory design that affects hearing (loss?) if misused by the listener may be a concern. I think it is likely the first reason.What has really impressed me are the little things with these headphones. Example, when switching modes, say from straight headphone to ""enhanced"" mode the volume turns down and then slowly up in the new mode. No surprising sound burst. Each time the audio comes in at a mid-level. Just right! Nice. Another example of thought to detail is the dynamic limiting in the listening modes for upper decibel level. In layman's terms it means you can only go so high in volume before you get a quiet beeping alert you are at the threshold of levels that could be damaging to your hearing. It seems that it's at 85db. In the straight ahead headphone listening mode the sky's the limit if you need it LOUD!HOW DO THEY SOUND?Audio performance is impressive. I am an audio enthusiast with the best equipment I can afford. These had to be really good quality to win my five stars. These sound great for headphones! Rich bass, crisp highs without being tiring. Clear sound at any level. Vocals nice and clear.The base station (charger unit) is slim and the indicators are straight forward. Nice place to park the phones while charging which typically takes about an hour for every hour of listening that has been done.Connection is easy with both analog and digital. The only place in my home I have trouble keeping a connection is the kitchen which, by line of sight, has a fridge, stove and microwave between the transmitter and the phones. I have clear audio anywhere in my home, even the far corner of the basement!I highly recommend these!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Headphones!!

    ","i have had this headphone rig for a few weeks now and my first impressions are that if you are struggling with the onset of hearing difficulties this product may not be what you are looking for. in my situation i have the rs195 dac/transmitter/processor/charger connected via optical cable to a lg smart flat panel tv. at start up you have to make sure that the tv's audio output is set to PCM, i did this setup procedure and followed the headphone manual in regard to preparing the headphones for use. all steps completed, tv and headphones on and i was hearing a very weak output from the headset with the volume on the headset at max output. i tried several different combinations of processing, tried increasing the tv's volume and nothing i tried seemed to increase the headphone output to the point that i could easily hear the tv sound. i checked the package the headphones came in and sure enough the box stated that the output of the headphones is 117db. speaking from experience 117db should have been far louder than what i was hearing. so i took out my realistic model 33-2050 sound pressure meter to measure what the actual max sound pressure was. the meter was used on the ""C"" weighted flat scale, with the meters microphone place next to the headphone drivers output the meter read between 55db to 60db, changing processing on the base did not yield any measurable improvement.also noticed was that the sound continually dropped out on the headphones for a second or two while the tv speakers continued to play uninterrupted. this sound interruption on the headphone was very annoying. i gave up at that point thinking that some of the poor reviews i read were true.a few days later i tried again, when i put the headphone on i was disappointed again, they just were not loud enough especially since they are advertised for people with hearing loss. as i was listening i tried pressing the ear cups tighter to my head to see if that helped, while i was doing that all of a sudden the volume increased noticeably. i released the pressure on the ear cups and the volume stayed at the increased level. i looked at the processor/charger/base and noticed all leds with regard to signal processing were off. i then realized what i had done when holding the headset tight to my ears was turn off all signal processing. without this processing the volume jumps up to a reasonable level for someone that has hearing loss. it could be louder and is not at 117db, but it was much better. the headphone sound interruption was still present and annoying as heck.a few days latter i thought perhaps a source other than tv might have a effect on the sound interruptions i was experiencing. there was a dvd player connected to the tv so rather than use a tv station terrestrial signal as source i used the dvd player as the source. big improvement, no more interruption in headphone sound. my best guess is that slight interruptions in tv rf signals are compensated in the tv's internal sound output to its speakers but not to its optical output. since there are no interruptions in input signal with the dvd player the sound out of the headphones is not interrupted.so if you are at the onset of hearing loss and looking for a headset that you can play as loud as you want while your significant other turns down the tv's volume level in the room because of their sensitive hearing this may not be the headphones for you. if you decide to try them you may find by defeating the signal processing brings the volume to a more reasonable level.",3.0 out of 5 stars,may not be what you are looking for

    ","I have been using these wireless headphones off and on for several days and listened to a variety of Music and TV sources.I have compared them to other wired and wireless headpones side-by-side and must say the sound is very good.Sometimes, you just want a pass-through with no sound enhancement while other times, some bass, mid-range ro trebble boosts improves the listening experience.From the Smart TV, Optical Audio sounds better than L-R RCA Jacks to a 3.5mm headphone jack.I don't think they are bulky at all. In fact, they are very comfortable and I could wear them all dayThe RS 195 provide a very wide range of sound experienceI feel they are very loud and keep turning them downOptical Audio out from the TV to the Sennheiser headphones do not permit variable audio volume output to the RS195 but the RCA to 3.5mm jack does. However, Optical Digital Audio is noticeably better over RCA to 3.5mm Analog. HDMI audio if even better than Optical Digital so I wished they had that ability along with Optical Digital and RCA analog choices.Pros:Overall, these are the best Sounding Wireless Headphones I have ever heard.They look good in the stand and on the shelf (Premium)Cons:Wished I had anotherI would like it if they were BlueTooth as well so I could use them on other devices and take them with meThe Mode Selector and Volume on the headphones can be tricky to isolate (one or the other). It seems there should be a better way to easily tell which button you're pushing without guess-workStatus Update:I've been using these just about everyday since last September, 2015 (9 mos)I still like them but wish they had more equalizer effects with different sound boosts and were Bluetooth.I find myself using them straight through, pass through normal headphone listening/hearing for TV, Movies, etc and personal hearing (Music and Selector set to ""D"") mode for audio music but some shows as well.The optical audio is definitely better than the 3.5mm jack.I don't have any complaints or problems with volume.Since last September, we have purchased 3 of these for around the home and multi-users.Get them on Amazon Today!!  There has never been a better price at almost 50% off.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A New World of Sound opens up

    ","Architecture is not as sophisticated as say Denon, however, for strict use for the hearing impaired, it gets the job done. I love hi end audio, however, I also insist on hearing all the dialog in uncompressed Blu-ray audio. I've purchased an OPPO BD-95 at $500+ used, also, a Denon 3808CI Analog / Digital receiver used at $300+ to accept the ""analog in"" Center, Front, Surround, Surround Sides, Surround Back and Sub -source to playback connections. This audio processing albeit impressive separation, doesn't do what a select few headphones can do. I also own Denon hardwired AH MM400 Music Maniac, closed ear headphones and find these to be spacially far superior in both audio dialog and music playback. For those who just want to hear dialog and cannot afford to muck around with trial and error, These Sennheiser RS 195 RF Wireless will do what you need and as a bonus give you a bit of dynamic high end music audio as well.",4.0 out of 5 stars,For those about to rock . . .
193,"on January 8, 2017",,"I got a set of these for Christmas (from my Christmas list), so although it doesn't show as a verified purchase, I do have one from Amazon.My initial review was critical and dropped a star based on some inconveniences compared to my previous Sony headset.  The inconveniences relate to the features of automatic positioning on the head, and automatic power on and off.  With the Sennheiser it is necessary to turn it on, off and to pull the earpieces in or out to adjust to head size.  All of these remain true, but after a little use I find they are minor issues.  The quality of the sound and the way it can be adjusted far outweigh any other issues.The settings do make a big difference in sound clarity.  Switching to voice mode makes the voice much clearer, though it detracts somewhat from the overall sound quality.  But if you have trouble hearing speech this will help.  And if you are listening to music and want better timbre and richer sound, a simple touch of a button on the earpiece changes to music mode and full sound.They are expensive, but for me well worth it for the improved ability to hear speech clearly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Expensive, but excellent for hearing speech."

    ","This headphone has many redeeming qualities including excellent DSP (digital signal processing) capabilities that enhance speech intelligibility. As someone who has normal hearing but has always been annoyed by the (often) poor sound mixing on TV shows (muffled speech, overly loud sound effects and backing music), I have found these headphones to be a Godsend. Although I found all the hearing profiles except for ""D"" to sound significantly unbalanced (with ""E"" to ""G"" inclusive sounding progressively more irritating with far too much emphasis of higher frequencies), I can certainly imagine that they would do a good job for people with hearing loss at high frequencies. But the reason I mention my normal hearing and these hearing profiles in the same breath is because the speech intelligibility feature cannot be enabled at all without one of the aforementioned hearing profiles being activated. I would rather be able to activate the speech intelligibility independently of the hearing profiles, though that said, at least the ""D"" profile sounds reasonably close to neutral to my ears.So far as fit and wearability is concerned, like most Sennheisers I have owned, these are very comfortable. I am able to wear them for several hours at a time without any discomfort at all, though I am not really a fan of the earpad material which tends to overheat and over-humidify the ear when in use. Having air-conditioning, it is not a severe issue for me personally, however I would hate to use these headphones in Summer without it. I think Sennheiser need to look into alternative materials that can still form a good acoustic seal but are also more comfortable in heat and humidity for extended listening periods.I also think Sennheiser could have made better choices in terms of the plastics used in these headphones. Whilst I appreciate the light weight of these headphones, that is no excuse to use the very cheap ""scratchy"" plastics that proliferate throughout. The finish is not at all robust and although I am sure the headphones will last, I can't see them looking good for the long-term.Onto some technical issues: my particular pair of RS195 has a volume imbalance of around 1.5 dB - the right channel being louder than the left. This is not a problem with my own hearing since if I swap the earcups around, the left channel becomes louder. This imbalance is not a problem with the TV source either, since plugging several other sets of headphones into the TV reveals a perfect balance left to right. I consider such mis-matching to be beyond acceptable for a product in this price range and although the product does at least have a balance control, it is very hard to adjust it accurately as the adjustment range beyond the centre-detent is very coarse.But the biggest potential issue of all with these headphones is the considerable lag - not only on account of the wireless configuration but also on account of the DSP (if enabled). Personally speaking, were it not for the fact that I can actually advance the audio ahead of the video on my TV set, I would be unable to use these headphones at all - the resulting lip sync issues being intolerable. Luckily, by being able to advance the audio on my LG Smart TV (LB6500 series), I can eliminate the lip sync problem. But many potential users will not have such adjustments on their TV and as such, they may find the lip sync problems too serious if they are sensitised to them.So overall, I do like the product despite the aforementioned flaws, but I think Sennheiser could do far better in many respects on future models.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Flawed execution but a potentially worthwhile product

    ",Using the Toslink optical input I not only use them for watching tv but also listening to my iTunes music collection via Apple TV.  I am able to hear nuances I never even knew were there.  The dynamics and frequency response are beyond my expectations in every way. The 50mm drivers can play at an astounding 117db maximum loudness which makes explosions and low base frequencies in movies feel like a large subwoofer in the room.  I probably should have spent a little less and bought the RS185 though because I find that I don't like the added affects of the bells and whistles of the RS195.  I think they sound best with all that stuff off. The 8-FSK Digital 2.4GHZ technology is lossless just like the infrared KLEER generation except now you can walk around the house instead of having to remain in line of sight.  I think I'm going to order the velour ear pads like the RS185 have because they are more comfortable than leatherette which come with the RS195.  I highly recommend these and make sure to utilize the optical input because it makes a huge difference.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just outstanding in every way!

    ","Aesthetically, you can tell these were designed by Germans and not Jony Ive as they're not the most visually appealing item to have sitting in your living room. This is fine if you have your audio equipment in a closet or rack, but something to consider if these are going to be sitting out in your living room for all to see. Most of the bulk comes from the headphones, so it's less intrusive when in use.Setting up and using these headphones are a cinch. Most of the controls are on the headphones themselves including power, volume and mode, though you can adjust balance and mode back at the base unit as well. There are two means of audio in, either 1/8"" mini or optical audio, though they sound great even using the mini jack with an iPad as a source. While it comes with multiple plug options for the power adapter, this may have caused the one thing I don't like about the unit which is the size of the power adapter at the plug in. It won't fit nicely into a power strip as it's wide and long. The headphones are powered by two AAA rechargeable batteries which sit inside the earpieces and are charged when the headphones are put back on the base unit. It took about 12 hours for the initial charge out of the box; I'll have to report back on how long they last. Haven't tested out the range, but I have been able to walk around and use them in another room without too much of an issue so far.The sound is rich and the headphones comfortable, so I can see myself using these in several applications. Our living room acoustics aren't great, so I can see myself using these when watching an action movie or playing Playstation by myself. I can also foresee using them when discretion is warranted and I want to listen to music but don't want to disturb others.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not pretty to look at, but delightful to listen to"

    ","This is a great pair of headphones - if you need them. These are not a regular set, but you could use them as such if you wanted.I use to have a similar pair of headphones years ago that I got with the purchase of a big screen television. And I used them a lot, but someone left the headphones on the couch and they were broken when they got sat on. These Sennheiser HDR 195 TV/HIFI headphones are way beyond the pair I use to have both in quality and features.These headphones are geared more toward someone with hearing issues - for instance myself. I'm in my mid-50's and have problems hearing certain frequencies clearly and a touch of tinnitus in my right ear. Most times when I watch television I have the Closed Captioning turned on as I at times have difficulty understanding what is being said. I also have that problem doing other things - especially with understanding speech when there is a lot ambient noise.You have two options of providing audio to the base unit - regular analog using a standard 1/8"" stereo audio cable or digital using a To-slink optical cable. Both of which are provided in the box. The base unit is also powered with a wall transformer (which comes with a selection of adapters for different power outlets). The power cord is a pretty decent length - about 6'. I tested out the headphones with both inputs. For the analog, I hooked the base unit up to my iPod touch and spent the day listening to both music and an audiobook. The headphones performed adequately with both.The best feature of this headphone system is that you have a number of audio presets that you can switch between to enhance your listening. Basically there is a six-position (A-F) selector knob on the front of the base unit which acts like an equalizer. Position 'A' emphasizes the low-end (bass) and sort of mutes the high-end. Position 'F' is pretty much the opposite - emphasizes the high-end and mutes the low-end. Position ""D"" seems to be right in the middle - no enhancement. The other settings are somewhere in-between the two extremes. I found myself using 'C' for music and 'E' when listening to the audiobook. You also have the ability to adjust the left/right balance if needed. There is also a 'Mode' setting - which is goes from speech, regular listening, and music. Haven't really experimented with it enough to describe how works.The base unit also acts as the charging stand for the headphones. It doesn't matter which direction you put the headphones (front or back) they will charge.Before you use the headphones, you have to install the two rechargeable AAA batteries. One goes in each earpiece. To do that you have to gently twist off the individual cushions pieces. And then they need to be charged. I left the headphones on the base unit over night to charge. The battery life seems decent enough - I probably used the headphones for over six hours with no problems.The headphones are a bit clunky in my opinion - in a bulky sort of way. Not uncomfortable, but I did find myself removing them a number of times just to give my ears a rest. I will say that while you're wearing them outside noise is greatly minimized (but not completely eliminated).There are some controls on the outside of the right side earpiece. You can cycle through the modes and adjust the volume up & down. That's pretty much all you can do from the headphones. Controlling the sound source is strictly from whatever remote / control that device provides.I had some logistic issues with connecting these headphones to my main television. I would have liked to use the digital input, but I have a sound-bar using that output. So I had to make use of the headphone jack. The headphones work well with the television audio - I found that I could hear dialog much clearer. But I ended up installing these on my smaller television in my bedroom - where I was able to use the digital audio output. Using the headphones for that set gives me two benefits. One, the CC on that smaller set was too small to read at the distance - so being able to hear better made it where I didn't need to. And two, now I can watch TV late at night and not worry about disturbing anyone else in the house with the sound.I'm very happy with these headphones and recommend them to anyone with similar hearing issues.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear!
