    ","I purchased these from a Seller in HK through ebay. Paid more for this. I already have the Urbanite Xl, bluetooth. These have a very similar sound signature as the Urbanites.Here are things I liked about it1) APT-X no lag when watching movies / playing games.2) Very good sound. I have the HD 600 that I use at home for music. This sounds just as clear as them. I have a lossless track of Katie Melua & Eva Cassidy singing What a wonderful world. Most headphones tend to muddy the voices to the point where you are guessing who is singing what. Not this one, you can clearly make out the difference between the two through these.3) These headphones are much brighter than the HD 600's, they have a foot tapping liveliness that is easy to love.4) Bass extension, the bass guitar riffs sound real on these to my untrained ears. Close enough to the real thing, (I play the bass). Listening to a track like Carousel by Melanie Martinez, where other bass heavy headphones like Beats Studio starts to distort, this plays with authority and clarity. These are no where near as bass heavy as most other gen - next headphones out there, but they are not bass shy either. When they do play bass, they do it well.5) I flew to Ireland and got stuck in a long lay over situation. The net duration was 28 hours including layover. This paired with a tablet, lasted me the entire time. I had to charge the Tablet 5 times during the trip, this one was still going strong when I finally switched off. The LiPo batteries are awesome.What I dont like1) These are on ear for me. I admit I am 6'1 and have elephant ears. Still I have no idea why Sennheiser cant build a HD 600 sized bluetooth headphone ?I purchased the Brainwavez hybrid headphone pads and they fit right and go over the ears, but that needed some electrical tape to happen and killed the looks of the headphone.I have this exact same issue with my Urbanite XL as well. Its more like an Urbanite M, not XL.2) Bluetooth range its good enough for 15-20 feet, LOS, after that it cuts out. It most likely will not be a problem for anyone, but my $ 15 kinivo bluetooth headphones from Amazon has 3x the range, not sure why sennheiser cant do this ? This is not a deal breaker for me, but it bothered me that a $ 15 headphone can beat this in range.3) The headband doesnt have any real cushioning to it. Its better than urbanite but barely so. After a few hours of extended listening, the top of my head starts to hurt. I fixed this with an add on pad, but that makes this look really bad.4) The noise cancelling is a an experiment in compromise, I think its set at a mid point between complete isolation and zero noise cancelling. I think that is because complete isolation causes some people to have a perceived headache/ear ache. I have spent hours in the shooting range for the Marines before and I have used the BHP, (Ballistic Hearing Protection). They are really foam based ear plugs with a fancy name. Anyway, zero ambient noise does not bother me.So for guys like me, I wish there was a more aggressive noise cancellation. Maybe a three level adjustable noise cancellation with the final level set aggressively.At +/- $150.00, these are great. But if noise cancellation is the only thing you need and sound quality is as important to you as the current drought in Nigeria, I would recommend the Bose headphones. Otherwise, these are quite awesome and slightly better sounding than the Urbanite XL.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great but not for large ears

    ","When these were announced at CES (2017) I was really excited. I had been contemplating taking the dive and buying significantly higher quality headphones than the cheapo ones I usually tend to buy. I figured these would be a decent compromise between the expensive $350+ headphones that dominate the ""best"" Bluetooth with active noise cancellation that you can buy and the extremely cheapo sub-$100 Bluetooth headphones. They took a good 3 weeks or so to ship, but that will likely improve when there is more stock readily available.First thoughts were that the packaging was very well done and Amazon also did a good job of choosing a box with filler that didn't allow it to shift all over the place. Inside the packaging it is bare-bones, just the headphones, cable, cheap bag carrying case, and some leaflets. While they are plastic, they did not feel cheap. Obviously that is an opinion and I think that quality plastic can be great in some scenarios, just like metal can be in other scenarios... So your mileage may vary.I paired these up with a OnePlus 3 (no aptX) and oh boy, what sound. Honestly, listening to music on these was a revelation much like the first time I hooked up a surround sound system to my TV. Coming from cheap headphones that ""work"" you don't realize how much you are missing from the music you listen too. The sound is super crisp and vibrant. I could hear extra detail from the instruments that I didn't before on much cheaper Bluetooth headphones. I feel like the bass was there, but not overbearing. I am not a bass head, so people wanting super saturated base probably should look elsewhere, in my opinion.Now for the bad. I have a big head. I am the sort of person that dies a little inside when you look at a hat and it says ""one size fits all"". Liars. haha. I ought to have listened to some of the other reviews that I had read stating these were not rainbows and butterflies on large heads. The biggest issue are the size of the ear cups. For anyone with adult sized ears these will likely be closer to ON ear as opposed to OVER ear. The material is nice and soft (a faux leather of some sort), but with it all on my ears, it got roasty pretty quick. On that same vein, I feel like because of the size of my head, they didn't quite fit comfortably and would get a little uncomfortable on the top of my head and to a lesser degree my ears after wearing them for a while.I will be honest, I did not test the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) much. It seemed like they did a decent job killing general ambient noise, but I don't really have anything to compare them against as a reference for ""WOW these are amazing"" levels of ANC. Honestly, for half the cost of the ""Golden Standard"" of ANC (Bose QC35) you can't expect it to be earthshattering. I will say that the ""white-noise"" that some older ANC headsets has is virtually non-existent, which is nice.I don't want to discourage people with smaller heads from these. The sound you get is awesome and you get the bonus of great battery life and ANC in an exceptionally reasonable price. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could, but I want to be sure that people with bigger heads think twice before they buy these. Maybe I just have a sensitive large head and other people wouldn't find my qualms an issue, but I want to put out the word regardless. I ended up returning them and am back to researching a decent set of headphones that won't cost me a kidney, but will cover my big head and ears.TLDR:Pros+ Quality plastic construction (yes, plastic and quality can be in the same sentence)+ Great sound, super crisp and vibrant, bass not overbearing+ No sound bleed (at volume levels that won't make you deaf)+ Great battery lifeCons- Marketed as OVER ear, really actually ON ear- Uncomfortable on larger sized heads- Ear cups, though comfortable, warm up quickly as they are on your ear (not over)Other thoughts* Active Noise Cancellation is nice, but not phenomenal* Price to sound and build quality ratio is great* If your head isn't huge... these are definitely worth looking into* If your head is huge... you probably want to look elsewhere",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, but bad for big heads and ears"

    ","I like Sennheiser. I've always had a good experience with their products ever since my first ""real"" set of quality headphones, the PC151 for my computer ~15 years ago.But this was the first time I've used their bluetooth headphones, and also the first time I've used their ANC. I take the train to and from work each day, and mostly wanted a pair of BT headphones that block out the noise both from the train and also from the people around me. These do that and then some. Despite what others may say, these headphones completely block out all of the noise from the train and let me enjoy my commute in peace. The sound quality is great considering my current phone does not support aptX, and I can't complain at all about the comfort or fit. Maybe I just have small ears? Regardless, this is a great product. I've used the Bose and Sony models, and they're also very quality products, but I really enjoy these headphones.The battery life surprised me. I'm coming from a set of Sony BT headphones without ANC. They'd last a good month or two between charges. I expected to take a hit in the battery life department, but I've managed to go ~3 weeks before hearing the low battery message, using them 4-5 days a week for 1-2 hours a day. Really can't complain with battery life like that.The ANC isn't perfect, though. I can still hear some noises, but with music playing it's a non-issue. Not enough for me to subtract a star, anyway. And even with no music playing, it completely silences the train. I hear a ""snap"" or ""pop"" sound when the ANC kicks in, then it's all quiet.If you're looking for good quality noise-cancelling headphones and don't want to pay $350-400, this is your best bet.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser always delivers

    ","It's really funny because the only negative reviews are ""this headphone is too small"" or ""it's an on the ear not an over the ear headphone"".  I'm 6'4"" with a pretty large head and appropriately sized ears for my head, and I can manage them just fine.  Unless you have Mad Magazine cartoonishly large ears you should be fine.  It's definitely not a loose fit, but it's not uncomfortable, and I can wear them for hours without issue.The other negative I see is someone said that ""the noise cancelling is too hard to activate"".  To turn the noise cancelling on, you have to press the up and down volume at the same time and hold for like 1 second.  It's a single rocker, and the mediocre pictogram does show them using two fingers.  PERSONALLY, I use just my thumb and I manage fine...Anyway, outside of stupid people leaving bad reviews.  The sound profile is pretty good on bluetooth.  It's only atpX, not aptX HD, so you get 16 bit audio out of it so approximately CD quality.  That's still enough to tell that any audio from YouTube is ""meh"" at best, and that other websites have better bitrates.  The nice thing is that you can plug it in and listen wired if you want to and it does come with a 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable so you can plug your headset into any normal aux port.  They sound WAY better plugged in as long as your machine can output 24 bit audio (which makes sense if you think about it).The sound profile is nice and fairly clean, mids are a touch muddy, but the bass response is really nice.  Treble COULD be a bit punchier for my taste, but it's pretty clean and I haven't heard any clipping in the 10-ish hours I've used them to listen to music.  Basically, they are not studio quality headphones, what they are is really good quality general purpose headphones with a great name, good frequency response, and nice convenience being both bluetooth and wired.  I would highly recommend them if you're looking for what I'm describing above, if you're looking for more audiophile/studio/sit at home in a butterfly chair with a pipe listening to ELO on vinyl headphones at about the same price, the Audio Technica ath-m50x are about the same price including a bluetooth adapter.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for price general purpose noise cancelling headphones.

    ","Sound: close to neutral and very clear, highly detailed, with a gentle touch of bass.These headphones are meant for advanced listeners and audiophiles seeking to customize their own sound preference using an equalizer (and have the proper app/hardware to do so). Sennheiser do not over manipulate frequencies, so the headphones may not have the out-of-the-box 'wow' effect most buyers are looking for.The mids are indeed strong as some say, and my guess is that it was done to achieve more gain or volume. This feature can be adjusted.Overall, a very detailed and stunning sound experience, once shaped to your taste. These headphones shine when listening to the mellow sounds of Radiohead, the powerful beats of Polica and the warmth of Bon Iver.Sennheiser's app, CapTune, can help you find the right EQ to match your sound taste.I personally use PowerAmp for android. Added screen caps of my personal EQ settings (with ANC turned off and on).ANC: Very (very) basic noise reduction for this price range. Cuts off low-frequency noise only, but it's better than nothing. It will not mute voices, external music and you will not feel isolated from the world.Build: Perfect. It's Sennheiser.",4.0 out of 5 stars,HD 4.50 sound review + EQ settings

At first listen i was very impressed, after listening to them for about a week I noticed the mid ranges literally seems to be overwhelming and the Bass is not as robust.

    ","Super comfy, although someone with larger ears may not find it comfortable. The product came with a little carrying bag (although I bought a carrying case at the same time), which is enough to carry the headphones. The sound quality is excellent! The noise cancelling feature is good as well but some background noise can still be heard.Edit: I almost returned these because I wasn’t able to pair my headphones to my phone. I had contacted both Amazon tech support and Sennheiser support, both responded quickly enough (the latter responded more than a day later) If anyone makes the same mistake as me.... make sure you hold on to the power button while connecting, it’ll flash blue and red, and let go once it’s connected. Don’t be silly like me and just turn the headphones on wondering why my phone couldn’t detect them...Also if you wear glasses it may not be 100% comfy.

    ","I love Sennheiser.  I have owned quite a few of them, even their esoteric HE90. I still have HD650 for my home reference headphone.  When I started looking for a noise cancelling headphones a year ago, I picked Sennheiser Momentum 2 blind.  The ear cup of M2 is too small too shallow, can't wear them even for short period of time.  So I give it away and pick Definitive Technology Symphony 1, which has good sound quality and huge ear cup.The DT Symphony 1 is not perfect -- a bit mid-bass boom, a tad grainy mid-range.  But the biggest problem is the headband: it presses on the top of my head which make it also impossible to wear for too long.  So I started to look for a new pair of  BTNC headphones.  I don't like BOSE brand but I tried the QC35 at BestBuy and their are extremely comfortable!  SONY 1000X is not that comfortable for me and doesn't sound very impressive either.  But I couldn't find any Sennheiser 4.50BTNC at store to try on so I bought them on Amazon and hope Sennheiser has fixed the ear cup design flaw.  Boy was I wrong!  the ear cup is still the same small/shallow design as in M2.  I can't wear them for too long.  Yeah I admit people have different anatomy so maybe mine is a bit off but my ear is certainly on the mid/small side for sure.  I am so disappointed.  I give 4.50BTNC one stars for sound quality which is ok.  but not as expected from Sennheiser.  sound stage is hollow,  frequency response is not balanced. Also the max sound volume is quite low, which could be an issue for some recordings.  As a comparison,  Bose QC35 is better in EVERY aspects!My advise for people consider buying 4.50BTNC:  TRY THEM ON before you buy!  They may work for you but don't assume so.  Also try Bose QC35 if you can!I posted the side-by-side photos of 4.50BTNC, HD650, and BOSE QC35  for reference.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Ear cup too small and uncomfortable

    ","Works fine and the sound quality is good but they really hug your head and there isn't a lot of space in the ear cups. These two things mean that they are uncomfortable to wear for more than a short time and make your ears hot. I don't have a large head. The ear cups are also a cheaper material so they'll probably last a long time but they're fairly stiff.Bottom line: Functionality is good, noise cancellation is good, and I can't really tell the difference between wired and bluetooth. However, comfortable is poor. If you plan to use them around the house for an hour or less, they'll be perfect. If you want these to travel and fly with, look elsewhere.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Works fine and the sound quality is good but they really ...

    ","I gotta say that I am definitely a fan of these headphones, even though I returned them. My ears fit into the cups just fine (despite what others have said), but my wife says I have small ears, so there's that.  The sound quality is very good, especially with electronic music, though I'm sure all genres would hold up.However, I returned them because I didn't find the noise cancellation to be that great.  It definitely works but it only cuts out the lower end of the spectrum, leaving the highs to be acutely heard once the lows are eliminated.  I found that to distracting at times, though admittedly I kind of have OCD.That said, I had a hard time keeping them when I've read that the Bose (QC 35 ii) and Sonys (WH-1000XM2) do much better at noise cancellation.  I finally decided to pull the trigger and get the Bose and I am glad I did.  They are a lot softer and thus more comfortable, and the noise cancellation definitely works better, albeit marginally (they definitely don't block out *all* noise as I have been made to understand by reading reviews, but they eat into higher frequencies than the Sennheisers).  I'd say the price difference in price between them is accurate for what you get, so if you're willing to shell out nearly twice as much for the Bose you definitely get a more comfortable and effective product.Final note: They do sound great, so if that's your primary concern you're golden.  I think the Sennheisers actually sound just as good as the Bose, it was very hard to tell the difference.  Maybe that's just because, again, I was playing electronic music.  It was a short test, I was already sold on the Bose from the moment I put them on so I didn't spend very much time comparing them.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Silver Medal

    ","Bought these for my girlfriend to block out all the ruckus I make when playing online with my buddy.  So far she hasn't been able to hear me so that's great.  They are very light and produce high quality audio with a much appreciated basic/sleek design.  We haven't tested the battery life but we haven't had any issues with it.  If you have big ears you might find these cups a bit small and will not sit over your ear completely; I uploaded a picture of them lying next to my Sennheiser HD558 which sits very comfortably over my larger ears. Build quality is good with a smooth quality plastic feel (I mean that in a good way), however, it could use a bit more padding under the band.  The controls on the cup are not intuitive or easy to distinguish; I feel they could have done a better job implementing the controls.

    ","These headphones are not bad, I give them three stars because they are not a good value in my opinion.  For the money you're spending you can truthfully get comparable or better build quality and performance.Build quality - Not bad but not premium either.  They are solid but they do feel plasticy (they are plastic) and cheap, but well put together.  Solid build does count for something but but when cheap materials are used it kinda takes some of that away.Sound - I was not impressed to say the least.  They didn't sound bad but they also didn't sound good.  If I paid $40 for these I would say they sound good (not great) but that is not what you pay and I definitely expected way more.  The volume is also on the low side with both ANC on and off.  Decent sounding headphone but not what I expected in this price range.ANC - NO, my passive noice cancelling headphones (Avantree Auditions) do almost as good of a job blocking out the outside world.  I turned ANC on and off and there wasn't that big of a difference to me.  With just a small fan on, I still heard the fan up until I turned the music up past 50%, you may say that's good but that is the same result I got with my Avantrees and they have no ANC.Comfort was good, the ear cups are very plush and you could wear these for a while.  I like the locking 2.5mm audio cable...I hate yanking those out.  Again I am not saying that these are bad headphones, they are actually good...but for this price, no, you can get similar or better even cheaper. Oddly enough my Avantrees have out-shined  or matched these in all categories and they are 1/3 of the cost.

    ","Pretty good, OK. They sound great. Sound quality is what you would expect or better from $100 Sennheisers. I cannot discern a difference in audio quality between these and anything else, although they do seem to be a bit on the warm side, they are not overly so. They'll start with 5 stars for this. The First real problem is you can't use them in any way while you charge them. The Bluetooth stuff turns off when the usb is connected for charging. There's a loud hiss when both the USB charging and 3.5mm cables are connected to a source. Sounds kinda like a bad ground loop. It _May_ be this unit only, but everything else works fine (after a few minutes debugging an issue that amazon caused). They can't be 5-star if you can't charge and use them simultaneously.Also, they require a better Bluetooth adapter. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ZIILLI does NOT work, despite being suggested as an add-on by amazon. I do not fault them for this, but rather amazon for selling me incompatible products together in a bundle.Second real problem is when you attempt to use these as a phone headset. It's specifically designed for ths, and even has programed buttons for answer, hangup, voice dial, etc. The only problem is that other people cannot consistently hear you. Your voice cuts out, and they complain.  It's like the microphone isn't able to consistently pick up your voice. Loose another star for not being able to do something they're advertised to do. Luckily it's not what I bought them for, and they do play music well. -1 more star, down to three.Also, as others have said, this isn't for people with larger ears or heads. I can only keep these on for about an hour before my head hurts. I think i'll have to go back to my HD-280 pro's, at least for a few hours a day. some days I wear headphones for 6-7 hours. Yeah, lets go ahead and take another star off for these. It's really not that bad because I HAVE to take them off for conference calls, but still... -1 more star. down to two.These are arguabally supra-aural, not circumaural, as advertised. I guess it depends on your ear sizes, but that's not really a fair comparison. They need to fit around at least 85% of peoples' ears, otherwise they're just supra-aural. minus 1 more star. oh noes! we've reached 1 star.Will be returning these.",1.0 out of 5 stars,I really want to love these... but cannot.

    ","These are a great set of headphones for their purpose, so be careful not to judge them too harshly.What they do great at:- For the price, the noise cancelling is about 80% of the Bose (in my opinion). The padding is soft and forms a great seal and the noise reduction does what it says, considering the price. So a fantastic closed-back headphone with active noise cancelling and Bluetooth in a single package- Battery life- I like the dual cable & Bluetooth, so if the Bluetooth dies, you can still use the headphones- Voice calls are crystal clear, which is something considering where the mic is, and the headphones auto disconnect the noise cancelling when you're on a callWhat to look out for:- Sennheiser flatness of the mids as a closed-back headphone. It's unfair to judge them against my HD 598SEs (but I do anyway). Understand they'll sound flattish and has that typical closed-back sense, but that's why I have a pair of HD 598's when I want that clearer sound. I did feel they were a bit aggressively flat on the high notes versus just being natural- Yes, they've included Bluetooth controls, but they don't seem to be designed to be used all the time, as they're a bit fiddly. If you see the robust buttons on the Bose, you'd see what a more refined design is. I found myself frequently trying to figure out if I was touching the volume control or the next track rocker.- While the build is solid, I'm eyeing the headband with suspicion as I feel they could have made them a tad thicker considering they've hinged them to high heaven as part of how it compacts for travel. It hasn't broken yet, but if you look at a pair of headphones like the 598s, you'll feel like you need to treat these a lot more carefully- The soft carry bag. I suppose with all the money in electronics, you can't expect too much. I just feel I need to get an extra hard carry case if I'm lugging these around. And the bag doesn't do anything special for cable management, considering you have two cables to contend with now (USB and manual audio)It's terrible to call a headphone a good compromise, but that's what they are. A jack of all trades and a master of none, does make this a good value all rounder. I would recommend and buy them, if you understand their weaknesses and want them for their strengths.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"A jack of all trades and a master of none, but class-leading value at this price point"

20,"on April 3, 2018",,"I bought these to replace a $60 pair of August EP650s which drove me crazy with signal dropouts while commuting and walking around bluetooth and wifi saturated SF. These are much better, but dropouts still occur. I would say they eliminate 80-90% of the problem. My old iPhone 6 may be part of the issue and who knows, more expensive phones might have the issue as well. This is my first pair of ANC phones so I have no comparison to offer, but they do a fantastic job on the subway. I can hear very little of the ambient environment, so I don't need to listen as loud which is more relaxing. Looking forward to trying them on a plane. Build and audio quality seem very good, except for the ridiculous tiny buttons which are hard to operate and distinguish from one another.  The ""multifunction button"" is the worst and has no tactile ""click"" when pausing/playing. Turning the NC off and on is harder than it should be. I also wish they came with a better case--they needn't have bothered with the cheap fabric one and I haven't been able to find an aftermarket one which fits. Overall, I will keep them but they definitely could benefit from a redesign of the controls.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good phones, poor controls"

    ","Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC (0-5 scale)Sound: These are the first Bluetooth headphones I've used: I have nothing to compare them to fairly. All my other headsets are work related and of a different class. As such, they do not seem particularly revealing. Detail seems lacking but *shrug* Bluetooth. (3)Design: They look good and still are robust enough to ride outside of my shoulder bag without falling apart. The ear cups may be small but I just rock them a bit and they cover my ears. Ear cups fold in for storage/large pockets but they do not rotate for comfort when hanging around the neck. (4)Signal: The phone is less than 3 feet away and the signal drops occasionally but if I am walking around they generally stay connect long enough for me to get back to the phone before dropping connection. (3)Microphone: Folk on the other end complain when I use these. (2)Noise cancelling: Works on some frequencies, but seems to allows a lot of the environment to pass through. (3)Peeves: No ""sleep"" mode when not receiving music. No way to tell if they are on without toggling them off and on. Mic performance/noise cancelling are weak. The ""Power On"" sounds like a lousy recording of someone that doesn't know what they are saying. (2)Summary: These were sug. retail at $199 and I paid $150. For that price they're okay for music, not so good for phone conversations. They really seem like a product Sennheiser didn't engineer but, rather, sourced from a vendor. I'll use them until they break. I won't cry when they do. (3)",3.0 out of 5 stars,These Are Sennheiser? Really?

I'm not an audiophile, so I can't really say how the sound compares, but I found the sound and noise cancellation to be very good. Acoustically - great!So...why am I returning these headphones? Because I'm in the camp of those who find them simply too uncomfortable. I have wired Sennheisers that have nice padding on the top bar; these do not. Over long periods, I found the top bar uncomfortable on my head. More importantly, the pressure on my ears was too much. The tension presses the earpieces too firmly against my ears. The opening of the earpieces is a long but very narrow oval. I can wedge the back of my ear (the pinna) into the back of the opening, but the front of the foam rests very firmly against the front of the ear (tragus). I found the pressure uncomfortable, and the heat builds up so that after 10 minutes, the skin was a little damp from sweat. Of course, others have found them to be comfortable and your experience may be very different.

    ","I always liked Sennheiser products for the combination of quality and features. However with this product I am somewhat disappointed. Overall it is very well built, the only problem I think is that the top arc of the phones is too narrow so it ""cuts"" into the sculp, making these headphones less comfortable to wear for prolonged time. More major problems are in bluetooth connection quality that introduces periodic distortions of sound which are very bad and very noticeable to sound quality. I am not sure if this relates to BT itself of the product quality problem. Second with the noise cancelling I feel it works in a weird way - it seems the system turns it on and off at certain moments, so sometime you hear noise, sometime you don't.

    ","So I got these about 6 weeks ago, used and on sale, and I am more pleased with them everyday. I use them almost exclusively for working out, and never wear them longer than an hour or two.Great sound. Very clear, but if bass is your thing, you won't be blown away by them.

No problem going from my phone in the basement to the headphones on the second floor.Battery is amazing. I charged them a day or two after receiving them and that's it.Noise Cancelation is good enough for my use, but these are the first high-end noise cancelling headphones I've owned. I was between these and the 4.40, but I'm glad I got the 4.50s.Fit: I have a small head and ears and they are very tight on me. It was actually painful the first few times wearing them for an extended period and I had to take them off every 10 minutes or so. I contemplated returning them, but happy I didn't. Very few over the ear headphones stay on my head when I workout, these never slip or slide, and aren't painful anymore. I guess it just takes time for them to expand a bit or find the right positioning.If you are using them for more than an hour or two at a time, have a larger head, or need that heavy bass, these might not be the best.

    ","these were moderately priced at 170 at amazon, and I was anxious because it would be my first pair of wireless noice cancelling headphones. Honestly, I do not like Bose (as a company or its products), and I did not want to shell out $300 for Bose, so I gave these a try. They are great sounding, and great with noise cancelling (quite interesting how they filter noise), but they do not fit right. I dont have a big head or big ears, but these feel too tight on me even when I extend them out, and they are on-ear as opposed to around the ear. My coworker, who has the expensive Bose noise cancelling headphones, let me wear his as a comparison, and I did the same for him. For a sound standpoint, they are very similar is what they product, and their noise cancelling features. However, from a comfort standpoint, the Bose are superior since they are around the ear, and feel looser overall. It was night and day as far as comfort, and I could not bear to keep these even though they function well. I also love the fact they are can be corded and wireless, that was once of the selling points. I would highly suggest you try a pair of these on before you buy them to see if they are comfortable. If you have a big head or big ears, I think you are really going to hate them. Beside the lack of comfort on the ears, I was really disappointed with the case it came with. It is literally a t $.50 nylon case; it makes you think the the nice headphones you just bought are cheap. Again, as a comparison to the Bose headphones of my coworker, you get a sharp-looking, rugged case that holds more than just headphones. This cheap case was a downer for me. Ultimately, I returned these to amazon and am still shopping for a pair that works for me. If you never tried noise cancelling headphones, go instore to try them, and see how they fit to your head; saves time and the headache.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"sound great, but not that comfortable the case could be better"

    ","Historically, I have been very impressed with the comfort of Sennheiser headphones.  I loved my HD280 Pros and could wear them for hours on end.  I ordered these without trying them on, which was a huge mistake. The difference in comfort is so stark it's nearly unbelievable.  It's like Sennheiser contracted another manufacturer to produce these.  They have more in common with, for example, the Modern Portable HiFi Elite Super66 than with other Sennheiser models.  The padding is very thin, and the hard plastic housing for the speakers rests on my ears.  I'm building up a tolerance to this, but it is not an enjoyable experience.I don't know if the comfort or the crappy audio is more noticeable.  These sound great when they're not cutting out.  The noise cancelling is decent - not as good as the noise cancelling on the Bose models I've tried - but good for the money.  Unfortunately, it's the Bluetooth that I've had the most trouble with.  Every few minutes, audio will cut out.  It's short - no more than a second.  But it definitely detracts from the experience.  I've used these with two different MacBook Pros and with a Nexus 6P.  Same problem on all devices.Ultimately, the Modern Portable HiFi Elite Super66 are a good Bluetooth headphone for the money, and you won't be as disappointed as with these Sennheisers.  The controls on the Modern Portables are far more intuitive, too.  If you really want the Bluetooth with noise cancelling, step up to the Bose QC35.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy.

    ","These are advertised as OVER-ear headphones. However ear cups are really small and I think these should really be considered ON-ear headphones.

    ","I preordered these and used them for a few weeks before returning.  I liked these headphones, but like many reviews have mentioned, they are definitely on-ear rather than over ear.  They fit my wife much better, but were just too small for me even though I have a fairly normal size head for a man.  Way too much clamping force and barely any padding on the headband made them too painful for me to wear for any length of time.  The sound quality was excellent, especially when listening from an aptX or wired connection. Noise cancellation was decent, though not nearly as good as the higher end competition (QC35 or MDR 1000x).

    ","I pre-ordered the headphone when it first came out, waited for around three weeks. Been reading the reviews to debate whether to keep it or not.Took it along with me for couple short business trips (2~3 hr flight), there is actually a lot to like about the headphone: latest BT protocol, AptX support, foldable, comes with a travel pouch, super long battery life, noise cancellation actually works, not bad appearance....etc. Unfortunately, it is just not cutting it with the sound department. Pulled out my other go-to bluetooth headphone from 2013 - Logitech UE9000, the sound on Sennheiser HD 4.50BTNC just sounded a lot thinner and not a lot of ""meat"", I know I'm comparing a $400 msrp headphone versus a $200 one, if I give it a score with only the sound quality comparison of the two, UE9000 will earn a 8.5 and the HD 4.50BTNC will earn a 6.5.Even though the Sennheiser headphone may trump on all other aspects compare to the Logitech one, unfortunately I value sound quality the most when it comes to the headphones. If you are a travel professional and spend a lot of time up in the air, there is a lot to like about this headphone, price is actually very competitive. I might not recommend this to an office professional since you're mostly in a quiet environment and I would be more critical with what I hear, I would get one with better sound quality.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is only okay, and I'll leave it at that"

    ","With two little kids at home, I don't get to listen to my favorite music or movies on my home theater system very often so instead, I most often use headphones. For the past year or so I've been using a pair of Sony MDRXB650BT/B Bluetooth Headphones to listen to my favorite Spotify tracks from my smartphone at home or when traveling.I've used the Sennheiser HD4.50 BT Headphones in similar fashion for the better part of a month and have really come to like this pair of headphones for overall sound fidelity, comfort, and features.►Smartphone Pairing & Setup:The HD4.50 supports NFC so pairing the headphones with a smart device is incredibly simple. The only thing you need to do is make sure NFC is enabled on your device, turn on the headphones, and hold your device up to the left earpiece (it has the NFC logo on it). Pairing takes a few short seconds and that's it! Next time you turn on the headphones in range of your device they'll pair automatically. Pretty standard stuff but it's nice that it works perfectly every time.►CapTune:The next logical step after the HD4.50's are paired to your device is to head over the Play or iTunes store and download Sennheiser's CapTune app. This app is specifically designed to work with the HD4.50 headphones (and some other Sennheiser models too) and really to get the most out of the headphones you'll need the application. CapTune allows you to set all sorts of settings with the HD4.50 headphones including preset and custom EQ settings, bass and treble adjustments. There's a built-in music player within CapTune as well for playing back media.►Features:The HD4.50's have all of the features you'd expect from headphones in this class - Bluetooth, voice guided functions, built-in rechargeable Lithium-ion battery, and so forth. The product page and spec sheet are loaded with information about the features of the HD4.50's but one of my favorite features has to be the easy to use track controls integrated directly onto the headphones. This probably seems like a silly thing but it's nice not having to dig out my smartphone every time I want to skip to the next track. The headphones fold up nicely making them easy to bring along on trips thanks to the space-saving design.Although all of my music playback with the HD4.50's has been wireless it's important to note that you can also listen to music wired via a 3.5mm male-male cable (included).►Usage Impressions:I'm a fan of these headphones and music playback is noticeably better than my Sony XB650's with a fuller and more realistic audio playback. I took the HD4.50's on a short business trip and confirmed the noise canceling features are every bit as welcome as I imagined traveling during a busy workweek.The one area I did have concern is the earcup design. Sennheiser lists these as ""around ear"" on the product page and I interpreted that to mean an over the ear design (vice on the ear design) where the earcup materials don't press directly on the ears. That is not the case. With the HD4.50's the earcup materials definitely fit right on top of your ear. Thankfully the materials are soft enough and the pressure from the headset gentle enough that I didn't get a headache or discomfort to my ears even after multiple hours of consecutive use.►In the Box:- HD4.50 headset- 3.5mm auxiliary cable (1.4m)- USB-A to micro-USB cable- Black, zip top carrying case►Closing:Sennheiser is known for producing excellent headphones and the HD4.50 does not disappoint. This is a feature packed, well-built pair of headphones packed with all the technology bells and whistles while till delivering simple, quality audio playback. Comfortable, reliable, a solid pair of headphones. Recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser Gets Everything Right with the HD4.50 Headset!

    ","I really, really wanted to like this headphone.  Bluetooth, decent battery life, active noise cancellation and very reasonable price make for a compelling product.  Unfortunately, I ended up having to return this because of fit issue.  I just could not get comfortable with this headphone because of my rather large head; even after a few minutes, I would start to experience excruciating ear pain.  I ended up getting Bose QuietComfort 35 which I absolutely adore.  Sure, it costs $150 more, but long-term comfort, better sound quality (yes, QC35 actually sounds better with music than this headphone to me) and significantly better active noise cancellation (no comparison!) justify the higher price.  In the end, I suppose you get what you pay for.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have large head, fit may be an issue"

    ","Pros:1. Noise cancelling works (see cons thus).2. Sound quality is good for music and audiobooks.3. Really long battery life.4. Feature-rich: BT + cable + NFC (see cons thus).Cons:1. Not everyone notices the difference/effect of noise cancellation. I gave the headset to tens of people to try. Musicians and people with gentle hearing don't notice the effect. People with not-sensitive ears notice the noise cancelling immediately.2. Wearing it with no music causes the whistle in ears after 15-20 minutes.3. Wearing in the airplane makes impossible the use of head-support pillow: the pillow pushes on the phone-cups and the headset presses the ears => soon pain.4. NFC works but partially: the phone recognizes the headset however can't complete the pairing. Regular bluetooth pairing works.5. During the call Noise cancelling does not work at all. On contrary, all external noises are amplified. this is pretty shocking to hear all the sound-garbage first time after silence. This is actual for all types of calls: GSM or VOIP.6. Power button behavior is not consistent. With no cable the button must be hold few seconds for power on/off. With cable connected the power button works immediately.7.

They are basically useless.-2)  The music with the headphones plugged directly to my iphone was horrible.  Listening was like being inside of tin can.  The voice seemed distant from the instruments.

I simply want to listen to the tv and music and not hear my husband in the background when he is on the on the phone, etc.3)  The worst horrible.....  Bluetooth does not work.  Why?  Because you cannot turn the headphones on unless you are connected to, say an iphone.  This defeats the purpose of being WIRELESS.  Yes, they were charged.

    ",I’ve been using these nearly every day for 2 weeks now.  They are very comfortable to wear for hours at a time.  They are very good headphones in this price range.The sound is very good – not a booming bass but a crisp/clear sound.  They are really comfortable over my ears & sitting on top of my head.The noise cancelling is very good but not excellent.  It is “active noise cancelling” which means it reduces unwanted sound by adding a second sound.  I did not get the effect of dead silence when I turned it on with no music but it definitely knocks back ambient sound.-Controls are on the right ear can.

    ","I'm going with 4 stars. Could they be better? Yes. Did I return them? No. Am I super happy to not have headphone wires? ABSOFERKINLUTELY!Now for the rest:If you're thinking these are going to be some magical sounding headphones that will beat your wired headphones, don't buy wireless. Taking into consideration you are literally streaming digital-to-analog data over bluetooth (NOT WiFi people!), if you keep your expectations realistic then you'll be stoked with the sound and quality of these.Comparing to HD 380 Pro Headphones:The ear cups are much smaller than that of other Sennheiser 380s so keep this in mind. It doesn't bother me because I like the smaller footprint for when I need to hit up Costco. The 380s are much bulkier which is good for studio, bad for mobility on the road. The sound quality of the 380s is better (richer bass for sure) - there's no argument there - however the HD 4.50 headphones are very comparable and if you attach the cable. The 380s have better mid to lows, but it's only slightly when comparing both as wired headphones.I've never owned a pair of noise cancelling headphones so I can't compare BUT this is definitely one reason I kept these. Usually I'm tuning to EDM music at work, but when I changed to classical, WHOAH, what a difference in ambient noise! The lows are almost completely removed from the environment around me. If you have ""white noise"" at work, this is a Godsend because it will almost eliminate that humming noise of a/c and fans etc. People talking is much quieter too so I'm going with the other professional reviews in that the noise cancellation is stellar. One thing to note after using them in loud environments like driving in a car, the cancellation might give you a headache; the extra noise cancellation messes with your hearing, but this is the same with all headphones and you can turn it off easily.Overall I'm happy with the purchase. Just don't be thinking these are going to give you studio quality sound like I did originally. They're still only $200 and I think they're great at that price point. Even if they are made in ch*na.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Could they be better? Yes

    ","For a long time I used a pair of Beats Solo2 Wireless headphones I bought for $200, and there are some notable differences between those headphones and this pair of Sennheisers.The Beats are designed for intuitiveness, aesthetic, and simplicity. They have three ""buttons"" - volume up, volume down, and the multifunction ""b"" button. They are very easy to use out of the box and look great, although the sound is built for bass heavy music. However, the tradeoff of the three button interface was always needing to have my phone out to deal with tasks like answering calls or using Siri.This pair of Sennheiser HD 4.50s on the other hand, is built for function and unbiased sound. The controls are intuitive according to Sennheiser, but in my experience there is a bit of a learning curve, and unfortunately the instructions that come with the headphones only have pictures but no written instructions. After I got used to the controls though, it was a great listening experience. The Sennheiser HD 4.50s are very true to sound, and the Active Noise Cancelling feature comes in very handy in NYC public transit. The 25 hour battery life is also great for commuters like me - I have used the headphones pretty regularly since I got them two days ago and they haven't died yet. In terms of comfort, the Sennheisers are a bit uncomfortable during the first couple hours of use, but fine after they're broken in.Summary:  At $149, the Sennheiser HD 4.50 is by far the best bang for your buck for ANC headphones. I recommend this pair of headphones for commuters who want great sound on a budget. If your budget is higher, consider investing the extra $150 on a pair of Bose QC35s or Sennheiser PXC 550s - it will be much more useful in the long run.Pros:  looks great, affordable, ANC, pairs w/ multiple devices, long battery life,Cons:  not very intuitive, slightly awkward button placement",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones although the controls take some getting used to.
197,"on March 6, 2018",,"The product is extremely disappointing given the high price. First of all bluetooth pairing is very slow. The device did not show up on my phone until several tries.

It is heavy and ear cups too tight. My ears get warmed up quickly. Not too bad for the winter. But I don't think it would be comfortable in warmer weather. For this price one probably can buy three bluetooth headphones that use the same chip technology and have similar quality of construction.---------Additional Note:You have to use the cable supplied by Sennheiser to connect to listening device if you want to listen in wired mode. Standard 3.5mm stereo wire does not work, because the slot on HD4.50 is not 3.5mm. On the other hand, don't even bother listening in wired mode.

    ","I am giving 3 stars mainly because of the price (keeping in mind bluetooth headphones are more for convenience than sound quality). I have had these for about 3 weeks as my work headphones, and they are certainly not worth $200. If you are curious on them, I would strongly suggest the non ANC pair which is 60$ cheaper, and the noise cancelling is not that impressive on these anyways. They are a little too tight against the head, the cups are too tight around the ear, and they seem a bit heavy.

    ","I use these he'd phones with my iPod classics, Samsung S8, iPad, and hub may grab it for his iPhone.  The Bluetooth connection is really easy with each device.  You have to reset and resynch with each device.  Comfort is good, but if your head is bigger/wider than average, it may feel tad right across circumference.  The bass is fabulous, and you expect nothing less from Senheiser.  I thoroughly enjoyed the music experience.  You can walk away by about 6 feet away from the device , provided no material obstruction.  Now, the instructions are decent, but it does take a little bit to understand them and then apply them!  I wished the case was sturdier for this price range, it is just light nylon case with no support.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superb tones, especially bass."

    ","I bought these when they first became available but hadn't had a chance to use them until recently. They work very well at drowning out background noise like jet engines and droning noises. They do not cancel out screaming babies, but with my music on (not too loud) I couldn't hear anything. They are comfortable for longer wear periods and I was able to use them for conference calls int he middle of the Detroit Airport and no one had any idea I was there. They do pass through exterior noises well during calls though, so I could hear the person to the right of me crystal clear from 20 feet away when I had no music on. So if you want to eaves drop someone, point the right ear piece towards them and turn the music off. Over all, I'd say they were a good buy for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great on the plane or in a crowd

    ","The product description says that  Lithium Polymer batteries are required but the headphones are in fact chargeable.  I purchased them to replace a pair of Sony headphones that were being held together with electrical tape after just two years of use.  Most of the headphones on offer seem to be designed to fall apart after a short time.  I chose this pair because the ear pieces are made of leatherette and seem to be durable.  They fit just right over my ears (I am a 6 ft. male with, I suppose, normal size ears) and were still comfortable after six hours.  A woman with an English accent informs you when they connect or disconnect.  Connection is prompt.  The controls are easy to use and seem to be more durable than others I have tried.  They recharge quickly.  Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable.  Great sound.

    ","I got these headphones for my gaming laptop. The sound is quite good. It's got a dynamic range of sound. They're easy to set up with my computer. I'm not as crazy about how they fit over my ears. The ear pieces are a bit narrow, meaning they have to slip over your ear rather than cover the entire ear. If you have relatively large ears, then your ears might feel a bit scrunched. It's not too problematic, but I found myself needing to take a break during longer gaming sessions. I do recommend them, especially if you have smaller ears.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"good sound, ok fit"
215,"on December 4, 2017",,"So after reading the reviews on these headphones I was hesitant to get a pair. After much review (and refusing to support Dre) I pulled the trigger. I couldn’t be happier. I read they are uncomfortable, that couldn’t be further from the truth. I’m over 6 foot, and a bigger guy, and I have no issue with these things fitting “too tight”. I also read they sound “tinny”. Maybe if your used to sitting in a room with a high end Bose sound system. This is not my first pair of over the ear headphones and I’ll tell you, these things, by far sound the best. Lastly the CapTune app is awesome, it makes these things fully customizable.These are hands down a 5 star purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are hands down a 5 star purchase.

217,"on July 13, 2017",,"I was hoping for much better quality from Sennheiser based on my experience with their older wired headphones and earbuds. It feels they are charging a premium price for a non-premium product now. Very cheap plastic feel, not finished well around the connector holes. The head band has no padding at all which results in quick discomfort. Sound in my opinion does not have the old Sennheiser signature and the sound quality is clearly affected when noice canceling is enabled, they sound better with NC off. The cups do sit on the ears a bit, not a big problem in my case but I can see how others may take issue with it.Overall I'm disappointed as I really wanted to like them. I purchased the Sony MDR-100ABN and I'm much happier with them, finish, comfort, sound quality. I also have the Sony MDR-ZX780DC from Costco which I got on the very cheap during a sale and while those do not have usable noise cancelation, the sound quality and comfort are better than the Sennheiser 4.50 and for only a fraction of the cost.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Premium price for non-premium headphones

    ",Pros: I like the feature where you can enable or disable noise cancellation. It goes around the ears not on the ears. Sound is good.Cons: I don't have a large head but its quite tight and can be uncomfortable to wear after a while.

    ","I first got a pair of Sennheiser phones years ago which I loved and this new pair is a substantial upgrade.The 10hr+ battery life is outstanding--- for casual listening it means you can go a week or more between charges, or if you're in an all day project you know they're not going to run out.The fit and comfort is first rate.Sound reproduction is very rich across the spectrum, very crisp and pleasing.The active noise cancelling is superb--- in noisy environments you can tell a big difference between the noise cancelling being on or off even when there's no music playing-- much better than my Sony phones.Overall, I think any listener audiophile to casual will be very pleased with these phones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Outstanding comfort, sound reproduction and noise cancellation"

223,"on May 24, 2017",,"Just purchased these (2 hours ago) from Best Buy so I haven't put them through their paces yet but first impressions below:1. Well, they aren't very loud (maybe my ears are worse than I thought)2. Noise cancellation is good, not great. No white noise, but you can still hear quite a bit, although I think that is by design as the sound seems like its coming through the headphone themselves3. I think this is a defect but while walking, with Noise Cancellation on, I get a fairly loud, extremely annoying, consistent click every time I take a step in the right headphone.4. Sound is great, what you would expect from Sennheiser. Obviously better with the cord attached but the BT w/  APTX holds its own.5. Only took 1 call with them but was told the sound was clearly worse than the in-line mic on my Shure SE in ear monitors (probably has something to do with placement)Conclusion: Ill be returning these as I think they are factory defective, however, I don't think Ill be replacing them with the same BT Headphones.

    ","This is going to sound crazy, but these paled in comparison to the Beats Solo3 I've owned for a while now. I wanted to try a good pair of over ear headphones and thought I couldn't go wrong with Sennheiser. The noise cancelling only muted very ambient noises (cars passing outside). I could barely tell when the feature was activated or not. The sound was the most disappointing. I'm by no means an audiophile, but I know what sounds good and what doesn't. I tried toying with the EQ on the app and that only helped things marginally. Also if you have bigger ears, these will fit more like on ear headphones. My ears are smaller and I still had to tuck them into the ear cups.The only positive thing I can say about these cans is that the build quality is excellent for being all plastic. Doesn't feel cheap and creaky like the Solo3's that I own.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe I'm missing something..

    ","I use my headphones mostly for listening to audiobooks and I've been using a cheap pair for years. And by cheap, I mean they break every year so I've had a buy a new pair. I don't think I can ever go back! These are so soft and comfortable. I had no problems pairing them with my iPhone. I love that they fold up and even come with a case. And the sound quality is fantastic. All ambient noise is filtered out so I can focus on what I'm listening to. I can still hear my kids when they call for me so I can avert disaster. Win win.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these!
