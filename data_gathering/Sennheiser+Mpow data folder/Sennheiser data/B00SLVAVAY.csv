    ","I have owned many headsets over the years, usually top of the line Sony's, Sennheiser's, etc.  This is the best sound, I have ever heard.  I was a little skeptical at first, because Sennheiser, has not been known for it's great bass sound.  But these are not your Daddy's Sennheiser's.  I'm 79 years of age, and these babies are, MINE!Follow Up:  About 6 months after purchase the headphones started cutting in and out.  The location of the base is about 10 to 12 feet in front of me.I have tried moving the base.  Changing the re-charging batteries, switching to regular batteries, adjusting the volume on my TV, opening and closing them around my ears.  Nothing works.  The earphones haven't been abused, I am elderly and use them every evening for about two hours. Then they go back on the cradle.  For over two hundred dollars, they should last more than a year, wouldn't you think?",2.0 out of 5 stars,I should have waited before writing review

    ","I went with the RS 165 RF because of my frustration with the competitor's TV Ears remote headphones.  I had two sets of TV Ears and both of them broke and fell apart in less than one year or usage.  I wanted a more durable and reliable product so I went with the RS 165 RF.The RS 165 RS headphones not only continue to perform well after 7 weeks of use but have actually exceeded my expectations.  The sound quality is vastly superior to lower cost competitors such as TV Ears.  They appear to be solidly built and I expect that they will be very durable but the trade off is that they are just very slightly heavy and block out environmental noise so I have to take them off to hear what is going on in the room around me.  That is both a bane and a blessing at the same time.The instructions could be better.  One other reviewer complained that he couldn't get them to turn on. That could be because there is a universal power switch symbol on the charging station that looks like a power switch but is actually just a power indicator.  In my opinion, the designers should have used some other symbol (perhaps a lightning bolt symbol) for this indicator.  I shared the other reviewer's difficulty until I discovered that the real power switch is on the headphones themselves.  The power switch is rather small and not obvious.  Once I figured this out, everything worked well and I am very pleased with the product.  The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 Star rating is because of the poor instructions on how to turn on the phones.  I would recommend this product to those consumers that want a more durable and higher quality product than TV Ears.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound quality is vastly superior to lower cost competitors such as TV Ears

    ","Negative1) These wireless headphones, Sennheiser RS 165 RF, Totally block out someone trying to talk to you. Totally frustrating my wife!!2) They are also Hot on my ears after wearing them for awhile!3) The adjustable head band is made is just like my old Sennheiser  RS 120. After 3 1/2 years, the plastic areas that hold the spring steel band in place, started breaking. I first glued these 4 areas, then Duct Tapped them when they cracked again,  to be able to wear the headset.4) The sound input jack is a single,  3.5 mm stereo jack. In order to hook this headset into my Dennon AV Receiver, I had to buy a Y adapter to convert this hookup to dual left/right RCA plugs, something to be aware of!5) The power button is flush and hard to find while you're wearing these, also you have to hold the button down for 2 seconds. It doesn't instantly power up!Positives The sound quality is excelent, Cristal clear voices and no background static. Decent music quality with reasonable bass levels. Even with the Bass boost selected, it's not a Strong thumping bass, better for your eardrums, since they seal tightly around your ears!  Except for the Hot ears, these are fairly comfortable.* Bottom line, for me, I don't like the almost total isolation these headphones have. Even with the sound turned off, I can barely hear people around me and,  how hot my ears get after wearing them a while! Also I'm guessing the adjustable  headband will break after about 3 1/2 years since it's stress points are made exactly like my old RS 120! For the price, that's totally unacceptable!I'm selling these and  buying a replacement for my old set, Sennheiser RS 120. ($59.98) They don't sound quite as good, but much more comfortable and less isolated, AND MUCH less expensive than the current price for these.  Wow! The RS 165 today is $219.00!",3.0 out of 5 stars,TOTALLY blocks out anyone trying to talk to you!

    ","After almost 20 years of use, I had to replace an early Sennheiser model that was closer to the RS line of headphones.  I tried the Newer RS 120, deciding I didn't need the surround sound function, but it was over ear, which I didn't like.  Researched and choose these headphone based on reviews and features.  Price was fine.  I like this headphones much better than my original ones.  The cup of the earphone fits nicer and the sound is great.  I mostly use it for TV and Movie watching when house need to be quiet.  I've listed to some streaming music with them and the sound is pretty good.  Distance is ok, within sight, I've tried to walk outside, but once I'm away from the closest window, I loose the signal.  I was just testing, I don't really care to walk around outside with my headphones anyway, but within the house I can go just about anywhere.  I don't use the bass boost for TV or movies, I might turn it on when listening to music, but that's about it.  It ok, but I've heard better bass boost. It more like a low shelf boost than others.One other thing I like;  My hearing is going and I find myself reading the subtitles more and leaving them on.  Some older movies I stream don't have subtitles and these headphone make it so I don't miss them. I can hear dialog clearly.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great set of Wireless headphones

    ","I do transcription for a living and need good reliable headphones in order to do my job.  The quality of the sound is excellent, absolutely no background noise.  They do have to stay at least a couple feet from my wireless router otherwise I get a little feedback and I do receive a little bit of interference during a thunderstorm.I am sold on Sennheiser products.  I have other systems in my house and receive the same excellent quality for all.  I would highly recommend them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love Sennheiser!

    ","I have had the older RS120 on our bedroom TV for years, but moved them to the gym so I could hear the TV above the treadmill. I have one good ear. I picked these as the replacement for the bedroom TV.  I had no need for fancy features so this would be as good or better than the ""just fine"" old RS120. I was delighted once the night-long required wait for the initial battery charge was completed. The sound is outstanding, even for my ""bad"" ear. They are very comfortable. Volume and tone are great. My only minor complaint is that they give you four or five international wall charger adapter plugs that no one in the US needs. No one travels with this rig unless they still use a steamer trunk. A waste of product and money. I tossed them in the garbage. YET they do NOT give you the 3.5 miniature phono plug to RCA male plugs conversion cord that most of us need, or at least many of us. Dumb!

    ","I had hoped to find something similar at a lesser price but settled on these and am quite happy with them.  The RF design is trouble proof and the range is excellent.  The charge tower is simple and convenient.  They are more comfortable than I expected, not too tight and sit well.  I will not comment on the sound quality other than to speculate that any closed back design suffers flaws but my objective was to block out external noise, as such these sound good to me as long as you don't saturate them with too much low frequency bass.  I expect the open back 180 series sounds better but can't achieve the isolation these do.  In any case I find them high quality, convenient and comfortable.  Note that these 165s only have a single RCA jack input, no digital optical, but that was all I required.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"They Deliver on Build Quality, Convenience, Comfort and Range."

    ","I needed  a set of headphones to use exclusively with the television.  Either it’s late night and I can’t turn up the sound for fear of waking someone, or there was a lot of other noise in the house and  I had to turn it up to hear all the dialogue clearly.The connection that I used was TV digital audio out -> D/A Converter -> dedicated headphones. My current analog output goes to an amplifier for running through the big stereo speakers and I wanted to keep the two independent. Originally, someone recommended that I buy a Bluetooth transmitter and then buy a pair of Bluetooth headphones where there are more options. I tried this but the Bluetooth adapter wouldn’t connect to the headphones, and when I tried the headphones, they didn’t Isolate very well and the sound was mediocre. Plus this rig was more money than the Sennheisers. So I sent that stuff back and bought the Sennheisers.My main concern was the quality of sound. I heard some wireless headphones many years ago and they sounded like crap. Like AM radio with all the hiss, etc. I own several pairs of headphones for music listening and some of them exceed $1000 in price. So I’m pretty picky and my expectations were high.Do these sound like really expensive headphones? No. but they sound pretty darn good and there was ZERO background noise. I could hear all the low level details, and on one movie there were low level background noises that I actually thought for a moment were coming from my kitchen. My main complaint about the sound is that the top end is rolled off slightly so it doesn’t show the details with cymbals or other high frequency sounds. This would be a deal killer for me if they were for music, but for television and movies it’s not a big deal.I find the comfort to be very good. I think my head is pretty average sized and they fit well. They isolate external noises pretty well also. Some have complained that the headband could use a little more padding but I don’t have a problem with it.Two minor annoyances…First, Sennheiser should have included an RCA to mini cable. This will be used more than a mini-to-mini connection (in which they include a cable) but RCA to Mini cables can be bought for less than $1 in bulk. There is no good reason why Sennheiser couldn’t have included this. The other issue is the ergonomics of the volume up/down buttons.  I’m not blind so Braille isn’t really my thing. The raised “+” and “-“ on the headset take some getting used to. A competent human factors team could have come up with a design that’s more intuitive.I didn’t find the bass boost to be of much value. I don’t think the headphones are bass deficient, and the effect of the boost is a little unnatural. You don’t need it. A better approach would have been to make it a “loudness” button which along with a little bass would boost the highs a little also. Loudness is beneficial at lower listening levels if it’s implemented properly.I thought it was a nice choice for Sennheiser to use rechargeable AAA batteries in the headset. I hate when companies use some obscure battery that’s hard to replace. This isn’t the case here. Also the manual recommends an initial charge of something like 14hrs. (going from memory) But I just pulled the batteries out and put them in my other battery charger for 2 hours and they were fully charged, so I could use the headset the same evening.  I have yet to run these down mid viewing, including watching television for 6+ hours.So although not perfect, this headset is still a really solid 4 star recommendation.",4.0 out of 5 stars,For TV audio....You can't go wrong

    ","I was saving up for the RS 195 and further study convinced me the only differencewas fake surround sound and an optical input.  I can do without those!  I should havepaid further attention to the specs.The 165 has one third the range of the higher priced models.  It says that clearly onthe pages of the full sized (Firefox on the PC), but not so clear on the smart phoneapp.  My bad.  I'll keep them as they work fine in the listening area and even into thecan.  If I head  toward my man cave, I only get down the 3 steps into the lower areaof the house and this is 35 feet from the base!  To be fair, the specs say 100 feet""Line of Sight"".  My 35 feet is through about 4 walls and the washer/dryer when Iturn and look back from the drop out area.  I suspect others having trouble 15 feetaway have the unit very near a router or other transmitting device.  My WiFi is inthe other end of the house.  In my shop about 50 feet distant, I can sorta get a signalif I hold my mouth right, but I've never been very good at that.  They're relegated tothe living room....The good:  They fit great and are comfortable.  Compared to my old HDR 120's a worldof difference.  They stay on my head and do not tend to fall into the commode, forinstance.  That was always annoying with the 120's.  Noise is blocked out as I desired.the wife can yell at the cat or talk on the phone without annoying Mozart or the TV.Sound is clear, uncolored and pleasant.  There is amply volume available (much morethan you'll safely use).  The Bass Boost ads very subtle body to the sound withoutbeing over powering.I connect to the analog audio out of the Dish receiver and with a switch also to thestereo receiver recorder ouputs.  It takes adapters to do this.  If you are connectingto an earphone level output, you are on your own.  At line level, they work great.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Warning!

    ",I'm 65 yrs old and wear older hearing aids for mod - severe hearing loss.  I've used Sony's headphones for about 3 years and neither of the 2 pairs lasted much over a year.  The ear ups on then Sony phones were pretty shallow and allowed the speaker casings to touch my hearing aids causing a lot of quality issues.  I bought the Sennheiser RS165 RF for only a few dollars more as a replacement. What I've experienced is1.  The ear cups are deeper and comfortable (solves feedback and distortion issues).2.  I've gained an in set volume control (super convenient and produces a higher volume than Sony)3.  A base boost button on the head set (great for when you want to amp up the bass a touch)4.  The overall quality has been vastly improved for this first month I've been using themI've seen a couple of folks complain about the headset being a little difficult to get back on the base/recharger.

    ","Two things that other reviewers have said are true:  Unless your sound source takes a 3.5 mm pin connector, you will have to buy the proper connector and/or cable.  The converter connector shown in the manual (3.5 to 1/4"") is not provided; nor is a split ""Y"" RCA cable.  It's surprising that at least one type of adapter is not provided, since they do include 4 different types of electric socket plug adapters!The other minor annoyance is that the headset is tight, presumably for people who have larger head sizes.  I wear a 7-1/2 hat size, and the phones are a tad too snug, especially after an hour or so of use.  The tension will probably relax after continued use.  I may attempt to stretch them out a little, even though the ""safety"" manual advises against it.The phones themselves are very good.  Good sound quality, and easy to adjust.  I use them with a television with speakers hooked up via a tuner.  So the phones required a head phone jack.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality - may need connector/adapter

    ","As an audio professional I am disappointed with the audio quality, but for the price the Sennheiser RS165's are sufficient for our purpose. We are using the RS 165's as monitors while shooting handheld live music video. The headphones have a good fit and finish, are comfortable to wear, but sound hollow compared to our Audio-Technica ATHM50 and Sony MDR7506 headphones. For listening pleasure, these RS 165's would be my last choice. Also, these brand new Sennheiser RS 165's came with a bad mini-jack cable which caused a severe Left/Right imbalance--a quick change of the mini-jack cable fixed the imbalance, but I would expect better QC from Sennheiser.

    ","You'll love this quality, comfortable, reliable, BlueTooth headset.  I bought two 5 months ago and haven't regretted the purchase.  I live in a smallish apartment and can watch TV or listen to the audio system without disturbing anyone.  There is a bass enhancement button and the headset mimicks surround sound.  The stand is also a recharger: very functional.I highly recommend the Sennheiser RS 165 RF especially for apartments or the bedroom (if you or significant other is a night owl and the other isn't!).

And the stand arrangement is more compact and docks well.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, on/off features.  Snug fit, and excellent noise cancellation.  Sound range shorter than expected."

    ",I have two complaints.1: the plasticy fake leather that sennheiser and other companies use for ear pads is pretty uncomfortable. These replaced some other sennheiser headphones that have the nicer fuzzy earpads. That same fuzzy earpad style is available on the RS 185. You can buy replacement pads for the 185 and they fit the 165 perfectly. I did this and couldn't be happier with the comfort of the headphones.2: The battery charges so slowly. It takes hours.

    ","I waited a few months to review this because of some of the negative reviews. This is my personal and unpaid review. The sound quality is fantastic. The sound is impressive even with the bass boost turned off during normal TV shows. When I play a movie the bass boost adds just a enough bass to feel those explosions and heavy sounds. The clarity is fantastic. I can hear dialog better than ever. No need for closed captions anymore. The price compared to others is a little high but worth every penny, I wish I purchased them sooner. Connecting to TV is simple and easy. The batteries have outlasted my 5 hour marathons. They can also easily be swapped out once the start to wear down. The fit, They did feel a little tight when new but now they seem to have loosened up a bit and now feel comfortable. The are a little large so resting your head on a pillow could be a problem. Dropout, after months of use I did have dropout twice. My conclusion is that if the audio is corrupted or the audio feed drops below a certain level the headphone will not carry the bad audio and it sound like a dropout. I use a DVR and when replayed over the dropout reoccurs indicating it the sound feed and not the headphones. I prefer this over poor sound in the headset. Most people, while watching a TV show accept the video signal glitch from time to time but when the audio does it and your using headphone it becomes noticeable. As for the closed back design, I prefer the better isolation of background noise. If something loud happens in the house you will still hear it. The buttons for changing the volume would benefit from a better tactile felling. Maybe the + and - could be raised more than they are so they are easier to find. Be warned, this head set can be turned up very loud. if you have hearing problems these will do the job.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic sound, easy setup, good volume, and good fit after a few weeks"

    ","This is my second pair of wireless Sennheiser headphones. When it comes to wireless headphones, I have found Sennheiser to be a decent choice. I have paid less and gotten better sound, but the comfort, build quality, aesthetics, and longevity of the product are quite good. With that said, Sennheiser headphones suffer from the same difficulties all wireless headphones seem to suffer from: poor audio, periodic cutting out when walking around the room, interference from surrounding electronics at times, and battery issues.Here are the positives for these headphones:1. I purchased these because I want to listen to TV and music without waking up and/or bothering my partner. Thus, sound leakage is paramount. These headphones are excellent in regards to sound leakage. I can turn this up quite loudly and she can't hear a thing. 5/5 for the primary purpose!2. The headphones come with rechargeable batteries. The system for recharging (i.e. the stand) is intuitive. in that the batteries recharge effectively and last for many hours.3. The headphones are comfortable. They offer a slight squeeze, enough so they don't fall off, but not so much that they are uncomfortable. Basically, a perfect fit for my 7 1/2 sized head.4. The bass mode is excellent. The primary competitor for these headphones are Beats. I have a disdain for Beats due to the low quality build and sound they produce. Yet, when it comes to wireless they are the best I have heard. My partner has Beats so I have a proper point of comparison. These offer slightly BETTER bass addition than beats. Surprising, right?5. For television the headphones are good. I can hear everything fine. When it comes to music though...Negatives:1. The music quality is low. To be fair, my normal headphones are Sennheiser HD650s. So the point of comparison isn't really fair. But still, even my Boss IE2s, Sony MDR 750s, and even my Soul by Ludacris headphones supersede these in sound quality for music. The bass is so good that I can overlook some of the music shortcomings when listening to music that is best with huge amounts of bass...but for an audiophile-seeking individual this is a poor listening experience. I normally listen to classical music when working and more pop-type music when listening for fun and emailing I would never listen to classical music with these. I'll just get frustrated. This is for bass-heavy music only.2. The batteries are rechargeable and so far things seem to be going smoothly. BUT, my previous pair of Sennheisers had serious battery issues. I am not sure how long these will hold up.3. I am aware these are not Bluetooth. I wasn't seeking Bluetooth capabilities. But wireless is synonymous with Bluetooth to some people (i.e. my wife). Apple seems to be moving toward an elimination of the headphone jack on their iPhones. People will be seeking wireless headphones - and these are NOT it. These rely on a 3.5mm audio jack. Also, don't expect to make phone calls with these on. These are for TV purposes.Bottom Line: Good sound quality for TV and they have very little sound leakage. But, remember the sound quality will be poor.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not mind-blowing

    ","I purchased the RS 165 for watching TV in a moderately noisy location.  They work for that though they aren't very isolating.  However, my main problem is with the controls.  I don't find them to be readily identifiable.  The up and down button plus the bass boost are located on the flat outside part of the right head phone.  The volume buttons are large and flat with a slightly raised plus and minus on them.  I have to find the middle head phone and feel my way to find the ridges that divide the buttons to know where I am.  I purchased another less expensive brand at Best Buy that had much better controls and took them back due to sound quality.

    ",Apparently those that say these work well have never used anything else.  I purchased 2 Sennheiser 120 headphones about 7 years ago.  Cost about $80 a piece.

    ","I have only 1 complaint--these aren't really comfortable. There's something about the angle that creates too much pressure for me right in front of my ears behind my jawbones that I don't like at all.  Adjusting the size up and down did not help.  I have a medium-sized head, unremarkable really in size. So I had to take off a star, because comfort is a huge factor in something like this.In terms of ease of use and performance, these are 5-star winners.  There is an instruction manual on DVD, but for me, the quick start guide was enough to figure them out (it's not rocket science!).  I had a little bit of trouble finding the on-button, but a half a minute of searching turned it up.  I was hooked up and able to use them within 5 minutes of opening the box.The sound quality is beautiful.  I had no idea YouTube could sound that good!  It was awesome to hear everything in stereo, crystal-clear.  The range of the speakers is amazing; I was walking all over the downstairs and I heard no reduction in sound quality.  Truly wonderful.I think if these fit your head well, you will adore these. If you are like me and find them an uncomfortable pressure, you may, like me, still decide they are worth using given the amazing sound and performance quality.

    ","Sometimes, my kids like to watch TV or play their Wii when there are adults in the room. Adults don't want the noise dialed up too loud. The kids can't hear over the adults. Cordless headphones are the perfect solution.These were easy to set up. I just had to hook up a cable to the TV and plug the stand into the wall. Note that only an auxiliary cable is included. I had to dig around my cable drawer for a dual RCA red/white) cable. I ended up using an RCA cable with yellow and black plugs on one end and red, white, and yellow plugs on the other. I just left the extra plugs dangling.To use, all I have to do is turn it on. If I want sound to only come out of the headset, I turn the TV volume down. The sound quality is everything I expect from Sennheiser - crisp and clear, with amazing sound separation I noticed from just watching TV. The range is incredible. The headphones don't have to see the stand. In fact, I walked away into another room behind the headphone stand with walls in between and still had good reception. My son give it his stamp of approval.I like the charging stand, the intuitive and easy to reach controls on the headphones, and the padding all around. I don't like that it sits a little on my ears and put pressure all around. It's somewhat firm and I can't loosen that by expanding the size.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Superior Range

    ","I purchased 2 complete RS 165 systems.  Headphones and charging base.  Plan was to use these like my previous Sennheiser headsets, HDR 65, that we loved for years.  One base was used only for charging.  The other base had the auto plugged in.THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH THIS MODEL. The 2nd headset, the one that came with the 2nd  base, will NOT work with the first base, even if the headphones from the 1st base are off.  Just to cover all the options, I removed the 1st set completely (headset and base), installed the 2nd set (headset and base).  It worked perfectly.  Swapped bases. The 2nd headset stopped working and the 1st headset came back on.  I'm guessing these things are set to some arbitrary frequency at the factory, and only the stand alone extra headset that they sell can deal with finding the base frequency.  I'm unhappy and will return both, and shop around for a company with less deceptive advertising.  Lousy design.  I didn't mind paying extra for the 2nd complete set so that i could have convenient charging station, although a accessory charging station would have been a good selling point.  But they don't care.I suppose if your base ever failed, you'd be forced to buy a whole new system, and throw out your perfectly good headset.  A sad story.  Time to move on.Just a footnote:  Buying 2 complete systems (base and headset at $158 each) cost just $18 more than buying the alternative, one complete system (headset and base $158) and the awkward 2nd stand alone headset ($140).  But saving the $18 means you have to explain to the family time and again why they have to dismantle the spare headset frequently when someone forgets to follow the rotation schedule to swap headsets around on the single charging/base station.  Plus you still have to go buy a AAA battery charging station!!  We're talking an 8 hour per headset charging cycle time here.  What's the chance of getting this organized in order to be able manage 16 hours of charging time out of every 24 for two headsets ???  Very remote in my family.  ...And where are those spare batteries, by the way?  dah!And which family member is going to get the crappy ""extra"" headset that's always dead when you need it?

280,"on April 13, 2017",,"These headphones are a big step up from the Sony MDR-RF-985RK that I have for watching TV and movies when my family is asleep. My biggest concern was better sound and connection. Sennheiser definitely delivered here but came up short in the comfort department.As far as sound, they're terrific. Audiophile quality isn't practicable from a wireless set of headphones but this is really close. If you're looking for a new set of headphones to watch TV and movies that delivers awesome sound, these are probably it. They feature a bass boost option that is excellent because the bass is pretty weak without it enabled. The RF connection is also solid, and there is no static of clipping even when I move around. This is a huge improvement and the biggest reason I was willing to dish out the money for a new set. My Sony's had constant static and clipping which only got worse when I moved my head around.The one thing I'll miss about the Sony's is the comfort. I could wear them for hours and feel great. Not so with the Sennheisers. The weight distribution puts a lot of pressure not only on my ears (which I guess is great for isolating sound) but also on the top of my head. The padding on the headband is thin and stiff so I'm always aware of it. Also, they're massive. I know people call them ""cans"" but it's almost like having empty Campbell's containers on my head.Bottom line is if you value audio above comfort, these are for you. If the reverse, I'd try something else. Also if you're like me and couldn't decide between the 165, 175, or 185, wirecutter has a helpful review suggesting these over the 165. From several hours of research, I gathered that the surround sound feature on the 175 is a major disappointment which sounds hollow. It does have markedly better range though. It sounds like the improvement in audio quality of the 185's isn't enough to justify the price bump (I got a sealed, brand new pair with full warranty for $127 on ebay). Great pair of headphone that I would easily buy again. They might not be for everyone though.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, but not very comfortable."
