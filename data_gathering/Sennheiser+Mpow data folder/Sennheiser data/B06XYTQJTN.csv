    ","This was to replace a Sennheiser IS410, where the electronics are unobtrusive, no lower than neck level.  This has the electronics hanging down to chest level.  When used reclining, this can be very annoying.  Finally found an IS410 elsewhere, so returning this.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Electronics hang down to chest

    ","These are great!! God sent! My family can watch tv like normal, I put on the headset, adjust the volume to what works for me. My right ear hearing is not good, I can balance the headset to feed more to my right ear. I cannot express how happy I am.  Quality is great, just buy the audio cord, plug into the cable box & done. Simple! Recommend for anyone with hearing problems.",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great!! God sent

    ","Disappointing.  I had to buy an extra connection to  hook up these earphones.  When I got them connected, I was extremely disappointed in the sound quality. The sound lacks fidelity and clarity with these earphones. They are not comfortable when I turn my head to one side or the other.  The feature that I did like was the ability to adjust the volume in the right and left earphones separately. I had far superior sound quality on my old Sony earphones which are now in need of replacement. I am returning these Sennheisers and will be trying something different.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor sound quality

    ","I tested these out with my parents, who have some hearing issues when we watch tv, and this has made a HUGE difference!First off, setup wasn't bad at all, and once the power and audio stuff is connected, it is SUPER easy to use. No crappy pairing process, as is usually the case with bluetooth. These are paired to the base already, so to turn them on, you basically just wear them. When you take them off, sound stops coming out. To charge them, you just put them back on the base. No re-pairing, loss of signal, etc.Also, the range is great! We have a big house, but you can walk pretty much anywhere and keep the signal going. It's nice because if you have a show on and need to do something by the kitchen or in the garden, you can keep listening as if you were in the same room--no problem!The sound quality is perfect for TV. I know some people aren't thrilled about it for music, and while that's totally valid, these are more for tv/movies anyway. For that, the clarity of sound is great, and you can go to pretty high volume. Also, you can adjust the volume differently for EACH EAR. So if you have hearing loss on one side but not the other, you don't have to harm your good ear and only hear quietly from the other--it has easy adjustments for this!Comfort: Great news: these hook into your ears and hang down comfortably, and they do NOT have to go over your head. Why does this matter? Because you can wear them with glasses without interfering or squishing the glasses into the side of your head. The pressure is strong-ish (so they don't slip off) so if you are sensitive or prone to headaches from pressure, you might not want to wear them all the time, but for most people, it should be fine for a few hours at a time.Difference between the 2000 and the 5000 model? 50 feet range difference, and 3 hours less time on a full charge for the 2000. Sound quality seems the same, and functionality is pretty much the same.Awesome solution for those with so-so hearing, or people sharing space and not wanting to bother neighbors or other residents.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy use, great sound/volume, comfortable"

    ","First, the Sennheiser headphones have great sound.  Also, it is easy to change the volume and the right/left balance. I have had older Sennheiser wireless ""over the ear"" headphones for several years and they still sound great. I had Sony headphones previously and I felt the Sennheiser was just a slight bit better in sound quality. I expected great sound from the RS 2000 digital.If you are hard of hearing, as I am, this is the best answer for listening to music or watching TV. I generally don't wear my hearing aids when I have either of the wireless phones on. They are not needed since the sound is immediate and the volume can be controlled without blasting out any one else watching TV. For listening to music, I just plug the Sennheiser head phones jack into the receiver front. Though...This does turn off the sound for anyone else since it no longer goes through the speakers.When I watch TV with my wife, she listens through the speakers and I through the headphones. (Without the headphones, I loose about 60 percent of the dialog from TV). To use both the speakers and headphones I use Zone Two on my Onkyo receiver. With this function, I can direct the sound to the headphones or even another set of speakers with one channel, while retaining the sound in the primary speakers through a second channel that my wife is listening to. In this way, with the Sennheiser phones and the receiver options, we can both listen and control the volume individually. If you have a very old receiver this same thing can be accomplished by hooking into the tape player jacks. ( Incidentally,  if you have a Onkyo receiver, and perhaps other receivers, in order to get sound to headphones through Zone Two, you must have RCA cables from the sound creating unit such as the TV, to the receiver.  The headphones will only work through analog in the Onkyo receiver. As far as I can determine, this is a receiver glitch, not the headphones. The Sennheiser headphones are digital and when they are used with my Sony Walkman or phone, it is directly digital.  I have both analog and digital cables hooked up to all of my system , TV, DVD, Blue ray). The phone jack in the front of the receivers work as usual.Even though the sound is great through the Sennheiser phones, I gave this unit 4 stars. This is why. The plug for the charger/headphones cradle  came with 4 different plug possibilities. It has different plugs for Great Britain, the rest of Europe and Australia as well as the US. They are all included. That's fine except that this is not an advantage for me, but rather for the company. I'm sure it is figured into the cost. Next, in order to plug the headphone base unit into the front of my receiver, I had to come up with a simple inexpensive adapter which was not included. I happened to have one. In order to plug the unit into the back of the receiver, Zone Two, I needed another adapter. This is an RCA adapter/spliter. With my former Sennheiser headphones, they came hook-up ready, this was something you now must buy. This again is a very inexpensive item which could have been included.Since most of us are used to either ear buds or over the ear phones, the configuration of this unit takes a little getting used to. They are definitely a sit down to use or perhaps using with limited walking around. The bottom of the unit is somewhat heavy and bounces when you walk, plus the ear pieces feel a little different for me. My wife feels they are very comfortable.I checked the range of these headphones and found that they were good throughout most of the house, but would go out in some of the further rooms. They did not work when I went outside or in the garage.Overall...because of the quality of the sound, the ease of use and my experience with my other set of Sennheiser headphones, I would order them again without question.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Wireless Head Phone

    ","I have owned, and loved, several Sennheiser headphones so I was excited to try this new stethoset style RS 2000. It was originally meant for the Exalted One, who likes to set the TV volume on ‚ÄúStun‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt know if I can give it up.You receive the headset, charging station, cords, manual, and four power adapters for UK, EU, US and Au. The manual is in about 17 languages.I am so over apps, Bluetooth and pairing! What a relief to just plug and play. Everything is SO simple.  You place the headset on the charger for about three hours. There is a red lit battery icon on the charger.  The unit is on when you fold the arms of the headset, off when you close the arms.  The volume buttons are on the front and left and right balance buttons on the sides.I have B & O sound systems on my computers (skullcandy on the laptop) but the sound can be improved with the balance buttons on the headset. It‚Äôs great to listen to something like a webinar and be able to walk away without losing sound quality.If you have a device with left and right audio output you will need what I call a ‚Äúsplitter ‚Äú. I don‚Äôt know the technical term. Love my Stethoset!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser RS 2000 Digital Wireless Headphone ...
