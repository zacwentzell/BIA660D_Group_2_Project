    ","I'm using it for a quiet, cable hassle-free guitar practice and they are amazing! Nowadays most other wireless headphones are digital, and conversion to digital and back adds significant latency. These, being analog RF, don't suffer from this problem. The latency is effectively zero!I've combined them with a wireless guitar system (line6 G10) to get a fully wireless setup. Sometimes I switch back and forth between playing through my amp's speaker and the headphones. Its funny to hear a latency when I step a few meters from the amp (each meter of distance adds about 3 ms of latency due to the speed of sound), but have a latency-free experience when wearing headphones.Note: due to them being analog, sometimes they produce a faint hiss, but if your input signal is high enough you'll barely hear it. You may need to adjust the levels of input and the volume or try switching channels to achieve best results.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for a quiet electric guitar practice

2,"on November 12, 2017",,IT HAS TERRIFIC SOUND QUALITY WITH EASY CONTROLS. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WITH IT IS THERE WAS DIFFICULTY WITH THE BASE UNIT PEELING THE CHROME OFF OF ONE SIDE WHICH THEN CORRODED TO THE POINT WHERE THE HEADPHONE COULD RARELY GET A GOOD CONNECTION TO CHARGE TO CHARGE ITSELF. I TRIED TO PURCHASE A REPLACEMENT BASE BUT THE COMPANY STATED THEY DO NOT HAVE REPLACEMENTS FOR ANY OF THEIR EQUIPMENT ERGO THE CUSTOMER IS FORCED TO PURCHASE A NEW UNIT AT AN EXORBITANT COST.

    ","We had purchased a similar pair (RS 118) of wireless headphones for my mother-in-law in Germany, so I had some experience with this line of headphones.  First off, the sound is really good.  Clean highs, good bass, and the semi-open back doesn't block out all the ambient noise, although it's still difficult to carry on a real conversation with the headphones on.  Second, the headset is very comfortable, although the cushion is uncomfortable if my hearing aid is still on.  I like the fact that placing the headset back on the stand automatically recharges the batteries - no separate charging device or connection is needed.  Third, setup is very easy, although I had some problems with a connection: we have all the sound running through a home entertainment receiver, with the TV connected via HDMI.  The receiver had to be set to pass the audio through to the TV, instead of 'passing it through' internally only, and the only audio output connections were on the TV.  The result was severe echo that could only be solved by resettting the audio delay for each input: cable, DVR, streaming, or DVD.  Not good.  In the end, I purchased an audio splitter that is capable of separating out the audio signal from the receiver before it gets to the TV.  Works well, but it's yet another device in the mare's nest of wires behind the entertainment center.  That said, none of this is Sennheiser's problem or fault.Bottom line: for the money, these wireless headphones can't be beat.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, good sound, easy setup"
5,"on March 17, 2018",,I use to watch TV from about 18 feet away in a straight line and they work fine with good sound quality.  In a 2 hour sitting I will normally a little interference 2 to 4 time for about 1/2 of a second.

6,"on February 3, 2018",,The reception from the base to the headset has to be tuned in and the sound is awful. Lots of static no matter where you find a signal. I had to provide my own cable splitter to plug in the RCA cables to the back of the TV. The best set I've found is from Insignia at best buy. Right off the shelf. The headset is connected to the base via bluetooth with no tuning needed and they sound great.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Losey Reception

    ","Pros:-Good quality sound.-I love the chargeable feature and stand.Cons:-UNCOMFORTABLE on my ears- They lay flat and hurt.- In order to have these sit right (less uncomfortable) on your ears, the tuner wheels are towards the back. If you lay back on anything that touches the wheels, they get out of tune or the volumes is changed. PITA.-DISLIKE the ""tuning"". I had some that were auto-tuned and liked them better.-They crackle at times.-They get serious static if you pause your program for very long.I am returning them and I tried to like them for a month.

    ","I bought this wireless headset in order to better hear my television.  However, I had nothing but interference when connected to my TV's audio socket, even when I increased the distance from the TV with a 20 foot audio extension cable.  The interference was definitely coming over the audio connection, which works fine with a wired headset.  When I checked the headphones by plugging the transmitter into my PC's audio system, the reception was clear as a bell.  So I figured out a work-around - I plugged the transmitter into my stereo amplifier, which is also connected to the satellite TV receiver.  Reception was OK, but I had a background 60 cycle hum which I could minimize by careful tuning, but could not completely eliminate.The listening experience was quite underwhelming.  The open design of the headset allows you to hear the normal TV audio speakers, unless you really turn up the volume on the headset to drown out of the background.  The normal audio interferes with the headset audio, causing an unpleasant echo effect because of the transmission delay to the headset..  My wife could also hear the echo from the headset from across the room, and complained that it was very distracting.  Also, the reception volume was rather erratic at times.  During a newscast, it seemed like it would amplify certain news presenters more than others, especially those doing a remote broadcast.  This could not be heard over the normal audio speakers.I am returning the product, and going back to my wired headset and long extension cable.",2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this wireless headset in order to better hear my television

    ","These headphones produce a pretty solid sound quality.  Probably not high quality enough for an audiophile, but more than good enough to listen to the television while the husband is working.  The problem is that they DO NOT stay on my head -- or my husband's head for that matter (i.e., they will probably fall off of any person's head unless one has a giant head).  Although the sound engineer may have gotten it right, the industrial design engineer really failed.  If I tip my neck forward just a smidge, the headphones slide forward. God forbid I lean over to pick something up from the floor, the headphones clatter to the floor EVERY TIME.  This is my second pair of Sennheiser headphones and the first pair did not have this issue.  Despite the nice sound quality, I'd be willing to pay double for a pair of headphones that stays on my head and would reconsider another Sennheiser purchase.",3.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones produce a pretty solid sound quality
