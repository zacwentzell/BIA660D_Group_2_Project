    ","I like my Urbanite XLs a lot. I love the sound. They're very comfortable for long listening periods. The battery lasts long enough that I am rarely concerned about it losing charge on me - I think I charge them once or twice a week with daily usage. Connecting and disconnecting from sources just works and is mostly effortless. Phone calls work really well considering you can't see a microphone (there is a little hole on the right ear cup to indicate a likely position). In a pinch, the 3 foot mini to mini cable works as advertised.That's the good and it shouldn't be overlooked. These are excellent headphones.Now the less good.- Touch based controls on the right ear cup are exactly where I go to grab these things often resulting in music starting to blare from whatever source I was connected to at the time or the last number I called to be dialed. This is my absolute biggest gripe with these.- The headphones are nicely compact when folded up, but that leaves 4 sharp metal edges exposed so I almost never fold them (except to show people you can).- The user-replaceable ear pads are too easy to accidentally tug off then take 5 minutes of concentrated effort to put back on. I actually lost one while walking, holding the headphones by the band. Replacements are easy to come by and only take 5 minutes of concentrated effort to put on.One even more minor gripe:- These do not come with a case (!) but instead have a little baggy you can use to... I don't know, wipe away the tears after losing an ear pad?",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like my Urbanite XLs a lot, but..."

    ","I love Sennheisers and have had 6 or 7 wired versions.  I wanted to try the Bluetooth versions so bought the Urbanite XLs and used them for a bit. After most recently coming from open back Sennheisers like the HD598 I found the soundstage on the Urbanite very constricting and the band and cups were uncomfortable for me (and they were noticeably heavy).  The sound was a bit 'muddy' compared to what I was used to, perhaps this was the focus on the bass to cater to the Beats crowd.  I also didn't like the slider touch control on the cup, volume up and down was too difficult to control.  I returned them and splurged for the Momentum 2 wireless which I find I like better w/ a better feel on the head/ears and an 'airier' less bass heavy sound, the Momentums are also lighter on my head.  Amazon was as cool as ever w/ their return policy.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Tried to like 'em, but moved up to the Momentum 2 wireless; still a Sennheiser fan"

    ","1. Headphones are smaller than HD600 series so they won't go snuggly around ears as HD600 does.2. Pads are very easy to remove, so you should be careful if you wear them around your neck from time to time (pads can fall off).Apart from this headphones connect and work well with different Bluetooth devices (phones, laptops). Sound is quite good.New:3. When you remove headphones without turning them off they sometimes make phone to redial last number. In short this touch interface suxx.4. When you wear a hoodie it sometimes causes touch interface on headphones to do stuff as well.AVOID.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Pads are very easy to remove

    ","High quality headphones!Pros: These appear to be very high quality. The headband is padded. The touch controls are a bit touchy but like anything, you just need to adapt and they will become second nature. They look really nice.  They are very comfortable.Cons: I could not seem to get the sound balanced. Without an equalizer they were not bass heavy but they seemed muffled. With an equalizer the highs never seemed to have clarity, almost as if the headset was faulty.Verdict: I returned them as I did not like the sound.Why four stars? Maybe they were faulty.",4.0 out of 5 stars,High quality

    ","I have had these headphones for almost a month so far and they continue to impress me.Comfort - The earpads sit nicely over my ears and don't cause any discomfort over long periods of wearing them which is important since I use these for my work. The only point where it becomes uncomfortable is if I wear them around my neck, but it's only uncomfortable when they're collapsed to the size of my head. Unfortunately I have to readjust them if I want to wear them around my neck and then put them back on my head. But that's pretty minor.Sound quality - These are honestly the best headphones I've ever heard. They rival some of the expensive speakers my housemate has (apples and oranges though). The lows are impressive, the mids are crisp and the highs are very detailed with only a hint of sibilance.Bluetooth - This was the main reason I bought these headphones since I was sick of throttling myself when I stood up at my desk at work, the Bluetooth is almost flawless. There's no discernible loss of sound quality over Bluetooth and it doesn't drop out.The dual device pairing is awesome too, I have these connected to my phone and my work computer and when there's a lull in audio typing, I can switch to listening to music on my phone. There are occasional lag issues from my computer but that's possibly my Bluetooth adapter or the computer itself as my phone never has those problems.Value for money - Given these are up to $600 and I've never seen them below $400 in Australia and I got them for $220 including shipping here on Amazon, I'm pretty satisfied with what I got for what I paid.I've never used a better pair of headphones and they continue to blow my mind with the amazing sound quality over Bluetooth.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent pair of headphones with not much to fault

    ","I'm surprised how dissatisfied I am with this product given its relatively high ratings - maybe I got a lemon, but the problems seem integral to the design. Difficult to use, volume control inoperable, pads that pop off when you look at them, are really easy to lose, and then are quite difficult to reinstall. Has something changed with the manufacturing that has harmed the quality? I accidentally left them on the airplane and when the airline called to let me know, I said, ""Don't bother sending them to me, they aren't worth the effort.""",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bad design, frustrating to use"

    ","Best over ear wireless headphone on the market. I have tried numerous brands of headphones and these definitely deliver crisp sound and deep bass that doesn't overpower the clarity of music. These are perfect for any style of music and overall are a well balanced headphone. The touch control on the side is a very clever concept but can take a while to get use to, but once you get the hang of it you will love the feature. The sound isn't as loud as I expected but if you connect via wired connection you can get the extra sound boost to increase loudness. I will also note that I have a large head so it is hard to find headphones that are comfortable to wear for long periods of time and so far these win in the comfort category. For the price you really get a great pair of feature packed headphones",5.0 out of 5 stars,Look no further for great headphones

    ","I love these. Simple as that. Now, having said that. I'm not a new guy to bluetooth headphones. These sound great. They are large on your head and feel very, very solid. The build quality is just insane. To be fair, these aren't as good as my Sennheiser HD598. But for the value and practicality, they probably are better. These are more of a usable headphone. I've bought many. bluetooth cans. To list a few, Bluedio Air, August EP650, Avantree Audition, Bluedio R+ (love these as well. strong competitor to these in my opinion.). Yet these just exceed all of them. Problem is the money. My Bluedio R cost me 80$. The August Ep650 was ONLY 50$. Less than half of what I paid for my Urbanites. My recommendation? If you're willing to pay more, sennheiser all the way. If not? I'm afraid I have to vote the August Ep650.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pair, but it comes at a price. Literally."
8,"on December 19, 2015",,"I had ordered a set of Beats Studio Wireless headphones and found them to be uncomfortable and with a flawed Bluetooth which caused them to lose their connection constantly. I came to Amazon and ordered these as a replacement. Not only are they less expensive but they are better all around. The cans move up and down smoothly and not by notches so they achieve a custom fit. The touch/swipe control pad functions perfectly. There are no hidden buttons all over the place. The swipe pad on the right does everything. I find that its sensitivity is just right. These do not have active noise reduction but they fit and seal so well that they don't need it. Because of this, the slight hiss of ANR is absent. It's just music. Whether I'm listening to an orchestra, Norteño, Reggaetón or bagpipes, the sound is amazing and rich with nothing missing or overdriven. Battery life is beyond excellent. The headband is padded just right so it is comfortable. These should have been my first choice because they are outstanding.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best I Have Owned!

    ","The sound quality and bluetooth functionality is nice, no complaints. But, and as many reviews have noted - THE EAR PADS FALL OFF WAY TOO EASILY! And, they take minutes of concentrated effort to put back on. Really quite a nuisance and a time burner -- especially to the point of me feeling the need to write this review.I always keep them in the case provided and move them gently from place to place -- and they still happen to fall off. So, if you buy these headphones, expect with high certainty they'll fall off for you too.I haven't tried using a hard casing for the headphones.... that could work.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Earpads will fall off for you, too!"

11,"on October 16, 2015",,So far it is everything sound wise you could expect from a BT signal. Very good bass as stated in other reviews. Good battery. Charges quickly. Comfortable but the earphones keep slipping down the head band. The issue about sensitivity with the control pad on the right ear is easily managed by using the design of the touch pad. Notice the top of both touch pads have a cured top. With your right for finger start above the touch pad and slowly slip into the curve. Then littlely slide down onto the touch pad itself to initiate a command. With practice you'll get the hang of it. Still overly sensitive and must watch for careless touching. It can actually accidently re-dial a phone number if you touch the wrong sequence of touches. I almost ordered three more pizzas!! Great set of cans overall.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good bass as stated in other reviews

Expensive, but then again, they are Sennheiser's.EDIT:  I have decided that the weight of the product, and the fact that when I look downwards they slide off is enough to prompt me to return them in exchange for the Bose Soundlink II Wireless headphones.  Just a note for those prospective buyers, plan on staying fairly docile while listening to your headphones then they are a great choice, otherwise, the Bose Soundlink II stay on a bit better due to the lighter weight (and 10 hours less battery life; in accordance i'm sure to battery size).

13,"on March 4, 2016",,"After ordering a pair of cheap, but expensive looking Turbine headphones, whose sound ""quality"" turned out about as good as a listening to your neighbor's 20 year old bumping tunes on his souped up Honda Civic (lots of bass, little of anything else), I decided my ears deserved a pair of well-made, quality headphones, so I ordered these instead.What can I say? Sennheiser is one of the top brands for audio equipment for reason. The Germans know what they're doing. The sound quality is superb, and these are comfortable to wear, although my left ear does need a break from time to time. The battery lasts for a long time (almost a week), and is apparently replaceable, so you know you're buying something that you don't need to throw away in a year because it's broken.My only complaint is, as other reviewers have already mentioned, that darn touch control on the right speaker. It's waaayyy too sensitive at times (usually when turning on), and doesn't seem to work at all at other times (usually when trying to turn off, as you'd expect per Moore's Law). Nevertheless, I decided to keep them, because hey, nobody's perfect. Also, these look a hell of a lot better than the dorky MM 550-X. I'll probably hang on to these until I can afford to get a pair of Momentums.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones

15,"on January 22, 2016",,"They're good looking and they have good battery life. That's about it.They don't sound that great (somewhat muddy), although they sound ok when compared with their peers. Comfort depends on your ears, but I didn't find them comfortable at all. They have an excellent velour-like padding, but the foam inside is not soft and when you combine the somewhat small opening with average to large ear size, you get this weird situation where it's 75% around-ear and 25% on-ear and they are just uncomfortable in the long run.The touch controls are both slow and finicky. You'll find yourself tapping around on the pad multiple times wondering if it registered or not. You'll have to learn to adjust the cups grabbing them weirdly by the sides making sure you don't touch the pad.Oh, and $300 headphones that come with the cheapest of cloth bags for storage? Pass.Just get the Plantronics BackBeat PRO Wireless Noise Canceling Hi-Fi Headphones with Mic - Compatible with iPhone, iPad, Android, and Other Smart Devices - they are superior in all aspect except styling. But if styling is a priority, get the Beats instead.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"75% around-ear, 25% on-ear, finicky touch controls. Sound is not that great either."

I feel the ear pads are the weakest link in the system and I expected much better from Sennheiser for the price.  Fairly comfortable but not super comfortable. Check out the offerings from JBL, Sony and Bose.  The Senn's did not live up to my expectations.  I would have returned had the ear pads issue surfaced while it was still returnable.  I plan to replace soon.  Bluetooth connection however is flawless, no complaints there.

18,"on January 3, 2016",,"These things are AWESOME.  The sound quality is excellent.  I bought these for my son who is a musician.  He has the wired version of these and LOVES them, but being tethered is sometimes problematic.  I have seen him forget he has them on (they are that comfortable) and get yanked back by the cord when he gets up to walk across the room.  I bought him these for Christmas.  He paired them to his phone and I haven't seen him without them since.  He did let me listen to them, and I was amazed at the sound quality.  I expected to lose some sound quality simply because they are wireless, but they sounded the same or even better than his wired version which are pretty freaking fantastic too.  I was kind of hoping he would give me the wired ones, but he said he would use those if these ran out of juice or he forgets to charge them - darn it!  Speaking of battery life, he can use these all day, and they don't die, so that gets 5 stars too.  The only semi-complaint he has is that the touch controls are sensitive.  He accidentally turns them off/on when he moves them, but he said that since he has been using them he has learned and adjusted accordingly so it's not a problem.  Long story short, I would definitely recommend these!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spectacular sound!

Being Bluetooth 4.1 they have better battery life, superb base. I hate noise cancelling as it feels so unnatural to me and therefore these were amazing good for the sound quality they offer. Beats are popular but they got serious overtone of low and high frequency issue. These on the other hands have very decent sound quality and surely will be one of the best on wireless I believe.There is a microphone which i thought would be useless for making phone calls .. but to its wonder.. it does a very decent job of taking phone calls which is not what i bought them for but is a plus+Be careful with folding them as the finger may get stuck if you are not carefully looking ..The cushions on the sides can be easily removed and placed back .. not sure if you get spares .. so leave them the way they are ..Hope this helps !!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Value for Money

The battery life is also incredible and I never have to worry about being music-less when I'm out and about. Three problems with these headphones: (1) they sit really flat on my head, (2) the touch pad is really sensitive so if you have to raise your arms often (like at the gym) this will get annoying fast, and (3) the ear cups keep falling out. If you take off the headphones and rest them on your neck you have to be really careful or else you'll end up re-tracing your steps looking for these ear cups.

I can only reach about 20 feet on both my Macbook and Nexus 6P before I start to get choppiness to the point I can't really listen anymore. And the worst part of all, hands down, is the touch controls. I'm not sure why this was implemented but it was implemented badly. To change volume, play/pause a song, you must use your finger along the side of the headphones. The volume works ok, but occasionally it will pick it up as you pressing play or pause.

Very easy to setup and play.The overall sound is quite good considering they are Bluetooth, very round full low end, crunchy detalied mids and highs are perfect for my personal taste.  Soundstage is quite expansive as well.  With the APTX codec you can hear noticeable differences between 320k and FLAC.  Battery life is spectacular, charging time quite short.  Overall very pleased with these headphones and look forward to many years of use.  Only downside is side controls are a bit finnicky, and often I find myself starting or stopping by accidentally adjusting them, have a tedious time getting the tapping speed down for the forward/reverse command.

    ","I'm known to my friends as kind of a headphone fetishist. I have been collecting headphones for over 15 years. Probably could have bought a house or two with the amount of money i've spent on headphones. Many a pair from Sennheiser, including models such as the HD595, and the HD650, ultrasone models, tons of bose, beats, all of them, ALL of them.I have a special need for bluetooth headphones. Let me tell you, A2DP headphones have come so far in the past 5 or so years. They used to be limited to crappy ear buds or just in general junky quality headphones. While beats kind of brought bluetooth headphones into the ""premium"" space, i still was never happy with any of them.And then Sennheiser comes out with the Urbanite XL wireless, and i absolutely love them. Why didn't i get the momentum 2 wireless? active notice canceling. I HATE it. it makes my head feel like its being squeezed in a trash compactor. I've tried so many ANC sets, including the QC15, the QC20i's and so on.So i was excited that Senn decided to leave this feature out of the Urbs. There really isn't much about these headphones i don't like, in fact they may very well be the best headphones i've ever had, and by far not the most expensive. The battery lasts for hours and hours, they did take a bit of use to get comfortable on my head but they finally settled in. I do have a large head, and wear glasses, typically the 2 worst things when it comes to finding comfortable headphones. The sound for me is spot on, i usually use an EQ to boost bass, but with these i run it flat and am completely happy. So if you're one of those who like pure flat, maybe these aren't for you.The range is good, the build is good, the touch thing on the side is kinda wonky and a bit sensitive, but it doesn't really bother the experience enough to call it a con.I would have liked a better case, the bag that comes with them is acceptable at best. I would have also liked a slightly longer cable, but i do like very much how the cable connects with a twist on lock, as opposed to just being held on by friction like most hybrid bluetooth headphones.Another feature these have that many bluetooth headphones dont is that you can plug in a usb cable from the headphone to your windows/mac and they will function as a usb sound card, allowing you to not use your analog jack, and eliminating potential static, hiss, etc.I guess what i can say in closing is, i love them, i love them i love them, and getting them on amazon warehouse deals for sometimes 100 bucks off msrp, they're a steal.

    ","Wanted to LOVE these, but ultimately returned them.PROS:-  Good sound. Punchy bass, well detailed highs, while mids are well represented with an overall ""club-like"" sound.  The sound is not overly exaggerated as one would expect based on the description and there is still a relative balance to the sound.-  Solid build.  Materials feel durable and well put together.-  Dual mic works well.  One of the mics is in the typical location at the bottom of the earcup, while the other is on the side of the earcup.  My voice was picked up with satisfactory overall clarity and volume, even if I sounded slightly ""compressed"".  My voice came across smooth with no notable echoing or distortions.CONS:-  Although he sound was quite good overall, my only complaint in this area is the lack of sub-bass response.  Again, the bass is quite punchy, but don't expect ""rumbling"" or low-end bass ""texture"".  The drivers are, based on my research, 32 mm vs. 40 mm+.  Had these specs been disclosed by Sennheiser, I could have made a better decision before purchasing.-  Advertised as ""over-ear"", but literally, unless you are a small child, this will NOT fit over your entire ear.  I have relatively small ears for an adult, but the barely 5 cm earcup opening us MUCH too small to fit my entire ear.  Moreover, the opening is round vs. oval, so it's not an natural ear-like opening.  It only fits about 80% over my entire ear and prevents me from getting a good quality seal. - The earcup sliders.  I definitely prefer an adjustable ""clicking"" headband vs. these, since the resistance is not enough to prevent unintentional re-sizing when moving your head, resting your head against a lounge chair, etc.Again, liked the sound, but the CONS just pushed me to return them.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, BAD fit."

    ","I have a lot to say about these cans.  Mostly positive.The first thing you should know is they do NOT have a low profile on your head.  They are wide and heavy.  I got them because they looked way sturdier and a little more stylish than the bose or beats equivalents.  I still find this to be true, but with sturdiness comes a little weight.  Although very comfortable, you certainly won't forget they are on your head.  If you're looking for lightweight comfort, probably go for Bose.  Still, I always felt like the Bose ones will snap in half if you look at them the wrong way, which is not the case for these.  I carry these around in my backpack with only the included soft pouch and they still work and look like brand new.The ear pads are removable and replaceable.  This seems like a cool concept, but I've had some trouble with them coming off when I don't want them to and they are kind of a pain to get back into place.  A very minor problem, but it's there nonetheless.The sound quality is everything you could ask for.  And because they are so thick and heavy, they isolate really well.  The rest of the world melts away with these guys over your ears.Touch controls: Hard to get used to at first (redialed my mom a lot by accident) but very useful once you get the hang of it.  Now I can start a playlist on my tablet and just leave it in my backpack but still skip/repeat songs and adjust the volume with a quick reach to my ear.Battery life: so good that you will wonder what the hell happened every time they die.  On iPhone you get a battery gauge next to the bluetooth icon, otherwise there's a touch control where a voice tells you a time range for remaining battery life (""more than twelve hours play time"").  But actually I use these off and on all day every day and only charge them once a fortnight.Never been disappointed with Senn and this is absolutely no exception.  They aren't perfect, but I can't imagine you will do better for the price if wireless is a necessity--and it should be.  It's life changing.  Treat yo self.Thanks for reading!

    ","I ultimately ended up returning these. To be fair, it was largely my own fault.I have had a pair of Sennheiser HD590s since highschool. Lord did I love those things. These days they look rather ratty and are slightly blown out in the left ear, but they were a fantastic workhorse for over a decade. Heck, they got me through obtaining a bachelors in music! But that's the past and these days I am software engineer earning his second degree at ASU. As such, I got to order a MacBook with a nice student discount, and with it came...a Beats Solo2 Wireless.I instantly fell in love with the cordless cans life. It even had a microphone builtin! No more uncomfortable setups for gaming or business VoIP! Except...on-the-ear just outright hurt after 30mins and the sound frankly sucked. They advertise hard hitting bass, and that is exactly what it is. The only genres that made me raise an eyebrow was rap and hip hop - two of my least listened to genres. They even managed to screw up other, supposedly, bass heavy genres such as psytrance. I had grown up on the ""flat"" sound of Sennheiser and ended up resenting the EQ decisions that the Beats was making for me. But did I desperately want to keep the cord cut.So out I went. All I wanted was my HD590s, but wireless. Sennheiser had done me SO well for over a decade that I was instantly drawn to this headset. It seemed like exactly what I desired. Well, that's what I told myself anyways. These are really are meant to be competitors to the Beats. That is, worn in public with a bass emphasis. The result is the earpads are small and tight to avoid leaking and there is a slight EQ bias towards bass (not nearly as much as the Beats, I don't think Sennheiser had the heart to so completely butcher its core sound). Unfortunately I had no intention of wearing these in public, I needed a domestic headset. That means I was dealing with the discomfort of tight earpads and a less than desirable sound profile in exchange for bluetooth at home...all at the tune of $300.To me that was just too much compromise for $300. So I returned these and bought a pair of Sennheiser HD 598 Over-Ear Headphones. These are a true replacement for my HD590s and are fantastic for my purposes. I am keeping the Beats for mobility and VoIP, but the HD598s are for day-to-day use.So, I believe that these are far better than the Beats Solo2 Wireless, but they simply were not what I was looking for, plus I already had the heavily discounted Beats. If you are in the market for a direct Beats competitor I would definitely give these a look as they do better across genres than the Beats do.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but not what I was looking for. Better than Beats Solo2 Wireless."

    ","When it comes to DESIGN, for a Sennheiser headset, this headset looks amazing. As the name implies, it's meant to give you the vibe of urban hipsters. The inner sides of the headbands are comfy, and the outer rim screams stylish. Another thing that should be noted regarding this headset is that this is wireless. For some people, being wired/wireless is a huge factor, and it was one of mine, too.I found the headset a bit UNCOMFORTABLE to have it on, sadly. It's probably because I wear glasses, but compared to the other headsets I have worn, this thing will heavily squeeze your skull. To some, that is a good thing, since they don't want a loose headset that sways around on the head. Nonetheless, for me, having this on for more than 1 hour is painful.AUDIO QUALITY IS VARIED. Just like the name, this song is meant for some urban-vibe songs, such as EDM, rap, hip hop, and so on. If you are going to listen to heavy metal or classic rock, this will show some sub-par quality. I'm not saying the headset's audio quality is bad, it's just that it does not live up in certain genres. WIRELESS QUALITY IS FINE. Urbanite XL used a APT-X Bluetooth technology, which is pretty much the top runner for audio quality when it comes to Bluetooth.

You just click it on or off.  Click on.  Click off.  You do not need a stop watch to turn it on and off!!!!  It has an old on/off switch.  The kind I long for.  Why do I have to hold a button for 5 seconds to turn it on or off?  That's 5 seconds of my life, over and over and over.  This is better technology?  NO IT IS NOT!!!So first off, thanks for putting a good old on and off switch Sennheiser!  How could you do something so great, so astoundingly brilliant, and then finish it off with the worst controls I have ever seen.  Read my first review.  The other controls are the worst you can buy.  The worst on the market.  Someone was sleeping at Sennheiser when they let this one go to manufacturing.So now that I have that off my chest, again, I also tried the Bose SoundLink around-ear wireless headphones and the B&O PLAY by Bang & Olufsen Over-Ear Beoplay H4 wireless headphones.  I tried no noise cancelling headphones.  I have no noise to cancel.  I tried all three of these though.  What many consider the leading candidates in this category.Terrible controls and everything, for me, Sennheiser is still the winner.  I bought a little Android music clicker to control them so I only use their off and on button.  Everything else, I like the Sennheiser.  I believe it has the best and truest sound.  It is also the most comfortable to wear.  I think it wins every category but the controls, so I bought my own controls.I know I hate the controls and I do, but now I say, buy a music clicker and get the Sennheiser.  I believe it is a truer, better sound than the Bose, but it is close.  The B&O actually get painful to wear after awhile.  They have bad controls too.  5 second hold buttons.  Congrats to Bose though.  The Bose has the best controls of the bunch.  They too have an off and on switch.  I love it.  No more wasting 5 seconds of my life just to turn off a stupid pair of headphones, over and over and over.  The Bose sound okay too.  I just give a small edge to Sennheiser.I am still looking though.  I want an on and off switch.  I want a volume dial.  Remember those?  They worked great and you could tell whether the device was on or off and what the volume was just by looking.  An on/off switch.  A volume dial.  Two buttons for next and previous or even better, a toggle switch for next , previous, fast forward, etc.Speaking of such, since I had to look for an Android music controller I learned there are no good ones.  If someone knows of a good one, let me know.I feel listening to music requires 8 control functions.  Vol+, Vol-, Pause, Next, Previous, Back to Beginning, Fast Forward, Fast Reverse (rewind).  Out of tons of these music controllers available, I have found only one that has these 8 functions.  To me this is amazing.  There are only 8 functions.  We all know them.  How hard can it be?!?!?!  Many have far more than 8 buttons, but they still cannot do the 8 basic functions.  Only one does, but I won't recommend it because to save the battery it turns itself off about every 3-4 seconds.  Then you get to hold down the off/on button for 8.389756659782687657801364 seconds to turn it back on.  While this saves the battery, it makes the device useless.Maybe one of the headphone manufacturers could add such a device.  It would be greatly appreciated.  Please let it have an off and on switch.  Let it do all 8 functions and no more.  Please don't let it turn itself off.  If it wants to be off, let it buy its own controller.First Review:I do not recommend these because they have bad controls.  I feel Sennheiser is being novel just to be novel.  These controls do not work nearly as well as many other tried and tested methods.  Many commented that you will catch on, get used to them.  Why?  Why must I get used to them.  Why not concentrate on sound quality instead?The controls are located on a pressure sensitive surface of one of the cups.  Slide your finger for volume.  Tap for tracks.  Tap once to pause, twice for the next track and so forth.  Much of the time when I tap twice it only reads one tap and pauses.  Then I have to unpause and try again.  I try to turn the volume down and guess what?  It pauses.  It loves to pause.  Very annoying.Why must I get used to this?  Why can't they just have good old controls that work without a training period?  Plus when you tap them, it's like putting your head in a drum (or a cup!), and pounding on it.  It hurts.  My ear drum does not like it.  Put a paper cup over your ear..  Tap on the bottom.  What do you think?I don't know how they sound.  Too annoyed with the controls.  My advice, find another.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bad Controls

89,"on October 5, 2016",,"So far I'm very happy with my new Sennheiser bluetooth headphones. They are lightweight, comfortable and sound great. I was tired of issues with in-ear headphones and spent a lot of time choosing an ""over ear"" style replacement. I'm a fan of Sennheiser so ultimately decided to give the Urbanite a try. Here's my breakdown of pros and cons:Pros:1. Battery life. I have had them now for going on three weeks and haven't had to charge them yet. No, that was not a typo, three weeks! Mind you I don't use them all that much yet, 30 - 60 minutes a day 3 or 4 times a week, but even with non-use, most headphones I've had need to be recharged at least a couple of times a week.2. Comfort. The ear pads on these are really soft and fit comfortably over my ears. Granted, my ears are small but up to largish ears should fit okay in my opinion. The ear pads are so soft though that even if your ears don't completely fit I think the head phones would still be comfortable.3. Attractive: They are nice looking headphones and I like the streamlined look of the size adjustment slide and options.4. Sturdy: They seem very sturdy and well built and like they will last awhile.5. Audio quality: The sounds is rich, loud if desirable, but not too bassy. Just right.Cons:1. For smaller heads like mine, the slider bar to make them fit comfortably is loose so I have to readjust fairly often. Its not that big a deal and is at least very easy to adjust.2. The finger slide controls take some getting used to, and I do inadvertently turn off playback accidentally when doing things like adjusting the fit or brushing my hair aside. But I really like the sleek look of the controls so its a fair trade off.3. Band fit. The top band that goes over the top of your head doesn't seem to stay in place at times, another readjustment issue. Maybe because of my smaller head. The band is pretty wide, and sturdy, so there isn't any ""give"" to it and somehow seems to not rest in place on top of my head. That is probably related to the slider slippage, see con. #1.For the price and many excellent qualities of these headphones, I think that they are a great choice. Just hold on dearly to the earpads. From reading about replacement options, they aren't very good.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super comfortable and lightweight!

    ","While I love the sound quality on these, the earpads are crazy difficult to put back on, and they pop off fairly easily. Prepare for them to pop off roughly once a week. It takes me on average an hour and a lot of contorting of my fingers to get them back on.Hugely frustrating to the point I would say don't buy these, and find ones that aren't so difficult to replace. There are numerous guides showing how to replace the earpads, and all of them are heavily edited to not show how frustrating this process is, or show the presenter going through several trys to get them back on.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Terrific Sound Quality with a fatal flaw

    ","Great set of headphones! Clarity is terrific, bass response is not overpowering, but nicely leveled. Bluetooth works wonderful with my Samsung S6 pairing. I got these used as ""Almost new"", but they were brand new. Every cable was in original sealed plastic packaging and the cans themselves looked not used at all. The pairing process was simplicity itself and I was listening in minutes. The controls are simple once you get used to where on your right ear to manipulate. Volume control works fine with up/down motion, skip to next track with double tap, back to beginning of track with a triple click. Talking on my phone was easy and clear with these, answering with a single tap on incoming call and the built-in mic was sufficient and my caller had no trouble hearing me. This was my first foray into bluetooth headphones for bike-riding and I can't say how pleased I am with this purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Crystal clear, nice bass response.

    ","The Urbanites first got my attention for their looks and videos demonstrating their durability. Just as I was about to buy the regular version, Sennheiser announced the wireless Urbanites with an option to plug in their in mic cable for wired use. I thought perhaps I found a wireless headphone that would be everything I was looking for.Feel: The Urbanite XL’s feel very well built, I thought the only metal pieces were on the hinges but was surprised to find that the entire frame with the sliders are as metal well. The underside of the headband is nice and cushiony and I flattened the headband out as I’ve seen in a lot of videos and just like the regular wired editions they are just as durable. My ears fit right into the cups and the pads barely press on my head. They were so comfortable that I wore them for 6 hours the first day and I did not feel any discomfort like I did with other headphones which is why I used ear buds then in ear monitors (Shure SE 215) for the last couple of years. However, these may or may not fit your ears as they did mine. The inside of the cups measure 1 and 7/8 inches so keep that in mind.Sound: The sound is pretty well balanced in my opinion. The bass is there but it doesn't sound muddy. In searching for a pair of good headphones that lets everything shine, these satisfy what I was looking for. Sound isolation on these headphones is good as well. As these are meant to compete with beats I will say that these blow beats out of the water. I’ve tried those before and I couldn’t say I was pleased with them except for knowing that sound came out of them. The Urbanites have done an all around good job with the music I listen to, from indie, classic rock and metal to most kind of electronic music. I was not disappointed with the sound. Phone call quality is pretty clear on both ends. As for volume these can get loud and do leak out if you fully crank the volume. From what I can tell you can work with two volumes, the Urbanites volume and the devices volume. This applies to both the wireless connection and when using this with the included mic cable.Connection: The Urbanite XL Wireless connects pretty quickly to your device with Bluetooth 4.0. An audible confirmation message is heard when it connects. The battery life shows up on my phone, which I thought was really neat. I haven't had a chance to try out the NFC but would assume it’s quick and easy as well. The range on these headphones is impressive. I left my phone in my room on the second floor of my home and walked all around the house challenging its connection and only started losing signal once I reached the basement but if I found a good spot it would be stable once again. I would probably never be that far from my phone anyway but it’s nice to know how far I can be. You can also be connected to two devices at the same time. This is not to say that two audio sources can be heard at the same time but you can have the Urbanites ready to switch between two sources without having to disconnect from one before connecting to the other. It worked well when switching between my Macbook Pro and my iPhone 6 except for a delay (about 6 seconds) while the device picked up the signal from my macbook. When switching back to my phone the delay was shorter (3 seconds).Controls: The touch controls which are located on the right slider could use some improvements. My biggest complaint with these controls is not having a lock feature or something so that you don't accidentally pause the song. I've gone to scratch my head and accidentally stopped a song by hitting a spot on the touch sensor. I thought the controls would use a left and right swipe to change songs and was disappointed to have to resort to taps as sliding up and down adjusts the volume. I believe that these were said to have left and right swipe capabilities in a video for CES 2015. Recently I’ve found that my music will pause without any explanation and I believe that the touch pad is to blame. When I reconnect the Urbanites a second the problem goes away. My guess is that the touch pad could be sensitive and be going off by itself? I will be contacting Sennheiser about this to see if they can offer me an explanation or solution.Accessories: The Urbanite XL wireless do come with an inline mic cable in case you want to connect it straight to your device if the rechargeable battery dies or if you just want it wired. The case on my phone prevents the cable from being flush against the body (I have an Otterbox Defender case for my iPhone 6) and an adjustable angle cable would have been great, something like the cable that the wired Momentums came with. Included in the packaging is a fairly long micro usb cable for charging the headphones. A hard case isn't entirely necessary but it would have been nice too. I was a bit surprised that they didn’t include one for these seeing as how many original Urbanite owners have been asking for it in their reviews.I am currently trying to get these to work for my xbox one as I have a stereo adapter but despise the headset I bought (Tritton Kunai) when it comes to comfort. I have tried using the flat cable that was included with the packaging but the microphone will not work. If I can find a cable that will let me chat with my friends on XBL the Urbanite XL Wireless will instantly replace those and I believe I’ll never need another headset again. They’re that comfortable!Pros:+ Great balanced sound for many genres of music+ Loud if you want them to be+ Can be really far from the device and signal will not fail+ Comes with mic cable for wired use options+ So comfortable you may not even notice you have them on after hours of use+ DURABLE, Well built!+ Folds for storage+ Battery Life appears on your phone, Convenient!+ Can be connected to two devices, just a short delayCons:- Included cazble could have been better- Hard case would have been nice as many have requested it- Touch controls could be a problem as they are sensitive, needs work",5.0 out of 5 stars,Touch controls need work but otherwise very impressive headset!

    ","Wired performance is fantastic as I and other reviewers will readily tell you. However, Bluetooth wireless mode drives the volume up 40 fold (no joke). The discrepancy between the loudness levels of wired and wireless is so large as to make wireless mode, the same one you pay $70 extra for over the base model, useless. I really wanted these headphones to be good for me because headphone cords are the last ones holding me back from my vision of a wireless lifestyle.From a technical perspective, I have come to the conclusion that because the wireless headphones are dependent on the phone to adjust volume, and the phone is dependent on the wireless headphones to control its audio levels, neither of them can control the volume effectively. This should not be an issue with devices with extremely granular controls such as Windows computers or headphones with manual controls that are uncoupled with the mobile device volume settings (The Urbanites are coupled with device volume). To be clear, the headphones have the ability to go low volume on wireless.Now that said, your mileage may vary, I have sensitive hearing and anything above very low volumes is uncomfortable, you may listen at levels that are deafening to me and find these genuinely faultless. However, a central issue is still that the discrepancy between loudness levels on wired and wireless is so large as to be measured on the scale of 40+ times louder, where the highest volume level on wired is comparable to the lowest volume level on wireless. I would accept it if it was a generic brand headphones with no device orientation, but these are Sennheisers designed to be used with iOS devices, this tuning or lack of thereof is disappointing to me. Will return and get wired model in the future or *shudder* beats that do not seem to suffer from this issue.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality marred by unfortunate Bluetooth experience

I do use a Trond BT Transmitter attached to the headphone jack of the MacBook Pro which supports the AptX codec..  Apple for some reason blew it and didn't put AptX codec support in their products (including the iphone7).  These headphones support Apt-X and couple with the BT AptX transmitter, the sound is great.

    ","Pros:* Good wireless range: I use every day at work, stand up, go to the coffee machine room (next door) without issues.* Very good sound: The first time I used, I found it a bit low on volume, but the quality overall is great.* Very good battery: I can use it for almost a week without any charging. I don't have it on the whole day, but half of it at least.Cons:* It comes with a little cotton-like bag that is pretty much useless. Buy a case if you plan to have them on your backpack.* No original ear pads replacements for sale. You wont find them on Amazon nor on Sennheiser website. If you contact their support, they will redirect you to a toll free number, and ask for them. Good luck with that.One of the reasons I paid that much for them, is because I knew that a brand like Sennheiser should have replacement parts I could buy one year later after my purchase.

I wouldn't be too overly concerned with this, except that 2 year warranty may be meaningless. Sennheiser is a UK based company which makes repairs a pain in the neck. Their website's a mess, and the best direction I've gotten is some weird sound company in Florida. Customer service is an important requisite for any product of this nature.

    ","Quick review. The sound is crystal clear, bass isn't super intense but it is present. I have found myself hearing parts of my music I'd never heard before with Dre beats (highly overrated in my opinion) the battery life is ridiculous on these bad boys, using them a few hours everyday they last me nearly a week. Sennheiser's claim that the battery lasts for about 24 hours of play time is absolutely true. They may not be sound canceling but I can block out anything shy of gunshots and landing airplanes with the volume set to low. Another great feature is that you can run these with an aux cord that is included with the headphones or a USB cable plugged into your computer or other device without using any power. You can plug them in if the battery dies and keep listening. The touch controls on the side of the ear cups are a little weird at first and have a mild amount of lag but in no time at all you'll find yourself trying to tap your earbuds or another set of headphones wondering why nobody else has done this yet. Oh, I almost forgot, these things are very well built the stainless steel frame and trim is tough as nails. The wiring is tucked away in-between the headphones and your noggin so they won't catch on anything.  The portion that rests on your head is padded and very comfortable. These are great for six hour flight where you want to comfortably block out some lady's  screaming children, or that one guy at the gym who feels the need to grunt like a wounded boar while he finishes his last set. All in all I would buy these again, they have served me faithfully the past few months.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones, excellent craftmanship."

    ","I have owned these headphones for over six months. I was hoping that perhaps I just needed to get used to them but no. These are truly horrible, especially for their price point.I loose connection constantly, and if I don't loose connection I get constant and continuous drop off even if I'm right next to the bluetooth device I have connected it to.

    ",I've been trying other Bluetooth headphones and not finding quite what I wanted so I decided to splurge for these. Based on reviews it sounded like they had great Sennheiser sound but with tasteful bass emphasis. And a few people said the controls could be tricky. But they're light and comfortable and beautiful and again -- sound with lots of detail etc. I was excited.So when I received them today I was really disappointed to hear a muddy mess. Very little separation and the bass is clunky. Did I get Dusa? I dunno. I'm no expert audiophile but I can tell when my $50 earbuds sound better than $250 cans.The kicker was that it redialed a number I had called yesterday just from barely touching them. And taking them off accidentally causes music to start or stop. So they placed this touch control precisely where your hand is going to touch the device when you remove or adjust them??I've about given up on this. Maybe I'll just get some Bluetooth earbuds.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed

    ","I am a fan of Sennheiser products.  I like over the ear headphones, vs on the ear style.  I am not usually a fan of active noise cancelling, which these don't have (yeah!).  These seal nice and tight doing a reasonable job blocking out the various noises reasonably well.  I like the range on Bluetooth of these guys.  I was able to go quite a distance away and still hear them.  I wanted to test the microphone for voice calling, but I only got a chance to have a moment on the phone and the other person couldn't hear me.  This could be a configuration issue though as I didn't mess with it.The bottom line though is I had to return them.  I loved everything about them except the pain my ears go through wearing them.  The outer edge of my left ear hurt for more than 8 hours after using them for 90 minutes.  It was wedged against the speaker grill inside.  I tried everything to get them comfortable, they are just to small for me.  I have Sennheiser HD280, and have used 580 and 600 with no issue at all.  These aren't those in the space front.  I wish they were, I would have kept them and loved them.  The other product that has the features I am looking for from Sennheiser is the Momentum 2 wireless, which are around double the price of these.  I could of bought them, and almost did, but without the ability to disable active noise cancelling they weren't perfect and for that money they better be.Spent a quarter of the money on an open box pair of Sony MDR-ZX770DC or MDR-ZX770.  My ears fit great while the cans are less bulky, and the noise cancelling is optional vs non existent.  Go read the reviews of those if you think you want these and have even average ears in the US.Happy hunting!",2.0 out of 5 stars,I like over the ear headphones

    ","This review is for Sennheiser Urbanite XL Wireless headphones.UX/Ease of use: At first glance, this looks like a premium headphone, Nice stitched headband, duo tone color scheme, matte metal emblem on the sides, even the included remote cable looks great. Upon closer inspection, the first impression continues. The inner left side is marked with three protruding dots, thats Braille for ""L"". In case someone with vision difficulties were using it or you were putting on the headphone in near dark situations. The Power button is spring slide type. It has a hard stop at ""Off"" position and a springed stop for bluetooth discovery mode. Much nicer than other headphones where you have to hold the power button for a few seconds to turn on discovery. A female voices announces connection or the lack of rather unobtrusively. Reminding me of the early BMW navigation systems. Still, I think, a voice prompt is best left behind. But for some of us, who cannot see a blinking led light for various reasons, a voice prompt maybe god send. I just wish there was a way to switch it off.Speaking of connectivity, this headphone can remember 8 devices. I tried it with 6 and it remembered them all without issue.The ear cups are plush the velour feels premium and comfortable, only a soft fleece blanket type material will be more comfortable, but I haven't seen any headphone brand come up with those yet. I wear an XL sized helmet so I like to think I have a larger than average head, the band expanded and the cups fit just as they should regardless of that. The headphone cups have an inner ball type rotation mechanism that fits the headphones snugly on you regardless of the size of your head. Very cool. The bottom part where the cups are situated are metal in a matte finish, and seem very durable. Once I put those on, I realized my first problem. My ears were just a bit bigger than the cup so parts of it stuck out of the cup. It felt strange and at times uncomfortable. How nice it would be if Sennheiser included a a few different interchangeable pads with various widths of padding so most ear sized would fit in fine ? My wife, who isnt cursed with such elvish ears, didnt have any problems with this.Once I put this on and paired it, I noticed how nicely it cuts off the outside world. I am sensitive to active noise cancellation and most passive noise cancellation reminds me of my days in the range with near silence and tight fitting headache inducing noise guards. These are a nice compromise between the two extremes. I put the headphone down to talk to my wife and then put it back on. Suddenly the music was gone and there was a male voice saying hello. It took a few seconds for me to realize I had called my dad, in the middle of the night. Yeah the touch plate on the side is finicky. You might make an unwanted call sometime. My dad, also a headphone addict, was actually quite amused, and he noted twice how clear my voice was during the call.The head band has a thin layer of padding at the bottom, it works but is nowhere near as comfortable as the padding you will find in Sennheiser's other models. With an extra large head like mine, it started to become painfully uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing. YMMV !I would have much preferred these to have a thicker padding and yes that would have made these headphones probably a bit bigger. But a bigger band would also be easier to carry around on your neck. You can carry this around your neck but the large cups and the small headband make this a bit challenging. Especially if you are wearing a thick jacket. Comparing this to the Sony MDR-10RBT, the sony feels much more comfortable and easier to carry. The Sennheiser does fold, but its still a big headphone when folded.So over all, an elegant subdued stylish set that to me, seems will last longer than the bluetooth standard itself. I didnt care for the touch panel controls, however I have an RS 180 wireless headset with actual buttons and those arent much easier to use either. So this issue will probably resolve itself with practice. My main problem so far is the size, it seems the band could have been a bit bigger and the velour padding should have been a bit less wide or had came with interchangeable pads.Sound Quality: Before I get into this, I would like to briefly explain my current set up so we know what I am comparing this set with.My main system is a 5.2 set up consisting of 4 Tannoy Revolution XT6F floor standing speakers, Tannoy - Revolution XTC center speaker and dual HSU VTF-15H subwoofers.My main headphone is Sennheiser HD 600 but I also have a Sennheiser HDR 180 that I use at work on a daily basis. I also at times use my wifes Sony bluetooth headphones.I will be comparing this set to the above set ups.First impressions on sound quality: Almost 25 years ago, my dad bought me my first sennheiser headphone to pair with my Aiwa Cassette player. I remember been up all night that listening to my favorite tracks because I was hearing things I had never heard before. Years later I had a similar experience with my Sennheiser HD600 and now these Urbanites reminded me of those experiences. No its not in the same league as the HD 600. But I have heard songs through my wifes Sony and then through this and I was amazed by the difference.These have a nicer stereo separation a wide soundstage and the tone is luscious and lively. Yes these have a v-shaped equalization applied to them. But the bass didnt sound exaggerated, it sounded punchy, with a just hint more loudness than say the HD 600. Comparatively, the Sony sounds like you are sitting next to a sub woofer. These have what I like to think, ""Sennheiser sound signature"" but more tailored to the tastes of a younger bass loving generation. I have a live recording of a concert in a church in England by a local band. Before the band starts playing, the drummer was calibrating his drum and while doing so he hits the drum once swiftly with his stick. The sound is like a loud thwack that reverbated back through the church. I have heard few speakers that can convey that immediacy and reverberation and decay of that sound as it reverberated along the walls of the church. My main speakers do a fair job, the HSU's definitely convey the feeling. The HD 600's definitely convey the sound but not the same feeling. The urbanite sounded like a fair compromise, it had no issues conveying the immediacy and the presentation of the bass note, but struggled to convey the subtler decay as the reverberation faded away.Listening to Norah Jones, I feel the v-shaped equalization hurts the music a little. Norah Jones still sounds like Norah Jones but not as intimately so as she would on the Sennheiser HD 600 and definitely nothing like a Grado RS2.Listening to Hayley Westenra ""Winter Magic"", the headphones do a splendid job of conveying the orchestra, they had the wide soundstage of my main system, and showed off the intricate details much like the Sennheiser HD 600. The built in equalization didnt hurt the sound much. Awesome.I played something more main stream, ""Hold on, were going home"" by Drake, this track has multiple drum and base lines and is quite bass heavy. The bass sounded powerful but not boomy and it never over powered Drake's voice. Quite an achievement considering Drake's voice is quite low and mellow in this track. Comparing this to the HDR 180, you immediately notice the presentation is just a bit cleaner through the HDR 180 but the bass almost sounds lose and woolly. The treble is clearer through the Urbanites, but its also a bit more grating compared to the HDR 180. The open back nature of the HDR 180 creates a much larger and nicer soundstage than the Urbanites but the stereo separation in the Urbanites is better.This is when I noticed my first real big issue with the Urbanite. The range, is abysmal even moving my head left and right sometimess causes the music to fade or distort. I am only about 3 feet away from the transmitter. I realize bluetooth performance is also a factor of the transmitter, so I tried a different dongle. A highly rated azio dongle instead of the soundbot I was previously using. Same issue, I love the sound but I cannot really enjoy it. Comparatively, I can take my HDR 180 out to the backyard and sit at the patio with uninterrupted music. Even my daughter's $25 Kinivo headphone works fine with transmitter indoors and her sitting in the Patio, but not this guy. My main purpose for buying this headphone is to replace my HDR 180 in my office as it leaks too much sound. I will not be moving around a lot with these headphones on and I will be within 3 feet of the transmitter. The Sony and the Kinivo has issue with this range, but the Sennheiser drops out intermittently.I am at a loss for words, this is unacceptable at this price.Closing thoughts: I really love the sound of these phones. They sound similar to my main floor standing loudspeakers but with a more forward presentation and just a bit harsher. Still they sound great. Whatever DSP Sennheiser has chosen with these phones, works well. It does enhance the bass, but it doesnt take away the music in the process. I have heard other bass heavy speakers including the famous brand that forced Sennheiser to come up with this model, those phones all sound dull and muddy compared to these phones. These are not neutral or audiophile but sound great nevertheless. However, in the end, I am not able to keep it simply because of its abysmal range and lack of comfort for longer listening sessions. The HDR 180 runs circles around this on the above two points. Yes these headphones don't annoy your neighbors with sound bleed like the HDR 180, but whats the point in having a headphone if it just cuts off with sharp whizzy noises in the middle of your listening session ? I can live with the discomfort but I cannot live with the cut off. I am still thinking this may be a defective unit, and I have to admit I have a larger head an elven ears, so I am cutting off only one star. If Sennheiser could fix my main two gripes, this would be a 5 star product. Till then, I am back to annoying folks with my HDR 180.Update: 12/10...I purchased another unit to give the bluetooth range another shot. The range still isnt anything to write home about but it doesnt drop off every few minutes at a 3 feet distance. I guess my original unit had issues. I am updating this review to 5 Stars.If you are using this on a windows pc and the sound is muffled or sounds like a speakerphone, make sure your Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) is enabled. Also, while Windows 8.1 onwards, the OS supports this natively, your dongle or motherboard may not.",5.0 out of 5 stars,So close to perfection... But there is room for improvement...

    ","I purchased these recently because I'd owned a pair of cheaper Sony headphones for about 10 years and thought I'd treat myself to some really nice ones... and wireless to boot!  Should have been an awesome experience but it was only so-so.SOUND - My primary listening interests are audio books, classical music, folk music, House / techno music (stuff with some punchy bass lines).  While audio books don't require a lot from headphones I did think that the voice acting sounded great with these headphones!  Very crisp and clear.  The same goes for the classical and folk music which sounded clear and beautiful as well.  I also like to have my own dance parties in my office and this is where the headphones fell short.  The bass tended to be flat, fuzzy, and distorted at loud volumes.  It just didn't sound good to me and although I tried them for about 2 weeks, I just couldn't justify keeping them for the price.  These are marketed to bass lovers and I really didn't hear anything worth falling in love with.COMFORT /  BUILD - Out of the box these headphones feel rich!  They are heavy and well built and I think they look pretty cool which was part of the reason I bought them.  With regards to comfort, my initial impressions were favorable.  The head band has a nice softness to it and the ear pieces are filled with memory foam and have a nice soft texture.  However, each time I put them on I had to work to find a comfortable position for my ears. These are over-ear headphones so I wanted to get my ears tucked in the phones but over time my ears would ache from the pressure.  I am an artist so I will listen while working for a few hours at a time.  One day I had to switch to external speakers because I had a headache that I attributed to the headphones (also the day I decided to return them).  When I felt the need to jam a bit to some fun tunes I found that it was difficult to dance around (yeah... it feels good ;).  The headphones were heavy enough that they put pressure on my ears, the slides loosened up and they tended to slide off my head.  I don't think these were designed for someone on the move.CONNECTIVITY - I tried these with my ipad2 as well as with my 3.2 ghz quad core Mac Pro.  The iPad connected quickly and easily each time.  My mac took a little more convincing.  I wasn't quite sure why but it always took several attempts to connect to the headphones by using the bluetooth dropdown menu and selecting connect.  I often have the same problem with my wireless keyboard so perhaps it is just a mac problem or something with my computer.  Once they were connected they worked great but there was always that 1-2 minutes of waiting for them to connect (frustration).CONCLUSION - Finally, I did return these primarily because of the comfort issues.  I think I could have lived with the bass and connectivity issues along with those combined with achy ears were a deal-breaker.  I am currently waiting on a pair of Sony MDR1RBT headphones so we'll see how they go.  I decided to go to Best buy this time and try a few on so I had a better idea of what I liked and what I didn't like.  I should have done that in the first place :).  Feel free to ask questions. Thanks!",3.0 out of 5 stars,They look awesome but were not my favorite...

    ","These headphones are great when they want to be. The sound is awesome. The bass is impactful but you can still hear the full range of sound. It's like if beats studio headphones went to school and got a ph.d... But still went to the club on Saturday night.  I dunno if that analogy makes sense. Having no wires is something that I can never go away from again. The Achilles' heel to these great sounding headphones is the touch control. They have a mind of their own half of the time. I find myself resetting the headphones too often whether it's because the touch controls are unresponsive or if they start stopping and starting music on its own. I thought it was one defective set until my replacement did the exact same thing. It doesn't seem like the touch controls were ready for prime time yet. Regular buttons like the wireless momentum headphones would make it a masterpiece. The touch panel makes it too much of a hassle to deal with.

    ","I have been searching for a set of nice cans that has style.  Typically with Sennheisers, you get excellent audio quality, but not a lot in the way of style.  These Sennheisers sound very good, but I found that the cups were a bit small for my ears (I would think that I have medium size ears - my Bose QC25 fit perfectly, and they're in a smaller package than these), and the felt covered cups really made my ears get hot.  I would have much rather preferred to get traditional comfy leatherette pads, and had something different done with the band.I know that the band is supposed to be a style thing, but they were pretty heavy, and if you aren't really careful, you can pinch your fingers, or skin etc., really really easy in the hinge.  It hurts bad - watch out for your skin when opening.  If you're looking for pure style, and good audio quality, I think these sound better than Beats, but could improve in fit, and quality.Battery life seemed good.  I didn't notice much audio quality difference than the wired version.I hated the touch panel controls.  They were very easy to accidentally touch while moving your hand around, and I found a lot of times that the touch panel wouldn't recognize when I was pausing or playing music, or when I'd try to do phone calls.

    ","1.  I definitely don't claim to be an audiophile, but for background I do love / know music well, I currently own the Sennheiser 210BT (old bluetooth headphones), some other low end bluetooth headphones,  several wired Sennheiser headphones including the Moment.  The following are my impressions of Urbanite Bluetooth:  A:  Size:  man it's huge... and heavy.  I can kind of handle the huge, but the heavy is a problem... because the thing is on your head.  Furthermore, most folks who get a bluetooth headphone will plan to be somewhat more mobile and thus I can't see anyone utilizing these headphones for any length of time outside / walking around etc...  On the otherhand, if you're going to use them in an office / sitting down etc... then it might work out for you.  B:  The controls:  absolutely terrible.  Somewhere along the road, Sennheiser decided to weight form over function on these headphones and for some folks, the looks will trump function but not for me, especially with a bluetooth headphone.  One of the reasons to get bluetooth is so that you don't have to fiddle with your mobile device.  With this headphone and it’s really lousy controls, you will be reaching for your device to switch between songs etc…  The volume control is no problem (slide finger up / down the touchpad), pausing the headphones;  easy (just tap once), but switching between songs is seriously problematic.  Yes, you can switch between songs, but will you be able to consistently switch correctly?  That’s a different story.  And as others have said, it’s easy to mistakenly touch the touchpad and mess things up.  I could kind of live with the huge cans and weight, but the terrible controls was the deal breaker.  C:  Sound:  nice… kind of bass heavy, but nice / clear / clean;  I’m sure by adjusting the EQ on the mobile device, on can get the sound they like.  But the sound is great.2.  In the end, I wanted to keep these headphones, but because the size / weight factor and more importantly the terrible controls, I had to send them back.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Form over Function

    ","Sennheiser Urbanite XL Wireless, BlackThese headphones are beautiful and the sounds great, albeit maybe a little under-powered.  But, the sound quality isn't their downfall.  It's the fact that while being ""over-the-ear"" the cups are relatively small.  They should've been called ""over most of the ear"".  I specifically didn't purchase the non-XL Urbanites because I despise on-the-ear headphones, so I thought that these would be great; however, I was sadly disappointed.  When you take the small cups and factor in the stiffness of the pads (not that they're stiff pads, but they're not soft as clouds), it creates discomfort after a decent listening sessions.  That said, the product is going back as a result.If I had smaller ears, I'd hold onto these and they'd be a solid 4-4.5 stars (deductions would be the result of my perceiving the headphones as slightly underpowered).",3.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to love these. . .

I hadn't seen much about this but did read one review that said that airplane engine noise is almost amplified with these headphones on.  I can definitely agree with this statement.  If you are buying these to use on a plane and sit at or behind the engines, these headphones do amplify the jet noise.  Why?  I don't know.  But it is annoying and takes away one star.  Wish these had noise cancellation.  Otherwise, I am happy with them for casual listening.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Generally happy but not for use on airplanes.

The cushion is a little small, so it may fold your ear if you try to fit it around your ears, which contributes to the ear fatigue.

    ","Update:The earpads fall off easily.  My son lost one of them.  Sennheiser has a SKU on their website for a replacement set of pads, but they don't sell them and NO ONE has them in stock.Someone on Amazon sells a replacement pair of pads, but they aren't OEM.  They have the following differences:1. They fit OVER the plastic earpiece, instead of in a tiny little slot.  This makes them hold on a lot better, but they are hard to put on.  But,2. They are made of different rubber material and they profoundly alter the sound!  If they make good air seal around your head, they have good bass.  But as soon as the air seal is broken, there is NO bass.  Especially hard to use if you were glasses (the arm of the glasses breaks the air tight seal).  (I'm talking about the replacement ear pads, not the originals).So, my new conclusion is these are good headphones if you take care of your stuff.  If you are rough with your stuff, the ear pads will come off, and if you lose one or it gets damaged, Sennheiser doesn't make it easy to replace.  And the ear pads are responsible for the great audio.All this is sad because Sennheiser has a product SKU for the replacement pads, they are just out of stock everywhere including on Sennheisers' own online store.I have a ridiculous number of headphones.  And most are Sennheiser.  These are among my favorites.  So here's a quick rundown of the features and how they diff from other Sennheisers.  I'm leaving the 4 star review.My original review:1. These are NOT open.  They look like HD555, 558, 598.  But they aren't.  They block outside sound.2. Some Bluetooth headphones have internal volume mechanism.  These don't.  The volume on the headphones adjusts the iPhone volume.3. I have them set at the lowest volume.  So they get crazy loud.  That's one reason not 5 star.  It's hard to get them low enough to hear your workmates.4. The touch controls are another reason for minus 1 star.  They are way to easy to hit accidentally.  Just moving the cups, readjusting, swatting a fly, almost any hand motion on that side risks touching the sensor and pausing, playing, adjusting volume.  Not a deal you say?  How about this?  swatting a fly and your phone redials your boss.  at 11pm.  Not funny.  So I wish there was a way to actually TURN OFF the touch sensor so you have to use your phone to play/pause and adjust volume.  So far I haven't found a way.  I can see the touch sensor being a deal breaker for some people.  In fact, I bought mine used on an auction site.  I assume that's why they were returned.  Because otherwise, they sound great.5.  I have HD518 and HD555 wired.  The 518 are bass-heavy and lack treble.  The 555 are real crisp and have great treble.  These Urbanites seem to have BOTH.  So I think that's a huge advantage of the Urbanite.  You get both worlds.6.  At home I use two pair of RS180 wireless, which use their own proprietary transmitter.  I still prefer them for wireless listening as they are open, however you need the transmitter for them.  For bluetooth, these are the way to go.  However, if Mr. Sennheiser would ask me my opinion, I'd prefer open style.  But I notice it's very rare to find open bluetooth cans.  Most of the good ones are closed and block outside sound.I bought mine used.  I'm not sure I'd be happy to pay full price considering the goofy touch interface.  But for the price I paid, I'm keeping them and these are the ones I use at work all the time now.  No more wired HD518 at work.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive but great bluetooth sound

    ","Pros:- Most versatile headphones I have ever owned. When at home or work I have it connected to my phone through bluetooth and to my PC through USB and it will play from either source depending on priority while charging.- 24 hour battery rating is no myth, it really lasts that long.- Aptx and bluetooth 4.0 provide excellent sound quality. Clarity is excellent, bass is punchy, soundstage is fantastic. Treble maybe too recessed for some people, but for me it's a good tradeoff for less fatigue and ear strain.- Ear cups are comfortable and REMOVABLE. It makes maintenance of the headphone so much easier and you can replace them with 3rd party accessories.- Headband is very sturdy with enough give to expand to any head size without clamping down too hard on you like a viceCons:- The headband is made of plastic with little to no padding on it. I had to buy paddings from geekriahttp://www.amazon.com/Headphone-Sennheiser-Audio-Technica-Replacement-Protector/dp/B00OF71WWO/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1427941331&sr=8-6&keywords=headphone+padding- Portability is minimal. The ear cups fold into place and that's it. Be careful of the edges of the headband since they have a metal finishing that might injure you. I can't tell you how many times I hurt myself while unfolding the headphones and its a hard lesson learned- It only comes in black and white. I'm actually considering painting mine just to customize it since I love it so much.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer. Well played Sennheiser.
232,"on March 17, 2015",,"Bought these from Crutchfield. I love these headphones, and yet I'll be returning them. Briefly: the sound is fantastic. Warm and balanced. I own the over-ear Momentums too and I would say that, while it is true that the bass might be just a tiny bit overemphasised on the Urbanites, the difference is truly quite minor. Also, they seem to 'settle' or 'break in' nicely after a few hours of listening. They are incredibly comfortable and sturdy (but the lack of hard case is a disgrace). Comfier even than the Momentums. Bluetooth is done right: I used to have a pair of Sonys BT that required awkward long-presses and prayers to connect to your iPhone. On the Urbanites, you just flick the switch, and it says ""connected!"" in a pleasant British accent. Perfect. No other buttons to press. Volume and play/pause is on the touch-sensitive part of the ear cup. I had read somewhere that people found those gestures hard to figure, but I am absolutely in love with them. Some people are always going to find something hard to figure... In short, I only have positive things to say about these headphones. But there is a sad but. Their style, with the thick band extending over the earcups, means they look extremely ""wide"" when on, if that makes sense. They literally make my head way wider than it is tall. Now, this is of course extremely subjective, but in my case, the problem is enough to rule out ever wearing them in public. Of course, for a $300 BT headphone, that is a dealbreaker. But I will be very sad to let them go.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones if they look right on your head.

    ","These headphones have a lot of potential but definitely fall short in many ways. I've been using them for about a year now and the sound is decent, not amazing but good enough.Some of the real problems stem from features that were clearly not thought out as well as they needed to be.the touch panel on the side is beyond irratating, any little brush bump or adjustment sets it off causing it to pause/play music or even worse, hang up current calls.I've contacted Sennheiser about this and their reply was a blunt, 'thats how it works'.the other problem is the way it tries to let you connect to multiple devices. it just plain doesn't work well. you spend a lot of time telling devices you want to connect to connect over and over again. if you just leave it connected to one thing like a phone or computer it works fine and you never have to manually connect it.the other big problem in my mind is the way it handles the battery power. theres not any sort of stand by mode or way for the headphones to recognize they aren't being used. All I really want here is the ability to take my headphones off and have the headphones either turn off or go into standby when there is no sound being transmitted to them.In summary I would 4 or 5 star these headphones with the following- get rid of the touch panel- add a standby mode- you can keep the dual bluetooth but I would just as soon remove it to reduce cost.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser can't provide solid features
234,"on August 15, 2016",,"These Headphones are the all in one package I was looking for. While the earpads could be larger they are ok for that, but the sound sure has that Sennheiser signature and clarity, with a bit of added low end to all.Also something I have never seen anyone mention is that the hehadphones offer USB audio!! connecting them to Windows or OSX will install the USB audio drivers and they sound good wireless, wiered 3.5 jack and USB.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are Bluetooth, 3.5 Jack and USB AUDIO (Yes USB audio)!!!!!!!"
235,"on March 2, 2017",,I bought these and the AKG 845 BT because I could not decide. The AKG's connect quickly and easily to any new source. They sound great and just work. There is no fuss and no muss with the AKG. They just work and work well. The Sennheiser Urbanite XL is too sensitive to touch. It changes sources and then you  are fumbling with your ears trying to get back the sound to what you want. The Sennheiser Urbanite XL's take way to long to connect to a source compared to the AKG's. If you want a good pair of Blue tooth headphones in this price clase buy the AKG'sThe Sennheiser Urbanites do sound and look good. These can be used with a phone. Something I do not do.,3.0 out of 5 stars,The AKG's connect quickly and easily to any new source

    ","I have had these ""cans"" for 1.5 years now and still love them.  Battery life is amazing, I listen to them at high volume for 2 hrs a night and don't have to recharge them for weeks.  I find the touch pad very easy to use and they link to my phone as soon as I turn them on. The phone works awesome thru these and no one has ever said it doesn't sound good.  No one can ever tell i'm talking to them through headphones at all.  The only problem I have had is when they are paired to my computer and my phone at the same time the phone doesn't sound very good in a call.  Very minor.  Very happy with the Sennheiser Urbanite XL.",5.0 out of 5 stars,5 years now and still love them. Battery life is amazing

    ","I've owned this headset for a few days now, and my opinion on the headset has changed overtime. I will be comparing it to the other headsets that I own (I know these are not specifically for music): Razer Megaladon, Sennheiser G4ME Zero, and Sony Gold Wireless Headset.Out of the box:In the box, you will get the headsets (obviously), a flat noodle like cable to connect your headset to your phone if you so choose, and a little baggy. Scarce accessories in the box, but not a huge con.Design/Comfort:I pulled the headset out of the box and unfolded it. The first thing that happened was the clamp pinching the skin between my forefinger and my thumb. Let me say this: It hurt. It's a metal clamp, so it is solid in design. But, I recommend you make sure you unfold the headset from the ear cuffs, and not like an idiot like myself. If Sennheiser put some sort of stretchable band over the metal hinge or rubber in the inside of the hinge, it would prevent idiots like myself from pinching my skin each time I unfold it.Next, I noticed the the ear cans themself are really small. At first I thought I somehow got the ""on-ear"" versions (even though they don't exist). But, I guess I have big ears because the ear cans don't fully cover my ears. The plush part sits on top of my ear in some places. Furthermore, the cans are not that deep either. Again, if you have big ears, they will touch the inside of the can.In comparison, I had the same issue with the Razer Megalodon. And,  I had to spend 2 weeks making my ears get used to that pain and pressure. But, after I broke them in, they felt wonderful. The Sennheiser G4ME Zero headset, on the other hand, are absolutely wonderful. So comfortable. So big. So perfect. The fully encompass my ears. The leather with memory foam inside are so soft. And, the cans are so deep that my ears don't touch the inside. I really wish that Sennheiser designed their Urbanites more like the Zero. Would have been so much better.As for the quality in design, I don't see how  I could break these. Super solid build. Band stretches and contorts without any creaking. The cans feel solid. The plush ear cuffs are hard at first, but I know they will soften over time. First time wearing these things,  I was super disappointed. It hurt and felt so rigid and small. After a few days, my ears are starting to get used to the feeling and the plush is already starting to soften up. I'm sure they will feel better over time.Furthermore, these things are really bulky. First time seeing myself in the mirror with these things on, I looked like a cyborg.Features:The touch sensitive control panel on the right ear can is super cool. I've never come across something like that before. So, (like an idiot) I kept touching the control panel. Accidentally pausing or playing songs whenever putting the headset on or off. Or even making phone calls. Yes, this thing can redial the last call you've made. You can play, pause, change volume, move tracks, fast-forward/rewind, answer calls, reject calls, redial, and manage conference calls all from the control panel. Super cool.The wire that is included is a huge plus. Gives you the opportunity to switch back and forth if you need to. Since, this thing has Bluetooth 4.0 and aptX , you can listen to very high quality music wirelessly. However, let's say your phone only has Bluetooth 4.0 and NOT aptX, then your Urbanite will NOT produce aptX quality sound. It will be limited to the Bluetooth 4.0 on your phone. Therefore, if you're listening to higher quality music than the Bluetooth 4.0 can transmit, then you're missing out. The cable will then allow you to listen to higher quality music without the bandwidth limitation of the Bluetooth.I haven't touched the baggy since I got it out of the box.Sound:I charged the headset for awhile before testing them out (I recommend you let it charge for a few hours first). My first impression was the same as my impression with the comfort: disappointment. The drivers seemed to be really rigid and tight. The treble trailed off really quickly. The mids seem veiled (kinda like they were in the background). The bass was harsh and rigid. It almost sounded like it was coming from dual 15"" subwoofers inside the trunk of a 40 year old car. More rattling then pounding bass. The first thing I thought was: Sennheiser...why???I put all the EQ's in my phone to flat. I then listened to some rock/heavy metal. It was good. Not great. The bassline was almost non existent. The mids were a bit soft. The treble was clear in the parts it didn't trail off. So, I then put a mix playlist on my phone including: rock, heavy metal, techno, house, DnB, orchestral dubstep, and trap. Then, I set the headset aside for four hours.After that, I plugged in my Urbanites into the Creative Soundblaster Omni 5.1 Surround Sound external soundcard attached to my computer. I listened to music from there, and it sounded good. Much better than initially.Then, I hooked up my Urbanites to my phone, and started to mess with the EQ as I switched between songs. Overtime, the Urbanites started to sound better and better. On the EQ in my phone, all I did was add ""soft bass"" and then amplified the bass just a tad bit while leaving everything else flat. (I recommend listening to Arkasia - Gate 74. It has the mids and highs of the parts containing classical style music, but since it is still ""electronic music"" you will get good source of bass, too. Great song to use to adjust your EQ to your liking. Your ears will thank you.)Now, they sound really good. Still not amazing, though. My $200 Sennheiser G4ME Zero headset sounds so much better than my Urbanites. The bass is richer and the music sounds deeper and more natural. And, I believe that is mostly due to the fact that the Zero's actually engulf my ears entirely.Pros:-Can get loud-Good clarity in mids and highs after a burn in period-Bass is not overwhelming, so mids don't suffer-After some EQ tweaking, the bass will sound powerful and clear-Solid design and build-Gets more comfortable the longer you wear them-Detachable cable-Touch featuresCons:-Price (don't think these are worth $300 since my $200 Zero's sound infinitely better...and they are meant for gaming more than music)-Bulky-Scarce accessories-Requires time and patience with burn in and EQ adjustment to ensure proper frequency response in the bass-While audio is clear, it is still outperformed by cheaper headset-Not the best for those with bigger earsSennheiser could have done so much more with this headset especially at the asking price. It leaves me wanting more. Really wish the ear cuffs had bigger replacements out there.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Mixed Feelings. Really want to love this, though."

Also they sound  somewhat on the muffled side like you're underwater. I had several of my coworkers take a listen & they said things like ""where's the bass & are these the loudest they go?"" I also feel the bass is a little bit lacking as well. I've been trying 8 hour long headphone burn in clips on You Tube  to see if these would liven up a little bit more but it doesn't seem like it's having much of an effect. It looks like I'll be going back to my Sony MDR-XB950BT's which can get much louder & have more bass.EDIT; March 1st 2016.

    ","These headphones are literally garbage unless you want to exclusively listen through Bluetooth, these are not made for desktops, gaming, or movies. I got these as a Christmas gift and I plan on asking for a return. I don't use Bluetooth for anything, they are worthless to me. I tried listening to Netflix and spotify through my desktop and the levels and audio are so over the place it gave me a headache just attempting to test them out. The music, ambient noise and voices in shows and movies are not balanced, certain sounds will be louder or quieter than others, forcing you to adjust the volume or levels constantly. These are made for listening through wireless speakers or your smart phone, they are not made at all for everyday use in an office or home environment with the included auxiliary cord. Go buy Audio Technicas for half the price, or Sennheiser 558's if you want something decent for multiple uses at home.",1.0 out of 5 stars,terrible quality for anything other than Wireless listening
