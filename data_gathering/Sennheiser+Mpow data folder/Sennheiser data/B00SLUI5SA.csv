    ","First let me say that I suffer a serious hearing loss which makes it difficult to watch television with my wife because I have to have the volume up so loud and even then I can't hear everything.  I have had two sets of sennheiser RS 120's for a few years now and loved them.  My wife wanted to get me these for Christmas this year because they were apparently capable of surround sound. Now I'm not an audiophile but I will try to point out some pro's and con's here.The 175's are an over the ear fit as opposed to the 120's being an on the ear fit.  The 175's fit much tighter which is very nice when up and moving about yet the tight fit makes it difficult to hear when my wife is speaking to me during a show which she does quite often.  I'll let you decide if that's is a pro or a con.  The 120's were loose enough that I could hear her speak even though I still had to remove the headset to understand her.  The looseness had a downside though in that if I went to the fridge for a drink or snack and bent down the headset fell off.  Not so with the 175's.  Both sets have excellent sound reproduction even though the 120's are analog.  The 175's can be digital or analog which can be decided by a switch on the back of the transmitter.  You have the option of connecting to the sound source by optical cable or 3.5 jack which in my case required a y adapter converting to RCA jacks.  I was amazed to find that there is a very noticeable difference between digital and analog, digital being the best by far.  With the digital you don't hear any static or interference noises in non-dialog or silent spots.  At least I couldn't hear any and my wife said in her words ""this is fantastic"".sound with the 175's:You can switch between regular stereo, low SRS, and High SRS by clicking a button on the side of the headset.  This can also be controlled at the transmitter.  There is a very noticeable difference between each setting.  I have noticed that on low SRS the background recordings seem to be moved back and reduced in volume while the main dialog remains at regular volume.  Ever had one of those instances where the main character is talking in a whisper voice, which seems to be in vogue these days, and is suddenly overrun by the background noise, which also seems to be a problem these days.  Well, low SRS helps to overcome that problem for me.  I can hear the dialog very clearly and if you've lived for a while having to constantly asked ""what did he/she say?""  then you can really appreciate that fact.In High SRS there is a distinct surround sound quality.  I've never been able to experience this before due to my hearing loss so to me it is awesome.  I love Paul Simons music, especially ""Graceland"", ""father and daughter"" and ""late in the evening"".  I just thought I liked them before but after listening to them through the 175's I have heard notes and instruments that I didn't realize were there. Now I love the songs.  Having discovered that I went back and watched a couple of my favorite movies and discovered background sounds that I had been missing and they add so much more to the entertainment value.  Keep in mind that I have experienced all this with the 120's also and there is a large difference.continued pros sound aside:I like that the controls are on the side of the 175 headset because I often recline when watching television and this keeps the controls from contacting anything and changing the settings unintentionally.This was a problem with the 120 sets because the controls were behind the headset.The 175 set, to me, is much more comfortable because of the padding and because possibly of the tighter fit which keeps them in place verses the loose fit of the 120 set.cons (maybe):The 175 set is only capable of employing two headsets.The 120 can employ several at one time.  I'm not sure how many but certainly more than four because I have that many headsets.The 120 has an option of three channels selectable on the transmitter and the headset which means you can use more than one in a household without interfering with each other.  This is the situation at my house.  I have one set in the bedroom and one in the living room and we can use them separately on separate channels at the same time.  My grandkids love the headsets so this settles a problem when they come to visit and want cartoons while I want news.The 175 has only one channel so this setup would probably not be possible.The 175 power button has to be held down for about three seconds to activate while the 120 has a slide switch.  The 175 has a very slight delay between activation and transmitter connection.  The 120 is instant.  This caused a rather humorous incident early on.  My wife was watching a movie on Netflix and I picked up the headset, turned it on, placed it on my head and thought I was waiting on a connection when in reality I was in a very quite point in the movie just before an explosion and massive gunfire.  I was on my way to my recliner when all hell broke loose and it was so realistic I almost wet my pants and overran the recliner.  It was apparently the highlight of my wife's day.  She still laughs about it.  Her lack of concern about my bruised shins and ego aside...after the fact it was funny.I know this was lengthy but I hope it helps someone in my situation to make an informed decision.In  short I would never had purchased the 175's for myself due to the cost because I wouldn't have believed they would make this much difference.  Now that I've experienced them I would buy them in a heartbeat.Now a word about sennheiser's customer service.  I had a situation early on where I lost the optical connection with my TV.  I was quick to blame the new headset simply because they were new.  I sent an email to sennheiser  in hopes they could find a solution before I had to send the set back.  I had a return mail in about 45 minutes telling me what to do.  Turns out the problem was with the television and not the sennheiser transmitter.  Quick response, great customer service.",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are fantastic but I'm not retiring my 120's.

    ","I originally started shopping for wireless headphones to find something better than the so-called TV ears that a member of my immediate family who suffers from hearing loss had been using with some success. This inevitably brought me to the fine line of quality wireless headphones available from the German company Sennheiser and I had first thought about purchasing a just recently discontinued RS 170 or RS 180 model without an optical connection – analog only (As of 05/30/2015, the RS 180 was still only $199.99 at Crutchfield online with free shipping and 60-day returns). But then why spend about $200.00 on technology that is essentially 12 to 14 years old when the absolutely latest thing from Sennheiser (models RS 165, RS 175, RS 185 and RS 195) is available for just a little bit more?Out of this latest line of Sennheiser wireless headphones with a two-year warranty it is this model – the closed-back RS 175 – that I eventually ended up purchasing from Crutchfield online. Pricing was exactly the same as it is here on Amazon.com ($279.95). However, by using my Discover card (5% rebate through Shop Discover online and 90-day price match guarantee - lowest price seen 2 weeks later was $233.97) I was able to ultimately get my pair of brand new headphones for only $219.97 with free shipping, no sales tax and 60-day returns.I agree with CNET.com and their excellent review of the Sennheiser RS 175 that it is this specific model that gives you the most bang for your buck; it is the most cost-effective model in this product line. There is a big difference in moving from the RS 165 to the RS 175 in that the transmission distance of the RS 165 is only rated at about 90 feet while the RS 175 and other models are still functional at a distance of about 300 feet. The RS 175 also adds a low/high surround sound capability which the RS 165 (bass boost feature only) does not have.The differences in moving to a pricier model beyond the RS 175 are not that significant, in my opinion. Whether the open-back (not as sound isolating) RS 185 with the addition of manual/automatic level control features (MLC/ALC) and a balance control located on the headset is worth an additional $90.00 premium (best current price of about $370.00) above the RS 175 is something that only you can decide.At a cost of about $170.00 more than the RS 175, the top-of-the-line RS 195 closed-back model includes all of the aforementioned features of the RS 185 and adds 7 presets to tailor sound to individual hearing requirements as well as separate “speech” and “music” modes.Initial setup of these RS 175 headphones was extremely simple. The most time-consuming step was waiting for the batteries located in the two headphone ear-cups to complete their initial charging process which takes about 18 hours; subsequent full recharging of the headphones should only take about 8 hours. The operating time with fully charged headphones is claimed to be up to 18 hours until recharging is required. Both analog and optical/digital connection options are available. You can choose to use both connections (say for a TV and a stereo system) and then toggle between the two at your leisure using the sliding switch provided for this purpose on the back of the headphone transmitter.So far I have only opted to connect my television via the included 1.5 m long optical cable (don’t forget to remove both clear protective plastic end caps before using) and the optical input on the headphone transmitter which ensures optimum performance. If the cable is too short for your needs, you can always subsequently purchase a 3 m long cable like I did for about $10.00 (AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable - 9.8 Feet [3 Meters] - see my review). Note that the appropriate output on the back of your TV or other device may not be labelled as an optical output: Mine is actually called the digital audio output, but it is definitely what is needed to make the proper connection. The unique shape of the optical connector (it really can only fit in one place) will help you figure out just where it needs to go, assuming that you have an appropriate output available and don’t need to make an analog connection. If you do make an optical/digital audio connection to your TV, be sure to go into the appropriate settings menu before first using the headphones to set the optical/digital audio output mode to PCM (pulse-code modulation). Don’t leave it on automatic or some other setting. This is specifically required in the 15-language Sennheiser instruction manual on CD that comes with the headphones!As far as the user experience itself is concerned, these comfortable headphones with the easily adjustable headband are just what I was looking for. The member of my family who is hard of hearing has noticed a day and night difference in his ability to not only hear, but more importantly distinguish and understand speech when using these wonderfully isolating closed-back headphones. There is virtually no sound leakage in or out. He remains happily occupied in his own little world watching TV while now being able to understand essentially everything. This was not the case with the previously mentioned TV ears that cost less than $100.00 when purchased. Other people in the same room can simultaneously watch the TV in the usual manner – without headphones. Everybody’s happy.The quality of the sound that emanates from these headphones when using an optical connection is truly amazing! There is absolutely no hissing or other distracting sound – only that which needs to be heard and nothing more. The bass boost setting is quite useful for music and can be activated on-the fly when needed by using the touch controls located on the outside of the right ear-cup (bass boost, surround sound, volume +/-) near where the on/off button for the headphones is found. The surround sound setting (off, low and high available) does create a more immersive sound experience when activated; I personally prefer the low setting and usually have the headphones set in this manner when I use them. Additional bass boost and surround sound controls, each with a separate indicator light that glows green when activated, are also found on the front of the headphone transmitter upon which the headphones are placed when not in use and for recharging. The transmission distance with these headphones is excellent: I am able to walk anywhere throughout my 1600 square foot ranch home without any signal loss whatsoever; the same holds true when I am in either my front or back yards.I have the headphone transmitter base located near my Roku 3 in the living room and there is absolutely no interference when streaming and simultaneously using the Sennheiser headphones. However, I should note that I have my Roku 3 set to stream at 5.0 GHz on my dual-band AC router. There may or may not be a problem if your WiFi network with connected devices located near the Sennheiser transmitter is set to function in the 2.4 to 2.8 GHz range which is used by the headphones. You’ll just have to try it and see what happens. If necessary, appropriate device relocation - a greater distance of separation - should resolve any difficulties.Overall my hearing-impaired family member and I have been exceedingly pleased with our listening experience when using these Sennheiser RS 175, closed-back, wireless headphones of impressive quality. If you too would like to experience a most enjoyable, crystal-clear earful when partaking of diverse auditory pleasures during your leisure time, I can recommend them most highly and without any reservations whatsoever.",5.0 out of 5 stars,An ear-opening experience whether or not you are hearing impaired

    ","I bought these to replace a pair of Sony MDR RF-6000s and use them mostly for TV/Movies.  The Sonys cut out and picked up lots of interference from wifi and other 2.4ghz traffic (I live in a city environment with easily 25 wifi networks in range).  Overall, they've been great and are well worth the money.Signal:So far, the Sennheisers have been flawless with no dropouts or signal loss.  As above, I live in a pretty interference-heavy environment.  Haven't really range tested them, but they'll easily go into the next room with no problem.Sound Quality:I played around with the bass boost and surround, but find things sound best with all that off.  There's no shortage of bass and sound quality is full and on par with any high-end headphone from Bose, Sennheiser, or Sony.  There's a slight signal delay, though that's only perceptible when the audio is also playing through speakers, and I'd expect that from any RF headphones.Batteries:I haven't tested the battery life yet (had them on a couple hours and no issues).  They use rechargeable AAA batteries, which allows for the use of standard AAAs if the rechargeable ones die.  Each earcup has a battery, accessible by twisting/unlocking the pad.  That evens out the weight, but adds a step to change batteries.Cradle/Transponder:It's a pretty sleek looking stand, both with the phones on and off.  Takes a little bit of practice to get them on and off just right, but nothing too difficult.Comfort:They're a pretty tight fit, which is good for keeping them on while moving around, though maybe not the best for all-day listening.  All considered, no complaints about comfort.  My only long-term concern would be the foam pads on the headband - foam tends to wear and these don't look replaceable.  The headband is a standard adjustable model, though a bit thicker than some others due to the larger size and weight of the electronics/batteries.  The Sonys had a band that turned them on automatically when you put them on (and then beeped annoyingly if there was no signal).  These use a button for on/off, which is slightly less convenient but more durable and reliable long term.  You have to hold the button for a few secs, so they aren't prone to accidentally being turned off.In all, these are a good buy and decent balance between price and quality with no significant flaws.  My main driver is signal quality in a high-interference environment, and these have certainly solved that so far.  Also, the packaging and instructions were easy and clearly well thought out.  That's often an afterthought, but a bad experience there can set the tone for the product long term.  Nice work, Sennheiser.UPDATE: 10 Months in, and these are still going strong.  Battery life is still excellent - I've had a few ""marathon"" sessions (use these for TV) and they've yet to run out.  Often, I get lazy and don't throw them back on the charger after an evening of TV and they're still good to go the next time.  In our old place, I finally found where the signal would cut out - in the basement three floors down.  Our new house is lath and plaster, which is murder on all kinds of wireless signals, and they're good for about one floor in either direction and probably 70-80 ft from the base station.  Unless you live with lath & plaster (and you'll know if you do) or in a stone castle, I can't imagine a scenario where you wouldn't have whole-house roaming.  Still never had even a blip of interference, despite a neighborhood of wireless routers screaming at high volume in 2.4ghz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Wireless Headphones

    ","After much research, I finally pulled the trigger on 11/22/15 and ordered the top rated Sennheiser RS 175 Headphones over the ear phoneswith  Amazon Prime for $245, with no added tax or shipping costs. These were essential for domestic tranquility with others in the house because my new SAMSUNG 4K UHDTV and Soundbar system speaker bass which you could hear all over the house even with a low volume setting of 10.  These got as low as $199  for Black Friday, but I still got a good price on them.General Comments:As far as the hookup to my Samsung UN65JS8500 (see my Amazon review)......a couple of things your should know that took me about an hour to figure out which might save you some time and pain. First,  I already had a Samsung Soundbar on the 4K UHDTV which ran off the single optical out from the one-connect mini box.  These headphones are not Bluetooth but have their own wireless frequency transmitter direct to your headphones up to 100 meters away depending on your walls. You don't have to pair them up with the UHDTV and you can get a second pair of them for a viewing companion. They are great phones but you need to set them up special on this Samsung:1. Split the Optical out into 2 cables if you have a soundbar. Get the Toslink Digital Optical Audio Splitter 1x3...1 input to 3 possible output devices. The VHD-TS1X3 will cost you around $25 on Prime or at stores like Fry's. Also purchase a 1 meter optical cable from your one-connect mini box to the splitter input port for about $10, Then you will have A, B, or C output ports and supplied cables from the splitter to your soundbar, headphones, and one additional device if you need it.2. On the Samsung Menu Sound Option. Very important, as it took me an hour to figure out what settings to use as my first hookup with the headphones was dead silent and there was nobody to help me at Samsung or Sennheiser:a. Sound Mode: Up to you, but I like ""Movie"" for the better base in most movies and 4K series on Prime or Netflix.b. TV Speaker: Stay with SoundBar (if you have one) or TV speakers....not Bluetooth, or Optical Out options.c. Additional Settings: HDMI Out:.....set to PCM and Audio Format: also set to PCM. Headphones require PCM format on UHDTV.Once you do this, the headphones and the soundbar will both send out fantastic audio simultaneously......so you must mute the soundbar (or regular TV speakers) to eliminate any echo effect time delays....but fiber optic is so fast you should not hear any. My Audio delay is set to 100 ms with my HD Audio: OFF. You may need to play with these depending on your speaker/Soundbar setup.PROS:1. Great sound fidelity and reproduction.  No noise once you put them on.  You hear voices and stereo sound effects you can't hear fromstandard UHDTV speakers or soundbars which adds to your viewing experience.2.  I can take them to any room in the house within 30 feet upstairs or downstairs and not miss a sound.  No sound dropouts anywhere,even the garage, bathroom, or outside.3.  Fairly easy to setup once you have your optical cable or stereo audio cable setup and your sound source menu options setup properlyfor the Sennheiser.4.  Nice to have the transmitter post nearby to charge the headphones when not in use and red/green charging indicator status.5. Good reference CD.  I suggest you print out the entire 32 page instruction manual before you start the setup or view the PDF.  You can still read every page if you double up to print 2 pages per sheet for 16 pages with landscape format.  It will take you 10 minutes to read it.6.  Nice to confirm your current BASS BOOST or SURROUND SOUND setting lights on the transmitter post if within view.7.  I am still experimenting with BASS and Surround Sound settings Hi and Low for movies, normal shows, and music channels.  So far, I like the just the extra BASS BOOST setting for movies.  You need to experiment for yourself.CONS:1.  Headphone batteries:  Swap out the supplied AAA batteries with the Energizer AAA rechargeable batteries, which charge up much faster and last a lot longer than the German supplied ""ReCyko"" batteries. You need 1 battery in for the left and right side headphone. Volume controls, + or -, base high/low, and surround sound buttons are on the right side headphone, which take a while to get use to. Don't use your remote or you will unmute your soundbar or TV speakers and alert others in your house and defeat your headphone privacy.2.  All controls on the right earphone.  Very nice if you are right-handed or ok with your right hand if left-handed.  The other problem is that the 4 main quadrants of the control circle:  BASS,  SURROUND SOUND,  VOL -, and VOL +, are basically on a flat surface, and  unless you have a mutant eye or good tactile feel on your right thumb, you really can't feel which control is which.  The first few days, I had to take off my headphones multiple times to see which control I was touching.  Problem solved:  I got some 3/8"" round soft felt tabs with a stick-on side on each control.  The BASS and SURROUND tabs are a little thicker than the sound control tabs, so I could feel, where I was on the control circle.  All I had to remember was the BASS was to the left of the SURROUND control and that VOL - was to the left of VOL +.  Sennheiser should improve this ergonomic problem with future models.3.  Break-in pain.  I have only had these headphones about 2 weeks, and even with the padding around the ears and on the top of my head, there is definitely a dull throbbing pain around my ears once I remove the headphones after about an hour of viewing.  There is  no way to adjust the tightness of these phones on the sides of your head.  However, as others have suggested, it might take a month or so of normal use to loosen them up...or maybe you can stretch them out over a large wooden block when not in use.I may change my 4* rating to 5* in a future review update if the pain issue resolves itself or my head shrinks.  We'll see.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Happy with this Addition to my 4K Samsung System with a few Suggestions

    ","I'm a musician with a home studio.  With several sets of headphones all getting old, I decided to invest in some new ones. I've had good luck with Sennheiser in the past so I wanted to check out what they were currently offering. After reading lots of reviews, I decided to give these rs175 rf's a try. I was a little leery of them being wireless but trusting in the Sennheiser name, bought them anyway. I wanted them for general recording and playback.Pros: Excellent sound... flat, uncolored. Clear detailed, etc. All the qualities I've come to expect from Sennheiser.  Wireless setup was virtually nothing... plug in the base where you'd plug in the headphones and you're done. Turn on the headphones and start listening. The stand serves as the charging station and placing the headphones on it is straightforward and secure... not clumsy at all. I have a fairly large head with proportional sized ears... (size xxl hat). The ear pads fit completely over my ears and completely seal very nicely around them.  You won't be bothered by outside sounds, nor will your spouse be bothered by what you're listening to.  A quick check of the range shows I can go anywhere in my average size home without losing the signal. (I didn't try going outside).Cons: The only negative is that there is a bit of latency. If you use them for listening to music or even tv, you won't notice it... but if you turn on speakers at the same time and listen to both, you'll notice a very slight lag in the headphones.Bottom line: these are excellent headphones, quality of build and quality of sound are both first rate. But if that latency is an issue, you probably shouldn't be looking at wireless anyway (I suspect this occurs on any wireless system).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sounding wireless headphones...

    ","I got a newer Samsung TV (2016) and it only had optical out for audio.  Tried to keep my old Sennheiser running with a Orei DA34X Optical to Audio RCA jack converter.  Mistake, if you are still at the decision point just go straight to these.  The Orei’s Would run for 20 minutes, go mute, and I had to power cycle them to get the audio back.  The optical input here directly to the headset base seems very solid. Right now this is the lowest end Sennheiser that takes an optical input.  Haven’t owned them long but I’m pretty sure they will be very stable in terms of providing good audio for hours at a time.  I have a sound bar that wants optical too.  An Optical splitter might be good but I don’t know if there is an optical splitter.  Two other comments about the product.  The sound is very good, especially for spoken dialog.  Some have commented about the on/off switch.  With the old Sennheiser it was easy to know whether the headset was on or off.  Be patient with the power on for these.  It takes a few seconds after you hit the button for them to power up.  Once they are on a quick hit of the on button will mute them and another quick hit will restore the sound without turning off the base station.  Update, connecting to comcast worked great for these.  Want to mention something I ran into so that others can avoid.  I have a 2016 Samsung 9000 level tv.  When I went to Amazon using the tv remote the green lite on the front of the sennheiser started blinking.  The green light blinking means the Sennheiser base station isn’t talking to the tv.  I was confused because the sennheiser worked great with comcast.  in the Samsung settings -> Sound -> Expert settings my default for HDMI Audio Format was PCM which is good.  BUT! The Audio Format below that has to be PCM also and it’s default was Dolby Digital.  When I set Audio Format to PCM also Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube started putting sound through the Sennheiser.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"RS 175 Optical Input Discussion, Samsung/amazon only audio problem"

    ","Outstanding sound, would have given this 5 stars if it had a control for the treble as well as the base. I have read many reviews complaining about aThe lack of a charging system if you purchase a 2nd set of these headphones. The price difference between buying the whole system and buying just the headphones is $20. If you want two headsets, buy two complete systems, only attach one base to the audio sorce and use the 2nd base as a charger. No shuffling headsets on one base or switching out batteries and you have a spare base if anything goes wrong with the main one.

    ","Wireless:When sitting at my desk near the transmitter the signal is clear. However after I step out of my room about 15ft there is a lot of interference and I can no longer listen to a song/podcast properly until I return within range. I should mention that I live in an apartment complex and it may or may not be a factor.2 inputs Analog & Digital:I picked the rs 175 because it has two inputs, unlike the rs 165 which only had analog. I initially planned to use the analog 3.5mm input for my computer and the digital input for my T.V. and just flip the switch on the dock when I want to watch T.V./Computer. However the analog input consistently introduced an annoying flat lining noise and was unusable. I tried it with my desktop, several different phones and my laptop and the same noise was introduced with each device. Luckily the digital optical worked well and is very clear compared to the analog input. So as a result in order for me to switch back and forth between tv/computer I have to unplug/re-plug the digital opt from each device.Comfort:When I first tried on these headphones there is some pressure on jawline and on the top of my head. I like to transition from youtube to playing games to watching T.V./Movies so I was using these headphones for long periods of time. After 3-4 hours it became uncomfortable/sore. I would have to take the headphones off and take a break.Sound:I am by no means an audiophile/expert, but I am going to try my best to describe the sound. I’ve listen to podcasts, hip-hop, edm, and music with strong vocals. I’ve also watched a couple movies and binge watched some anime with these headphones. Overall I would describe the sound as very upfront, powerful, and clear. For me personally, I thought it was a bit overwhelming and didn’t like the sound. The best way I can describe it, the audio sounded very in my face, it felt suffocating and sometimes gave me a head ache.  Every sound instrument, beat, and vocal sounded like it was 5ft  away from me and in a way sounded artificial. I don’t know if this is the correct term but I believe what I am describing is a lack of depth. I also tried testing out the bass boost and surround options a couple times but didn’t test them for long periods because I thought the audio sounded better overall without these settings on. I just want to say that sound can be very subjective in terms of what people like and although I may not have like the way these headphones sounded you just might.Battery & Charging Dock:The battery life was never an issue and I loved the charging station. I never really felt like I had to actually ""charge"" these headphones, every time I was done using them I felt as if I was simply putting them away. I usually just lay my headphones down on my desk but I always worry they might get scratched or banged up so the dock was nice and really convenient. The only problem I had was with the initial charge time. As soon as I got the headphones I wanted to try them out immediately, but they require an initial 16 hour charge time. I was trying to keep myself busy and take my mind off them but I would find myself checking back every couple of hours for the green light.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like these headphones they look awesome on my desk, but they didn’t quiet perform like I expected them to."

    ","These work great.  I have them in my home office and in my living room.  Pricey?  Yes, but absolutely worth it!  In the living room, I have connected the base station to the audio output on my TV.  (You will have to purchase an inexpensive RCA male to 3.5 mm female convert to do this.)  You can also plug directly into the headphone jack (most TVs have one), but you will probably lose the sound from the TV speakers.  With my set up, I can get sound from the TV speakers at the same time as the headphones.  This is great, because my wife likes the sound lower.  The range is fabulous because the signal is not blocked by walls, interior or exterior.  In fact, I keep mine in a closed cabinet!  Also, these headphones use rechargeable AAA batteries.  Some Sennheiser products use a proprietary rechargeable battery.  These are expensive to replace and seem to have a shorter run time than ordinary AAA's.  Whenever I purchase battery powered electronics, I try to buy products that use standard battery sizes (e.g., AA or AAA) rather than proprietary products, which are always pricey!I find the headphones to be very comfortable.  The sound is fine too whether it comes from TV, DVD, VCR.  That includes music as well.  Maybe not theater quality, but the product has 2 surround sound settings (3 if you include ""Off""!) and a bass booster.  And there is plenty of volume.  (If you need more volume, then use the headphone jack.  This will allow you to increase the volume by increasing the volume on the TV in addition to the volume on the headphones.  Nice, if you need that much volume.)I find the headphones to be comfortable.  The control buttons on the right hand headset are a bit tricky to operate by feel, but you can always take them off to make an adjustment.  With a little time, I can now access the controls by touch, so give it a chance.  You know, I might even by a third pair for the bedroom!",5.0 out of 5 stars,EXCELLENT CORDLESS HEADPHONES!

    ","This unit was a cinch to hook up. The headphones fit snug to my head and seals in sound perfectly but not very comfortable to wear. I find that I need to take frequent breaks removing the headphones as it feels like a vice on my head. Perhaps that's a trade off I can live with. The sound caps at a reasonable level and I love the surround sound feature. It really does take 16 hours for the initial charge and I suggest you don't skimp on this as you will notice shorter battery times later. The headphones are strong/sturdy with the accompanying weight. It comes with a digital optical cord but I highly recommend purchasing a longer cord if your unit is placed away from your TV or cable-box. Sennheiser makes solid, great sounding audio products that's on par with highend industry standards. The only reason that I did not give a five rating is the lack of comfort and that a AAA battery is needed for each headphone. I will continue testing these and update this review in a few weeks.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The headphones fit snug to my head and seals in sound perfectly but not very comfortable to wear

    ","I own the Seinnheiser RS170, and two of the RS175, in different locations.  While the sound is similar, the 170 requires activating a switch on the base unit, then the headphone.  The 175 requires only a button press (4 seconds or so) on the headphone, which then activates the base station.While my 70+ yr ears are not audiophile quality, I find the sound quality quite good.  I also find that I can understand speech rather well with the earphones -- not always true from my soundbar.I also find the earphones (both 170 and 175) to be comfortable, occasionally for 4-5 hour periods.Both the k170 and 175 take the same replacement earpads.  I have had my 170 for 2-1/2 years, using it in my exercise room (i.e., sweating into the earpads), and have found no degradation at all.  My 175's are about a year younger, again, with no degradation in the earpad.  Sennheiser OEM earpads are about $17.While I don't normally run the battery out, I have found no battery issues in any of the thee sets that I use.  One set sits on the charger sometimes for a month (remote location) before use -- again with no issues.  The others are used frequently -- daily or bi-daily, again with no battery issues.  Of course, the AAA NiCad batteries are easily replaced, with they finally wear out.  A good charger will keep NiCad batteries for quite a long time.  The biggest battery issue is running the batteries all the way down, which places reverse current in the weaker of the two batteries, effectively killing it.Bottom line is that I liked them enough to put one on each sound device that I use.  Good sound and reliable operation.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Decent sound and reliable operation.

    ","Oh how I wish I had bought these a long time ago. My husband is hard of hearing even with his hearing aids. TV was nightmare as he couldn't understand people and even the captioning wasn't always helpful as they skip words, misspell them or put up gibberish when it was too fast. Often the sound had to be so loud for him I was afraid of losing my hearing. I gave him the headphones for Christmas and it's been a miracle for us. He can now hear and understand movies and tv. When he wants to watch something I don't care about, I can turn the sound off and he can hear it just fine. No cords and works even if he gets up to go to the kitchen. He has the stand sitting next to the TV and when not in use he puts the headphones on there to keep them charged up. I would recommend these to anyone who has hearing problems.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Marriage saver

    ","Like a lot of people, I had the RS 110. It lasted 9 years, including when I set it aside thinking it was dead, randomly plugged it back after it being disconnected for a couple of days and it started working again! It lasted about 3 years after that. Guess it just needed recharging. Needless to say, I was ready to buy another Sennheiser product when the RS110 died for good. After researching all of the models, I chose the RS 175 model for its price and the overall positive feedback. I was a little reluctant, as some people mentioned the digital signal could cut out, but I decided it was the best choice. So far, so good and overall I like it but there are some quirks. Here's what I've found:Pros:-- Good, solid sound. I like the fact the headphones cover my ears and the ear pads are comfortable. I use it solely on my computer and do sometimes sit farther away (10 feet or so) to watch a movie or TV show. Unlike the RS110, it didn't start to fade a little as I got a certain distance away. No analog static here. I have walked out of my apartment and could still hear sound coming from the phones, although it did stop at a certain point (no listening to music in the laundry room). I sometimes wear them in my kitchen or when walking around my apartment while listening to music, and the headphones work great for that. No loss of signal at all.-- It turns the sound off after a set period and it's easy to turn back on with a quick flick of the button (as long as the power light is still on on the headphones --- see Cons for a caveat about that)-- It's easy to put back onto the charging station and I've never run out of power when using the headphones off the charger for a time.This is due to the power saving feature which, as mentioned below, can be a bit frustrating.Cons:-- The volume buttons on the side of the headphones are somewhat tricky to use without taking off the headphones. I sometimes turn it down when I mean to turn it up if I try to adjust the volume with them on. I have to feel around a bit for the volume buttons to get it right and sometimes turn on the surround sound or bass boost by mistake, but don't do it as much now that I've gotten used to them. Another reviewer mentioned this and fixed it by putting some type of raised sticker on one of the buttons. I may do this.-- Speaking of the Bass boost and surround sound, it doesn't do a whole lot for my set up. This might be more of a benefit on a higher end system or high-quality TV, but it doesn't add much to my onboard computer sound card.-- The headphones fully cover your ears, and when it's warm your ears can get a bit sweaty. Not a huge problem though unless I'm using them a lot for long periods.-- And the power issue. Sometimes the headphones are hard to turn back on if I've put them down, and not back on the charger/receiver, and don't run sound through them for a longer period. The headphones do power down completely after not running sound through them for longer periods (which is great for not running out of juice) and, unlike when the power button on the headphones stays lit and you simply hit the power button on the headphones quickly to restore sound, if the power light goes off on the headphones, as well as the connectivity light on the charger/receiver, it sometimes doesn't play sound when you turn them back on. How it works to turn them on is you have to hold the power button on the headphones until the power light comes on the headphones and then a connectivity light comes on on the charger/receiver. It works fine when you first turn them on after taking them off the charger/receiver, but for some reason when you leave the phones lying around, and off the charger/receiver, and the lights do go off ( I don't know the actual time it takes for this) on both the headphones and the charger/receiver, it won't play sound when you turn it back on again, even if both lights are lit. As mentioned before, not a problem if the lights stay on when you leave the headphones off the charger and don't run sound through them: just hit the power button on the headphones once quickly and sound plays. It's interesting, as doing the same thing after you power the phones back on and they don't play sometimes fixes the issue, but not always. Occasionally, I have to turn them completely off again and then back on to get it to work. I've noticed the problem can be inconsistent too. Sometimes I can watch as the power button comes on on the headphones ( of course you can't be wearing them at the time) and then the light comes on the charger/receiver, it will run sound if you let go of the power button on the headphones just as the light comes on on the receiver, but again not always. It definitely won't work if you leave the headphones on, press the power button on the headphones and wait for the light on the charger/receiver to come on. You end up holding the power button on the headphones on for too long or something. No sound will come through. This is when I have to power them down and then back up again as even pressing the power button on the headphones quickly doesn't always work.  This may be by design, and it might just be a timing issue, but it doesn't do it when you first turn on the headphones after taking them off the charger so it's kind of annoying.Again, overall the headphones are well made and the sound is solid. Despite the minor quirks of the powering down kind, I would probably buy them again. For the price, I think they are worth it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy overall but some minor problems

    ",Another Sennheiser great product! In full disclosure I own corded Sennheiser headphones and personally would not buy anything else because of the quality and sound. On that note these are no exception they are cordless and they sound absolutely tremendous. You can read the reviews for yourself and you be glad to find out that they are a Hi-Fi item. They come with surround sound and also extra Bass. They are easy to hook up to your TV. Just hook the optical optical cord to your TV and then to the back of the headphone unit. Let the headphones charge for 16 hours. The volume rocker and other controls are on the right side for easy handling. We bought these for our seventy-year-old mother and she absolutely adores them in fact we had to buy some rechargeable triple A batteries and a charger so that we can keep her charged up all the time!! Just to give you an idea she is an avid TV Watcher and she has the TV on 24/7. However if you want to get normal wear out of these they last about 10 to 12 hours a day. The sound for spoken language is pure and uninhibited. The sound for movies is clear and encapsulate you with emotion. These headphones were made to last they are built of solid material. They are not dainty. If you are keeping your wife or husband up at night watching TV I would suggest getting a pair of these they are fantastic and you will do yourself a favor by listening to awesome sound. It is unique when you can find a product as good as it touts! Happy listening.😉,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely the best sound for wireless headphones on the market hands down!

    ","The first RS 175 RF I purchased was to replace a Sony RF head phone...which worked right from the first time I plugged it in....this RS 175 RF did not.  It was sent out defective by Amazon's supplier...then a second one was sent, and that was defective.....third one as well!  That sucks!I thought at this price point, every headphone sent out should work as advertised....this company must have some serious issues w/ quality control.  I asked myself; ""what would be the odds of 3 defective Sennheiser RS 175 RF sent out to the same customer?""  My guess?  Pretty long odds....maybe lottery odds!  If I was one of the head fellows in this company, and found out about this, my quality control people would end up looking for new jobs.So, the real question is why did it take me so long to do a review?  The forth pair arrived from the same vender who sent out the 3 defective ones....I was a little angry by that time....well, very angry.....but finally the forth pair sent worked!But by that time, I did not trust the Sennheiser brand any more.  It has been a year or more since that first defective pair came to my door, and the nightmare started.  Won't speculate how this could have happened to one customer....but the forth pair is still working as advertised.The four stars in the rating reflect that forth pair.  The first three defective ones don't even rate one star!I liked the Sony design a lot better than the Sennheiser's, but sadly Sony discontinued that part number...the Sony controls were not as complicated to use,the Sony controls were more user friendly....Sennheiser's are not.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Hope the first pair works.....the first three I got did not!

    ","RS 175. The directions (Quick Guide) are very, very poor. Nowhere does it tell you to hold the ON button on the headset until the transmitter lights up. Nowhere does it give you any troubleshooting options. (I still cannot connect with digital audio.) A detailed product manual would be helpful. I cannot find one online.  I am using the plug-in jacks to the red and white audio output on the TV. The sound is tinny, not the rich sound without the headset. The headset buttons are difficult to find while on your head. I use 5GHz wifi to the TV so that is not a problem. The dual band router is in the basement one floor down. The range extender is in the laundry room about thirty feet away.

    ","I recently bought a Samsung UHD TV for my living room. The surround system is right under the master bedroom making it impossible to listen at a reasonable volume with someone upstairs. In addition, my hearing loss makes it difficult to get all the dialog especially if there is a lot of background noise.These headphones solved both problems. I can now hear everything clearly and not bother anyone else.I purchased these refurbished and they arrived in a generic white box with a ""Sennheizer QC"" sticker inside. Included were a very thin optical cable and an analog connection cable. There was a quick reference guide that was fairly useless and a manual on CD which I did not take the time to review.The headphones are pretty straightforward to set up and get charging. Unfortunately they come uncharged and take a ridiculous 16 hours to reach full charge. Other reviewers have mentioned replacing the AAA batteries with other brands - something I will definitely try.As others have also mentioned, getting these to work required your source to be set to PCM (uncompressed) vs Dolby audio. I spent 20 minutes getting this cleared up. It would be helpful if this detail were prominent in the quick start guide.Sound quality is good - dialog is now clear. I am not blown away by the sound quality but that could be my ears. I am still playing with the bass boost and surround settings. So far, boost off and surround low seem to sound the best.I have worn these for two nights so far and they are comfortable enough to make it through a two hour movie without being annoying.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Problem solver

    ","Great sound.Less reception distance than my RS120 headphones, but still plenty far enough.I only have 3 complaints.  One, the shell is plasticky and although I can't hear it in the sound, if I touch them with my fingers they ring and echo enormously.  Even just eating something while wearing them, gives them this ringing echo.  Two, there should be better padding.  The unpadded center of the top where the charging contacts are rest on my bald head.  Seriously, makes for a nice sleek design visually, but it's not as comfortable as it should be.  Three, the level of passive sound isolation could be improved.  The rest of the world leaks in too much..though they don't seem to let much sound out - though I do listen at much lower volumes than I suspect most people do, usually.I find the bass boost and surround features usable, but could be better with a little ability to tailor it to my own desired sound.If the 3 items I mentioned above were fixed, these would not be 4 stars.

These wireless headsets are super easy to install (or move between TV's), easy to operate and the sound is awesome.  I even went back and watched some of the old shows that I had already watched and got a whole new perspective of what was said. They do not kill the volume on the TV so not an issue watching a show with your family.

    ","Having had the rs170s for just over 4 years, we decided it was time to update given how much we use the 170s (everyday most of the time)--showing the wear but still functioning as well as day one.  I admit I have not always been delicate with my set especially during football season and it still works wonderfully, durable.first off, I love the sennheiser plastic loop inserted in the box in such a way that indicates if the box opened.  They did that with the 170s and it was there for both this box and the hdr175, optional headset.  I like receiving new stuff when I make a purchase.  I have had at times used stuff sent my way for new purchases.  Thank you amazon.com for sending me new items.a nice feature with the 175s is that no longer are we required to interact with the transmitter (base) to turn on the transmitter.  turning on the headsets will activate the base.  this aspect has worked every time tried so far.  I think sennheiser heeded the complaints and added this overdue capability.one minor issue I had was how the base does not initially indicate charged for a charged battery, i.e., the base takes some time, a couple of days, to work out a ""sync"" with the battery and its charge.  so, do not be alarmed, as I was and contacted support, if you charge a set the first day and it still indicates red, not charged.  the base will figure out, sorry, the sync between the charge and indicator.  I use two sets and now I have no issues charging and knowing when both are charged.there is one big downer and that is the wireless capability does not seem in any way improved over the rs170s; yes, that capability was/is great.  but, to my chagrin, in my house I have the exact same drops with the 175s I had with the 170s--due to obstacles, but not that far away.  it is disappointing given how wireless tech has changed over the recent years; I thought there would be some improvements with how robust the wireless tech is with this set.  NOTE:  the wireless connection is otherwise awesome when not challenging the set with too many obstacles.overall, I enjoy these headphones more than I enjoyed the 170s, so I consider these a great upgrade for the role as primarily for tv, movies/cable, and gaming.  the bass is more potent over the 170s, but not too much to be a problem.  we have the option to turn the bass off with the headphones.  NOTE:  if you turn the bass off for one set you turn it off for both sets.  same with the surround sound.  the surround sound is good, but I do not care so much about it too make much of a worthwhile comment.  it works and you have options therein.great product by sennheiser, again.  thank you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"upgraded 170s to 175s, and satisfied"

    ","StrengthsSound quality really good for wireless, the best i have heard in fact for wireless. Better than a lot of wired too, to my ears these sound wonderful. I have a lot of headphones and am into audio as well. I think the sound would suit the tastes of 90% of people. For movies these kill, got me though when my daughter was in infant :) They extremely conformable with easily replaceable pads. i upgraded to the felt pads you can buy the 185 pads and they work fine. They are better than the stock ones that come with these for those of us that like the feel of felt.Simply fun to listen to. Close as you will get to a 2k home theater on a budget.Really just want to cut to the chase these are fun to listen to, and i feel they sound wonderful for movies. I can honestly say i don't think they could be any better for this usage.Also love having replaceable batteries. I have had this for a couple years now, and a buddy has has his a previous model for more than 10 years old (180) so i know they hold up fairly well.WeaknessesThey don't leak sound, but the sound isolation isn't the best as compared to some other over year phones i have tried. It isn't bad, just don't expect super isolation.The head band pad is not the best. Fake leather feels a little thin there too. The build is also not the most robust. I haven't had any issues but i am also really careful with my things. I wouldn't drop it. I'd be surprised if it could sustain a fall from 4-5 feet on a hard surface with out breaking.The price i paid for the full unit with the base station was 171. It is a buy at that price, no regrets, in fact i like the sound so much if i could find it for that price or lower i'd consider picking up a second done for work since i like it better than Bluetooth. while it isn't quite as flexible as bluetooth since you need this station, it performs better, and there are no hiccups with either lag, or bluetooth issues like jitter etc. In fact in all the years of owning this i have never had any issue audio or otherwise. I think 270 which i see from time to time is asking way  too much though they are good but let's not be crazy. The mark up on head phones is absurd. I'd wait for a sale. For what these do they are wonderful. If you want a pair of cans for your home theater system or computer, and don't need as much flexibility as bluetooth provides and have a scenario where audio performance is paramount, you'll totally love these.It really is significant in terms of quality it is a rich sound, with a nice sound stage and imaging which helps for movies and games.While not perfect if I am being picky, after years of owning this i am giving it 5 starts because i still use it, and it has served me really well, and i have been totally satisfied with my purchase. In fact i used this and my Bluetooth cans more than any of the corded ones i have these days, and i have some nice ones. This sound just about as good as some of my high end cabled head phones especially for things like movies. They are particularly tuned for that. My main gripes are I would love to see 1.) more isolation, 2.) more robust build quality 3.) this quality of sound on Bluetooth if it is possible. I mean i feel like i have to treat these things like fine china which they are :) I can honestly say these'd would by far be my go to head phones in all scenarios if i could get this sound quality on Bluetooth and not paying 500 dollars.Here is hoping. These have great imaging and are almost as good as open back headphones in sound stage. there is almost a surround sound nature to them, but they just sound great. If you want uncompromising high end sounds for your movies in a head phones these are the ones to get.",5.0 out of 5 stars,One of my favorite electronic dad toys.

Made a few adjustment by using my menu from my Sony Led TV and once setting it up it just sounded awesome, the sound is incredible. Sounds like I'm in the TV show, I was watching the third Season of Flash. You can hear background noises of the computer back in Star Labs from where I could not hear them from my audio system in the past, the sound quality in these headset is excellent. I bought these as refurbished for $99.99 dollars with all the necessary accessories needed to set them up from out of the box to your TV. Just took a few minutes and test them with two episodes of Flash and I just fell in love with the sound quality. Now I'm going to fully recharge it since the batteries do not come fully charged. The good thing is once charged they last 24+ hours plus before you need to recharge them again. This are my first pair of wireless headset and since the recommendation from the reviews for Sennheiser is one of the most popular and reliable wireless headset. I can't wait to use them every night, believe me my wife loved them, after explaining to her what they can do, she said thank you Sennheiser. Its 1200 midnight on 11/1/2016 and my wife has not gotten up once. She is happily sleeping without any interruption of no TV noise.

    ","Great sound. Nice padding. The only thing I don't like is more of a personal preference. I don't like how tightly they fit my head. It creates an almost airtight seal. It turns my head into a bass tube. I use these for watching TV while I eat. Not only do I get great sound from the TV, but also a greatly amplified internal crunching from the corn chips I'm chewing. The padding makes these really comfortable to wear, but after a few hours of watching I find I need a break from squeezing my head. I just wish there was a way to adjust this so people who like the tight fit can have it, but others who don't like that so much don't have to have it.

    ","Good headphones.  My old sennheisers plugged into my satellite box with an RCA cable.  These went right into my Sony TV with the supplied optical cable. Easy peasy.  The volume control on the phones is not well designed.  You have to teach yourself to deal with it.  Very far from instinctive.  The phones are pretty heavy and a bit too confining.  They are not uncomfortable but they just 'bury' your ears inside the foam padding.  The sound is great.  I'm quite hearing impaired and can't get a lot of the dialog on TV programs without headphones.  These do the trick.  Can't say about the simulated surround sound.  Don't use it.Couple Months in:  The plastic below the actual ear muffs is coming apart.  I'm handling them gingerly but it won't last another year I'm sure.  Screw it.  I'll rebuild the ear muffs.  The hard plastic cover that twists off to get to the battery is solid.  I'll just jury rig new padding that will not be as confining anyway as the originals.  Still,  this is a shame.

    ","From my initial experience with these, they are absolutely phenomenal! The sound is crystal clear, and the bass is impressive, with 2 options to choose from; great bass, or extreme bass! The surround sound is a cool added bonus too, with two levels to choose from.Now the issues... First of all, I just want to say, the setup was super simple and awesome. I used the Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable that was included in the box and connected it directly from my TV's Digital Optical Audio out to the Sennheiser dock for the best audio connection possible. I completed the setup process as per the quick start manual, and let it charge for half a day before trying them out. They worked great, and the sound exceeded all my expectations.Where the problem started was if I accidentally pushed the power button (while powered on) or even intentionally pushed it, like a typical button instead of holding it in to power it off, the audio would disappear yet the device would remain powered on. I know the manual says to hold it in for several seconds to power on or off, but sometimes you might accidentally push it, like when adjusting them on your head, or even when getting used to how they operate you might inadvertently push the button to power it off only to remember you must hold it in... I first thought that maybe it was a cool additional feature to mute the audio without powering them off, but pushing the button again did not bring the audio back, in fact no button would bring the audio back. The first time this happened I simply powered them off completely and then back on and I was good to go. However, twice since then I have accidentally pushed the button and lost audio, and powering it off and on wouldn't even bring it back. With my luck, this would usually happen just as I was beginning a movie or TV episode, and I was unable to get audio back for the duration of that use, having to resort to using my Bose sound system and watch the volume carefully.Each time I've encountered this issue I have ended up leaving the headset powered off on the charging dock, and the next day when I went to use them they worked just fine. I read completely through the operation manual several times trying to find anything on whether it was a mute function or used as something different aside from powering on or off, and I found absolutely nothing! In fact there was there was very little to practically nothing in all the papers included in the box on the operation of the device aside from how to set up the dock and connect to your TV, and insert the batteries in the headset and power it on. I figure they assume everything else is straight forward when it comes to buttons; bass, surround sound, and volume control. That being said, I would assume that the power button would be the same, not finding anything to say otherwise, its sole purpose is to power the headset on or off.I don't know why I have this problem, but I'm quite sure it isn't a dead battery because they are brand new, and two of the times it has happened I had just pulled them off of the charging dock with the green light indicating they were fully charged, and these are supposed to have quite an impressive battery life that I probably could never completely drain in a single day.. Other uses that I didn't bump the button or run into this problem, I would use them for up to six continuous hours, ruling out the battery as being the problem. All I can figure is that it could be a faulty pair??Aside from this one issue, if I am careful to not push the button until I am done using them for that setting, then I don't have any problems... And as I mentioned before, the sound is awesome!I have not yet reached out to Sennheiser for support, but I intend to when I get around to it. For now, this has been my experience with these, and I do intend to update my review if and when I resolve this problem.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely amazing sound, with some interesting glitches that I haven't figured out yet!"

29,"on March 17, 2018",,"Excellent headphones, if you have an optical digital (toslink) input on your TV or the intended connection device. First off, these 175s work great when connected to an optical digital device like a high end HDTV. The sound is crisp and clear, the surround sound at all 3 levels is superb and the extra bass boost is awesome. It creates a new experience as I heard sounds, mostly background sounds, that I never heard before. Movies like Alien, Event Horizon, Leviathan, Friday the 13th and Halloween really come alive. The experience is overwhelming.If you plan on using these with the analog input, the sound suffers due to the inadequacy of the drivers. For me, sound ducks under - meaning the device automatically turns the volume down when it receives a sound it thinks is too loud such as an explosion or gun shot in a movie. After that, it's hard to hear much of anything. With a few consecutive explosions it will continue to duck under until I only hear a faint whisper.I bought these with the intention of proofing recordings. The fit is good for over the ear and the quality is fantastic. For the most part they works, but keeps ducking under. To correct this, I have to turn them off and than back on. It has gotten to the point where I find them hard to use, but can live with it. I keep the volume low and that seems to help, but if a cymbal or bass kick is a tad too loud - it ducks under. Since I was not able to find a solution to this problem, I now just mostly use them for TV and practicing on my guitar. It still ducks under now and then, but I hope to find a solution as the sound the produce is incredible.I do like the Digital/Analog switch on the back. I can keep my TV and Guitar amp both hooked up all the time. No need to fiddle with any wires. With a simple flip of the switch, I can watch the latest horror flick or play my guitar - all with disturbing others. I also like that I can control the volume, surround sound and bass from either the base unit or the head phones. When proofing recordings I don't use any surround sound, but I noticed if I go from normal mode to SURR2 it sounds really close to what I would expect from a mastered recording. They really work great for proofing, I just hope I can find a solution to my problem.All in all, these are great if you have a digital input, but the analog needs some work. The sound is exhilarating - just ask my friend George.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Digital Input, So-So Analog Input..."

    ","Update: 3/25/2018. I believe long term reviews can be a great help to people, this is about a year and a half later. I have had zero issues with the headphones since my purchase. The only thing I changed was the batteries, I put a different brand (energizer) for the rechargeables. No issues with build quality at all, sound is still great and they're still  comfortable to this day.First, I'm impressed with the range. Have a somewhat large apartment and no issues with it in any room. Actually makes cleaning less of a chore as I can just wear this and listen to the news or music if I connect the stand to my phone.COMFORT. Very comfortable, but may feel weird to you at first. Give it a couple days. I have a big head and the clamping on my head isn't bad at all for me personally (I wear a Large/XL Bern helmet when snowboarding) it's a non issue. The earcups are quite large which I like. No part of my ear touches the sides of the earcups. Sure the leatherette gets somewhat warm but I've worn these for 6 hours straight without a problem. If they get too warm for you there's also the velour pads that you can buy here on Amazon but they'll likely isolate sound a little less.DESIGN: A little bulky but not a problem as you won't be going out and about with this like you would regular headphones. If you're just wearing them in the apartment or house, who cares what you look like. The packaging was somewhat comical. Box within a box within a plastic box (then little plastic bags in the box) but they arrived undamaged which was the important part. No big deal.SETUP: Extremely easy. I don't think I can post the link but search on Youtube for Sennheiser RS 175 and there's a setup guide that's clear and easy to understand. Batteries are included but will need charged. Charging time is no issue, I put them on the charger when I go to bed and by morning they're ready to go.SOUND: Very clear, very clean sound. The bass boost isn't overpowering at all. The surround sound option is obviously not a true surround, as in having speakers set up in certain areas of your living room but it's not bad for a set of headphones. I think it's going to be personal preference if you want the surround on or not but personally I also keep the bass boost on as well as it gives more of a movie feel to the sound.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Details inside!

    ","The headphone is a great for watching movies, music, videos, and for walking around the house without worrying about cables.The main problem with these headphones is that if you have it near a router or anything that might disrupt the signal, whatever you are listening to will cut off regularly. This is the only thing. Since i have everyone on one desk, i had to figure out a way to keep the base away from my router. The sound quality is awesome —give or take the little surround sound features and the bass boost that are a little gimmicky—and the comfort is good—although like many closed back headphones, it can get very hot after long periods of use.Overall, make sure you put the base away from your router or your experience will suck.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Address the connection warnings and you will love these

    ","The range is stated to be up to 100 meters but walls and floors reduce that significantly. To get a very rough idea of the range to expect in a typical wood frame house I’ve come up with the following guide; heavy metal objects such as boilers in line of sight reduce the range even further:Same floor- range is three rooms away or about 20 meters (60 feet)One floor above/below- range is two rooms away from the room directly under the transmitter, or about 10 meters (30 feet)Through one exterior wall- range is about 45 feet (15 meters) facing away from the transmitter, 30 feet (10 meters) when facing it.Your range will vary from mine based on many factors.I have not found the “surround sound” settings helpful but sometimes the Bass boost is nice to use, and the on headset volume controls are wonderful!A few words about digital wireless audio: there isn’t any static or fading of volume over distance so you won’t constantly have to adjust volume as you change distance from the transmitter. The down side is either you get a good static free signal or nothing, as the unit goes in and out of range suddenly and without any clicks or hiss.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Usable Range Estimate

    ","Had a really old version of from Sennheiser that worked for 12 years.  Had hard time trying to pick a replacement.  Treated myself to these as a Christmas gift. Worked great for the first 45 days now there is an issue with the included batteries draining really fast.  I removed and charge in a regular battery charger.  Reinstalled and it drained again in about an hour.  Replaced factory batteries with new Energizer rechargeable batteries.  Same results.  Something has changed to cause the batteries to drain at a much higher rate.  For the first month the battery life was impressive, and never had an issue with running out even after 5 hours of use.  Also when you place it back onto the cradle to charge the Red light never goes to Green to indicate that it is charged.  The light stays Red even when the other battery charger thinks they have a full charge.  Use the charger and batteries for other devices with no issues.  So my choice is to go thru the issues with Warranty Work, or switch to regular batteries to try and bypass the issue.  I expected more from this manufacture.  The $180 I paid is not super expensive, but not inexpensive either.Contacted the Manufacture via their website.  I was issued a prepaid return label for replacement within a day or two.  Somewhat new replacement arrived about 5 days later.  That was 2 weeks ago and new unit is fine.  Time will tell.

    ","I have had these headphones for about nine months now, and use them daily.  I bought them to hear the TV set better.  The new wide screen tvs have terrible sound systems.  I bought a set of external speakers for the tv, and it only helped a little.  These have helped a lot.  I debated and debated on which set to buy.  I read everything I could find, and it boiled down to two brands, Sennheiser being one of them.  I couldn't decide on which pair to buy.  I think for hearing problems the most expensive set is the best, but I didn't want to spend that much.  Most of the sound options on these different sets improve bass quality, which doesn't help for hearing loss.  I rarely use the sound effects on these.  I rely on the good sound that they produce.  With good clear sound I can understand much better what is being said on the tv programs.  If the sound is bad.  The characters are speaking in a heavy accent, there is a bunch of back ground music nothing is going to help.  There is absolutely no static, distortion, or weak signal with these.  Just good sound.  I do use the sound effects with a roaring action movie with lots of music, but that is all.  These are not a cure all if you have hearing loss, but they do help a lot.  TV shows that I have had trouble with in the past understanding what they say are now enjoyable.  A big plus with these are watching TV while my wife is asleep.  I can watch in the middle of the night without disturbing her.  The buttons are no problem either.  Once you get used to them they are easy to use while the headset is on your head.  The batteries last a long time.  I have only drained them once in a two day TV watching binge without charging them.  The only thing that I would change is the two second  hold time on the on off button.  The only additional thing that I would want is a separate charging base that I could put next to my chair, so I wouldn't have to get up to get them.  It took me awhile to decide if I wanted to spend $180.00 for a set of head phones, but I am glad that I did.  I would hate to do without these now.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Helped with hearing loss

    ","Let's just cut to the chase; these things sound GREAT.  If you love bass, this will not disappoint.  The bass boost feature is actually quite good and does not create the feeling of an ""artificial"" bass.  Certainly, there is a DSP playing around here, but it sounds quite good; the bass rumbles, has good frequency range, is not muddy, and does not distort the other frequencies.  This is PERFECT for a movie theater type sound.The low surround sound feature is OK, it gives a bit more spacing and soundstage at the cost of some ""aggressive"" mid-rooted aspects of the sound.  The bass response (bass boost on) is still quite good with the low surround setting, although the high setting sounds overly reverberated and likely will never be used by anyone, ever.If you also want to listen to music, it sounds VERY GOOD.

I’m constantly backing up movies without the headphones, because even though I have the volume up loud, I can’t hear everything they say, especially if the movie has music in the background. With the headphones, that isn’t a problem.  I can hear everything perfectly, even with music, and I don’t have to have the tv volume up loud, which my wife appreciates.  Comfort-wise I would give these only 4 stars, but the quality of the sound more than makes up for the slight discomfort so I definitely give these a 5.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Greatly improves quality of listening.

It is over the ear and fits comfortably snug. He doesn't give compliments very often but loved this a lot better and said it was great. He is hard of hearing so a huge pro for him. Con is that since it's over the ear, he can not hear my mom whatsoever. She has to get his attention visually now. I guess a con for her and maybe a pro for him? Ha.

    ","To keep this simple, the Sennheiser RS 175 wireless headphone system is great and works as advertised…when it syncs with whatever device you are connecting it to.My advice before purchasing this system, especially if your device options are limited, is to make certain your technology’s audio system outputs in a “language” (my word) the Sennheiser system understands. If it doesn’t, Sennheiser tech support suggests you may need to purchase a “translator” device (also my word) to resolve the “language” problem.I initially connected my RS 175 system to a two-year-old Panasonic television. After trying each of the television’s various audio settings I was still unable to make the headphones work in either digital or analog mode. To fast forward a bit, I then connected the RS 175 to a one-year-old Vizio smart TV that was in another room and it worked fine. I may have missed this potential connection issue in Amazon’s Sennheiser RS 175 overview…if so, my bad…but it would have saved me a few hours’ time and anguish had I known this system isn’t always plug and play.Lastly, I purchased my RS 175 system because I often have difficulty understanding the dialog when watching television. I hear the voices but sometimes have a problem determining what is being said. The Sennheiser RS 175 headphone system has eliminated this problem, and the digital wireless audio transmission is excellent throughout my house.  I’d buy it again.",4.0 out of 5 stars,the Sennheiser RS 175 wireless headphone system is great and works as advertised…when it syncs with whatever device ...

96,"on September 29, 2016",,"I am generally quite pleased with these head phones. The sound quality is very good. I tried out the surround sound and bass boost features but decided they didn't really add much, so I only use the basic sound that comes out of the phones. I originally had a bit of difficulty replacing the ear pieces after inserting the batteries....because I was trying to put the left piece on the right side and the right one on the left side! You do have to be careful to match them up correctly in terms of left and right! As far as comfort, the first few days, the head phones felt a bit uncomfortably tight, but they have loosened up enough so I now find them comfortable.The only negative comment I have is that you have to jiggle the phones and move them about somewhat when you put them back on the charging unit before you see the red charging light come on.It's a minor annoyance as I normally get them to start charging after a couple of tries. I think the charging design could be improved so you could put them on the charger just once and the charging light would come on immediately.",5.0 out of 5 stars,good head phones

I never forget to charge them because of the stellar design.Wireless range is decent. I can walk a room or two away before it cuts out.Sound quality is okay I guess -- they're better than my old $20 pair, but they don't sound like $200 headphones. I'm not an audio person though, so maybe I just don't know what good headphones sound like.Build quality is pretty bad IMO. The design of the headphone supports rotating the ear cups, but only ~5 degrees -- this could have been improved so that I could turn the cups 90 degrees to make it easier to rest around my neck, but it wasn't. The plastic on the outer face of the cups feels super cheap. The ear pads feel really flimsy and cheap as well. If someone showed me a pair of these, I wouldn't think they were worth $200.4/5 because even though build quality is poor and sound quality is meh, the charging design is amazing and makes up for those somewhat.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Designed so you can't forget to charge

    ","The surround sound being unbeatable is the best I can say about these headphones. Hooking them up was difficult and Sennheiser's customer service couldn't help.

Just before I was about to send them back I figured out how to hook them up with the help of an online help site.

104,"on September 27, 2016",,"These headphones were much better than I expected. With the faux surround-sound you really will forget you're wearing a headset at all after a few minutes. Bass is pretty good and the blocking of external noise is excellent. I live in a condo, so when the furnace kicks on it can really sound like a jet engine in my living room. With these headphones on, I can't even hear it... I'll pull them off my head and realize the furnace is blasting and I had no idea.The only cons are that I don't think it blocks noise from escaping the headphones as well as I would like. If you keep it at a pretty good volume, people will be able to hear it without trouble. It might even disturb someone else in the room if they are easily annoyed. The second con is that they hurt my neck after about an hour of use. They feel fairly light in the hand, but I guess the extra weight on my head really has a greater effect on my neck than I would have expected. Be sure to try to support your head if you're going to use them for extended periods or take breaks if you can. Lastly, they make your ears sweaty... they is really no two ways about this... if you wear the for extended periods expect to have very sweaty ears when you take them off.Otherwise, they were well worth the money and I'd consider purchasing a second pair.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones

    ","Maybe I didn't read the product information well enough, but I didn't realize these headphones work in the same frequency range as my WiFi router, 2.4 GHz. I wouldn't have purchased this model if I realized that because l use a Nighthawk gaming router and it's got a nice strong signal. My concer would have been justified because the router does interfere with the headphone signal and the sound drops out every few seconds making them unusable.I emailed Sennheiser and they recommended this solution, from their web site: https://sennheiserusa.happyfox.com/kb/article/219-what-do-i-do-when-there-is-wireless-signal-or-wifi-interference . That did confirm 100% that my router is the problem. As long as the router is off, the headphones work beautifully and the surround sound was particularly nice.Unfortunately, the recommended solution didn't work for me. The router and headphones are about 8 feet apart and I don't have any options for relocating them that would give me more than another three or four feet of separation. The bottom line for me is I have to choose between my router and these headphones, so the headphones are getting returned.Please note that I do have another set of Sennheiser HDR 120 headphones that work perfectly. They don't use the same frequency range and I was hoping to upgrade them with these RS 175's. The 120s are several years old and still going strong so I just went back to using them.I gave these RS 175 headphones a 2 star rating because they simply can't be used in my WiFi environment. Given how common wireless routers are, I think that's a big drawback. If it wasn't for that problem, I'd have rated them 5 stars.

    ","I never use that word but it applies (so far) here.I've been experimenting with these headphones and and used them, so far, in two ways:1) I connected the Digital optical out from my Sony Smart TV to the digital optical in on the headset base.  This makes it possible to hear the TV, without bothering others, anywhere in the house and about 50' out in my backyard.  I can also listen to Pandora or Slacker (from the smart TV app) but sound quality from those two sources is pretty muddy .  This is a limitation of the source not the headset.  I believe, to conserve bandwidth, quality from most streaming sources is similarly reduced.Here is how I know this muddiness from streaming sources is not the headphones:2) I used an external DAC (Fiio) and took digital optical out from my Macbook to the DAC and then the Analog out of the DAC into the headset base.  Playing High res FLAC files on the VLC player is the best sound source I can currently produce and the sound is really wonderful on the headset.  I'm not enough of an audiophile to impress you with jargon but I can hear lots of detail, depth, and definition.  I only have about 10 hours on the headset so far and I'm told a ""break in"" period of 40 hours or so will improve them further.  This experiment bypasses the DAC which must be built in to the headset base (else you couldn't put digital in) so I still need to get the necessary pieces parts to put digital directly in to the headset base from the MAC.I think most of what sells headphones these days is boosting the base for lots of that BOOM THUMP thing.  These have a bass boost button if that is your thing but I don't really like it.  The surround button add artificial delays to simulate the little echos we don't really notice when listening in, say, an empty room.  I'm not sure I like it but you have three levels to choose from.Comfort:  The ear boxes on these headphones are big enough for my big floppy ears so they don't bother me in that way but they are a bit tight.  I'd expect they'll loosen up a bit with time but I don't really want them too loose as I intend to be fairly active while using them and don't want them to fall off.In any case these things are terrific.  I'd tried a number of very expensive wireless headsets and come to the conclusion the technology just wasn't ""there"" yet but these prove me wrong.All that's left now is to test their quality using a digital source in (hoping the built in DAC is as good as the other components) and, of course at this price, that they don't fail or the quality doesn't fade.I will definitely update this review when I've got more time on them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,So Far I am STOKED!

One click minus and too soft, one click plus and too loud. This varies quite a bit with which surround mode you select. Regarding the surround modes and bass boost; I partially agree with the reviewers who say these are useless features. On new sound sources with high quality 5.1 sound these modes are detractors. But on old stuff, old movies, and especially old music videos, these modes are really great. You can make the old stuff sound a lot more full and open up the sound stage.

The band is very ""loose"" and breaks in quickly to adjust for head sizes. Weight is less than heavy,  I'd say they're medium, but definitely not light. Previous RS 170 model was actually light, these aren't.2. VOLUME - YEEES, max volume here is blasting, to the point of being painful. The volume buttons on the right headphone are easily located by touch, they have little ridges on them. Bass and Surround buttons on the headphones themselves are pretty useless, and do sometimes get in the way, when trying to change volume. They should definitely get rid of them in the next iteration.3. The base station has dim lights and nothing is blinking, so it's just nicey barely visible solid green lights that don't bother or annoy. Station looks pretty and modern too, totally in the right place on your desktop or shelve.4. Input switch located on the back is just awesome. Simple little tumbler, nothing silly-fancy like the 10 step process on SteelSeries H.5. Sound quality is superb. Added bass option is also great, I am running it ""On"" right now, but I do turn it off sometimes, if I feel like it.

197,"on October 25, 2016",,"I have had these headphones for about 3 months now and I use them everyday. I absolutely live these headphones. They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time, I have them hooked to my tv and my computer so I tend to wear them for extended periods of time. I'm no audiophile so I can't speak to sound compared to other headphones. However compared to any other over the ear headphones I have had before the bass is much better but not overpowering and they sound good for games music and much more. They have virtual surround sound which I do not use much as I think it sounds a little funky in some situations. Other than that I can totally recommend these headphones 10/10 times!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best headphones I have had yet!

    ","The sound quality is amazing,  whether I'm watching a movie, playing a game, or listening to music. The bass boost is epic, and the digital surround sound is top notch. I've never had the battery die out on me, it's super easy to keep it charged, and I can wear it around the house without worrying too much about the signal dropping. Honestly the only thing that I can say against it is that despite some really good padding it squeezes the heck out of your head and is a hit heavy, so if comfort is a major concern for you you might want to think twice before buying.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Truly Excellent

    ","I have  been using the RS140 over ear and my wife the RS120 on ear headsets. The missus complained about ambient noise and wanted RS140s like mine, but they don't make them anymore. Even though the 140s keep out much ambient noise, mine were sounding quite muddy. I also wear hearing aids under the ear cushions which helps a bit, Even with that setup I have a hard time with the dialogue. Seems like they are always mumbling.So I was hunting for some over ear headsets for the wife and came upon these. I would guess the RS170s are much the same, except they have no digital optical. I opted for these RS175s so I could go with digital sound vs. analogue. I received the phones yesterday (I purchased the extra phone for myself). Swapped the batteries from the old headsets as they were charged up and ready to go. Easy to hook up, just plug in the optical cord and turn everything on.I was shocked, shocked I say with the fidelity of these headsets. I could understand every word of the programs we were watching. And that's with no hearing aids :o)Pros;AAA batteries are easy to replace and can be supplemented by standard batteries if the rechargeable batteries go dead.Headsets are quite comfortable, but of course there is always a bit of body heat built up inside the ear cushions over time.Volume and special effects are easy to control with fairly large buttons on the headset.Sound is crisp and clear, even if the bass is pumped up - 3 choices on the bass.This is a very handsome piece of gear.Cons:My major beef is that even though the base unit will work with two (max) headsets, I can only charge one at a time and according to the manual, it takes 8 hours for a full charge. I purchased the HDR175 (headset only) so we could both enjoy this upgrade. Sennheiser does not make a charge only cradle for this additional headset so I have to remember to switch headsets on the cradle for charging. I can also remove the batteries and place them in my old headset for a recharge. Since the main reason, as I see it, for purchasing an additional headset is so that two people can use this at the same time, doesn't it make sense to make available a charger for the second headset? Maybe even include one with the headset.  I give them two lousy little measly stars on this issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wowee! With Some Reservations

    ","Pros:============+ They sound decent, which of course is the most important thing.+ They seem to run a long time on a charge; I use them a lot and they get thru the day fine, then recharge overnight.+ Batteries are easily replaceable, so when they die, the headphones don't become useless junk. HUGE plus here. I hate planned / careless obsolescence, as we see in typical smartphones with their [self-censored] non-replaceable batteries.+ They're comfortable. A little heavy, batteries and all that, but I don't mind the weight.+ The range is outstanding. No noise.+ Good looking setup.Cons:============- There's some kind of automatic volume compensation going on. I have music set up to be quiet, kind of as a background. I set the volume on the phones where I want it. Then, the computer announces something to me at normal volume, which is a good bit louder than the music, which is exactly what I want and intended. But the headphones DROP the volume so that the announcement is at the volume I set the music to, and then when the announcement is over, the music is WAY too quiet. This is [self-censored] annoying as [self-censored]. I took two stars off for this.- The initial charge time is also annoying, but it's only once, so I can grin and bear it on that one, no points off, but hey. Definitely annoying once. You just bought them, you'd like to use them. Can't really do that, according to the docs, or you compromise the battery life. They'll be sitting on the stand for the first day you own them.- Turning them on requires holding the power switch on the headphones for a while. I don't see why. It's a minor nit, no points off, but... I just don't see why. It's a pretty positive switch: I should be able to press it, and it should just work.- A little bit of background hiss. I could do without this, but it's only obvious when there is no audio coming through. So... meh.Don't cares:============?

    ","I bought these to replace a set of Sony MDR-HW700DS wireless surround sound headphones that started cutting out frequently, and then failed altogether. Unlike the RS 175 RF, the Sony model had true surround sound decoding and used psychological acoustics to create a surprisingly realistic surround sound experience. They were substantially more comfortable to wear with much thicker ear cups, and they used lithium ion batteries, which are lighter in weight and have no memory efffect. On the other hand, they listed for $400 with a street cost of $300, had a more limited range than the RS 175 RF and they cut out quite often, just from turning your head. Unfortunately Sony has done little to address their problems and their current offerings are mostly available only as Japanese imports. That is why I decided to switch to Sennheiser.The Sennheiser RS 175 RF is an excellent product, but when compared to the more expensive Sony's the differences are evident. For one thing, Sennheiser only offers simulated surround sound, which is not the same thing. With the Sony's, if a sound came from behind you, it really sounded like it was coming from behind you. That's the advantage of a true surround sound decoder. With the Senn's, even if you use the optical digital input, it will not accept a 5.1 surround sound signal. You have to set the output of your TV or video receiver to output stereo PCM for the Senn's to work. The Senn's use NiMH batteries, which have a memory effect, and then compound the problem with a charging stand that is guaranteed to make it worse if used as intended. The one saving grace is that the batteries are NiMH AAA batteries, making it easy and inexpensive to replace them, or to substitute alkaline batteries in a pinch. The ear cups are rather thin and uncomfortable with prolonged use.I would have paid more for a more premium product, but this is the best wireless headphone series that Sennheiser has to offer. Of course Sennheiser also offers the RS 185 RF, intended more for listening to music, and the RS 195 RF, which has multiple signal conditioning options, but even as expensive as the 195s are, they do not offer any surround sound options, they still use NiMH batteries, and they still use the same uncomfortable ear cups. Sennheiser also offers the Momentum 2 Wireless bluetooth headphones, which I own as well, and although they are a hundred time more comfortable to wear and use lithium ion batteries, the sound isn't as good, even with low latency AptX encoding. The Momentums may be the best bluetooth headphones out there in multiple reviews, and they do have active noise cancellation, but in direct side-by-side comparisons, there is no comparison. The RS 175 RFs sound like wired headphones. The only way the Momentums best the RS 175 RFs is when using a wired connection, which is why I'm keeping the 175s.In terms of range, the RS 175 RFs are a bit disappointing. I can get only perhaps 10% farther than I do with a bluetooth connection, but then I live in a large NYC apartment building with more than 20 WiFi networks in range. Overall, the Sennheiser RS 175 RF is an excellent wireless headphone system, but it's not outstanding. I would gladly pay more for a premium model with true surround sound decoding and a headphone more in line with the Momentum line, with lithium batteries, plush ear cups and better sound quality.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent and perhaps the best wireless headphones for cinema, but could have been so much better"

Sure, much more costly than the Sennheiser 120's, but from the first minute with the Sennheiser RS 175's I could tell it was worth every penny. As with the 120's, I could hear what people were saying, but I had no idea that I was missing so much richness in background audio. It is a delight to hear sound in depth, not just surround sound, but real depth.My general setting so far is no bass and no surround. With movies I've been kicking in the surround on the lower setting, maybe some bass, usually not. These are digital so I'm not worried about the tuning wheel or volume wheel wearing out as they did on the Sennheiser 120's, 'cause the 175's don't have wheels but button areas that you press.My recommendation -- While I have no experience or expertise in headsets, my suggestion is that if you're HOH or aging and starting to lose the edge in what people are saying on TV, instead of kicking the TV volume up, invest in a pair of these RS 175's and give yourself a rare treat.By the way... my hearing aids were $6,000. The Sennheiser RS 175's with tax were about $300.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Audio Challenged? These are an outstanding value for the Hard of Hearing

    ","This is my second review of the Sennheiser RS 175 wireless headphones. A previous review gave them 2 Stars, primarily due to poor product support. This time around, they get a 5 STAR rating. The sound quality is just great, especially for movies where the dialogue may be difficult to hear. For those who are hearing impaired, these headphones are a superb solution.I must say, however, that getting them set up can be a challenge if you have a sound system, or even a smart TV. The use of the optical connection is simple, but you next have to adjust the ""sound settings"" in your menu devoted to ""Sound."" I actually had to make two adjustments to move from ""Bit Rate"" to ""PCM"" on my system. Then, make sure that your ""TV Speakers"" are turned to ""on.""I ordered the accessory headphone set for my wife. It is a duplicate of the original RS 175 headphone set in all respects. The Sennheiser transmitter supports and will handle 2 headset without loss of signal or sound quality to either head set.I recommend this product without reservation, especially for those who are able to adjust their TV sound settings without getting lost.

    ","Since these headphones were a significant cost, I spent a lot of time researching, reading reviews, and trying to figure out if they were going to work for my needs before purchasing them. Unfortunately, when they arrived they wouldn’t work no matter what I did. Maybe with a different system than I have they would be fine, but the online tutorial was useless because I was trying to hook it up to a receiver instead of a television and I couldn’t make them work. My tech  savvy son-in-law and my tech savvy son and two other tech savvy guys I know all tried to get them to work, but it just wasn’t going to happen, so I sent them back. On the positive side, I was allowed a few weeks to try them out which I spent entirely on trying to make them work, and I received a 100% refund when I returned them. That was really great to have the opportunity to try them and still get my money back.

    ","I spend a lot of time in ""my man cave"" working with woodworking machinery.I needed something to enjoy listening to my big screen TV/radio which would be drowned out when the furnace kicked on or the well pump was running or running my saw and other equipment.I also needed some hearing protection when running machinery, if not as good as my normal ear protection then at least some kind of protection. Note that these are not advertised nor any claims made for decibel reduction or hearing protection but they seem to work that way.Also i was annoying my wife when i put the TV on a high volume and blasted the upstairs, then in order to stop annoying anyone i would have to stop what i was doing to turn the volume down when the noise stoped or a commercial came on.The hardest part was waiting to use these as they charged up for 16 hours. So the first thing you should do is plug them in to charge.The sound was better than the TV alone, you can adjust bass and treble. Plus once you set it, it remembers what the settings were. I had the volume down low and when the furnace kicked on i could hear just fine even standing next to the noise. I got a break as these were ""open box"" and the only thing missing were the instructions. Those were found quite easily on the web.I have a full acre lot and i walked some distance away from the house to see how far i could get and still have reception.I got about 150 feet and they cut out, keep in mind the doors and windows were shut as its winter! i have a feeling that if i had the window open i would be able to listen to music while mowing the lawn. The headset was good quality, if you take reasonable care of these they should last, some people are rougher on equipment than others but i tend to be careful with my stuff.Overall I'm quite pleased with this purchase, they do everything i wanted them to do. One con is the control buttons, I'm not agile enough to tell what the buttons are without taking them off and looking at the headset.  Also a mute button would be handy for the commercials or if someone wanted to talk to you. I think a solution would be to purchase those sticky backed rubber bumpers that go on kitchen doors. You could stick one on the plus and minus volume buttons and then be able to feel them without looking.They were easy to set up with my newer Samsung TV. I didn't know you had to peel the plastic knobs off that protect the ends of the optical cable so that baffled me for a little bit. This only shows my lack of technical knowledge yet i bumbled my way through in short order and got them working.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for me!

    ","This will be the second poor review of the Sennheiser brand from me and I am loath to give it. Besides the name being just damn cool, Sennheiser was a company I had always been able to rely on for a sound like no other. Now they are apparently attempting a new way to deliver on the Sennheiser promise. The sound promoted from This RS 175 is nearly Sennheiser studio sound - not audiophile. They still sound good. They pushed an audibly different sound than my last sets of Sennheiser phones however. I still have the last iterations (both wired and wireless) and during several side by side comparisons, the RS 175 are far more main stream sounding than previous generations and delivered a feeling of being boxed in. Thankfully my theater pre-amp has Dolby headphone which is pristine and opens up any set of headphones. The previous versions of Sennheiser’s wireless headphones from the 165 and up were soft, controlled and accurate sounding with emphasis on breath and openness. No, the last iteration could not handle wide variations of bass, nor were they loud, but they sounded beautifully, and light as air when compared to the likes of - well - anything else wireless really. These new phones do not give that open sense without help.Considering they are wireless phones, they have a much wider volume span than in days of yore, heading north of comfortable if need be. They also handled harder base notes with more consideration and power, which I admit was a welcome change from previous releases. Turning on the incorporated bass management however, sent them into kiddie-boom mudslinging territory during the last TRON movie and added hard hoofing to anything already booming. It added artificial mass to voices during SVU streamed and The Walking Dead that were already deep... I have no want of such things so I keep it deactivated.The RS-175, does not decode surround of any kind so any optical data sent to this unit must be two channel audio which brings us to my next gotcha. This unit is supposed to be a surround headphone to use during movies and video etc. so why not down mix a surround signal to two channel? Who uses non surround fiber channel during surround? What fiction is Sennheiser trying to sell here? I could not even pass two channel decoded Dolby to the unit; instead running the headphone out to the analog in. I have yet to get ANY optical signal to work with this unit encoded or not. Instead It has two settings for surround built in which are unrelated to Dolby or DTS; One was a kind of light hall surround and the next was an expansive hall echo-chamber sound. Luckily for me again, I have Dolby Headphone surround from my pre-amp which is quite superior to the effect invoked on these phones. I leave the effect from the RS 175 off.Above all of that nonsense is the following notable extreme problem: THEY ARE NOT COMFORTABLE... These phones are too tight against my head and unrelenting with metal bands in either side adjuster. They will not be breaking in to fit a noggin any time soon. For that much money I expected them to fit securely but lightly and softly on my head as so many other versions have. The ear pads themselves are soft and forgiving but the pressure reminds me of their newer HD 380 Pro which is so tight I can only use them for skirmishes with sound recording after which I must take a break. These are almost that snug - ouch. I HAVE A MEDIUM-HAT CRANIUM. I wear a medium helmet from most brands of motorcycle helmets. My hats are medium and I adjust them down (tighten). My ears do fit within these headphones so that is a plus - I have medium ears which do not protrude from my head very far. Most brands of over ear/Circumpolar units fit around my ears. I usually only worry about the depth of the ear cups, these have enough clearance to not rest on my outer ear.To wrap this up, I think it might be worth it to hang on to them for a week but I will most likely be sending them back as unwearable for an entire movie. The sound is not advanced enough to demand such a price and certainly the lack of comfort dismisses the price as well.A pose to Sennheiser: ruining a great name is easy; making money is easy. Delivering on a promise clearly makes you queasy.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Go ahead Sennheiser - keep screwing with your sound and comfort.

    ","At first I was hesitant to put this much money into headphones, but they have proven to be worth it.I was surprised at the sound isolation they provide. Dishes are getting done, kids are getting yelled at, etc... I'm oblivious to it all.These will never match a true surround sound system with external subwoofer, but I've been impressed with what they do offer. You definitely get the bass coming through, and just yesterday I was watching a show and heard a sound coming somewhat from behind me. This was actually unexpected because I was not expecting ANY surround sound.I've used these for about 2 months now, usually when I want to watch TV after my wife is sleeping in the next room. They are big enough to fit over my ears and not cause any kind of discomfort from pinching. I've used these for hours at a time without issue. Sometimes I'll pause the TV for a bit to work on my laptop for a bit, and I don't even bother to take them off. If I want to watch a cnn video or something, I have to take them off so I can actually hear it (did I mention great sound isolation?).I don't always put them back on the base after watching TV.

    ","After opening the exotic packaging I was dismayed at the fragile feeling of the headphones and base station. I had a use outdoors, to monitor a live concert where the audience was positioned across a pond, 140 ft the stage. In the description the range was spec'd as 300 ft so it seemed there would be no problems. However, write ups, product descriptions and specs can, and often are misleading especially in consumer electronics. So I thought it best to test, before deploying in a critical use. I set the station up atop my mail box with an mp3 player, on a clear sunny day and walked down the paved roadway, which curved conveniently to ensure a perfect line of sight view from transmitter to headphones. Alas, I only on got 130 ft before the first drop out and by 150 ft the signal was gone completely. Measurements were made line of sight with laser tape measure accurate to a couple of inches. In doors I notice the range was much less only going thru a couple of walls. Sound quality was good and they could get plenty loud, but the lack of robustness in the construction would not support rigors of out door festivals. Better to stick with Sennheiser's pro-line of wireless IEM.",1.0 out of 5 stars,You might get a range 300 feet on the moon.

Even if you have a new new TV you will want to get the converter. While it says it fits all digital TV's it does not.  This isn't their fault its due to so many different brands of TVs on the market. We all have recent TVs within the last 2 years since being purchased and the digital cord either didn't work or didn't fit.

491,"on July 19, 2016",,"Pros:Very convenient when watching movies or listening to music while walking around. Great audio quality, headphones are comfortable and do not put any pressure on the ears, so I can wear them for much longer than smaller on-ear ones. This model is closed, so it does not leak audio out -- not very important for me when I use them at home, but may be useful for some.Input switching is useful for my combination of computer output (SPDIF) and an audio system (analog jack), so I actually use it.There seem to be no problems with radio reception within range, and I have not yet got to the point when it ran out of battery.Cons:The ear pads are covered with thin synthetic leather, what is probably more durable, but less comfortable than velour version for RS185 -- I ended up buying those pads and use them in place of the original ones. I did not need RS185 features, so buying RS175 headphones and RS185 pads was for me a superior (and still cheaper) choice than RS185. Some may find it the other way around.Input switching control is only available as a slide switch on the back of the transmitter -- it would be better if it could be accessible from the headphones themselves instead of sound controls that I don't find to be of much use.Battery indicator, on the other hand, is only visible on the headphones themselves when they are not being charged -- it is not reported to the indicator on the transmitter, even though audio options are. (Edit -- indicator on the headphones does not show the battery state, only headphones being on or off, what is also visible on the transmitter. The battery state is only visible when headphones are being charged on the transmitter).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones with some very minor flaws.

These replacement headphones are a huge step up in performance. I was very impressed with the sound – it is just crystal clear and sounds great for  a wireless system.

Just connect the base to an outlet, connect an analog or optical digital source, insert the rechargeable batteries in the ear pieces by removing the ear pads, and set the headphones on the base to charge. After an initial recommended 16 hour charge, they are ready to use.The volume controls are on the right ear piece as are a surround button and a bass boost button. I found that the surround and bass effects are subtle, which I think is a good idea. I probably will just leave both of them off, since the sound is so good without any alteration.

    ","I'm a bit of audiophile, but not so snobby as to need the $300+ set of cans to be happy and when i say i was surprised with the quality of these RF headsets, i mean it.  I have tried RF before....years before and found them often lacking in quality and hated the dreaded hiss that seemed all too common.  With that said, i became a strictly wired cans person, but i have a friend who owned a pair of 170's and, after trying them, i decided to give RF another chance.The 175's are truly impressive for their price point.  Clean design, comfortable to wear, and the sound stage is robust, even compared to a few of wired options.  The ear cups do get a bit warm, but that was to be expected.  I tested these with bass heavy music, classical, and a few movies and i can't say i was displeased at any point.So, if you're in the market for a reasonable set of cans, buy now.

    ","I needed headphones to use with my new killer 4k home theater system since I live in a condo with paper-thin walls and and only have time to watch TV late at night. I also run Spotify on my HTS more than I watch Tv.  I purchased the rs175 and rs185 and compared over a week. The 185 sound is far superior. I thought I needed the bass boost and virtual surround effects the 175 has for music and movies...so  I was reluctant to consider the 185's. Well there is a reason those features aren't on the 185's...You don't need them! The natural unprocessed sound of the 185's is really that much better! Even so I wish they had a little more bass, but the bass, mid-tones, and highs ""as is"" are very rich, clear, and well balanced. The 175's sound was flat...and the bass was muddy and the mids and highs noticeably and almost uncomfortably harsh.  The only quirk for me is the open back so listening on the 185's isn't as private as the closed back 175's. But the 185's are also *much* more comfortable than the 175's, with super-soft microfiber earpads instead of the 175's ""leatherette"" (i.e. heat-trapping plastic) that made my ears feel hot and sweaty, so there's that plus too. Go with the 185's you won't be disappointed at all.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Okay but RS 185's sound better

    ","As an avid watcher of Downtown Abbey & Game of Thrones I needed these badly. I don't know about you - but as an American listening to BRITISH accented movies or TV shows I would often have a problem understanding 10% of the words because of the thick accented words. I used to watch GoT with CC on. Also i'd run into this problem with action movies and never fully hearing the words of what was being said over loud BOOMs and crashes. The only workaround was blasting my TV volume, and I live in the city in a condo so my neighbors probably wouldn't be happy with this.Secondly, living in a city I am surrounded by car alarms, dogs barking, babies screaming (new parents next door!) and construction sounds - to name a few. Putting these on is a nice way to escape from that. I can hear the TV crystal clear and was very surprised at how many subtle noises I heard now while wearing these.A few criticisms - the headphones ear cups get hot for me if I wear them longer than 2 hours. They are comfortable, but the body heat I produce make the plastic covering hot. This isn't a deal breaker. I have worn headphones for years for computer gaming and still have yet to find the ""perfect headphone"" that doesn't get hot.The base stand needs to be near your audio output. I have no problems with that, but the base stand is also your charger. If you, like me, have your audio output across the room, it means you have to get up, get your headphones, sit down, use them, and when done with them, get back up, walk over to the base stand and recharge the headphones. Yes, I know this is a ""First World Problems"" kind of thing, but I would have rather there was a design in which I could charge my headphones with another power cord closer to where I sit to watch TV. I could buy a digital audio cord that extends the base stand to where I sit, so its not the end of the world - just a buyer beware.Honestly, I should have bought something like this years ago. It really makes a huge difference when watching TV either by muting the rest of the outside world or by making it easier for you to watch TV and not bother anyone else.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect with a few quibbles

The headset will not work streaming from Netflix and Amazon without a digital to analog decoder.

    ","I love almost everything about these headphones. There are several negatives: 1) the foam-filled ear pads wear hot. I've thought about fabricating cloth covers to insulate them from my head. 2) The battery takes a lot of time to recharge if it's fully drained—over-night may not be enough. 3) They don't feel, in a tactile sense, like headphones that cost the better part of $300. I realize weight is an issue, at least for the headphones themselves, but both the headphones and the recharging stand feel cheap. On the positive side, their fidelity is amazing—clean, accurate sound, expansive sound stage, and excellent bass response that's never excessive. I also like their range. I can wear the headphones several rooms away from the recharging stand and still get great reception. Overall, these are very good wireless headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Sound, but...."

    ","I normally don't write reviews, but I had to put one in for this product. Out of all the wireless stereo headphones that we have owned, these by far are the best.  I bought this product along with an extra set of headphones for my wife. Hooking them up was very simple, digital fiber optic plug works great.  Both headsets have near flawless surround sound and the bass is amazing.  The headphones are very comfortable and not too heavy.  So far we are able to walk around the entire inside of our house and even outside and we do not have any interference or lose any sound quality.  Simply amazing.For those people reviewing multiple headsets and complaining about not being able to charge them at the same time, there is a simple solution, buy a AAA battery charger that plugs into a wall and you can plug all the batteries into the charger, directly into the wall outlet and charge all the batteries at the same time.  Again we have owned many headsets and these are the best sound quality, comfortability, range, and no interference whatsoever.  Yes the price is kind of high, but you get what you pay for. I would recommend these headsets to anyone I know.",5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST HEADSET I HAVE EVER OWNED!!

    ","Neither the 'quick start' leaflet (provided) or the 'how to set up' Sennheiser video give any guidance on what to do if your TV does not have the recommended 'optical audio output'. And if your TV does not have an analogue receptacle you are really out of luck to get sound. But....if you are fortunate enough to have the analogue receptacle and use that option you will loose the sound from the TV so anyone else watching the program will need Closed Caption! A ridiculous situation and an issue Sennheiser need to address, And one thing more.....Neither the leaflet or video clearly indicate that the button on the right hand side of the right headset needs to be pressed and held for at least two seconds otherwise, again, no sound! I found that out through a You Tube video! The headphone works pretty well if you can wade through the aggravations mentioned but for the price of the darned things you'd think Sennheiser could spend a few cents on providing a decent operation guide.",3.0 out of 5 stars,A Potential Frustrating Experience

638,"on May 25, 2017",,"The tl;dr is that these sound amazing, but there are ton of poor decisions in the physical design.  However it's currently the best option available if you want a charging stand.----I was looking for a pair of wireless headphones with a charging-stand.  However for some reason I could only find a handful of options.  After comparing literally all of them, I bought three headsets:* Sony MDR-RF985RK ($50)* Sennheiser RS 175 ($150)* Turtle Beach Elite 800 ($200)The Turtle Beach were painfully tight and had horrible non-stop static, so I returned them immediately.The Sony had the perfect physical-design but the audio quality was unacceptably bad.  I returned them as well.The Sennheiser's have great audio quality, but the physical-design is not good.  However, given my limited options I chose to keep them.PROS:* The audio sounds perfect* Wireless transmission is digital, meaning as you move away from the transmitter, you don't get increased static* Fantastic range.  I can walk around my entire house without losing the signal* Has a charging stand.  Why is this not more common!?!?* Wireless battery has good life.  I've used it for ~6 hours at a time with no issues.NEUTRAL:* Optical audio connection support.  I tried both the analog and digital, but couldn't hear a difference* Battery is NiMH.  Not sure why they didn't use LIon, which holds an even longer charge.CONS:* The headphones don't slide onto the charging stand, you need to line up the terminals manually.  This usually means placing the headphones on the stand, seeing that 'charging' light didn't turn on, then picking them up once or twice more and carefully placing them onto the terminals.In contrast, the Sony could literally be thrown on the stand and still start recharging every time.* You have to hold the power button down for 3 seconds to turn them on or off.  Why!?* If you take them off the stand and immediately hold down the power button, they won't turn on.  You need to wait ~2 seconds before holding the button down for another 3.  Why!?!?* The volume button are on the sides of the ear-pieces, meaning if you attempt to lie down while wearing them (to, say, watch a movie on the couch), you end up accidentally pressing the buttons 100% of the time.  The Sony one has them on the bottom of the ear cups* Completely unnecessary ""extra bass"" and ""surround-sound"" modes, which make the audio sound like crap.  Of course, the buttons for these are right next to the volume buttons, to ensure you accidentally turn them on often.* The ear cups themselves swivel around the head-band for unknown reasons.  The swivel-joint feels extremely flimsy, and I've heard multiple reports of it breaking.OVERALL:I really wish the Sony's used digital transmission that would reach across my house like these headphones; in that case I'd definitely choose those, because they have none of the ""cons"" above.  However, since they don't, I'm stuck with these.  The audio is great, but they made so SO many poor design decisions that I wonder how this ever made it through user-testing.For $150 I'd expect better, but these are still the best option I found, so until something better comes along, I'm keeping them.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, horrible design, but the best option available for my needs"

    ","Go this for my wife, as an upgrade to the Sennheiser RS-120's she has been using for TV watching.  She's not too particular about audio, so I wasn't sure if she would notice a difference.  After using the the RS-175 for about 30 seconds, she smiled and said ""These are MUCH better!"" :-).  <whew!>I've noticed that the RS-175 headphones also seal better around her ears than the headset from the RS-120 -- there is NO sound leaking out into the room, whereas there was a slight amount from the RS-120 headset.  Also, the receiver in the RS-120 headset had to be ""tuned"" to the base station, and that tuning was easy to upset by the wearer bumping the tuning knob while picking up or putting on the headset.  No tuning needed on the RS-175 (digital transmission, probably), so that's also no longer an issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars,RS-120 was nice; RS-175 is a definite step up!

I purchased these headphones to replace our stereo system for the time being. They replace a 5.1 surround system that has served us faithfully for years. We are currently limited to our Cable service and the included music channels (and yes of course, the TV!).I have to say the sound quality, ease-of-use, and overall end result has been a surprise and a blessing. It has taken a bit of mucking around in the tv/ device/ headphone settings to get the overall stereo effect as accurate as we could, but that was expected. The Bass is rich and relatively tight, the mids are clear, and the high end is superb. We get sound all the way out to the kitchen 30ft away with no problem (yes, snack runs during commercials).

847,"on April 8, 2016",,"Although pricey (maybe overpriced) this is a very high quality product. The clarity is astounding. I have hearing issues and these bring out background sounds that I cannot hear from the TV speakers or sound bar no matter how loud they are. There is no static or hiss ever (if you do not mind occasional hiss the RS-120 is an excellent alternative for about 1/4 the cost). I upgraded from the RS-120 because I thought over-ear phones would be much more comfortable than on-ear phones. They are more comfortable but still are too tight causing discomfort when wearing for more than 30 mins at a time. I do have a big head so this is part of the problem. I continuously stretch them out when not in use or charging. This has helped and the discomfort is worth it for the exceptional clarity.I always have the Bass function on. It does not muffle voices and add too much bass, but rather accents passages that are meant to have a strong bass line. I never use the Surround function because it does not seem to improve the presentation - just makes it sound different.

    ","First, let me say that I find reviews about service or non-product-related issues in product reviews very annoying. However, in this case I'm going to give myself license to list the good, the bad, and the perhaps slightly irrelevant all in one review. This is my second pair of Sennheiser headphones. I bought a pair for my hard-of-hearing mother a few years ago and they've been excellent. I purchased this second pair (different model) because these have an optical cable option and because I can pair a second set of headphones -- one each for me and my husband.Issue #1: The box had clearly been opened by someone prior to me receiving delivery. I don't mean the shipping box; I mean the product box. One of the accessory boxes had been torn open, the plastic bag containing the instructions had been opened, and ties on the optical cable had clearly been removed and carelessly replaced. However, it appeared that all parts were included and several parts were still in unopened plastic bags. The batteries were still in their original packaging. I did not order, nor did I pay for, an ""open"" package but that's clearly what I received.Issue #2: The optical cable is defective and clearly of inferior quality. If you purchase a set of these headphones do yourself a favor and just add a quality optical cable to your order. It took quite a bit of troubleshooting to figure out why the headphones weren't working (no sound). Luckily I had an optical cable for my sound bar. I was able to use that, reconfigure things, and determine that the provided optical cable was faulty.Issue #3: The rechargeable batteries provided are defective. Again, it took some troubleshooting to figure out why the headphones weren't working. Following the instructions, I installed the provided batteries and placed the headphones on the recharging stand for ~16 hours until the light turned green. Then I removed the headphones and started the process of testing for sound, etc. My first attempt didn't work (see cable issue above), so I turned off the TV, jiggled wires, etc. After less than 10 minutes of playing with the wires and buttons, etc (making sure I had the volume turned up and not muted), the power button turned off. I replaced the headphones on the charger and the light was red again. After 10 minutes?! I waited another 30 minutes but the headphones still had not charged to green again. At this point I dug out a set of non-rechargable AAA batteries, popped those in, and, with the new cable and the new batteries everything finally worked.In sum, Meh. They're headphones. They work (for now but I still have to get a new optical cable so I can wire my sound bar back up again). But they sure aren't anything special and they do not at all live up to what I expected based on the price and my previous Sennheiser experience. They do what they were supposed to do -- allow one (and hopefully, two) people to be able to watch TV while not disturbing the other people in the house trying to sleep or study. The Bass and Surround sound buttons do weird things to the sound that, to my ears, did nothing to enhance the experience. Maybe those are good for action movies? I tested them on a news program; the headphones certainly did not improve quality of the sound nor the quality of the news.As for comfort, I found them a bit heavy and I think they'll hurt my head after an hour or so but I think that's mostly an individual thing. I don't like wearing headphones in general and they all start to hurt after a while. The padding is nice and they fit around the ear and not over the ear so they do a pretty good job of buffering outside noise which allows one to keep the headphone volume to a minimum and avoid eardrum damage. But in terms of quality of sound or feel or buffering of outside noise I don't find these of any higher quality or any more comfortable than less expensive headphones I've owned over the years. The one thing these have over those others -- they're wireless.If I had to do all over again I'd probably avoid these and try a different model or maybe even a different brand. If you do buy these or similar headphones, either buy a better quality cable and a spare set of batteries or be prepared to acquire some in order to finish installation.I haven't received the companion headphones so I can't speak yet to how well they work or how it works to have two headphones working at the same time.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh. Headphones acceptable; inferior accessories; not worth the $$$

    ","Very disappointed with both audio performance and build quality of these headphones. They are made entirely of cheap plastic, the ear cushions are made of a material so thin I don't see how they will hold up to continued use without tearing. The fit was good and they seemed like they would be comfortable wearing for extended periods should you choose to keep them. I returned mine after two days. In my opinion based on build quality alone they are not worth $279. My intent for these headphones was going to be mainly for watching TV (optical out of TV to the transmitter optical input) and I thought it would be nice to not have to worry about the cord. I also didn't want to disturb my house-mates when watching TV. These headphones did seem to perform well when watching TV programming at moderate volume levels. Audio quality was good when listening to TV shows, Netflix, Amazon Prime, that were mostly dialog driven. Voices were clear and discernible, you could hear a lot of detail like things going on in the background, etc. However, when I listened to some more demanding soundtracks that were louder, or if I just turned up the volume then I lost the imaging and sound staging and the sound just gelled together. Listening to uncompressed FLAC music files is where these headphones really fell short in performance. There was no midrange warmth or bass extension, no pace, everything just sounded flat. My Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones (I think I paid around $140 for mine) being fed by an Audio Engine D1 USB headphone DAC outperformed the RS-175's in every possible way. The Surround modes were essentially useless, the LO setting did enhance voices (dialog) bringing it more forward in the head space while the Hi setting just produced an unrealistic reverberation and didn't really create an in-your-head surround sound experience. The bass boost really just overemphasized the bass response at higher volumes although at lower levels it did provide some needed bass much like the Loudness controls on AV receivers are intended to do. Also, as a closed back design these headphones leaked way to much sound out which negated my trying not to disturb others with my TV viewing. Some people might place more weight on the convenience of the wireless aspect of these cans and find the audio performance shortcomings an acceptable tradeoff but I just couldn't justify the cost of these headphones for the performance I was getting.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed with both audio performance and build quality of these ...

    ","I bought this ones over the RS 185 because they where cheaper and because of the surround sound and bass features. While I can say that the product sounds good when plugged in with the optical cable to my on-board motherboard sound card, the sound quality is completely lost when using the analog cable, and a predominant hiss and static noise is clearly audible. I do not think is my on-board sound card because my motherboard is premium and sports the SupremeFX Formula 2014 audio from ASUS ROG, which is the best ASUS has to offed for the Z97 generation of motherboards.The bass is good and punchy as advertised but the Surround Sound feature is mediocre, voices get distorted and sound hollow and digital as if an android or a Synth from Fallout 4 was talking, and a hiss and static noise becomes prominent when using the high surround sound setting. As for comfort, i can't complaint, they are comfortable but there is some heat buildup over time, and they can get a little painful after an hour of use as well.For Built quality man, despite being mostly plastic they still feel study and resilient, no complains there.What did scared me when I got them was that the plastic band that acts as a seal for the box was removed, and some of the bags for the accessories seemed to have been tampered with. My first thought was that it was probably done to check the product but it wasn't long before i was looking for the Sennheiser QR code to make sure it wasn't a fake. Luckily i found it and the authentication website said it was authentic but the fact that the seal was missing still bothers me. I bought this directly from Amazon which is listed as a Sennheiser certified dealer, not a third party that sells through Amazon.Conclusion.The headphones look splendid, feel like a premium product, and sound good (on occasion).Sadly their poor performance with the analog cable and the surround feature are too much to pass, since Sennheiser advertise this headphones as as being static noise free and honestly I expected better of the surround. I am pretty sure my devise is one of a few that isn't performing to Sennheiser's standards for X or Y reason. I emailed Sennheiser about the issues and hopefully they will help me troubleshoot this problems, but I do not know it it is too late, since I have already packed all the accessories back in their boxes.I will let the headphones finish charging and see if anything improves (which i hope), if nothing improves i will be returning these on Tuesday at the latest and will be getting the RF 185",2.0 out of 5 stars,Bad luck? or buyer beware?

    ","I need to concentrate in a sometimes noisy office environment. I had a previous model (RS-140) for years, and the battery finally died on them.The sound quality is MUCH improved (no hiss), but the design is in many ways a step backwards from the RS-140.#1 You must press and HOLD a small button for *several* seconds on the side of the headphones to turn them on (The RS-140 came one as soon as they were lifted from the cradle). This is annoying as the headphones turn off whenever they are placed in the cradle. I don't want to have to stare at my headphones for 3-5 seconds to see when the green light comes on every time I put them on.#2 The contacts on the cradle are too small (the coupling is just badly done).  I constantly have to 'wrestle' the headphones onto the stand to actually make contact, or more likely I put them on the cradle and don't realize that it didn't make contact, and so the headphones don't charge.Sennheiser if you are listening: these headphones really need to have a physical on/off instead of instead of a button-hold on/off. That was just a bad (dumb) design choice and is my major complaint. The headphones sound awesome, but the controls are horrible.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"1 step forward, 2 steps backward."

    ","I had a little extra money so I thought I would de-clutter my desk and get some high quality headphones at the same time. I had already picked out a pair of headphones from another maker when my Audiophile co-worker recommended Sennheiser. I checked them out online and the seemed like a really high quality product and so, I decided to go with the RS 175 as it had the highest overall rating and all the reviews seemed to rave about them.When I received the headphones over the weekend, they looked nice, Good packaging and easy installation. I charged them overnight, plugged them into my home computer and fired them up. First thing I noticed was that they didn't work with the switch in the ""Digital"" position. Which I thought was odd but didn't mind too much, Switched it to analog and we were off to the races. the music came though loud and clear. I spent the next few hours walking around the house doing chores with these on my head. That's where the trouble started.After the first song ended, I noticed that in the dead space there was a very loud and hissing sound like static from an old TV.  The next song that played (Pandora) was a much softer song and I could hear the hissing over the music. I tried using the SURR and the BASS but NOTHING got rid of it. To be honest, I never did figure out what either of these buttons did as they didn't appear to have any noticeable affect on the music. I even tried them on different types of music and couldn't hear any difference. While I'm not a pure audiophile, I'm also not tone deaf and I heard NOTHING, not a lick of difference with the settings in different modes.I figured the hissing noise might be an issue with my home PC. But, when I plugged them in at the office, same thing. Maybe it's a problem with Pandora, same problem on YouTube and on Itunes.So, after 2 hour of listening while doing chores, the headphones stated to feel like a C clamp on my head and I finally had to take them off. When I brought them into the office I could make it about 5 minutes and my head and jaw started to hurt. So, I am returning them and will buy the manufacturer I had in mind to begin with.Really not a good experience with Sennheiser",1.0 out of 5 stars,About the same quality of sound as a $50 gaming headset.

    ","I bought these for my desk at work for a couple reasons:1. I didn't want to have to deal with cords as I switch between working on a number of different computers at once. With wired headphones I have to constantly move the wire out of my way.2. Try something different than bluetooth. My computer doesn't have a bluetooth transmitter on it for one, but also I have never had a stellar experience with bluetooth headphones. I've owned quite a few pairs of bluetooth headphones all the way up to the $200 range and none compared to even a $40 pair of decent wired headphones in terms of sound quality.Sadly these miss the mark on a number of categories...Sound:You could tell me they were connected via bluetooth and I would have believed you. They are subject to the same pitfalls as bluetooth in terms of sound. The highs and mids get muddled together. The highs are missing any kind of real screech as you might hear when a guitarist slides his fingers on the frets in rock/metal/hardcore or some of the higher pitches of a keyboard/synth/digital in EDM. The lows and bass thumps might as well be played through a pillow. It's not awful, it's just underwhelming. The whole soundstage is missing any sort of separation and some music just sounds particularly flat. If you've ever owned a pair of bluetooth headphones, it's the exact same experience.Comfort:I can't wear these for more than a couple hours at a time. The product description would like to make you think you can wear these for hours on end, but I'm not sure how. My ears actually start sweating after a couple hours, and I'm not a particularly sweaty person. They also fit somewhat tight on my head, pressing against the area just under my ears (the lymph node area), which can be a bit annoying, but I generally get used to it after a few minutes. I'm mostly mentioning that part as a word of caution, in that, don't get freaked out right away. They'll settle in a bit on your head and you'll probably not notice that after a while. The occasional water/bio break is enough between extended wearing periods to not significantly annoy me, but the subtle discomfort is there.There are some really solid areas, however...Build Quality:Really nice. Everything is well crafted. Not much else to say here.Charge and the Charging Station:The charging station is real nice, and the battery lasts way longer than any bluetooth headphones I've ever owned. I've had them last over 9 hours without any drops in frequency or quality. The charging station only takes about 2-3 seconds to find the sweet spot, despite what some other reviews have mentioned. I'm not sure exactly what they found was so difficult about this. The battery is a huge plus to me, as I don't want to have to charge them while I'm at work. I want to take them off the charger, turn them on, and then not worry about it until I'm done working, and this product delivers in that category.Frequency:I've never once had them drop frequency. Granted, I'm never more than about 5 feet away from the station. Regardless, it's worth mentioning that every single pair of bluetooth headphones I've ever owned have dropped frequency in more ways than one and annoy me more times than one. This is a pretty big plus for me, as I don't want to get distracted while I'm concentrating. This spec was one of the most important for me. I have a squirrel's attention span and even one drop in frequency/quality will immediately annoy me and I'll stop focusing on the task at hand. Nailed it here.Noise Cancellation:This product doesn't really ""cancel"" noise in a technical sense, but it does block virtually all outside sound out. In a loud office, this is crucial for me. I generally don't even have to be playing anything to turn the world off once the cups are on. Another huge category for me.Overall I'd say that if you're buying these for your desk, you'll be okay with the purchase. If sound quality for music is most important to you, stay away. If you want headphones that block out noise, deliver decent sound, don't drop that sound and will last your whole work day, by all means, these will satisfy. I took a couple stars of mostly because I was underwhelmed by the sound quality and fit. If the sound were even slightly better than a set of bluetooth headphones, or if they felt like cold pillows on my ears, it would have been an easy 5 stars. Alas, they're more or less OK and thus 3 stars feels appropriate.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Meh sound, great battery, meh comfort, great frequency, an overall OK set for a work desk"

    ","I received this headphone as a birthday gift as it was purchased here on Amazon for me, so I won't be listed as a 'Verified Purchase.""  Opened this up, and installed the 2 AAA rechargeable batteries -- one in each ear piece. Then put the headphones on the 'cradle' hoping to see the red light go off soon, meaning that they were charged. Well as much fun as sitting next to the chimney waiting for Santa to slide down would be a comparison...  That got played out quickly, and I took the batteries both out and dropped them into my NIMH Battery charger, and within 10 minutes, the LCD display said they were fully charged. So I re-installed them in ear pieces and realized I had to ** PUSH and ** HOLD the start button on the headphone down for a FEW SECONDS and the nearby headphone green LED lit up and the headphone was turned ON.  Got all cables set up, used the included 3.5 mm cable for the TV audio out to Wireless box in, and WOW what a nice sound. I walked all around my condo, and the sound from the headphone was still streaming just fine. I then went on Amazon and ordered a pack of four 1.2 volt 850 mAh AAA Panasonic Eneloop rechargeable batteries to keep on hand and charged to replace in the ear pieces when they went depleted, I would just swap them out manually, rather than wait for MANY hours for them to re-charge on the cradle unit.......................Panasonic BK-4MCCA4BA Eneloop AAA 2100 Cycle Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries, Pack of 4** I want to order these also High Quality AAA M2cpower rechargeable batteries very soon, these have a Higher 1100 mAh and a good value for their low cost high quality with a Very High Rating by Amazon Reviewers:M2cpower® NiMH 1100mAh AAA Rechargeable Batteries (4 Pack)..................... The range on this headphone is incredible, and the sound is excellent high quality, and very comfortable to wear. Every time I look at the RED LIGHT being lit I think that that flaw is all I could find in an excellent pair of rechargeable headphone set. WHEN you get tired of waiting for the red light to eventually turn Green on the first charging, you may want to try the external charger trick, some reviewers have reported waiting 24-36 hours to see the Red LED to turn into a Green light. Good luck with that... I used my volt meter, and the prongs on top of the cradle unit are putting out a voltage.  After the first initial charging, I have been getting overnight full charges on the headset since then. ** See photos for a better idea what you are buying.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"EXCELLENT RANGE, BUILD QUALITY, SOUND FEATURES...

    ","Very satisfied with these headphones. Sound is very clear and virtual surround works well. I tested these with various action movies and it felt like being in a theater! I use an optical cable to connect it to my tv, or I switch to the analog one when I plug my iphone to listen to music. Bass is very powerful and can be deactivated, as well as the surround sound. Controls are conveniently located on the headset itself. Rechargable batteries are included and the headphones get recharged when they rest on the receiver. During music sessions,  I tried moving away from the receiver and I found out that the wireless range is unbelievable. Sound remained crisp and detailed even when I went on the upstairs level. I wish I could bring this premium headphones outside the house, but they are designed as a home theater tool and they need the receiver to be  plugged in to an outlet.

    ","These are great headphones for use with music or movies: I'm using them for watching movies.  They are not as good as the Sennheiser HD600, 650, etc, audiophile headphones, but they are very good for music and movies.  They're not true surround; they have two variations on simulated surround, and they have tremendous bass response as well as clear mid range and treble response as well.  I like the ability to control the volume, surround mode, and bass-boost all right from the headset. And with the 2nd set of headphones that works from the main base unit I can have a guest wear a headset as well.  The headset(s) use batteries that are user-replaceable, unlike some of the Sony headphones which require you ship the headphones back to Sony (!).  They  can accept a stereo RCA line level input or an optical input which is the way I'm using them.  I had absolutely no drop-outs or other noise or interference issues - just clean and clear sound with great bass response.  Absolutely perfect for late night movie watching or listening to music when you don't want to disturb the neighbors.  I am considering another set (with the 2nd pair of headphones) for guests.

The XBOX has an optical audio output in addition to the HDMI out.  Both can function at the same time.  I had a specific requirement for a headset, like the RS 175, to have an S/PDIF optical input to connect to my XBOX.  On the XBOX I went in to settings to make sure optical audio is enabled and set to stereo (since the headset is not surround sound.)Everything worked like a charm right out of the box.  I simply mute my stereo and pop on the headphones and I am good to go.I would recommend this for anyone with a setup like mine.The audio quality is very good.

    ","This wireless headphone set is easy to set up and use and works very well. In the package are the headphones themselves, the system's base unit, the power supply for the base unit, rechargeable batteries for the headphones, and various cables. The power supply comes with several swappable adapters, so the system will work with power outlets in the US, the UK, the EU, and Australia. The system supports both optical digital and analog audio connections, and a switch on the back of the unit allows you to change which the headphones receive, meaning you can hook the system up to two different devices and jump between them at a moment's notice. (Right now I have the optical cable hooked to my PS3 and the analog one to my laptop.) The included cables aren't enormously long, so you may want to buy longer ones if positioning the base unit at some distance from the audio source(s). As is now common, the full manual is available only on an included CD or online, but the quick start guide should answer most basic setup questions. What it can't do, of course, is help with the appropriate settings for whatever audio output device you're using, so be prepared to fiddle with that if you're not getting sound after the system is set up.The batteries fit behind the earpieces of the headphones, which slide easily out when the right pressure is applied but stay locked in place otherwise. Because the batteries charge while within the headphones when the 'phones are placed on top of the base unit, the only reason ever to take them out is if you've decided to use non-rechargeable batteries instead. Barring failure of the rechargeable set I don't see why you would-- the initial optimizing charge takes a long time (you can use the headphones for a while before you start it), but after that it reaches a point where you could use them literally all day and then recharge overnight. The headphones are sometimes a bit touchy about recognizing that they're in the cradle, but if you finesse them enough the light should go on, and once they're charging they don't slip out again.The headphones themselves are very comfortable; I've left them on for an hour or two while gaming, and after a while I sort of forget I'm even wearing them. They fit snugly enough to shut out a fair amount of external noise without being uncomfortable. A power button behind the right ear can be held down to turn the headphones on and off, or pushed once to mute and unmute. The volume controls are on the right ear, as are the buttons for bass boost and surround sound. Even with raised + and - icons for the volume buttons it can be a little difficult to tell by touch which one you're hitting, though it's easier if you start from the front or back of the earpiece and slide a finger along. I didn't find that either bass boost or surround sound had much effect on my listening experience, but then I'm not enough of an audiophile to detect fine distinctions in audio performance.Before receiving these I would never have thought wireless headphones would be worth the substantial bump in price over a wired set, but having used these for a couple days I'm at a point where I think I'd find it difficult to go back. The Sennheiser RS175 is certainly not a bargain set, but in terms of ease of setup and use, comfort, and performance, it's very easy to recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser RS 175 RF Wireless Headphones

    ","Great headphones - bought mine used from a coworker and use them daily at work. The charging station is very handy - I love never having to specifically plug them in, just set them on their stand and voila, they're charging.The surround sound function is... interesting. It drops a lot of the midrange and thus makes most modern rock and electronic music thin and empty. There are a very few select songs where I enjoy the effect but in general, it's not useful.The bass boost is pretty good, but I tend to just leave it off as well as it can be a bit overpowering.The headphones are comfortable for a couple hours but the material surrounding your ears can get a bit warm and therefor cause a bit of sweating. This is OK for my use as I don't tend to wear them for more than a couple hours at a time.The wireless range is plenty fine for an office - I can walk 5 or 6 desks away and not lose connection.HOWEVER...  the power button on my unit is a piece of junk. It can sometimes take me 5+ tries to get the headphones to turn on, and there's way to tell WHY they won't turn on, they just don't respond to the button. Hold the button for 10 seconds, click it quickly, anywhere in between... I haven't the slightest idea what the proper power button usage is, all I know is it always takes several tries to get them to turn on, which is frustratingly poor UX design.Beside the power button issue, the headphones are great and I plan to use them for years to come.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Power button finicky but otherwise great headphones

    ","So these were the winning headphone for me. After trying Bose, Blubio, Sony, and Beats, these were the only ones not to be returned. They had the best sound by far, the most reliable connection (RF) and the longest range (130'). They were also by far the best build quality. On the down side, they are pretty big and not the most comfortable, they were among the highest price and the worst issue of all is you cannot use them wired. Not being able to use them wired is crazy, this $1 part makes these only usable with the one device they are pretty much permanently connected to. I mean you can unplug the two transmitter cables and plug it in somewhere else, but why not just have a 3.5M input jack on the headphones themself. Anyway, if that is not an issue for you then I would recommend these headphones as the best in this price range and quality.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Winning headphone for me, but why no 3.5M input jack"

    ","I was previously using a pair of Sony Wireless headphones (MDRRF985RK). They had good sound and they were very comfortable. The downside was plugging and un-plugging into my Yamaha RX-V765's headphone jack every time I wanted to use them. I read the reviews on the Sennheiser RS 175 and it seemed like a nice upgrade for me. They were supposed to offer superior sound quality and a digital connection which eliminates the need to plug & un-plug into my AVR's headphone jack. My Sony KDL-46XBR6 has a digital (optical) output jack so I thought I was good to go. NOPE ! I only get sound from The Sennheisers when PCM is displayed in my AVR window. When Digital Dolby, DTS, DTS-HD MA or Dolby TrueHD is playing, I get NO audio. My source components are a Verizon FIOS DVR (Arris) & an Intel NUC HTPC running OpenELEC (Kodi). Almost all videos played are NOT in PCM and therefore NO SOUND from the Sennheisers. There are no settings in my Sony TV's menu for the digital output jack so I am forced to use the analog hook-up I had previously. The only advantage is the improved sound quality. That wasn't worth $200-300 more though.",3.0 out of 5 stars,The digital (optical) connection has major limitations which are NOT advertised

It WORKS AWESOME except that I get some ""micro dropouts"" when I'm about 25 feet away (and even have line-of-site to the transmitter).From some research this seems to be caused by having a nearby wireless router causing 2.4GHz interference.Fortunately the dropouts are for small fractions of a second so it's not bad but it keeps an otherwise ""perfect"" product from being perfect. I don't recall having this issue with the RS 170's though so that was surprising.I think I've moved all that I can to the 5GHz range but will check again and see if I can get more stuff off the crowded 2.4GHz spectrum. I could move my router but I don't really want to since it's in a good spot for everything else.On the plus side, I love how you don't have to go to the transmitter to turn it on like you did with the RS 170. When you turn on the headphones, the transmitter automatically turns on as well. Sound quality is also very good.But I can't blame the headphones too much for having a little trouble with wireless interference so I'm only knocking off half a star from these otherwise near-perfect headphones. 4.5 stars and rounding up to 5.This support link may help if you have the same issue:<Sorry, Amazon does not allow>",5.0 out of 5 stars,Watch out for nearby 2.4GHz devices like WiFi routers

    ","It took me a few tries to get these to work, but that may have been my fault in the end.  I found out something good to know though - Sennheiser customer service is top notch.  I emailed them and got a response the same day!  How often does that happen with anything, much less electronics. They really do sound amazing! I am so pleased to have these since my son and I are both night owls, but my husband is not.  With these, I can listen to the TV late at night, at a volume high enough so I can clearly understand everything without disturbing my husband, or competing with my son's TV. These headphones cancel out the sound of his TV and let me enjoy mine.  YAY!  Also, I can get up, get a snack or let the dog out without losing the signal.  If I step outside to untangle the dog, I do lose the signal, but that's not a big deal.I was also able to connect these, using the regular 3.5mm headphone jack, to my computer so I can listen to music while I work on photographs late into the night.Set up is really simple (once one figures it out).  I connected these wireless headphones to my Panasonic flat screen TV using the provided optical digital cable.  (The TV is connected via a HDMI cable to a Blu-ray player/surround sound system.)You just plugged in the base, (there are several removable plug options for different countries) put batteries in the earpieces and set them on the base. Chose which cable you need to use (2 are provided, reg. headphone and optical digital) and connect the base to your TV or stereo They will automatically charge themselves.  When the little light on the base turns green (which takes a few hours for the first time) you can put them on, push and hold the button on the back of the right earpiece and they connect and turn on.  Voila!  You can adjust the surround sound effect and the bass boost from the base, or on the right hand earpiece.  You can also adjust the volume there.  It took me a bit to get the hang of the buttons on the side. They are marked with raised bumps.  I'll probably never use the bass boost, but the surround sound (hi and low) does change the character of the sound somewhat and I will use that.They are soft and comfy and completely cover your ears.The only negatives are that they are a bit heavy with the batteries in each side and my ears do get a bit warm after a while.  That probably won't keep me from using them though.Almost a year later and I still love these.  They charge quickly, hold a charge well (I've yet to run them dead.  I use them for a movie or two then recharge) and they sound good.  I have used them almost every day because I'm a night owl in a house full of early birds.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, freedom to turn up the volume at night!"

Man what a difference; it's like night and day.  The sound coming out these headphones when watching TV is crystal clear, and they do a great job of blocking ambient noise as well.

    ","Exceptional sounding head phones. As a professional sound engineer I would rate these at 7.5.  Phones self adjusted the volume down on occasion for no apparent reason, but is easily adjusted back, could be RF. Unit was used but sold ""like New"", and appeared accurate. Packaging and assessories look unused. Everybody's hearing is different, but when you can hear the fine details of a mix then you know the cans are good. Bass is more than adaquate and in good proportion, mids very clear and defined, highs are clean, clear, and wide. Surround feature is more of a gimmick than a function, but can add depth to overly compressed audio. Volume controls are very responsive with a nice range. Master volume can be set at your source but be careful not to introduce buzz. Buzz is usually caused by bad ground, wire quality, loose or ineffective connectors etc. Hum is generally caused by EMF being introduced into your speaker wires by being to close to power wires. Atmospheric RF can introduce what I call 'audio dust' a sort of floating ethereal influence into wireless systems.I would not use them in the studio because they are enhanced, but for home audio they rock.

    ","My wife recently forced me to get these because my hearing is going and she was sick of having the TV too loud.  From what I can tell, this makes me a fairly typical customer.  I think these headphones are pretty good, and if you're in my situation, I predict that you will end up choosing these.  Here are some pros and cons that I wish I knew before I took the plunge.  I just like to know what I'm getting into.Pros.  The audio quality is pretty good.  I have a very long and satisfied history with SONY MDR-7506s in my home studio, and these Sennheisers, while pretty good, are definitely not as good as the MDR-7506.  On the other hand, they are a bit more comfortable, and they are wireless.  Duh.  They don't have noise cancellation, which is a plus if you're using this for home theater.  It is just wasted money.  So, if you get these, you'll be happy with the sound, and your wife will be happy with her reduced volume (or maybe just incrementally less unhappy, but you get the idea).Cons.  Let's start small and work up.  The claimed range is a joke.  In my wood-framed house, the range is 40-45 feet.  Which is plenty for a home theater, but the claimed range is fiction.  Now it gets a bit more serious.  Sennheiser product support is literally nonexistent.  All I wanted to know was how to register this product for its supposed 2 year warranty, and multiple emails to them using their product support website have yielded NOTHING.Finally, the most serious.  Hooking these things up so you can listen to something is going to be troublesome, and it is quite likely that you will have to buy some kind of adapter (not included).  You can tell from the complaints of some customers, and from Sennheiser's own instructions, that the preferred way to connect the base station is using the ""optical"" input.  This is also called ""TOSLINK"" or S/PDIF.  Using the ""analog"" connection is likely to get you unwanted noise and hum.  Many audio amplifiers (including mine, which is pretty expensive and pretty new) don't have an ""optical out"".  They have ""optical in"", but they typically have speaker outs, and RCA jacks for ""line outs"", but no optical out.  The only optical out I have is from my TIVO Bolt.  So, forget watch DVDs.  Problem.  Also, ""TOSLINK"" is pretty old and is not compatible with Dolby noise reduction, so to get anything useful from the TIVO, you have turn off its Dolby noice reduction.  Problem.  So you pretty quickly figure out that the optical connection is of very, very limited usefulness unless you buy an adapter.  That adapter has to be powered, so you have to plug it in, so you get the ground loops that you were trying to avoid with the optical connection in the first place.  You are not going to use the headphone jack on your amplifier, because if you plug something into that, it will kill the audio to your speakers and the audio in your HDMI (because it assumes that if you want to use the headphone out, it is because you want to create quiet in your room).  So, you'd better find a line out in the back of your amplifier.  This may or may not mean that you can't use your 5.1 surround sound.  Now, you, wearing your headphones, aren't going to get 5.1 anyway, but maybe the other people in the room were expecting to still have 5.1.So, it's pretty complicated, isn't it?  Ideally, I would be tempted to ask Sennheiser for advice, but since they can't even tell me how to validate my warranty, I'm not very hopeful.In the end, your wife will probably be happy, because the sound is turned down.  You will probably be happy, because wearing the headphones means you can't hear your wife when she's talking to you.  But listening to the movie soundtrack?  That's where it gets kind of complicated.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pros and Cons

    ","After some not-so-subtle hints, I was hoping to receive these as a Christmas present. The hints worked!  I did not try these out in any store, but I knew knew they would be purchased from Amazon and they have an excellent return policy.RANGE -One of my biggest concerns was about the range of these headphones in my house.  I have a 2-story home >3,000 sqft, and was hoping I could use these throughout the home.  They did not disappoint me.  The transmitter is on one end of the 2nd story in the media room.  I only had minor dropouts when walking at the opposite end of the home, inside other rooms, with two or three walls between me and the transmitter. If I stood still, reception was fine.  As someone who works professionally with RF systems, I am impressed by this performance.  I had previously tested a wireless outdoor speaker system (Soundcast Outcast) at much greater cost, and its performance was FAR inferior.  I am completely satisfied with the RF performance of the Sennheisers.SOUND - The performance of these headphones does not match my wired V-MODAs, But it is quite good.  The Bass and Surround options are effective, the surround button giving more presence to the audio.  I have no complaints in this department.ANALOG vs OPTICAL - There is some hiss when using the analog input from my receiver's headphone output. I found it objectionable enough to attempt to use the digital optical interface.  This interface is definitely preferable (no background hiss whatsoever, unless it is also in your source recording). However, one thing you must be aware of is that the optical uses PCM digital output. You might not get any audio from certain HDMI audio sources.  I am guessing that this is due to HDCP copy protection issues.  I had no problems with using one of the optical outputs on my receiver (a Yamaha RX-V2700) to listen to CDs or to listen to audio streamed on Netflix. However, some DVDS would not play any audio, and once I tried to play them, I could no longer listen to Netflix until I played a CD again again. I am thinking it's because the receiver went into some copy protection mode and wouldn't come out of it until it saw a stereo output.  This is just conjecture on my part.  Just be aware that if you try to connect these to a receiver (or even a DVD/BluRay player with optical out), you may encounter problems with some DVDs.  For me, I was primarily interested in listening to CDs, so this is not particularly objectionable.COMFORT - The headphones adjust well to my head, and are comfortable to wear.  They don't do as good a job of sealing out external ambient sounds as my V-MODAs, but they are 3-4 stars in this area.QUALITY - The build quality is very good for this price point.OVERALL IMPRESSION - I really like this system. If you use it for watching TV, you will be very satisfied.  If you use if for mobile HiFi, I think you will have a hard time finding something better at this price point.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great range, very good performance."

    ","I received these as a gift several weeks ago and wanted to wait before sharing my experience. I had found my previous set uncomfortable to wear, pretty much from the start, and they became progressively more uncomfortable the longer they were worn. Not so here, they are instantly comfortable with thick and soft material. In addition they hug your head firmly, so you do not have to keep readjusting  while being comfortable at the same time. More importantly, however, is the units sound , and this set delivers. The highs are crisp without being being over bearing, while the mid range has clarity and definition. The bass does not overpower and when put all together the result is a warm, well balanced and rich listening experience.  I have yet to experience any fading in signal strength as I moved around nor have  I yet to experience a total ""blackout""  ever. On one occasion I went outside and was amazed they were still jamming! My Bluetooth ones did that (breakup), and it was frustrating, sort of like a video freezing- just a hassle.  The battery life is reported to be rated at 18 hours (I have yet to validate that in that my insomnia is not  quite that profound!)  but have enjoyed them for up to 6 hours with no degradation in clarity or strength of the signal. The headphones are closed back which is helpful, if disturbing someone else in the room is a concern there is no sound ""leaking"". The set has two additional ""mix"" options , a Surround (high/low) and a bass button. I have noticed very subtle changes when altered- but nothing significant- which if fine in that they sound just right as they are. They do have the option of optical digital or analog connections (mine).  On previous pairs getting the head phones into the right spot on the charger resembled a lunar landing operation (frustrating).

    ","5 stars, but not quite perfect. The button necessary to turn the headset on/off (on one of the ear-cups) when you put the headphone on is a bit tricky to find in the dark; it's on the rim of one side of the headset ear cover and you find it without removing headset as you would use braille. Note that you must hold the tiny almost flush on/off button in for 3 seconds or so to accomplish task; one quick press will not do it; at first a bit annoying but probably a good feature to avoid an accidental bump resulting in no sound. The volume; sound control is done with 4 additional large buttons on the flat/outside of the same side ear-cover.  These buttons (all nearly flush, which is fine- there's enough protrusion to find, not so much as to interfere with operation) have raised dots for sound quality on two buttons, and a + and a -  for volume which are quite visible, but not as easy to distinguish by fingertip with the headset on. The single raised dot on the sound quality buttons should be doubled on one side (1 dot on one button, 2 dots on the other) since you will forget which button does what. The same controls are repeated on the base unit, but frankly, I have never had need to use these. The different shape of the ear covers is very useful to distinguish right from left by feel when you pick the headset up, as in the dark.  I find the range as described is adequate but exaggerated. I had a similar Sony set before this and a similar (earlier) Sennheiser set before that and both gave substantially better range (say, walking outside to check on the weather or whatever). Sorry, I have not measured actual range, but I use this only for watching TV (my wife listens to the TV's sound bar +/Bose speakers, since we have much different hearing sensitivity: she hears like a bat; I hear like a post), but as I walk around inside house there are areas where I lose sound. I was a bit disappointed, but the loss is limited & acceptable if not ideal. Otherwise, the sound quality is super excellent (recall my hearing). I hear MUCH better with these than in our super new multiplex IMAX theater. For others with hearing problems, turning off the surround sound/bass boost features at times gives me more distinguishable dialogue; so being able to change modes may be a useful alternative for most people. The surround-sound is quite convincing; I use it or not, depending on the program.  I have marathon-watched TV series or films and have never had a hint of battery weakening. The docking station is good looking and solid, never falls over from imbalance or a bump. I hope the ear pad material is an improvement over previous sets I have owned, which frayed long before the rest of the system showed wear. The ear fit & design are excellent, excluding all but loud ambient noise. When my wife and I are sitting on our long sofa, I cannot hear her normal speaking voice, but if she raises it just a bit, ""Can you hear me?"" I always answer, ""Yes, I can,"" then loosen the fit on one side and can hear her fine.  Overall, highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Well designed and functional. Highly recommend.

    ","This is exactly what I wanted to buy when I bought a pair of Sennheiser wireless headphones a few years ago.  On the previous pair, I was disappointed that it was basically like listening to an FM station:  static, old-school tuner like a transistor radio, a volume control that didn't work right, and a bad ""level adjuster"" that made it hard to set the volume that I wanted, or to enjoy high dynamic range music.  All that has been fixed.These are digital.  There is no static.  If you're on the edge of the range you get dropouts, but no static.  It does MUCH better in my house than my previous pair.  The ear-cup design is also much better than the press-on-your-ear design of the previous wireless headphones. My 25 year-old Sennheiser wired headphones have always been my favorite.  I like the sound of Sennheisers better than anything I've tried.  These sound great.

    ","After a year of frustrating ownership, here is a real review, not from an evaluator who got them free.Sound - meh, ok, but not outstanding for the high price paid.Build quality - cheap, flimsy ear pads. No wonder they are removable/ replaceable.Transmission range - very good, you can be in another room in the house.Here are 2 big deal breaking issues:Issue #1 - 2 pairs failed, each after a few months of use. Same problem. You power them on, after a few seconds the power red light at top of charge base starts flashing and base turns off. Analog or digital set up, same failure. Batteries fully charged. Works for a few seconds then shuts down. This is my 3rd replacement pair - fingers crossed.Issue #2 - Optical cable has no advantage over stereo analog and set up is ridiculous.Note that the supplied optical cable is super thin, fragile and looks like a Dollar Store bargain clearance item. Shame on you Sennheiser.This RS series features an optical digital input, BUT can only handle a stereo PCM audio signal, meaning only 2 channel stereo.Yes they are stereo headphones, but why do they not convert the signal from 5.1 and instead just shut off the headphones without a tech set up to get them to work with the optical cable?So like other than marketing hype, why even bother to offer this optical option?If you connect the optical cable to a device which is transmitting a 5.1 channel signal, the headphones will not reproduce any sound. You get silence. In fact the charge base green power light at thr bottom of the charge base will slowly glow on then off, and there is NO SOUND.You will need to change the settings of your receiver, streamer, game console or other device transmitting. 5.1 signal to output a stereo, 2 channel PCM signal.It is a big issue with Netflix app on smart TV where the default is 5.1 surround.In this case, once the program is playing, go to the 'Audio and Subtitles' Menu.Then select the option 'English' rather than 'English 5.1.Thanks Sennheiser for pretending state of the art optical when in fact, in use it is no better than just another low tech stereo cable.There is no reason other than cheapened design for the receiving base not to switch to a PCM signal automatically.For the high price / low value, you should pass on these.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"1 year of use, 3 pairs later, beware of Optical cable PCM issue."

    ","I used the Sennheiser RS 175 RF Wireless Headphone System on a PC watching HD movies. I was immediately impressed with the depth of sound. I heard a bass response that I don’t get from my desktop speakers, and a much cleaner high end. I watched X-Men : Days of future past, and it felt as if I was listening to my living room surround system. A few times I got up and walked to the kitchen for something to drink or eat, and the sound never cut out, or broke up. Considering the fact that the specs for the headphones quote a line of sight distance, I expected the sound to break up, but it didn’t even weaken. The headphones are relatively comfortable, although a bit heavy. They fit my head (which is larger than most) very well, and the buttons are easy to use on the side.I also listened to music with these headphones (BOND : Duel) and I was surprised at how full the music is with excellent base, all the way up to a crystal clear high end. Watching TV is also very pleasant. I hear more details than just sitting in front of the TV watching on regular speakers.Pros;Great rich sound for Movies and MusicComfortableEasily accessible volume and setting controls on the right sideGood battery life (Two days so far on one charge)Cons;The noise cancelling is overly sensitive so if you talk you hear yourself echoIf you’re chewing something especially crunchy, you’ll hear it.Note: These things shouldn’t bother you during a standard movie or music listening.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound, good range, long battery life"

Also own the open design HD 598 and like them as well for un compressed file music.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound adjustment is great for 65 year old ears.

    ",I am so pleased with this.  I was watching a show on our 54 inch TV.  Too hard to get good quality sound.  I hooked up my RS175 to our TV in our sitting room.  I watched 15 minutes of a show and I knew that I was understanding what all they were saying.  I moved into the other room and started the show over - on demand -.  It was amazing how much improved the sound was.  Sort of wish I would have went ahead and bought the model that has 2 headphones.,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE MY SENNHEISER RS 175

    ","I purchased the SENNHEISER RS 175 Digital Wireless Headphones System so that I could upgrade my old analog headphones to digital using the Optical digital input option on these new Wireless headphones.The RS 175 headphones are incompatible with my Sony KDL-65W850A TV optical digital input. My TV was manufactured Sept. 2013. I looked at the onscreen TV user's manual and tried to change the digital audio output to PCM but there is no option to do this.Sennheiser's owner's manual say if you have incompatible signal to set the digital audio output of your device/audio source to ""PCM"", with a sampling rate of max. 96 kHzThe headphones were a complete waste of money for me. MAKE SURE YOUR TV IS COMPATIBLE WITH THESE HEADPHONES BEFORE BUYING. If I find a work around I will update this review and let you know.",1.0 out of 5 stars,MAKE SURE YOUR TV IS COMPATIBLE WITH THESE HEADPHONES BEFORE BUYING

The power light was on and off all the time, it never stayed lit just on and off and I could not get anything to work so I had to send it back even tho it worked on regular TV because I tried to watch another video no AP IV and no voice so I think that Amazon Prime should pay attention to this letter and check it out.
