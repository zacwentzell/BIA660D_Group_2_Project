    ","I am a professional musician who does a fair amount of travel. My main considerations in choosing a pair of headphones were sound quality & noise cancellation. I tested the Bose, Sennheiser, & Sony — paying particular attention to those two parameters. Here is what I found:N O I S E  C A N C E L L A T I O NBOSE: These have the best noise cancellation by far. One of the tests I did was to turn on a vacuum cleaner beside me and listen to the differences. Bose’s ability to cancel the sound is quite amazing. All that was left was a whisper. I also turned on the dryer in an adjoining room. With the Bose, all that I heard was the click of the buttons on the drum.SENN: The Senns do a pretty good job of canceling sound. What’s left from the vacuum test contains more mid-range noise than with the Bose. The annoyance factor is cut way down, but Sennheiser is clearly not trying to equal Bose in this regard. With the dryer test, I could still hear the machine, though greatly reduced, and the quiet sound of the clothes.SONY: The Sonys are about equal to the Senns in the vacuum test, but the spectrum of what’s left is different: Whereas the Senns let pass a fairly neutral midrange, the Sonys pass a smaller spectrum focused in the high-midrange. They bested the Senns in the dryer test, almost equalling the Bose: Most of the machine sound was gone, but more of the upper-mid sounds of the clothes remained.VERDICT: For cancellation the Bose are the clear winners. The Senns are the weakest in this regard, and the Sonys about in between. One thing must be noted here: Only the Sonys have the capability of running Bluetooth without NC. This is an advantage in that NC causes a slight amount of hiss — and the Sony’s hiss is just slightly more apparent than that of the other two to these old ears. Turning off NC does not otherwise affect the sound.S O U N D  Q U A L I T YBOSE: Of the three, the Bose offer the least pleasing sound — which is not to say that it’s bad. The sound is very clear and tight, but it’s also kind of brittle — a little too pristine and bright. In passive wired mode, this effect is mitigated and the sound is somewhat warmer.SENN: Here is where the Sennheisers excel. Of the three, these sound the most like an audiophile headset. Whereas the other two tend to flatten the sound, the Senns have a lovely transparency. They have the richest spectrum, such that you can really hear the subtle raspy timbre of a voice or the expressive nuance of a bass tone. The sound is even slightly more luscious in passive wired mode.SONY: The Sonys fall about in the middle between the two, although this may be a matter of taste. They offer a truly beautiful, warm sound — clear like the Bose but without the brittleness; warm like the Senns but with less detail. In passive wired mode, the tendency toward a bass-forward EQ is accentuated.VERDICT: If sound quality is the most important factor, then the Bose are not in the running as far as Bluetooth performance is concerned: the other two are a significant notch above. Those who prefer a transparent, detailed sound will prefer the Senns. Those who prefer a warm, focused, bass-forward sound will prefer the Sonys. If wired mode will be a significant use, then the Bose can be considered at least in the same league, with the Senns setting the standard.L O O K  &  F E E LBOSE: A nice feature is the pivoting earpieces, which make them the most comfortable to hang around the neck. These headphones put the least pressure on the head, and the pads are very comfortable. All controls are on the right ear. The on/off/pair button is well-designed and satisfying. The Silicon-Valley Generic voice gives a percentage of charge on boot-up.SENN: These have a kind of vintage look to them. They offer a bit more pressure on the head than do the Bose, but the leather pads are luxurious. The volume/pause/skip button is an elegant design feature. The voice on boot-up does not give a charge percentage, but the lovely British accent almost makes up for it.SONY: These are some sharp-looking pieces! I got the teal-colored ones and they’re stunning. Pause/skip and volume are nicely separated on the right side, with on/off/pair on the left. They provide the most pressure on the head, with nicely-finished pads. The boot-up voice gives a high/medium/low accounting of charge. While not as sensuous as the Senn’s Brit, the Sony’s Midwest Professional voice is more refined than the Bose’s.VERDICT: The Bose are the most comfortable, the Senns have the most elegant volume/pause/skip control, and the Sonys are by far most fun as a fashion accessory.S U M M A R YThese are all well-designed headphones. Not one of them is better in every way; rather each offers a solution that makes different trade-offs. The Bose favor NC. The Senns favor sound quality. The Sonys offer a kind of compromise between these two, while adding the NC-off option and a fashion-forward look. You can’t go wrong with any of them, but the optimum choice will depend on the user’s priorities.S P E C I A L  N O T E  T O  M U S I C I A N SThe third test I did was to play soprano & tenor saxophone with NC on and no incoming audio, as one of my intended uses is to cut a few dBs off the volume while practicing. All three headsets function better in this regard than do custom in-ear passive hearing protectors, as the ear canal is not blocked. The Senns let through the most natural sound by far. The Sonys are a slightly better at reducing the highs, but the resulting sound is a bit hard-edged. The Bose cut down the overall dBs the most, but the result is a downright tinny sound.",5.0 out of 5 stars,HEADPHONE COMPARISON: Bose Quietcomfort 35 • Sennheiser Momentum Wireless • Sony h.ear on

    ","Arrived in a sturdy cardboard box packaging, I had to pause for a second while looking at the cover picture.  Even so it was a familiar image of the original wired Momentum, I still took a moment to enjoy sexy lines of their design.  Before opening the box, I usually like to take a tour around it to get acquainted with key features, list of accessories, design details, and technical spec data.  Some of this info really stands out with key features of 22 hr battery life, BT + aptX support, NFC pairing, Active Noise Canceling (ANC), foldable design, wireless and wired connection, and 2 year warranty – quite an impressive list to get you excited for what awaits inside of the box.  With a cover off, you will find a compact case made out of a soft material (kind of reminds me of suede texture) inside of a foam cutout, a familiar display setting I found with other Momentum models, though case material usually varies.In addition to this soft touch case with a yellow stitching around the edges, other included accessories (all inside of the case) were a detachable audio cable, usb to micro-usb charging/data cable, a flight adapter, a soft draw-string pouch with headphones inside and the pouch placed in the case, and a comprehensive quick guide.  Personally I prefer a more heavy duty hard shell case and eventually will look for one which shouldn’t be a problem to find since Momentum 2 has a foldable design, but I do have to admit this case looks really sweet with a yellow stitching matching the one used on leather headband.  Audio cable has a right angled gold plated slim connector going to your audio source and 2.5mm twist-on connector going to earcup.  This is the same connector used in the original wired Momentum, and my only comment here is that I would have liked to see some kind of an alignment marker so you know when connector is engaged and twisted correctly inside of earcup, but with a few tries you get used to it anyway.Flight adapter is rather rare to see nowadays, but it also very appropriate since a lot of people use headphones with ANC during their travel, and sometimes you're required to turn off Bluetooth on a plane (putting your phone in airplane mode).  Having a wired connection gives you the flexibility to use headphones when battery is low or when you don’t have access to Bluetooth or in a situation like an airplane.  USB to micro-usb connector is obviously for charging, but there is also another undocumented feature which I’m going to talk about later in the review.I already mentioned that unfolded Momentum 2 looks just like its original predecessor.  You get the same stainless steel metal arc headband, split at the top, partially wrapped in premium leather with a dense foam padding inside and yellow stitching around the edges.  Instead of a typical height adjustment mechanism and headphone yoke, you can slide the earcup up/down across a slit of exposed stainless steel headband sides.  The sliding adjustment is very fluid and easily controlled with one hand without being too tight or too loose.  The earcup itself is attached to a mounting pin and has a full 360deg pivoting rotation to adjust comfortably to the anatomy of your head and your ears.  This adjustment mechanism has a pure German engineering quality written all over it, and at the same time it has a very fashionable modern-classic look.  The wires from earcups going to headband are flexible and still have a heavy duty shielding.  At the point of their entry to headband you will find 4 metal screws for additional security.One of the most noticeable design changes introduced with Momentum 2 (both wired and wireless) has to be a foldable headband.  Such mechanism is easy to implement with a traditional headband where you can design-in foldable hinges.  Looks like Sennheiser decided to challenge themselves keeping the original design, making it look identical from outside, and adding a durable locking hinge on inside right at the point where leather band wrapping begins.  This is another example of well executed German engineering - done with a slim hinge which is hardly noticeable from outside.  The only comment I have here, you have to be careful when folding earcups in to make sure metal endpoints of the headband don't brush against leather earpads.And speaking of earpads, you will be pleased to know these have been updated with a bigger opening in comparison to the original Momentum headphones.  I never had issues with those original Momentum earpads, though my ears are just average and about 60mm in height.  For me with original earpads it was tight but still comfortable.  The new earpads are just perfect with an approximate opening of about 65mm in height, but that doesn't mean that 70-75mm ears won't fit in.  The earpads are deep, with memory foam and a soft leather wrapping.  According to a quick start guide, they are removable and replaceable, so it's definitely a big plus.  The donut shape of earpads is not symmetrical where the thicker part is faced toward the back making fitment more comfortable.  This also means that you can't flip left/right sides and always have to put headphones one way.  The L/R marking is inside of the headband, right underneath of the hinges, and you also get 3 dimples on the outside of the left side at the folding edge, though I wish those dimples would be a little bigger for a “blind” id.Looking closer at earcups, you will find the Left one having NFC pair up area and what appears to be a two microphone grills.  A spec of M2 Wireless lists NoiseGard hybrid feature using 4 mics where I assume these are two of them.  Right earcup is where you will find the actual controls.  First of all you have a port for 2.5mm cable with twist-on lock, and also micro-usb port for charging and USB DAC input (more about it later).  As a right handed person, I prefer cable attachment on the left side, but it’s not an issue moving forward since I’m planning to use these headphones mostly wireless.  Right next to it you have another long microphone grill and 2 control buttons.  One is a Power button (with led next to it) which also serves a purpose of initiating BT pair up once you hold it down.  The other control has a spring-loaded rocking multifunction push button where you push it once for Play/Pause/Call and rock it up/down for a volume control.  Furthermore, double and triple click while playing audio will trigger skip track next/prev, and double click and hold or triple click and hold will trigger a fast-forward/-back transport control.  In idle, triple click informs you about battery status.Moving on to Bluetooth functionality of these new Momentum beauties, let me first start with a ""digital"" domain of the design.  As it was mentioned before, Momentum 2 Wireless supports BT4.0 and aptX codec which is among the latest Bluetooth standards that enables high definition sound without lossy compression of the source.  Pair up was effortless and headphones connected to phone and media audio without a problem.  As an alternative you can also use NFC pair up.  Keep in mind, with power on, ANC will be enabled automatically and you can’t disable it.  Also, I had no issues making/receiving clear phone calls, though it was a bit of a new hearing experience considering ANC noise isolation.Another way to connect to your source is wired, using detachable cable.  With wired connection you have an option to use headphones in passive mode (with power off) or active mode (with power on).  According to Momentum 2 spec, this will change input impedance (where btw, the packaging box has a typo so please refer to a spec on the web), thus you will be able to drive Momentum 2 wired with power off like a regular pair of cans, even with addition of external portable amp if you prefer to.  With a power on, I would recommend direct connection without any external amping to avoid sound artifacts.  I don’t know the exact chipset inside of these earcups, but once you turn the power on sound becomes wider/deeper, more textured and better balanced (especially when it comes to bass) - suggesting a high quality of internal DAC and maybe some amplification stage.  Furthermore, with addition of ANC you will also hear a cleaner black background.Now, here comes a total undocumented surprise!  You can push Momentum 2 wired performance even further by using a direct USB connection to your smartphone or laptop/PC.  Yes, in a typical fashion of USB OTG connection (to your smartphone) or USB DAC connection (to your computer) you can now bypass analog HO driven by low quality internal DACs inside of your phone or laptop.  It’s hard to quantify the level of improvement since with some of the latest phones, like my Note 4, I find a lot of USB OTG DACs to offer only a marginal step up, but when it comes to laptops – you can expect a better wired sound through usb cable.Before I proceed to a more detailed sound analysis, I want to bring up another key feature of these headphones – Active Noise Cancellation (ANC).  I typically don’t require ANC in my everyday routine since I don’t take public transportation or work in a noisy environment.  As a matter of fact, I probably wouldn’t even take these headphones outdoors.  But I’m well aware that a lot of people rely on it during their daily activities and very serious about the quality of ANC implementation.  I have briefly tested ANC offered by other headphones, and a lot of you probably will agree that Bose is at the top of that game, but I also found Momentum 2 Wireless to be not too far behind and sometimes even better than others (such as noisy hiss of Beats Wireless Studio).  Personally, I was pleased with a quality of noise reduction implemented in Momentum 2, and found no annoying hissing or periodic pulsating white noise.  There were some occasional bursts, but it happens rarely.  I’m not going to carry on about these having the best ANC in the world, and in my opinion if this is your only top priority – Momentum 2 Wireless is not for you.  But considering everything else these headphones have to offer and their outstanding performance, ANC implementation is just an icing on a cake!!!  And just to be clear, ANC implementation in Momentum 2 Wireless doesn't feel like an afterthought feature added to make them look complete.  This is actually a well functioning active noise cancellation!So how do these sound?  I tested them both wired and wireless, and found some interesting differences.  As it was previously mentioned, in wired mode you have an option of passive mode (w/power off) and active mode (w/power on and ANC enabled).  In passive mode the input impedance is 28 ohms and headphones function just like a regular wired set of cans which you can drive directly from HO of your audio source or through external amp.In this passive mode I found sound to be well balanced and with just slightly overwhelming mid-bass hump.  What is interesting, the impact of this bass enhancement only comes out to play in the tracks with a strong 4x4 kick/bass drum, while it was hardly noticeable in mellow tracks.  In general, wired passive mode is OK if you completely drained your battery, but I personally prefer to keep active mode always on.  As soon as you turn on the power of active mode, you are greeted with an improved sound tuning and an expanded soundstage.  One interesting phenomenon, most likely due to internal DAC, in active mode the input impedance goes up to 480 ohms (!!!), and it becomes quite noticeable since the volume drops and you need to compensate it from your source.In active mode with a stock cable sound signature was close to a wireless mode performance.  It was a very impressive comparison since this is a truly best audiophile quality wireless sound I heard to date.  But for the sake of my testing, I will refer to how Momentum 2 sounds in a wireless mode of operation since I consider it to be the most important characteristics of these headphones.So, overall I found Sennheiser Momentum 2 Wireless to have a balanced sound signature with a smooth warm organic tone and moderately enhanced bass.Starting with a low end, you have a good extension down to a sub-bass layer which is smooth and well balanced with a mid-bass punch.  The bass presence is excellent and builds a strong warm foundation without muddying the sound or overwhelming the rest of the frequency range.  Also, it is well controlled without spilling too much into lower mids.  The mid-bass hump I experienced in passive wired mode was completely gone and smoothed out as soon as you enter active mode.Mids are warm and smooth, maybe just slightly recessed.  They contribute to a full body sound starting with a thicker lower mids and going into a detailed lush of upper mids.  Both male and female vocal delivery was very smooth and organic with an intimate feeling.  Even though mids are warm and smooth, they still have an excellent retrieval of details without being harsh or analytically bright.Treble is relaxed, detailed, organic, not too crisp or grainy and without any sign of sibilance.  These are definitely great for extended listening period without ear fatigue.  Some might perceive treble extension as a bit rolled off, but after a closer listening you realize that it's just a warm nature of the sound.As I mentioned before, in passive mode soundstage was just average, controlled by your source, but once you put it in an active mode - soundstage expanded to a 3D depth and width with an amazing separation and layering of sounds.Conclusion.Overall, I know that wireless experience can vary depending on the make and the vintage of your phone or tablet, BT version and aptX support, Android vs Apple (where aptX is not even supported by iDevices), and perhaps your location due to surrounding that can interfere with a signal.  But in my everyday use during a test period I experienced a flawless performance with a wireless sound quality that rivals some of the top wired headphones I’ve tested.  Of course a big factor in sound quality has to do with a great job Sennheiser team done in tuning of these headphones to have a warm and natural full body sound that oozes with a high level of detail retrieval.  When people think of wireless headphones, usually convenience of cutting a chord is at the top of their list.  With Momentum 2 Wireless you don’t have to compromise a sound quality and can add it at the top of your priority list as well.  On top of that Momentum 2 Wireless has a remarkable 22hrs battery life, a choice of wired or wireless connection, USB DAC support to connect to your smartphone or PC/laptop, very high quality build and comfortable fitment, convenience of foldable design, latest Bluetooth with aptX support and also NFC pairing, 2 year extended warranty, and of course a bonus of very capable Active Noise Cancellation making Momentum 2 Wireless a complete package with a great value even at its premium price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,An Audiophile Quality Wireless performance with A LOT of bonus features!!!

    ","These Senn HD1’s sound very good, the noise cancelation works well, and I love the premium materials and their aesthetic.  But they cost more than the competition and have fallen behind in features.The HD1’s come in three colors - the two you see here at Amazon, plus one with purple ear cups and multi-color stitching called the Pink Floyd edition, available only from Sennheiser’s online store.  (That’s the one I have, and it’s gorgeous.).I bought these about 6 weeks ago after owning the Bose QC35 for over a year and wanting something with better sound quality.  I looked at several alternatives in the $350-500 price range and picked the Senn’s mainly because of Senn’s reputation for excellent sound quality and their looks.  I’ve had a very positive experience with another pair of Senn headphones:  the HD650’s, a wired open-back headphone for home use.  Plus, the Sennheiser Momentum over-ear wireless headphones with noise cancellation received excellent reviews when it came out a couple years ago.I am happy with the HD1s in most ways, especially the ways that count:  sound quality, the use of premium materials, comfort, battery life (20 or more hours), and looks.But they are more expensive than the competition and lag the competition in features.The competition includes the Bose QC35s, the Sony WH-1000XM2, the brand new B&W PX (which is basically the excellent  wireless B&W P7 plus noise cancelation).The Senn HD1’s have some things in common with these competitors.  Each comes with a detachable audio cable for corded use, a travel case, an airplane adapter, and a standard micro USB charging cable.  All of these models get at least 20 hours of battery life.  The HD1’s case is soft neoprene and lightweight.  It isn’t as small as the Bose’s hard-shell travel case, but it’s lighter.But the competitors have some advantages.  All have a smartphone app that lets you tweak settings such as the amount of noise cancelation and when the phones will power down if they’re idle for a while.  These apps and these phones’ firmware is updated from time to time to add features or improve performance.  Some of them have cool new tech, such as atmospheric pressure optimizing, ambient sound control, equalizer & surround/sound position control (on the Sony) or environmental filter (B&W).In contrast, the Senn HD1’s do not have upgradable firmware and do not have a smartphone app for adjusting settings - there are basically no settings to adjust.Also, the Senn HD1’s are the only wireless noise-canceling headphone in this price range that do not allow you to set a power-down time.  So, if you forget to turn them off, they will stay on until the battery drains.  (According to Senn customer support when I asked them about this.) That is a really annoying omission in my opinion.Why does the HD1 lag the other models in features?  One reason is that the HD1 is a rebranding of the two-year-old Sennheiser Momentum 2.  The only thing that’s changed from the M2 is the headband is slightly wider and thicker, for more comfort.  But the change is subtle and easy to miss.  More importantly, there do not appear to be any upgrades to the sound quality or features in the HD1 compared to the M2’s, according to published specs and professional reviews.If you can live with a two-year-old feature set--and I’m struggling with this given the very high price of the HD1’s, then you’ll probably be very happy with them otherwise.The HD1’s ear pads are covered in rich, buttery leather that look and feel great.  The metal band is mostly covered in leather, except for the sides to adjust the height of the ear cups.  The backs of the ear cups are plastic, but it’s nicely finished and looks & feels good to the touch.  The HD1’s are slightly heavier than the ultra-light Bose QC35’s, but still light and perfectly comfortable for hours-long listening sessions.  (The Bose are lighter because they’re mostly plastic.  They look cheaper and boring.)And last but not least:  sound quality.The HD1’s sound signature is classic Sennheiser:  mids are clear and present, bass is tight and not boomy nor over-emphasized, and highs are laid back.  The sound signature is well-balanced and natural.  In comparison, the Bose QC35 sound signature puts the highs way out front and has very little mids.Besides the difference in sound signatures, the Senn’s do very well with complex, layered sound, like an orchestra with 50 or 80 instruments playing at the same time.  The Bose really blows it here, while the Senn and the other competitors are champs.  On the other hand, for recordings with a small number of instruments (e.g. voice, guitar, bass, drums), the Bose do just fine—except for the lack of mids.  The average consumer seems to like the Bose sound signature:  other Bose headphones and speakers also have this sound signature and Bose sells millions of them (kind of like McDonald’s sells millions of hamburgers).All of the professional reviews say that Bose has better noise cancellation than the other models in this group, but the noise cancellation in the other models is still pretty good.  I agree.  And all the professional reviews say that the other headphones in this group sound better than the Bose. I agree.However, I don’t think the difference in sound quality is as great as is claimed in other reviews.  The Bose do not sound bad (despite the vitriol they get from audiophiles).  The Senn HD1, Sony, and B&W models sound better than the Bose, but not spectacularly better.I think you’ll be disappointed if you buy one of these expensive high-end models expecting audiophile sound, as some reviews claim they have.  The better sounding models in this group are NOT audiophile grade.  Audiophile grade headphones are something like the Senn HD650 or the Hifiman HE400i, both of which are corded, larger, and open-backed (and both are a bit less expensive than the Senn HD1’s!).  They’re intended for home use, not travel.  You give up audiophile grade sound when you go for portable, wireless headphones.But for portable wireless headphones, the ones I’ve mentioned here (not counting the Bose) sound the best.Regarding the Senn HD1’s, I can’t recommend them over Sony or B&W because they cost a lot more and are missing some useful features that the others have.  All three of these sound very good, though the sound signatures differ and which one you like best is subjective.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good sound, but more expensive and fewer features than other high-end wireless noise-cancelling headphones"

    ","Sound quality is great although it could stand to get a little louder (maybe I'm going deaf). I havent experienced bluetooth connection issues, but Im also not moving around too much and my phone is usually on my person. I originally bought these for travel and in-home use because of the noise cancellation, sound quality reviews, and the generally positive perception of the Sennheiser brand.That said, the finish is horrible. It stayed in-tact throughout my long trip to South Asia (where I now live). After I arrived I put these neatly back in their bag and case, and didnt pull them out until my trip to Singapore. When I pulled them out, I was frustrated at the peeling finish that seemed to have come from nowhere on the right earcup. Theres no way a $500 should have this issue. Its unacceptable. I also saw from another reviewer that the exact same thing has happened to them.Currently, they sound great and look horrible.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality is great although it could stand to get a little louder ...

    ","As we looked through all of the reviews across the web, it was great to Sennheiser with a strong product in the bluetooth wireless headphones space.  And frankly, these cans deserve it! We did a sound test against the Bose Quiet Comfort 35, and my husband and I both picked the HD1s.  The sound is more clear with more range. The Bose sound felt very muted missing the crisp tones of the HD1s.  The HD1s were even lighter than the Bose, but not by much.  I wouldn't call the different noticeable.Pros:* Great sound range (high highs and low lows)* Amazing fidelity and sound* Comfortable to wear literally all day* Passive and active noise cancelling* No ""white noise"" when using noise cancelling without music playing* Awesome retro lookCons:* The strap across the top is not overly padded.  I was worried at first, but it hasn't turned out to be an issue.* Wider than most cans, but that is the price you pay for the retro look!The only thing I haven't tired them for yet is phone conversation.

    ","I don't have the deepest pockets and was never going to pay $500 for headphones. After months of price monitoring I came across a ""Like New"" pair on Amazon for almost half retail price and decided to go for it.  It's only been less than a week but so far, no regrets whatsoever.Regarding the way the headphones sound; that is so subjective.  We've seen many reviewers delve deeply into the quality of the highs, lows, midranges; too much base; too little. You don't need more of that. You'll really never know until you try them for yourself. And that, my dear reader is something you definitely should do. As for me, I find these to be most excellent sounding headphones.The hardware itself is exquisitely built and attractive to behold. Many have complained that the ear cups are too small, and I felt that as well initially. But upon closer evaluation, the circumference of the cups is fine. For me the problem is the depth of the cup is just a bit too shallow, such that the actual speaker within can press against the top of my ears. This is not necessarily a flaw in the headphones, but possibly just in the way my particular ears happen to be shaped. I can however adjust the positioning and find the sweet spot that fits perfectly.So in conclusion, the only thing I would change about these headphones is the depth of the ear cup to accommodate those of us with unconventional ear shapes, without of course, sacrificing any sound quality.Do that, and maybe then I could envision making the sacrifice to reach deep into the nether-regions of my pockets, and dig up the full retail price!Update:Vs. the just released Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless. This release was a surprise to me. I had just days earlier I purchased these Sennheiser Momentum Wireless. I simply had to try them out!Sound:  Both sound pretty amazing! The Bose have a slightly clearer sound and are better at lower volumes. where the Sennheisers have richer fuller sound overall. I'm having a difficult time deciding which is better so I have to call it even here.Comfort: The Sennheisers are pretty comfortable once I find that sweet spot, but the edge definitely goes to Bose with their wider, deeper cups and supremely soft cushioning.Noise Canceling: Hands down Bose. I tend to sing along while at home rocking out cleaning house, and I can't even hear myself (a good thing!)Build quality: The Sennheisers have have it here. They are exquisitely tooled with metal and leather all around, and have a most distinguishing look about them. The Bose are made of a glass filled nylon, not plastic. They seem very sturdy, but it still feels like plastic.  This does make them about an ounce lighter than the Sennheisers. Though they are quite handsome in a understated way that is pleasing.Price: The Sennheisers are going for $400, (down from a a whopping $500) vs the Bose at $350.Bottom line: I don't think you can go wrong with either of the headphones. I am still deciding. It will come down to comfort as noise canceling is not a great priority for me.  I did get a great deal price-wise on the Sennheisers, that made them much less expensive than the Bose, so that is a consideration for me as well. But If I had to pay full price,  I would have to choose the new Bose QC 35s.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Impressive!

    ","When I opened the box I took one look at the cups and thought, ""there's no way these are circumaural headphones.  I was sent the wrong product."" I was fortunately wrong.  They rest just on the edge of the edge of your face/ear and encompass the ears from top to bottom.  Noise cancellation is not perfect but handles white noise very well.  With music on, only the loudest noises seem noticeable.  There's a bit of a bass boost but the entire range of sound feels clean and crisp.  I own an android phone and do take advantage of the AptX encoding.  While the quality of the audio does seem more rich with AptX, the battery life suffers.  I'm not able to reach the 22 hours of play time advertised.  Near field communication quickly pairs the headphones with a mobile device and I've gotten compliments on their appearance.  My head is a little on the large side, so long listening sessions over 4 hours do lead to some ear pain.  I can understand how some people say that they can use them for an entire day.  They grip well and the cups are soft.  I did buy them on sale for 350$ and am happy I bought them.  For 500$ it would be quite a bit more difficult to justify the purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality and great noise canceling

    ","I kept the HD1 and sent the PXC550 back.First off, nobody paid me for this review. I am just an amateur audiophile looking for nice bluetooth cans, with the added twist that I work in a call center and would like to use them there. This is why I immediately ruled out the Bose QC35s and the Sony 1000's, because they can ONLY CONNECT TO ONE BLUETOOTH DEVICE AT A TIME. In 2018 that's just not acceptable to me.I started with a pair of Sennheiser HD570 wired headphones 15 years ago and these really set the standard for me. Fantastic audio quality and total comfort. I included them in this review just for fun. I bought the PXC 550 and HD1 over-ear (not the on-ear model) which is basically a rebranding of the Momentum 2.0 from what I understand. I tested all three, the two new bluetooth headphones and my old trusty wired ones.PRICE: PXC 550 ($300), HD1 ($350) as of Feb 2018.COMFORT (Winner: PXC550): The HD1s have ever so slightly larger inner diameter on the cups and it makes things ever so slightly better. I don't have weird ears or anything, pretty normal size and shape. The wired HD570s that I have from 15 years ago are still the epitome of comfort. Sennheiser absolutely nailed it with those. Granted they aren't bluetooth but I still ran them in the comparison here. The PXC 550 synthetic material earpads were actually a little comfier than the leather HD1 pads but they were smaller. The headband on the PXC550s is superior because it's padded and the HD1s aren't. This didn't bother me much but I wanted to point it out. The HD1s are sort of noticeable on my head when I first put them on, whereas the PXC550s seem to fit like a glove immediately. It feels like the HD1s just weigh a bit more or something. Yet after wearing the HD1s for an hour or two, I don't notice them anymore.NOISE CANCELLATION (Winner: HD1): Both headphones have the talk-through feature for calls which I personally like, but I have heard some occasional low level rumbling or popping on the PXC550s with the noise cancelling on, whereas the HD1s are silent. Both do a very good job with noise cancellation overall.CALL QUALITY (Winner: PXC 550): There is no mute button on the HD1, there is a touchpad gesture for this on the PXC550. Numerous people have all said, when I asked for their opinion, that they could hear me more loudly/clearly on the PXC550s than the HD1. They never outright complained about the call quality when I used the HD1s but when I called back and forth with each headset the pattern was demonstrable. The PXC550s do occasionally blurt out ""call ended"" while I was on a conference call with my Macbook Pro 15""/2015/Webex. It never ended the call, but it is startling and seems like a loose end that needs to be tied up. Still, I think the PXC550s win here.AUDIO QUALITY (Winner: HD1): This is where I saw the biggest difference between the two headsets. If you like rap or you listen to music at a very low volume, buy the PXC550s because they are very bass-heavy. If you like accuracy, get the HD1s. The soundstage was far more alive on the HD1s than the PXC550s. The HD1 stereo separation is better and they sound brighter, yet I don't think they were shrill. The HD1s remind me why I like my ancient Onkyo Integra amp, so if you've listened to one of those then you know what I'm talking about. It's exactly like that. The PXC550s sounded great but with the HD1s available for side-by-side testing there wasn't really any question about the winner here. The bass notes are all present and accurate on the HD1s but it doesn't define the whole experience the way it does on the PXC550s. The HD1s are more on par with my HD570s. Crisp and balanced. Over and over I swapped them for comparison and the result was the same.USABILITY (Winner: PXC550 if portability is critical, otherwise the HD1): I found the touchpad controls on the PXC550s to be more annoying than regular old buttons. I liken it a bit to the Apple TV Gen 4 remote control. It seems like a good idea but when you get your hands up there to touch it, sometimes you swipe and nothing happens, or there's a slight lag, so you're not always sure exactly what's happening. Also the motion of aiming your hand in the air and hoping you ""nail the landing"" on the PXC 550 pad adds a level of awkwardness. Worse, sometimes I would try to adjust the PXC550s on my head and accidentally touch the pad, which isn't hard to do. This would pause the music or hang up the call. I got in the habit of being careful how I touched the PXC550s. The HD1s just have a multifunction button that I find simpler and more accurate to use. For portability the PXC550s are the winner. They turn on and off by twisting them in a way that feels unnatural, but I got used to it and they are slimmer to transport. The HD1s fold in a more natural way and have a traditional on/off button, but they are bulkier. Both cans come with a wired cord in case the batteries die. Both cords felt pretty cheap. The HD1 cord twists securely into the headphones and the PXC550 doesn't. The PXC550 cord has an inline volume control, the HD1 doesn't. Audio quality when corded didn't change notably over bluetooth, interestingly enough.STYLE (Winner: HD1): The PXC550s look really good but let's be honest here, the HD1s in brown leather/ivory are gorgeous.  They remind me of some retro cans or like the old headsets from an airplane. Style wasn't that important to me, but they do look good.CAPTUNE IPHONE APP: I don't see the point. The EQ doesn't seem to work unless I give it access to my music library etc etc, and I'm not going to do that. So I didn't test it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser HD1 (Momentum 2.0) Over-ear versus PXC 550 versus HD570

    ","Unbelievable. I was between the Quiet Comfort 35's and these for Christmas 2017. I went with these and they are incredible. I'm sure the QC35's are great too - I tried them at Walmart - but after owning QC15's for 6 years I can tell you that the HD1's have noticeably better sound quality and are built with higher-grade materials. I just flew with them in an airplane next to the jet engine and the sound cancelling was more than sufficient. So, don't worry when you read that they have less aggressive sound cancelling than Bose. It works more than well enough regardless.Also, 6+ people in the plane had QC35's, no one had these sexy mofo's.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than QC35's IMO

    ","Certainly not cheap, but as a headphone snob these are the best sounding noise-cancelling wireless headsets I've used yet.  They don't get as loud as one would expect but I can generally use these on a plane at about 70% volume and hear everything clearly.  I've used them at 30% and fallen asleep in my seat with barely any noise from the engines coming through.And the battery lasts a loooooong time.  Haven't timed it, but I can get through about 5-6 flights without ever seeing a low battery warning.  Actually I don't even know if it has one.I won't say these sound as good as a pair of good open backs but I've used a lot of headphones in general as well as about 7-8 different noise cancelling ones and these (to MY ears) have sounded the best by a significant margin.",5.0 out of 5 stars,but as a headphone snob these are the best sounding noise-cancelling wireless headsets I've used yet

    ","I, like so many, have been reading countless reviews to try and find the perfect pair of wireless headphones, I honestly thought these would be the ones. I have coveted the Sennheiser HD1/Momentum headphones since I first saw them, but the price has always been too steep, nor do I live near a store where I could try them out. So, when they finally dropped the price, I took advantage, and I have to say that while I loved a lot about them, I ended up returning them. The sound quality is great, definitely on the warmer side, with a more pronounced bass tone, the build quality is phenomenal with solid feeling hinges and metal throughout, I loved the look of them too.My biggest issue was with the noise canceling. Not the quality of the noise canceling either, it definitely reduced the drone from the airplane, and made it almost impossible to hear people trying to talk to me. My issue was, you can't turn it off if you want to run the headphones wirelessly, and for me personally, the cabin pressure sensation was really uncomfortable. This is my first pair of noise canceling headphones, so I can't really say how the pressure stacks up to other headphones but for me it was unpleasant. The headphones are also smaller than I thought they would be, so you can't really wear them around your neck (I normally wear a medium collar size in my shirts so my neck is not abnormally large) and the clamping is not severe but they are definitely a pair of headphones you will be aware of at all times.I really did want to love these, sound quality, build quality, battery life and all of that are excellent, and when I got them on sale, they were on par with other brands in the market. However, the noise canceling was really unpleasant for me, and as much as people said I would get used to it, I never did. More importantly, I didn't want  anything about a pair of $300+ headphones to be something I had to acclimate to, or 'deal with'.The reviews for these headphones around the internet are glowing, but I unfortunately they just didn't work for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Noise Canceling Ended Up Being the Deal Breaker

    ","Sound quality still blows all the other wireless headphones out of the water despite being two years old (I've tried em all - Bose, Sony, B&W, B&O, Plantronics, etc). It has that warm, bassy Sennheiser sound I've come to love. AptX encoding is good enough to wirelessly accommodate most streaming services, but using these wired with some good quality FLACs when possible can be a wonderful treat. Build quality is excellent, with abundant high grade leather and steel everywhere. The only plastic seems to be on the backs of the earcups and the Bluetooth controls. The headband is all steel, making it very robust. These really stand out in stark contrast to all the drab, black hunks of plastic most portable over-the-ear headphones seem to be these days. The earcups are nice and fluffy and i have no problem wearing these cans multiple consecutive hours. Noise canceling is okay, but doesn't reach Bose and Sony's standards. On the plus side, there's no ""hiss"" either. Bluetooth connection quality has been largely excellent, with a couple hiccups every now and then in outdoor settings. Really don't know what the negative reviewers are doing to struggle so much with connecting these, it's not hard. I love that they'll automatically connect to both my laptop and phone after turning on. Many other headphones don't support simultaneous connections, and the ones that do often require you to manually make the second connection. Battery life is similarly on par.Negatives:- No ability to turn off noise canceling when using wirelessly, and it's not particularly strong.- Ear cushions are always sold out in the US store and have to be ordered from overseas.- $500 is insane, wait for the occasional sales that drop them down to $350- No light indicator that shows when the headphones are on, and no auto-off features. So you have to be careful to turn them off when you're not using them.- No AAC support, so iphone users are going to have a poorer experience because Apple refuses to support aptX, leaving only ol' fashioned SBC.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"An excellent, enduring pair of headphones"

    ","These are the first noise-canceling headphones I've ever purchased; I bought them in large part to get a bluetooth option now that I have a phone without a headphone jack (thanks, Apple).The audio quality is amazing (as expected); that feels like a throwaway but really isn't. I work in the digital media space and am really impressed with these as I haven't been with any wireless audio devices (including Sennheisers) that I've tried before. I also found these very comfortable both in terms of the fit over my ears and the weight. The ANC is nicely done, and doesn't have the disconcerting ""ear suck"" effect that I got from the Sony set that I tried. I also think they have a great, old-school look to them. Indeed, they feel high quality in every way.There were only two drawbacks that have me considering returning them:1)  The connection was just not stable while walking. Audio kept cutting in and out or skipping while I walked through the city with my iPhone 8 in my pocket. It was fine for many blocks, but then really struggled in certain places, so I suspect it was interference from wires, other users, or myriad other things that are unavoidable in a city. This is the real dealbreaker for me, though!2) There is no way to disable the ANC while using them wirelessly. This would be nice to have when using them at work or in other relatively quiet environments.My current plan is to return these and hope that Sennheiser will release a new version with the ability to disable ANC and perhaps an upgrade to Bluetooth 5 or an improved BT antenna.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sound but Unstable Connectivity

    ","I decided to get this based on the wirecutter article (The Best Bluetooth On- or Over-Ear Headphones) on bluetooth headphones, which placed it as the top choice if price was no object. I also read the headfi forum article (Huge Comparison of [almost] all the Best Bluetooth Headphones - post your own comparisons here) that compared a ton of bluetooth headphones, and this one ranked second among the over ear headphones, behind the Audio Technica ATH-WS99BT. The reason I chose this over the cheaper Audio Technica is 3 fold. First, the ATH headphone is said to be uncomfortable to wear for any prolonged listening, and you have to buy a third party earpad to replace the default ones. Second, I prefer darker sounding headphones (read: more impactful bass), and I found the popular ATH M50x to be too bright for my taste. I also had another ATH headphone before, which I'd classify as something on the ""brighter"" side of things as well. As such, I expect the ATH-WS99BT to have similar sound. Third, the ATH headphone uses bluetooth 3.0 which is said to be less battery efficient, and it is listed with only 3 hours battery life, vs the 22 hour on the Sennheiser.Comfort:I do find there is some clamping if these are not put on properly. But overall it is quite comfortable. The leather pads are high quality and feels good on skin contact.Sound:Smooth sounding. I think soundstage is okay, not as spatious as some reviews say, but since this is a closed headphone it isn't surprising. I do find myself missing the slam of the bass of my DT 770's, but those are basshead headphones...Isolation:Very good in the office. Not too good on the NYC subway. Noise is attenuated, but definitely audible. I doubt there's much you can do at such noisy environments!Battery life:I haven't used this continuously without charging for too long yet, can't say much about whether it really has 22 hour battery life.Price:I got a refurb version of this from an Amazon seller which is ~100 bucks cheaper than listed price, around 300 bucks is what I paid.Make sure you get a rev02 not rev01. Google ""headfi momentum 2 rev01"" and read the thread about how the rev01 had bluetooth connectivity problem AND paint was peeling off the surface of the headphone! Rev02 supposedly does not have either problem.If you can afford then just get this.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great bluetooth headphones. Recommended.

    ","Amazing fit and finish.  I do not consider myself to be an audio expert but if it helps, I also own the Shure 535's and the Shure 846 so, I know what good sound is.  I did not expect these to sound as good as they do for the price!!  I do NOT think that the bass is too pronounced (as indicated in some of the reviews).  The volume goes well past my comfort zone (which based upon some of the reviews they were too quiet).  The noise cancelling technology is way better in these than in the Bose earbuds I bought and returned because they HISSED super loud, which these do not.  Honestly, VERY minimal hissing from these and I am picky about that.  The final thing I'd like to say is that there are no wireless connectivity issues since they fixed the problems in September or so of 2015.  I have been quite pleased with these and for the price feel that they are a great value.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing fit and finish

    ","Really nice build quality.  The pads are really comfortable, but there isn't much padding on the top of the headband.  Battery life is great.  Sound quality is fantastic for a Bluetooth headphone, easily besting the Bose QC35, though the Bose may have a little better noise cancelling. I find the Momentum noise cancelling to be adequate for my needs and would happily trade better sound for worse noise cancelling. The looks/style is really great looking.  They pack fairly small, but the included case isn't very good.  It's nice looking and has a nice accessory pouch inside but it doesn't provide a lot of protection as it's fairly flimsy.  I ended up replacing it with a Slappa case that lacks the nice acc. pouch but has a harder shell for much better protection.It's the best sounding over ear Bluetooth headphone I tried out of many.

    ","So far so good.  After researching the latest reviews I kept finding myself coming back to the Sennheiser Over-the-Ear Momentum HD1 headphones.  I don't travel all that much so I viewed active noise cancellation as a bonus, not as a priority.  I will speak to that later.  First off, what helped me make my decision was that I found a refurbished item on Amazon for less than $350.  This was about the maximum I was willing to spend on a new set of headphones.  My refurbished set arrived in great condition, with a two-year warranty, and to me looked just like brand new.  I obviously can't speak to how they might hold up but so far, so good.Now for the review.  Like others have mentioned in previous reviews, the sound quality is very good.  I am not an audiophile  but I do know good sound when I hear it.  The workmanship also stands out and I just spent a long weekend of extended listening with these headphones and only after about day three did I find myself adjusting the earphones a tad to relieve a little pressure.  One tip for those not familiar with NFC pairing, if this applies to your smart phone, you have to position your device very close to the headset for initial pairing--within an inch, or so.  I was unaware of this, and spent five or more minutes trying to figure out why my smart phone would not pair with my new headset.  It is in the instructions, but I don't use this feature and was used to my earbuds where they just paired a foot or so away without any effort.  There is a small decal on the left earphone that I believe is the actual NFC receiver.  Once paired, this is no longer an issue.  I alternate between my laptop and smartphone, just fine.  I do make sure that only one of these devices (smart phone / laptop) has Bluetooth on while in range, then my headset pairs just fine.  (It can take ten to fifteen seconds.)As far as active noise cancellation goes, it may not be adequate enough for some, but I find that it does improve my listening environment.  For example, my living room and kitchen are not divided by walls so I can normally hear the hum of my refrigerator and dishwasher while sitting on the couch.  These headphones do a very nice job of quieting the background noise of these appliances.  Basically, low tones are reduced significantly but highs, not so much.  As an example, my bird can be quite noisy and high pitched, and these headphones are not too effective at eliminating these sounds--maybe just damped down a notch.  On the other hand, normal conversations are fairly muted but not enough to not know that someone is trying to get your attention, which I like.  I intend to use these for walking and I still want to be able to hear some sounds, for safety reasons.  So I agree with a lot of the reviews I read that the noise cancellation feature should be viewed as more of a 'bonus' with these headphones.  What you're really buying is great sound and very nice build quality.  I have also found the battery life to be as advertised so far.  I will try to check back in if I experience any problems or new epiphany.Edit:One week later, I just wanted to note that my experience with these headphones continues to be a positive one.  My walks this past week have been a pleasure.  Unlike with my earbuds, where traffic tended to drown out the music for significant stretches of roadway, now the music is the focus throughout the entire walk.  The good news is that I can still hear the cars coming from behind, though, the 'swish' sound is significantly reduced. This is exactly what I was hoping for.  One more note, in my office sometimes I'll turn the headphones on while listening in-line just to experiment.  There is some subtle background noises that disappear when the unit is powered on thereby activating the noise reduction feature.  Mostly, though, I find myself listening in my office with the headphones off to preserve battery life, and  maybe more importantly, so I can hear someone a little more easily if they need to get my attention.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Refurbished purchase working out just fine, so far"

    ","I really wanted to like these, but they're one of the least-comfortable headphones I've worn. Returning.Compared to the Sennheiser HD598s these are replacing: They don't sound quite as good; this is expected due to the closed-back design, and focus on features rather than sound quality. The main consequence I noticed is a muddier low-end. Overall, sound quality is fine/as-expected.I experienced intermittent Bluetooth-related choppyness. I'm unable to identify whether this was due to the headphones, or my computer; I did not attempt to troubleshoot it, so I cannot say it is the fault of the HD1s. Each time this occurred, it was resolved by power-cycling the headphones.The ANC's wonderful; I cannot compare it to other ANC headphones, since these are the only ones I've used, but it worked wonderfully for dimming the roar of the HVAC system in the area I used it.Why I returned: The earcups are much too small for me; they are not sized as expected for around-ear headphones; they're in between the size of around-ear, and on-ear phones, resulting in an awkward, ear-smashing fit. I suspect people with small ears may not experience this problem. I have not experienced this with any other set of headphones. They rest partially on the head, partially on the lobe.

    ","These are often-referenced best-available bluetooth over-ear headphones and I've recently been in a major time-and-money-wasting effort to shop around, try many (and return most) over-ear headphones to determine which one is REALLY great. Not just Good, but Great. Best value for the money - even if it's quite a bit of money.I admit I was hesitant; I'm not too fond of the Sennheiser HD1 aesthetic. This is also to be stacked up against a couple of other esteemed, and very much enjoyed, headsets in my collection that are definite ""keepers"" - Bang & Olufsen H9, Sony MDR-1000X (upgrading to WH-1000XM2), and Bose QC35. I also found some headsets that should have been great to be quite lacking - namely, Bluedio Vinyl and Victory. Given how much I enjoy the other high-end units above and not thrilled with the look of these - I opened it with some trepidation.Firing them up, they paired quickly. I played something - took me a moment to realize that the volume is a spring-loaded channel switch, and by default the unit appears to be turned all the way down - and, ahh. Yes. I get it.First: aesthetic and comfort. They are more compact than they look in the pictures. They fully enclose my ears and sit very comfortably around my head. They look nice, to be sure; the coarse grain leather headband is nice-looking (as is the stitched leather on the B&O). The ear pads appear to be genuine leather and are as soft as a well-worn club chair. I'll listen to these for a few hours and edit the review if I learn anything different, but my impression is that these are exceptionally comfortable and likely to produce no fatigue or pinching - so, a clear rival to the B&O and Bose. They are quite light - and the ""ivory"" shell, as well as the surround and buttons, are plastic. In terms of high-quality plastics mixed with metal bones, they are more a peer to the less expensive Bose and Sony; the B&O clearly wins in build and material quality.The sound quality is exceptional. The bass is deep and controlled. Not as much braggadocio behind the tones under 50Hz as the B&O - which I acknowledge could be offputting for some, but I happen to love - but these Senns deliver all of the bass, all the way down to minimal audible range, in a perfectly vocal, audible way. The soundstage is superb, treble is crisp. I'd argue the sound is ""fuller"" and tighter than the Sony or Bose, both of which are very good. My personal preference would give a slight advantage to the B&O, but that doesn't mean these are bad in any respect; they are superb. Just trimmed a little differently.Despite the hefty price tag and less-than-best materials quality, these are definitely a ""keeper"" for me. I would still rank the B&O #1; you can apparently download an app that can adjust the EQ on that headset - which I have chosen not to do - but gives you flexibility to fiddle with the sound to make it more to your liking. These are a close #2. Some fault the B&O for having finnicky touch controls; these have no touch controls and only 2 buttons: on/off, vol up/down. Take your pick.I'm assigning 4/5 for the sort of cheap/light plastic of the body of the cans, and the control buttons. At this price point, I expect more effort (money) to be spent on design and build quality. But I can still clearly recommend these on the basis of exceptional audio quality.Happy listening!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"A definite keeper, despite not winning across the board"

    ","First off, I must have the daintiest ears and head in the world, because 90% of over-ear headphones *really* bother me. For the last ~8 years, I had a pair of the Bose over-ear noise canceling headphones, and they were extremely comfortable. However, I was ready to mix it up after they finally bit the dust. I was nervous about these because they're obviously expensive, and I wasn't sure if after a month my ears and head would be hating life, but now I am true believer. I am a programmer and have the option to wear headphones for most of the day, and I'm able to wear these for probably ~6 hours a day without any discomfort. (Note that it did seem to take me a week or so to get used to them. I don't know if my head got used to a little more pressure, or maybe they got broken in some, but I was a little worried the night I took them out of the packaging.)Also, the sound.

    ","Let me start this by saying I bought a used pair. It wasn't new, it didn't come in the original packaging, and it sure wasn't free of surface grime from whatever might have happened to this pre-shipping. I still love these headphones despite its life before I met it. To put things into perspective, I have a pair of Sennheiser HD 600 headphones, but these are still my go-to headphones for casual listening, which I will elaborate on in a bit.COMFORT: This is the over-ear version of the Momentum 2.0 Wireless. However, ""over-ear"" should be placed in massive sarcasm quotes because the stock earpads on these are a joke. They are leather, and they are soft and squishy, but they're hardly over-ear. Maybe it's just my freakishly huge ears, but these stock earpads may not cup your ears like a HD 600 would. BUT, all of this is okay because earpads are easily replaced. Just buy some Brainwavz HM5 replacement earpads, slap them on, and your listening experience will go from ""Rumpelstiltskin pressing his hands on your ears and whispering the lyrics of that Usher song you thought you forgot past his fingers"" to ""Clouds around your ears that hug your face and tell you that you're very handsome and everyone thinks you're cool."" Now, I mentioned earlier that I prefer these to my HD 600s, and that's because of a difference in purpose. Don't get me wrong, the HD 600s are excellent, easily the best sounding headphones I've heard. But the Momentum 2.0 Wireless is just easier to use. The Momentum 2.0 is wireless. The HD 600s are not. The Momentum 2.0 doesn't need an additional amp. The HD 600s do. The Momentum 2.0 can come with you to the bathroom. The HD 600s in theory could, but you really don't want to do that.SOUND: The sound of these headphones is why you really want to get these headphones. Many headphones with active noise cancelling sacrifice sound quality for their ability to cancel ambient noise, but not these babies. If you ride public transit, consider this an excellent choice for mitigating annoying motor noise to let you focus on the sweet sound of your favorite album, Running With Scissors. Speaking of which, the clarity these headphones provide is nothing to scoff at. Due to the nature of being a closed set of headphones, you will hear details that you may not have even known existed in your favorite songs. This comes with a price, however. If you look at a frequency response graph of the Momentum 2.0 Wireless, you may see that around the 5kHz range, there is a strange valley. Strange, because while listening to music with detailed highs, it doesn't seem to matter that much, which I see as a big positive for the versatility of these things. The bass too, while not overpowering, feels very tasteful. It's clean bass that doesn't muddy like Dre's Beats do. Vocal clarity is just as good and clean.NOISE-CANCELLING: It's okay. It's probably not as great as the Bose QuietComfort stuff at noise cancelling, but that's okay too. You're not getting these for the noise-cancelling. You're getting them for the unparalleled sound quality in a pair of bluetooth headphones. These will do what you need them to do, such as blocking out the noise of a plane's engine, or those computer fans you've got running at full power.LOOKS: Damn sexy.BUILD: You know what's really solid? A strip of pure metal. That's what the headband is made from, and it shows. When you put these on your head, you won't hear a thing come from any part of the construction. No rattling whatsoever. And if you're worried about that leather strip with no padding on the top, don't be. With proper adjustment of the cups on the sides, that strip basically won't even touch your head most of the time. Speaking of the cups, they slide up and down very smoothly, a bit different from other headphones that click to adjust in small intervals. Basically, if you're not actively trying to destroy these headphones (and why would you?), then these will last you a long, long time. In 50 years, your grandkids are gonna ask you why you're using those big dumb earcups instead of their cybernetic aural implants, and you'll say ""Because it hasn't broken yet. Also, you're adopted."" Obviously hyperbole, but they're just built so well.Edit: I forgot to mention a few more things.BATTERY LIFE: 22 hours of battery life is what they advertise on their page, but I've heard claims of upwards of 25 hours playtime on a full charge. I don't know if I can substantiate that claim, but I can say this: I've never had these headphones die on me in the middle of listening. I go for days at a time without charging, intermittent listening all throughout and often overnight if I fall asleep with them on (since the HM5 pads are so comfy). There is a downside to leaving it alone for a while though, and that's the lack of an auto-sleep function. If it's on, it'll stay on until it dies or you turn it off. Fortunately, if you triple-tap the play button on the side, you get an audio reading from a British lady of approximately how much time you have left until you need to charge. And speaking of controls...INTERFACE: You get 2 buttons: a power button, and a play button. It takes a bit of time before you learn how to play, skip, pause, volume up/down, etc, but when once you get it, you're good. I'd rather have a set of headphones with as few buttons as possible than a set with like 4-5 different buttons scattered everywhere. Also, I don't know if this works with other headphones, but if you connect it to your smartphone and use Sennheiser's custom music app to listen to your music, you can enable a spatial emulator of sorts to increase the soundstage artificially. From what I can tell, it actually works and your music sounds like it's coming from outside your ears instead of being beamed into your brain. It does make your music quieter, so turn up that volume.TL;DR : Get these if you care about sound quality. Get Bose QuietComfort if you care about not hearing the din of the air conditioning in your one-room apartment. Get Beats if you care about fitting in at high school.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Do you hate it when you stand up after forgetting your headphones are plugged in and it just kind of jerks the cable out?

(aluminum headband)They fit over my ears.Adjustable.Amazing battery life.Haven't cut out once.Easy controlsNice case.Sound is clear and crisp*view my negative though.Warranty- Make sure you buy from a certified buyer (amazon LLC is) The first pair i bought was on Ebay and he said they came with warranty but after I received them I called Sennheiser and they verified he wasn't a qualified seller.NegativeExpensive (get what you pay fore though)Not a big fan of the noise canceling- Gives a slight humming sound, but does cut down on the background noise a lot. I can hear my PC running then turn on the headphones and it goes mute. I can still hear my TV next to me though, but definitely cuts down on the noise.Sound- They won't make your ears bleed...they get loud but not real loud.. I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting. The bass is OK- but certainly not low or powerful. I was a bit disappointed in not having a bass boost option.",5.0 out of 5 stars,No regrets

    ","sound quality is flawless.  No surprise here coming from Sennheiser as they are the no.1 high-end headphone manufacturer in the world.The main complain is the size of the ear cup, it is too small.  I don't have huge ears but these cups make my ear very uncomfortable.  I wear them at work almost all the time so this is a big issue for me.  Also once a while the Bluetooth pairing doesn't work smoothly with my PC laptop.  this may not be Sennheiser's fault since most of the time rebooting Windows makes everything work again.  Could be Microsoft, they are just bad.  Unfortunately the company only have PC's.I am getting a pair of Definitive Technology Symphony 1  since they have bigger ear cup.  I will see how that works for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars,ear cup size is too small.
24,"on November 7, 2016",,"Just received these a couple days ago and am extremely pleased with them!  They paired almost instantly with my Note 7 and computers at home at work.  Sound quality seems to be quite good and balanced.  I have a pair of Senn HD700's at home and while the Momentums are not 700's, they are much more balanced than the Bluedio R+ I had previously.  Construction is MUCH better than the Bluedios with a leather-covered stainless band and earpads.I am blown away by the active noise cancelling!  While I highly doubt I'll be trying them out in an airplane anytime soon, they worked very well in a fairly noisy apartment with a noisy neighbor upstairs and a washing machine running in the next room.  I couldn't even tell the washer was running or if the idiot upstairs was even around!!  During the day I work in a laser lab with a fairly high ambient noise level and these cans simply cut the background noise to nil - verrry nice!Controls consist of a on/off pushbutton and a 3-way switch which controls everything else.  All controls are on the rear of the right-hand ear cup and are readily accessible with your right thumb.  On/off, volume up/down and pause/unpause are intuitive.  The other music controls like next/previous song and fast-forward/backward are not as intuitive.  Maybe they'll become so with more than a day's use.  That's my only real complaint - do you push the 3-way switch two or three times, when do you hold down?  I feel Sennheiser could have done a better job there.RIGHT after I received these, I saw that Sennheiser had released a new model of wireless headphone, the PXC 550.  I'm real curious as to how these two models compare to each other!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice bluetooth headphones!

    ","I purchased these used from Amazon's Warehouse Deals, and I have really been happy with my purchase.  I wasn't ""blown away"" like I was the first time I moved from my ""run-of-mill headphones and ear buds for the masses"" to my first set of Shure in-ear monitors.  But so far, these sound noticeably better than any of my premium in-ear headphones--even my Shure SE420s that I had re-packaged in shells custom-molded for my ears.  As I had hoped, the bass on these were better defined than with my Shures, and the bass and high-end weren't over-the-top as with my UE9000s in wireless mode.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, that even the mids and high end sounded better to me with these Momentum 2.0 Wireless than with my custom-molded in-eat monitors...  There is better clarity and separation, and the treble is just bright enough to be enjoyable for me.I realize that my hearing (frequency) range is a lot narrower now than when I first got my Shures, so my preference for these new Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless over my other headphones may be because my old ears can no longer pick up the full range of sound offered by my in ear monitors.  I'm just very happy with the sound quality from these Sennheisers.  I've used them on a pair of flights from the US to Asia, and in the 20-hour-plus time I spent on the two planes on the trip over, these worked well to cut down on the plane's noise enough to let me enjoy the detail of my music. They were comfortable even after 20 hours of almost continuous use. And the battery lasted for the entire trip with Bluetooth on!  Incredible!!!Prior to purchasing these, I tried a pair of Sony SDR-A1BT as well as some of Sony's cheaper Bluetooth headphones, and I was not impressed with the Sony's.  The Sony's just do not have enough separation and clarity for me: instruments come through more ""muddled"" together compared to my in ear monitors.  Plus the touch and swipe controls on the high-end Sony Bluetooth headphones was inaccurate and very finicky-- could tell after a minute of use I would not like them.The styling of these Sennheisers is very nice...  That's genuine leather on the padding you see in Amazon's photos of these.  They really are very light and comfortable even with my eyeglasses on.I've read of other users online complaint of the Sennheiser Momentums dropping Bluetooth connectivity, but I haven't experienced any connectivity issues. On the contrary, Bluetooth connected very quickly when turned on, and I'm able to is ten to my music from my iPhone 6 un-interrupted even when I leave my phone on my nightstand and walk from room to room in my house.  I wonder if the connectivity complaints were related to the previous generation Momentums or perhaps the other users' phones or environment.The controls are very well placed, very responsive, and rather intuitive having used other Bluetooth headphones before.The noise cancellation is good, but they do not match Bose's noise cancellation.  They are good enough, however, that I was able to enjoy my music on my recent flights from the east coast US to Southeast Asia. The airplane's engine noise came through, but much of the loudest low-frequency hum was cut back to a reasonable level.  It's just enough for me to still enjoy the detail in my music.I am enjoying my music more because of these headphones.The only con with these headphones is the price...  They're pricey enough that I was willing to wait for a good deal for a used set from Amazon's warehouse deals instead of paying full retail price for them new.  Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Bluetooth headphones I've ever used

    ","Pros:- Sound is great (Spotify ""Extreme Quality"" setting, Bluetooth AptX)- Ear cups are super soft. No soreness/fatigue on ears after extended listening.- I like the looks- Sennheiser warranty support is easy, with quick turnaround- Bluetooth connection happens VERY fast- Two saved Bluetooth profiles is useful for switching between multiple devices (e.g. Playstation Vita and phone)Cons:- Heavy- No padding on headband. Makes my head sore after ~1hr of use.- Quality control issues? Had to send in to Sennheiser for replacement within first month (see below for specific details)- Overpriced?- No microphone on supplied audio cord- Can't disable noise-cancelling featureThe sound on these are pretty killer. The ear cups are super, duper soft and feel great, even after lengthy periods of listening.As these are my first noise-cancelling headphones, I can't comment on how well it works, but I like it and the effect is very noticeable. However, there are times when I wish I could disable the noise-cancelling feature.These are relatively heavy (at least, compared to my wired Sennsheiser HD 280 headphones) and that weight is felt via the unpadded headband. In my opinion, this entirely offsets the amazing feel of the earcups. Now, instead of my ears getting sore, the crown of my head gets sore. I usually notice the soreness developing after about an hour of listening. This was nearly a deal-breaker for me, but I liked the earcups and the sound so much, that I decided I'd keep them and try to manage the headband-induced soreness on my head.The first pair I received had some sort of noise-cancelling defect - sharp, loud sounds (i.e. while riding public transit) produced a popping/knocking noise in the right earcup. I also would occasionally experience feedback in the left earcup (this wasn't reproducible, so I couldn't pinpoint the cause). For a set of headphones that vary in price from $350 - $500, this was disappointing. However, Sennheiser warranty service was quick and hassle-free. The replacement set I received do not have these issues. This suggests a quality control problem somewhere, which is also disappointing.Although a minor quibble, it's disappointing that the supplied cord doesn't have a microphone. Since these are intended to be used wirelessly, I understand the decision to not include this. However, for anyone wanting to use these with the Playstation 4 system (PS4), be aware that you will be unable to connect these to the PS4 via Bluetooth (thanks, Sony) and since the Sennheiser cord doesn't have a microphone, you won't be able to chat when you plug the headphones into the PS4 controller. There is a replacement cable available that does have a built-in microphone, but for headphones that can be priced as high as $500, I don't think it's too much to ask that they receive all the perks that their lower-end brethren have.In regards to using these for wireless phone calls, I can't comment on that, as I haven't used them for that purpose to date.Overall, I think they're mostly worth what I paid for them ($350), but if I had paid more than that, I would have returned them based on the lack of padding on the headband.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound and ear cups are great!

The sound separation, sound quality, and the clarity of the soundstage is quite spectacular. I have yet to hear anything in this price range that comes close.

34,"on June 26, 2016",,"I am writing this review based on my first impression since they just arrived so my feeling may change over time, I will try to remember to come back with updates if anything noteworthy changes. The reason I purchased this headset was because I had a need to be able to talk on the phone through a headset and I dislike earbuds. I also have some hifi sensibilities (my go to headphones for a standard music session are a pair of audeze lcd2 I own) rather than trying to jury rig those to some kind of mic I felt like a wireless option would suit my needs better and be less risky than packing the bulky and expensive lcd 2 around. I am pleased with this sennheiser set for my purposes, they're decent sounding and are fairly light and comfortable. The battery life and connectivity seem good so far. My only real complaint after 8-9 hours of use is that the adjustments seem to get loose while in use. I initially got the ear cups positioned and adjusted the headband for a comfortable but snug fit, an hour or two later I got up and went to pick something up and they about swung off my head when I bent down. They seem to be fine if I make adjustments occasionally but that's a bit frustrating coming from several sets that have no trouble staying fixed in place. Other information I had read also gave me the impression these could be connected to two devices at the same time (I presumed meaning for example I could listen to music from my phone while say playing a video on my computer) I seemed to have no trouble connecting both my phone and a Bluetooth 4.0 transmitter attached to an audio cable at the same time, however whichever device connected last is the one that produced sound. If there's some method to simultaneously use two connected devices at once I have not figured it out. It's rare that I would need to do that but it is a little disappointing since there are times where on my wired setups I can achieve that with a simple audio switch box. Overall I am confident these will be perfectly suitable for my primary need of walking and talking on the phone simultaneously, with the option to listen to some music on the go the rest of the time, and I won't feel like I'm missing out on sound quality too much.A new observation since the original review is that the processing or codec being applied to these seems to not handle lower volume elements well. For example background music sometimes gets choppy while character voices sound clear and well rendered. This is frustrating a little when the primary sounds are more subtle, for example I was watching the latest episode of game of thrones and there were some church bells ringing, the initial bell sound was registering but the sustained sound after that which is a lot more soft was choppy. As such this set is probably suitable for music conforming to the loudness war, but not as good for dynamic recordings.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice set for cruising around town.

I prefer the comfort of this over-the-ear option when compared to the in-ear and on-ear options offered by those other devices.

    ","These headphone are amazing for the most part. They sound incredible. They're incredibly comfortable. They look beautiful (in my opinion). The option to listen either through a cable or wirelessly is great. The active noise cancellation is unobtrusive (no hiss) but effective. (Though if that's the feature you care about most, the Bose products have a bit of a leg up). I've had no problems with the bluetooth connection (on an Iphone 5). The only design flaw is that there is no indication light telling you if/when the headphones are on, and they don't turn off automatically, so it's easy to forget to turn them off and waste the headphones' battery. There's one other amazing feature that isn't advertised very widely: That is, it will play music directly through a USB connection to your computer. The sound quality of this (when it's working - see below) is fantastic because it never has to go through an analogue conversion. It's some of the best sound I've heard on headphones period. HOWEVER, this is also the feature that I've had consistent problems with. For some reason, the playback through the USB connection (on Windows 10) is plagued with glitches and stutters. I've tried everything to solve this problem - even to the point of doing a clean install of windows. It doesn't matter what audio player I use, or what other programs I'm running. I'm told by my tech-geek friends that the issue is a faulty driver - but I have the most recent one that Sennheiser put out, so.... ?

That said, they are not worth the MSRP $500.The sound cancellation can feel disorienting at times, with a discrepancy occurring between left and right ears. Walking through Chicago, the signal would drop out a lot. I couldn't tell if it was the processing of loud noises or if the Bluetooth would just crap out with my phone in my pocket.The foam pads feel really nice.

They're cheaper, feel just as good on my head, and the sound is still great. The noise cancellation is a level above, and the signal doesn't crap out when walking through the city.

I'd give the Plantronics a slight edge on recognizing voice (calls, dictation) over these, but on all other aspects I'd rate these as good or better.  I am picky about music and find these excellent.  They are not the overbassed headphones you get if you buy Beats, but I would not want that.  They do produce very nice, tight bass if you like your music real (e.g. the opening drum hit in live version of the Eagles ""Hotel California"" sounds great).  The Avantree Audition headphones are a good deal for the price ($69) but clearly outclassed by these in every way (except price).  I use the Avantree when sweating away on the elliptical machine.  I use these when I want serious music time or when riding (not driving) in the car and talking on the phone or dictating into my iPad.  In a quiet environment, the person on the other end thinks I sound great; in a car, it is not as good as holding a phone up to your mouth (again, riding, not driving).  I found the comfort to be good, but my ears are on the small side.  On the whole, very happy with these headphones.  YMMV, but after buying, trying, and returning others, I think these are the keepers.  I did have to order them on Amazon and then wait for 10 weeks for them to be available.  No issues with Bluetooth dropout though.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm happy I tried the others, but I'm sticking with these!"

    ","This is an amazing set of headphones.  The technology packed within these cans are incredible--the bluetooth connects instantly, the nfc works effortlessly, the charging is seam-less, and the physical buttons are snappy.  I pair the device with my phone and pc and it jumps between the two without needing to unpair from any devices.  The battery lasts over 20 hours of continuous wireless usage and you can continue listening afterwards by plugging in the wire if you can't charge it immediately.  Personally, I enjoy its looks.  Its sleek lines, shiny metal, soft leather, and minimal use of plastic exude refinement, luxury, and class without being too showy.  Weighing over 200g, it doesn't feel heavy.  I don't feel any pressure at the top of my head and the pressure around the ears are minimal.  The ear cups are of perfect size and comfort.  The sound is well balanced from low bass to high notes.  I listen mainly to house, trance, and edm music that lies heavily within the low to mid range and I thoroughly enjoy the sound; the bass has a strong presence without overpowering the other ranges.  The sound is clear without noise even at maximum volume.  I love the convenience of wireless.  No more wire snagging on doorknobs; no more pulling the phone in and out to change songs or answer calls; no more wire tangles.  Unfortunately, the wireless does sacrifice the sound quality a bit.  If you want to hear the headphones at its best, just plug in its wire.  Phone quality is good.  The cans contain speakers that allow you to hear yourself talk at almost the volume as you are currently speaking (in other words, despite it being over ear and noise cancelling, it allows you to hear yourself so you don't have to scream).  The noise cancelling works pretty well without interfering with what you're listening to.Overall, if you have the budget for one and thinking about it, then get it.  If the price is bothering you, then wait until next year when the price drops and get it.  For me, it is worth every penny.",5.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for.

It's made from top shelf materials and it is comfortable to wear with great battery life.Most importantly they sound second to none.

    ","I just received these about an hour ago, so haven't had a chance to try them in the real world. But I was looking for comparison reviews when shopping, so wanted to add one more. When shopping I was mainly comparing these to the Bowers & Wilkins P7 wireless, and I own a pair of the original Monster Beats headphones (white). I was never able to do a direct comparison to the P7s for sound, unfortunately, but the P7s might have fit just a bit better. But the 2.0s are very comfortable, and the quality of the construction is extremely good. They're very light and the leather ear cups are incredibly plush. Since I own a pair of the Monster Beats (which I've always loved), I was able to directly compare the two. First, in terms of comfort and quality of construction, the 2.0s win hands-down. There is no comparison. In terms of audio quality, I first compared the two headphones wired. The Beats were louder (which was nice), and they definitely had more bass. The Sennheisers sound better in the mid-ranges and seem to be a little less muddy. I don't think one wins over the other here. Comparing the Sennheiser wireless to both the wired option and the Beats, again, no comparison... wired is better. The wireless connection has a much thinner sound, and I suspect I will use the wire whenever possible. Ultimately, if you need to upgrade your headphones, I think you'll be very happy with these.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very high quality construction- quick comparison to Monster Beats (originals)

    ","In my opinion, just as comfortable as the Bose Quiet Comfort 35 with slightly smaller ear pads, but sounds much better in all range, especially if you are a base lover. I found the headphone produces more bass in the Bluetooth mode than in the wired mode. It is a bit on the heavier side with about 265 grams, 30 grams more than the QC 35. Still, that's a noticeable amount of difference. Also, the metal band allows you to manually adjust contact pressure yourself. However, the head band is inelastic and once it was stretched, it cannot return to original position and contact pressure, which a deadly downside of this headphone",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound, Weight, and Contact Pressure"

    ","I purchased a set of Bose QC35s and after a week with the Bose I got my the set of Momentum 2.0s. After spending a few weeks with both I feel like I can accurately compare the two.Sennheiser Momentum 2.0+SoundExcellent! While the Bose sounded almost muffled, my music came through the Momentums sounding wonderful. I am not an audio expert so I cannot talk about the exact specifics, for those just look at the many other reviews, but these sound great. Music sounds very clear and enjoyable.+StyleThe Momentums have such a unique look and I really like it. There are quite a few other Bose headphones at my office so I feel like the Momentums stand out and people often ask about them.+Battery & ChargingI think the Momentums outlast the Bose by a few hours or so. Also, the charging cable included with the Momentums is long enough that you can charge it while you listen. With the Bose, the cable is about 6 inches making it impossible to charge and listen at the same time so I had to use other earpods while I charged those.Bose QC35+Noise CancelingBose absolutely destroys the Momentums here. The Quiet Comforts block 90% of the outside sound out while the Momentums do block some sound but let some through, maybe closer to blocking 70% or so. However, once the music is playing there really is not much of a difference.+ComfortThese headphones are very comfortable and wearable for a long time. With the Momentums, the headband is not cushioned and hurts my head after a while of wearing them.+ControlsBoth headphones have a similar switch to control volume and play/pause but the Bose have a superior power switch where you can clearly tell that the headphones are on or off. The Momentums have a power button and no status light so I have ended up turning them off when I thought I was turning them on and vice versa. Also, the Bose tell you the power level when you turn them on while the Momentums don't, instead you have to triple click the control button while music is not playing...That is it for the comparison. Both headphones come with nice cases and adapters and at this point are pretty similar in price. I think the decision is pretty simple, if you want the best sound go with the Momentums and if you need headphones for long flights that block as much noise as possible then go with the Bose.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 vs Bose QC35 after owning both

    ","$500 for wireless headphones....they better be good, right?  Hopefully my feedback is valuable to anyone in the market.Environment:  I use these with my iPhone 6S.  I commute by train (BART in San Francisco, CA) and wear them for roughly 30 minutes, twice a day, five days a week.  I listen to a combination of talk/interview podcasts and music.Reasons for buying:  Entertainment and ambient noise cancellation/reduction are necessities for me on BART.  I recently had both ear drums intubated and as a result suffered significant low frequency hearing loss.  Simultaneiously, I'm much more sensitive to high frequency sounds.  Ultimately, I wanted a set of headphones that would offer solid noise cancellation and quality sound reproduction.Cliff Notes:  These are awesome headphones.  Noise cancellation is great.  Audio quality is great.  They're not too heavy, although they are a bit bulky when stuffing ina backpack (as expected).  Battery life is outstanding.  Given the limitations of the form factor, there are no real weaknesses here.  However, if you're looking for a solution to answer and receive calls, the mic placement requires you to speak more loudly than normal...very uncomfortable in a public setting.  Also worth noting that compressed audio delivered via Bluetooth will never satisfy an audiophile.Details...the good:  Sound quality is great.  Noise cancellation is terrific.  A+ on both counts, which alone validates the expense.  These are very comfortable to wear, they seem to be quite well constructed, and they're plenty portable...as you factor in the over-the-ear design.  There are on-ear models that cost less and fit better in small bags, but for me this side of that compromise was a no-brainer.  If noise cancellation is more a necessity than a convenience for you, and if you cherish extracting as much of the audio experience as possible, I believe you'll be very happy.Details....the bad:  Very little to say here.  If you really like to crank up the volume, you'll be disappointed when using these in wireless form.  I read about this up front and was prepared for it - the impedance of the speakers is higher than in other sets, so you're limited.  On a few occasions I have wished for a bit more oomph, but overall I run just shy of max volume.  Note that this not an issue when wired.  These really come to life when you feed them some power from an external pre-amp or even a tablet or computer with a bit more headroom.  Otherwise, just keep in mind that using the headset for telephone conversations is a bit awkward since you need to speak up quite a bit for the mic to pick up your voice.  And, if you're commuting/traveling, the size when folded is likely a bit bigger than you'd like.  Again, these are really nit picks as both are quite obvious before you click to buy.Conclusion:  Expensive, but worth the money.  If you can justify the expense, I think you'll be very happy.  I'm ecstatic, especially so in regard to the noise cancellation functionality.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive but worth the money

    ","The built quality felt excellent, great leather head band, aluminum sides, plush leather ear piece. Bluetooth worked great right out the box, no pairing issues (seemed like they fixed the bluetooth issue).The sound quality was underwhelming to say the least. The high's aren't very clear. I compared this to the HD598's, and the HD598 in some aspect was just as clear if not more than the Momentum's. I expected more from Sennheiser in reproducing the best stereo fidelity, especially for a product that costs well over $400.It may be unfair to compare a wireless product to a wired headphone in terms of sound quality, but I believe the technology is capable of reproducing high fidelity sound quality, and the Momentum's just didn't do it for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Uncharacteristic sound fidelity & clarity from Sennheiser

    ","These were disappointing. I had purchased the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 set of these, and was hoping that these would be almost identical, but wireless. The noise cancelling works pretty well, though not as well as the Bose QuietComfort 25. The problem, as with the other noise cancellation systems I've heard, is that there is still an audible hiss, even in silent rooms.The sound of these when plugged in, using passive mode, is nearly identical to the wired Momentum 2.0. The wireless sound is good, but has the hiss discussed above.The problem that I had is that the ear cups are not as soft and plush as the wired Momentum 2.0, and are much more shallow. I don't have huge ears, but the inside of the cups on the wireless pushed them against my head. The wired version has plenty of room and feels a lot more natural. The shallow ear cup makes these headphones feel hot and cramped.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"A step up in convenience from the wired model, but a step down in comfort"

82,"on September 18, 2016",,"I bought these headphones after extensive research, looking for wireless over-ear headphones with top end audio quality and with active noise cancelling. I am totally satisfied with the Momentums which are exactly what I was looking for. They sound great, they are very comfortable, they seem to be strong and sturdy, and the NC is entirely good enough. However, as another reviewer also noticed, for the NC to work optimally you need to hold your head at a very specific angle about 10 degrees to the left and tilted 10 degrees downwards - this is only apparent when on an aircraft with rumble from all  directions, and when listening to low volume classical music or movie dialogue, and is quite subtle, but once you notice it, you can't un-notice it. The comparisons are the the Sennheiser PCX-550 (which I haven't had a chance to look at), the Parrot Zik and the Bose Quietcomfort. With regard to the Parrot, the sound quality and comfort are all on a par. Compared to the Bose, I think the audio quality and comfort are marginally better with the Momentum. The main differences are the controls and the appearance. To me, the Parrots' controls are too complex and the appearance is too fancy and ostentatious; the Bose are fine but too common, everyone seems to have one.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Ticked all the boxes

Besides noise canceling, I needed to stream music and have excellent clarity when talking on the phone. And of course, I didn't want any cables or wires.I have other Sennheiser headphones and knew the sound would be excellent.

    ","Tested along with Sony MDR-1000x, Sennheiser PXC-550 and Bose QC35, on Nexus 6p and iPad Air 2Pros* Great battery life* Same sound as the wired version, except, with better bass, not overwhelming, but there when music demands it. In other words, perfection. Not thumping bass but bass nonetheless. I am a basshead I admit, so if it had just a smidgen more bass, I would give it a 5.* Good noise canceling. On a scale of 1 to 10 when it comes to detecting noise, while the music is playing, gets a 7.5 out of 10 (compared to the QC35, which gets 9.5/10. With the music off, you will hear almost everything going on around you, but as if someone turned the noise down about 65%, thus 6.5/10 (compared to 8.5/10 for the QC35)* Supports Multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, i.e. the ability to be connected to two devices at the same time and seamlessly switch between the devices.* Acts as an external DAC when connected to either the Nexus 6P or a computer via USB.* Fast first time connection (via NFC on Android)Cons* The play/pause/skip/volume button is a little shaky. Wish it were a little bit more firm. Its easy to change volumes when just trying to change a track for instance.* Of all 4 headphones, this has the weakest range. Drops off in certain areas with phone in pocket. Yes, this is the Rev 2 version.* While being able to connect to two devices at the same time, I don't use it. The Momentum will switch from one device to the other, even for system sounds. Imagine listening to music on the phone, turn the other (the iPad in this case), you, for instance, start typing (a system sound), the headphone will to switch to the iPad (unlike the QC35, which will NOT switch to the iPad, unless I paused music on the phone and vice versa).* No state indicator, i.e. there is no way to know if the thing is on or not.* Won't turn off automatically, the only device in the group without this functionality.Other* Choose it over the other headphones.* No supporting Anroid/iOS app. Yes, there exists CapTune, but unless you use the app to listen to music, it is practically useless.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Almost perfection,..., almost."

    ","I am a novice to headphones so recently tried a few headphones and finally found what I was looking for in the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless.  As a bit of background, I commute daily and was looking for a pair of wireless headphones that would deliver great sound and some noise cancelling benefits.  I am by no means an audiophile.  I tried the Bose Soundlink IIs and the Bose Quiet Comfort 35.  While those were comfortable, lightweight and offered great noise cancelling (the QC 35s), I found the sound to be flat.  The music was clear and did not distort at extreme volume levels, but I found the sound to be sort of lifeless.  As good as the noise cancelling was, my top priority is great sound.The Sennheiser M2s have delivered exactly what I wanted -- great, punchy sound with strong beats.  Music sounded louder at similar volumes that I tested with the Bose headsets.  Yes, the noise cancellation is not as good as the Bose, but it delivers enough for what I need.  Further sealing the deal is the premium quality of these headphones.  It's made of nice looking leather and metal for a cool retro look.  These feel slightly heavier than the Bose, but I have used them comfortably without issue.  The over-ear style fits perfectly, the headphones are easy to pair with a mobile device and I found the controls easier to use compared to Bose.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally Found What I was Looking For

    ","Been a fan of Sennheiser for a decade plus I decided to upgrade my work and home Senns.  At home I opted to head to the 650s and get the Schiit Stack (Magni 2 Uber / Modi 2 Uber) which I will review separately, while at work I wanted to try a wireless Sennheiser for the first time.The first attempt was the Urbanite XL, I returned this as it was too uncomfortable and I didn't care for the odd touch control mechanism or the muddy/bassy sound.  Upon their return I decided to spring for the Momentum 2 wireless model.  I got these before the 650s so it was my first step up to a higher quality 'rung' from the 598s.  The packing and fit and finish are quite attractive.  I have the Ivory 598s and love the color so opted for those in the Momentum 2s with its silver and brown leather topping it off.I haven't had noise cancelling phones before, nor closed back for that matter, so the soundstage was very different. It is very enveloping using them at work, I had to adjust my seating so I could use my peripheral vision as people would keep sidling up to me because I couldn't hear their approach! Laugh.The headphones are physically quite comfortable now having been in use for a few months, though they do not cover my ears completely like the 598s or 650s the leather cups are very soft and supple and don't fatigue me.  They fold up nicely for their trips to and from work.  The controls are much preferred to the Urbanite's button-less slider.  Much easier to control volume and pause, fwd, etc. I've had no problem with Bluetooth connectivity (audio drop outs etc.) from my Lumia 950XL nor my tower when I use the Avantree Leaf BT Adapter.Finally, the sound is rich and smooth, laugh. Though not backless with an airy soundstage like the 650s, I do find it imminently listenable and it does have more of a bass presence.  They're 'different', but both sound excellent.All around, a great combo of build quality, looks, comfort, wireless convenience and sound.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"All around, a great combo of build quality, looks, comfort, wireless convenience and sound."

    ","These headphones sound great wired and, since rev02, have good bluetooth connectivity. They are comfortable and don't suffer from the small earcups of momentum series v1.So why did I return mine?I failed to heed the warnings of other reviewers. Noise canceling can NOT be turned off in wireless mode. The noise canceling implementation will fatigue your ears quickly. Within 30 seconds of wearing the headphones with no sound playing, I had to take them off. The ANC feature was applying  pressure on my ear drums that will very quickly tire any user. If you listen to music for extended periods, this is NOT the headphone for you.In their wired and ""Off""/Passive mode, they sound fantastic for a closed around-ear headphone.  My suggestion is to GET THE WIRED VERSION. They are much cheaper, a bit lighter and share the same driver as the wireless version.Sennheiser should listen to customers and allow disabling ANC in version 3.0.

    ","These are an easy five-star rating. For me. Just like with speakers, not every pair of cans is for every pair of ears. And, it's hard to do a lot of side-by-side shopping so you have to go with your gut feel and reviews with headphones that aren't commonly found in Best Buy stores, except Magnolia, or other high-end outlets. And, above all else, your source material will have a huge impact. Don't listen to old .mp3 files you grabbed off Napster and pronounce a set of cans good or bad. Try some Spotify extreme downloads to get a good idea of how they sound.I appreciate a brighter sound and these definitely have that. Mids and bass are still there and quite tight. I typically use an iPhone with the equalizer set to ""off"" or ""Jazz"" with some ""Rock"" thrown in depending on the recording and genre. Again, that can greatly influence your perception of the music but I've found these to be very much to my liking. If you like the characteristics of Beats, Bose or anything else, go with what makes your listening experience the most enjoyable. $499 is a lot of glue but Amazon had them marked down around $125 and I had a gift card, putting them at a price point well below the Bose, which were my second choice.As for the other headphones I tried, it was pretty much left to what BB has in a typical store - Bose, Beats, JBL and Sony. There's others I'm missing but these are common in pretty much every BB. I also tried the high-end Sonys, B&W and a few others (names escape me now) at a Magnolia and the Sennheiser's still won out.Build quality is outstanding. Besides Bose being a little too warm/less detailed for me, I don't believe they feel as solid. The metal bands extending all the way below the cups make the Senns look and feel rugged. They're also unbelievably comfortable. There's not much padding on top but they're easy to wear for long periods. For me, a long period is an two hours at the gym. Bose were also comfortable and the Beats weren't bad but I had more of sense of them ""being up top.""Included travel case and accessories are of good quality and the included cord with 3.5mm connections has a nice twist-and-lock feature when securing to one of the cups. I haven't done a lot of corded listening but you will notice increased volume but I can't speak to any differences with clarity/detail although there should be some there relative to BlueTooth.I've had a few connection drops and they occur with my phone about three feet away.

    ","I just got it yesterday - it sounds Fantastic on all my devices - Samsung Note 3, Ipad Air 2 and even my WiiU games from controller.I was hesitant to spend $400 for a headphone, but after using it, I realized this was a great investment for personal enjoyment. I do have HD598 open back, and when I did back to back comparison, it proves that this M2 is a major upgrade. I'm not sure if I will use 598 anymore.598 is good on it's own, with the cool design (white) and the openness of the sound, but it is kind of bulky and I cannot really hung on my neck as it's too big. When I first opened the box of this Momentum 2 (M2), I was surprised of the compactness - I thought I got on-ear headphone by mistake, but it sure was over-the-ear ! It is very light and feels much lighter even when using with the cord (light cord, which is appropriate) and I just did not want to take it off after I started using it. It did not get hot at all.When I first listen to music via my Note 3, I was pleasantly surprised to experience a GREAT sound - TIGHT bass and really CLEAR sound overall.Noise cancellation is excellent as well - we have a noisy central heater and my wife always watching tv in the same room. But no more ! I can hardly hear any background when I turned up the volume. I can hear them when low volume though. It's as if I said ""SHHHHHH!"" and everything stopped !When I use cord, I do hear big difference between passive (power off) and active (power on) mode - I guess it's because noise cancellation is automatically turned ON when power it on, everything sounds so much more ooomph, to your face when ON mode. It was specially apparent when I used it with WiiU controller withe Splatoon. The sounds gotten so much more exciting, louder, more expansive when I powered ON.From PC, I tried connecting direct with USB (using M2 as DAC) and direct cable connect, but sound was OK, but when I used Fiio DAC/amplifier, the sound was so much better.All in all, this headhpone does EVERYTHING you want - with noise cancelling, and cord for the non-bluetooth devices (also great if you run out of M2 battery). I can hardly think of any cons at this time except that it was $$$, but all good things comes with price... Also I will have to see the reliability for longer term.You will be a MUSIC lover and realize what you were missing when you use this headphone.I highly recommend it !",5.0 out of 5 stars,FANTASTIC sounding all around headphone for any situation.

    ","There are a lot of choices for headsets out there. After reading and watching tons of reviews I decided to get the Momentum 2.0 Wireless. The main reason I got these headsets was the look of them. To me they look like traditional old-timey headset that I would be proud to have years down the line. Sennheiser also has a fantastic reputation of good quality sound and build. You could tell from listening to the headsets in both its wired and wireless forms the audio really stands out. There is a difference between the two, but honestly, it minimal compared to other Bluetooth headsets with the passive wired option.The function of the headset is essentially what I was looking for: the convenience of connecting to two devices at the same time; charging and using the headset simultaneously; great sound in all the ways it connects; some noise canceling but not so good that I feel I’m closed off to the world (get the BOSE qt35 if you want fantastic noise canceling, personally I just think it’s too much); and finally the comfort and build of the product.I find the passive audio with the USB was cool, but my computer has Bluetooth so I much rather just turn the headphones on and connect through that instead of relying on the USB (the USB connection doesn’t recognize sometimes), plus with the Bluetooth I could use the microphone on the headset. When using the wired passive mode with the 3.5 mm connection, I recommend getting an in-line microphone along with the headset otherwise you can’t use it to talk on the phone. This to me was stupid on Sennheisers part not to include the in-line microphone. You would think for the price they would include it. <sad face>The Bluetooth range is average 10 meters or so which is kinda low compared to others in the market. I read reviews about Bluetooth being bad, but so far I didn't have any issues. The button and controls are well placed; I have an affinity towards actual buttons rather than touch sensors. I hate it when I accidentally make a gesture or the annoying delay for touch sensors to recognize what I’m doing.At the time of my purchase, the Momentum 2.0 Wireless and the additional in-line microphone combined was cheaper than the BOSE qt35. I would recommend this device at below a $350 price tag. The device is simple, elegant, and consistent in all the ways you use it. Good purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simple, Elegant, and Consistent.

    ","I bought this headset primarily to replace my gaming headset because I wanted something with active noise cancellation but great audio quality. I've flipped flopped on wanting to return these several times. Ultimately I decided not to, because despite this product's failings I still think it's the closet thing on the market to meeting my needs. Still it doesn't leave me impressed with Sennheiser (a brand I've bought several times)Pros:Audio quality is great.StylishHigh build qualityNoise cancellation is great IF you're playing music relatively loudCons:Mic picks up everything in a 3-block radiusQuality falls off a roof if mic is enabled - Actually a limitation of bluetooth but something I wasn't aware of before purchase. Enabling the mic falls back to ""voice"" quality audio: read - two cans with a string between themPC-UnfriendlyPC-Unfriendly x2Can't seem to get very loudMeh:ComfortSo lets list some of the limitations:Noise Cancelling: You MUST connect via bluetooth (audio quality suffers slightly) or USB.Mic: Using this will TANK your audio quality. Don't expect to be able to chat and listen to music.Mic #2: You must use the bluetooth or USB mode. 3.5mm disables the micBluetooth: Will automatically connect to any devices you have paired. This means if you have paired your phone and want to listen on your PC via USB (the best way to use these). You'll have to unpair or turn off your phone's bluetooth.PC Bug #1: If you do not DISABLE the mic on the headset, attempting to use ANY mic on your computer will cause your audio quality to tank.PC Bug #2: Sometimes you have to reboot your machine to get it to detect that the headset is plugged in via USB.PC Bug #3: Using the MIC over USB still tanks your audio quality, even though it shouldn't (since you aren't using bluetooth)PC Bug #4: Bluetooth detection on PC is so finicky. I don't know if this is the bluetooth adapter I bought or the headset. Given the problems with the headset I'd been having, I'm going to go with a sennheiser failing on this somehow. Although they did pair fine with my iPhone.Overall, if you're primary use of these is going to be PC, I'd recommend you stay away unless you really really want the noise canceling feature.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sound but usuability is poor

    ","Wow, I really had high expectations for this product.  Especially given the price.  It is competent but the audio quality is sub-optimal in ways I did not anticipate.First: The Noise Canceling.The headphones do a good job of blocking a lot of background noise irrespective of the noise cancellation feature.  With the headphones turned off, they still block a lot of outside sound.  However, turn on the noise canceling function and it is noticeably quieter.  It is however not as quiet as I expected, and some noise bands (lower frequencies) are attenuated more than higher frequencies.Second:  General Audio Quality.Here is where I was most disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, these are fairly good sounding headphones but certainly not in the league of what half that price will buy you for non noise canceling bluetooth headsets.  Bass is overemphased - more thumpy and dark than a good balanced headphone. Some people may prefer that sound but it is not natural and flat. High frequencies seem veiled like you have a thin blanket over your head and the headphones on the outside.  High hats, snares, fret slides and breathy sounds are muted and the top end is wilted.  There is also a noticeable color and a hollowness in some of the vocal range.  This is present whether blue tooth connected or hard wired.  Of course hard wired sounds better than bluetooth if connected to a high quality source but the same audio compromise still manifests.  I'm 45 years old and my ears can still very clearly hear the finished highs.  I brought an AKG K551 headset a few weeks before for $200 and expected the Senneheisers to sound better.  In actuality the AKG K551's really (unexpectedly) had a substantially clearer and truer soundstage, flatness, clarity and natural sound than the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless.  However I did have to make sure the fit was good on the AKG's.  Until I figured that out I thought the AKG's were lacking bass.  However fitted correctly all is now very good.  I have decided I cannot accept the downgrade in quality for the Sennhiesers so I will be returning them - the noise canceling feature is not that great and not worth the $300 extra than the AKG's.Third: Build QualityI cannot fault the Sennhiesers here.  Immaculately presented.  Nice carry bag.  Good accessories. Great build quality.  Good size.  Very comfortable. If only they could give me a nice clean,Nnatural, Uncolored, flat EQ response, less thumpy bass, and good crisp high frequencies then this would be a match in heaven. Not good for classical, folk, or vocals and in my opinion the 'pop' EQ really gets in the way of my listening pleasure.  However I'm a purist and can tell great clarity when I hear it.  Other people may prefer the darker more veiled sound.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything except the clarity of sound is great (Sound is thumpy, dark, veiled, and colored)."

    ","I was hesitant to pull the trigger on this purchase, since it was more of a luxury item than a necessity, but I'm glad I did. Excellent sound clarity in all ranges without too much bass boosting. I'm not an audiophile, but I could instantly tell the difference compared to my previous headphones. Volume could be a little louder overall, but it is loud enough for my tastes. Build quality is excellent with an elegant design. Bluetooth connection is strong and stable even when moving away from the BT antenna. The leather ear cups are soft and comfortably filled with memory foam and could be worn for extended periods without fatigue. Noise reduction cannot be turned off on wireless mode and the batter lasts 18-22 hours on a full charge. The level of noise reduction is adequate, though it doesn't drown out all the loud noises around you, but it does the job well enough to make it barely noticeable with music on.The sound in wireless mode is no slouch but as an added bonus, the volume and sound quality gets even better when you plug it in via USB, which suggests that there is some kind of internal amp or DAC. This is not advertised or noted in the manual or box, but was a welcome surprise.There's so much to love with this pair of headphones, I highly recommend it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound quality!

    ","The review you're reading is coming from a guy that's been looking for the best bluetooth headphone for almost 2 years. So I have a lot to say since this one is a contender! I also run a music studio (that's doing quite well) so I'm very opinionated when it comes to sound and I have high expectations of sound/quality and comfort. So get ready for a wordy, but detailed, review!Lots of great things with a couple of turn offs. Let's start with the turn offs, since I think most of the nice things I would point out you'd see in the other reviews.Turn Offs- Noise Cancelling deactivates during a call. It's frustrating that Sennheiser tells me that this is not true unless I have a defective headset but I talked to several ""technical support reps"" that all said that, until 1 finally said it's designed that way so you can hear your voice during calls. I would prefer if it were on during calls, helping me focus on the call and noise cancelling never made talking a struggle. That's definitely a downside for me and the fact Sennheiser didn't seem to be aware of that on the technical support department was lame.- Cups don't swivel too well, meaning that during a walk; small movements will open up little gaps between the contact points of the headphone cups and your face, revealing a bunch of external noise off and on. So that's a bother for sure. The swivel mechanism is interesting. The cups sort of sit on the headband with a ball and socket type connection and it's a little bit stiff and inconsistent. Kind of ruins the listening experience a bit when it happens and it happens often during walks, which I am often on when wearing headphones (grocery shopping, walking, etc)- 1 do-it-all button. 1 button controls the play/pause/volume up and down/next/previous/seek/battery check/voice dial. When you spell it out like that, it's over whelming! And leaving that all up to 1 button and mixing that up with push, or push twice, push 3 times or push and hold, etc...I just get sick of that. There's room for more buttons. It'd be so much faster as the listener to have a couple more buttons to skip a track than use the same one but press 3 times and often accidentally mess up because the timing is awkward, or there's a slight lag or you mess up because the button doubles as a spring-loaded slider for adjusting volume...another little disappointment I was hoping to avoid when accepting that I'll pay around $400 for headphones. Just doesn't seem practical and the experience isn't ideal!The Good!!- Sound is excellent! You really wouldn't know it's bluetooth and the quality/balance is great. I personally think the lower mids could be a bit louder. I feel like it lacks a little bit of that texture you get there but the sub/highs are all very clear and crips and the mids are good too. I specifically mean the lower mids, between sub and mid, could be a bit louder and they just might be perfect for me.- Comfort. Very comfortable. The kind of comfort that lets you sort of forget these are on! I do think the swivel issue would be less of one with a slightly tighter fit that wouldn't affect the comfort, but here I go being picky again.- Battery life/range/durability. Very long battery life, speaks for itself. Batteries either last or they don't and these do! The range is better than most that sound this good, I'm sure. At least of the many pairs I've owned in this price bracket, they have greater range. The simple, non cluttered and non delicate/mostly flexible metal and minimal plastic means there is less to break stuff that is also harder to break. They fold up for easy storage and tuck themselves in.- Noise Cancellation. Very effective! And it deals with the wind quite well. Some headphones are very sensitive to wind and make walking at any speed above 5mph often miserable for listening to music with noise cancelling on (Sony hear on...cough, cough) so it's nice to have effective ANC that will hold up to a light breeze because I want to be able to go outside with these on a nice day. I'll rate them an 8.5/10 if Bose is a 10 and I've tried many, many headphones. That 8.5/10 is strictly considering the effectiveness of noise cancellation in optimal conditions. Ex. being Sony Hear Ons are also an 8.5 until it's windy and then it's about a 1/10 because it blows the wind sound right into your ears and you can't even make out the music anymore, at which point I just turn it off and think about other headphones.Anyway, that's my review! I hope my experience and insight was helpful. I feel I am unusually picky and that some of you will appreciate that while others may not find the issues I found to be issues for them at all, in which case I am very happy for you!! They're worth trying, definitely.These headphones are just a couple of minor tweaks from perfect for me. If the cups swiveled better or there was more padding (or both) then I wouldn't get gaps in the contact points so often and easily. I've actually only encountered this issue/bother with this headphone so I'm really making a point of it. That's the biggest issue for me, honestly! Then, it's that the noise cancelling deactivates during the calls and the do-it-all button follows as the final turn off.I used to not care for the look but I quickly got over than and am now a fan. But that's entirely superficial which is why it's mentioned last...and it turns out I like the look now anyhow. As I'm writing this review, I am still looking. I've tried just about all of the ANC bluetooth headphones except the newest SONY MDR1000x and the Sennheiser PXC 550. As for BOSE, since that headphone is such a reference point, I'll say here that the QC35's are great in every way except that the sound of them is so boring and lifeless to me. It sounds like a bluetooth headphone, if you know what I mean and that's just about the last compromise I'm going to make. I'll take a wire before sacrificing sound but I'm hoping that I don't have to! And I'm willing to spend this kind of money now to achieve that but I'm not quite there...but I'm close. So wish me luck, as I wish you!Thanks again and good luck! I will do my best to answer any questions you may have.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost just what I am looking for!! So close!

    ","In my search for wireless headphones I tried several different sets and these stood out above the rest.  I tried the Plantronics Backbeat Pro, Denon AHGC20 Globe Cruiser, Definitive Technology Symphony 1, V-Moda Crossfade with additional XL Pads and these Sennheiser Momentum 2.0.  After listening to several different genres of music it became clear which one was the best.The Plantronics Backbeat Pro was a nice set of headphones, but I started having issues with the music pausing, starting, pausing, starting and so on because of the ""smart sensors"" not working properly.  I had read several other reviews with this problem and decided these weren't going to work for me.  They were more bass forward which can be good, but sometimes they couldn't render the bass sounds well and it created a buzzing instead of booming.  Sent them back.The Denon AHGC20 Globe Cruiser looked nice out of the box, but the noise cancellation feature felt like it was putting pressure on my ears that was far too uncomfortable to continue with.  These were also very bass heavy and drowned out the mids far too much.  Since I listen to more than just bassy music this was a no-go.  Sent them back.The Definitive Technology Symphony 1 had good sound, but they are very, very bulky.  They make the Plantronics look small.  I needed something that was going to travel relatively well and the case for these is huge.  If you want travel headphones don't get these.  They did well with most genres of music although the mids were a tad held back in favor of the low end bass.  These were the heaviest pair at least from what I could tell.  Sent them back.Now comes the V-Moda Crossfade with additional XL Pads.  Very comfortable.  Very good sound even though they are more bass forward.  The larger (optional) pads really made this a joy to have on.  The main difference between these and the other sets is that these aren't active noise cancelling.  They do a good job of isolating although you can surely hear things around you.  I sent them back after a week.  They are very well made and I would have definitely gone with these if not for the winner in my unscientific testing and the purpose of this review: the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 headphones.The Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 wireless headphones were clearly the most expensive and turned out to be clearly the best for me.  Active noise cancelling works very well.  It doesn't block out everything, but all of the background noises on airplanes and trains were tucked away very nicely.  To me these were very comfortable.  I know some people complain about the earcups being too small, but I have a very large head with larger than average ears and these feel great.  No fatigue after hours of listening.  The way the cups swivel a bit really helps seal them around my ears.  The sound is amazing.  Not too bass heavy although the bass is definitely there in spades.  The music comes through crisp and clear, but not harsh.  I could hear instruments in various jazz music that other headphones were drowning out.  It was like hearing music I have listened to many times before as if it was now new.  These handled every genre of music I threw at them with ease and they provide a wonderful listening experience.  These are also very well made and collapse down into a much more reasonable case for traveling too and they are light.  Top notch in my book.I highly recommend these headphones to anyone who likes to be a part of their music experience and not just be pounded over the head with way too much bass and drowned out vocals.  But if that's what you like then these may not fit the bill for you.  As always your results may vary.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sensational Headphones That Are Well Worth The Price

    ","These headphones are absurdly nice. They are so nice that when I tried my boyfriends pair against my freshly ordered Bose QC35s, I knew the Bose had to go back. Now the Bose makes an excellent wireless play into the market. I had some old QC15s that I put through hell and loved dearly and I thought I'd be Bose loyal forever. While I love my Bose products, these headphones were worth the rigamarole of a return. The sound stage is wider, crisper, cleaner, the bass has true lows and highs. There's more isolation. I noticed superiority actually in the noise cancelling feature during music play while Bose knocks the active noise cancelling out of the park when they are silent. I tested both against a vacuum cleaner and I have to say, it was a tough call. With the QC35s you get notice cancelling superiority, near as good sound, and all the bells and whistles this pair offers.

Since then Bluetooth has resumed working randomly but volume fluctuates wildly cuts in and out. Noise canceling turns itself on and off. I had to order Bose as replacements as I need BT boise canceling for work. Sennheiser is not willing to refund and communication with customer service is terrible.  I'd never buy sennheiser again for any reason.  I'm out the entire purchase price.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Product stopped working, customer service won't answer my calls/emails."

    ","I'm no audiophile, but I bought these headsets over Bose because I value sound quality above all else. On that front — these cans certainly deliver. Music is rich and balanced, with a decent boost on the mid-range that really makes the music shine.The noise cancellation is pretty good. It doesn't eliminate voices at all. Only constant background noises. If you're hoping for a respite from crying infants on trans-continental flights, look elsewhere. The set also creates an ear-jarring popping sound when there's any kind of low frequency vibrational noise around. I hear this all the time on the train, and occasionally on older planes during take-off (when frame vibration is at its highest). It's annoying enough to make me consider jacking in during my commute, to disable noise-cancelling all together.The built-in microphone is completely useless. Even in quiet environments, my girlfriend can't even hear me when I talk through them. This makes me have to take the headsets off to take a call, which is pretty annoying.I love the sound and build quality of this set, but the issues above have me seriously considering sending these back. Hopefully the next generation model will take care of these issues so they can deliver on everything else besides sound quality.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound makes up for a lot, but not everything"

    ","I've only had these headphones for a day, but I'm liking them so far. I got them used for a little over half of Sennheiser's MSRP, so these were a steal.I think it's safe to say these are the best-sounding noise-cancelling headphones I've tried to date. They sound the same to me in both Bluetooth and wired active mode, but for now I'm running in the latter mode out of a Schiit Stack 2 (Modi 2, Magni 2, non-uber). Coming from Fidelio X2s, MSR7s, and KSC75s, I've noticed that the soundstage is very narrow. Bass is good, mids feel recessed, and highs are crisp depending on the recording. Compared to the aforementioned headphones, these don't sound as good, but they still hold their ground.Moving on to the ANC, I bought these to drown out the noise of the fans in my dorm. To give you an idea of how loud it is, I have a floor fan and two big box fans running at medium to full speed 24/7. With the noise-cancelling on, I can still hear the fans, but the roar is drastically diminished. With music playing, I can't hear them at all. The M2's ANC is more than enough for my needs.The Momentums pack a lot of cool features, too. I'm a fan of the voice that tells you how many hours of battery life you have left, as supposed to just giving you a percentage. I like how you can toggle the ANC in wired-mode too, just in case I'm in a situation where I don't want it. In Bluetooth mode, the noise-cancelling is always on, and I wish you could toggle it the same way. Including in the box are a spiffy carrying case, an airplane audio adapter, 3.5mm to 2.5mm cable, and a micro-USB charging cable. I would have liked to see volume/playback buttons on the audio cable, since the ones built into the headphone don't work in wired mode. The cable is tricky to get out of the headphone, too. If there is any moisture on my hands, I have a hard time pulling it out. Do note that you have to twist to lock it in place, and twist again before attempting to remove it.The only issue I've had so far is comfort; these aren't very comfy with my glasses, and I find myself having to take both them and the M2s off every 5 minutes or so. The only solution that works is to angle my glasses upward slightly (not over the earcup though). They last much longer that way, but when they start hurting, they HURT. By the way, I have thick frames, both in width and height, so I'd imagine this won't apply to all glasses-wearers.Overall, I'm glad I got these for the price I did; I'm not sure I'd buy these for Sennheiser's recommended price of $500. These sound great for a pair of noise-cancelling headphones, and the ANC works well for my needs. Comfort leaves a lot to be desired unless I do a lot of fidgeting with my glasses, but you can't have everything, right?",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best-sounding ANC headphones, good-looks, uncomfortable with glasses"

    ","These headphones, along with my Sonos surround system have been some of the most expensive, yet best purchases I've made. I often work out of coffee shops where there can be a lot of noise - these headphones really do a nice job of filtering out the most annoying of the sounds around me while also providing a nice listening experience to the broad selection of music that I listen to. Whether wired or wireless (the way I use it at coffee shops), these are a staple of my daily work life and I can't imagine not having these when I'm working.If I had to think of a downside to these, it would probably be that there's not a quick way on the headphones to disconnect from a specific paired source. For example I have these paired to both my computer and my AppleTV. Sometimes someone will turn on the AppleTV in the other room and suddenly my headphones will be playing the sound from the TV. This can be great if that's what you're trying to do. In a nutshell, in my experience the headphones work best when only connected to 1 device at a time, even though it can be paired to several devices. These issues aside, the headphones are still fantastic and I highly recommend them to music lovers and those who are bothered by noisy environments.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound & good noise cancellation

    ","First impression is that the headphones themselves look really, really nice. The ear cups looked smaller than I'd expected, but the interior was large enough to fit my average ears. They weigh less than I expected, and are quite comfortable and don't tend to move around on my head. The included case is fairly good quality, although for this price I think a hard case would be more appropriate.I have used the headphones in Bluetooth wireless mode with an Android phone and a Macbook Pro both at the same time, and also in USB DAC mode (an undocumented feature I didn't even know about until reading reviews here) with a USB cable connecting the headphones to a computer. The sound quality is excellent either way. At first it sounded better over USB compared to Bluetooth, but after configuring my computer to use the AptX Bluetooth codec instead of SBC, I can't really tell the difference, at least when listening to compressed input (i.e. streaming audio).  I have not run into any major compatibility problems with Linux, OS X or Android. I have not tried iOS. However, I have had dropouts and a weird behavior one time where the headphones would repeatedly report ""disconnected"" when the music stopped, even though they were actually still connected.One thing that's kind of neat is that you can be simultaneously connected to two Bluetooth devices and over USB also, and the headphones will automatically switch sources when sound starts on a different device. So while you are listening to music on a computer over USB, your phone notifications interrupt the music, and if you unplug from the computer and walk away, your music keeps playing over Bluetooth. Only one problem, when you plug the USB back in, the headphones turn themselves off for some reason and need to be turned back on.The automatic noise reduction (ANR) works. I use it in my noisy open floor plan office to mute people chatting and the loud rumble of the HVAC fans. Not perfect, but everything gets a lot quieter when ANR kicks in. It works better on lower frequencies - I can still kind of hear people talking, but I can't hear the fan rumble at all. When the ANR is working hard"" to mute the loud low frequency rumble while music is playing, I occasionally notice low frequencies in music sound a little odd - sort of warbly. But it's so worth it! Note however that you can't turn off the ANR when the headphones are on, so the only way to use these headphones *without* ANR is in passive wired mode with the 1/8"" cable connected and the power off.Overall these are great headphones, with great sound and features like simultaneous bluetooth connection, mic, AptX, USB etc. However they have some little issues, like occasional (rare) weird behavior, not being able to turn off ANR, no hard case. For the price, five stars would take absolute perfection. Minus one star for less than stellar value -- even though these might be the best Bluetooth cans you can get.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent headphones with minor issues

    ","Unfortunately, I can no longer recommend these.As a mass transit commuter, I purchased these for my daily commute on a bus, followed by several city blocks on foot.  The lack of control over the always-on noise cancelling was of concern,  but it quickly became apparent I could still hear enough to walk safely.After less than a year of daily use, the right ear suddenly stopped working on the bus ride home. These were always either on my head or on a headphone hanger, never dropped or knocked about.Now wearing the warrantee replacement, I believe I can hear why these were broken in such a short time. With only the headphones powered on, and no media playing, the noise cancellation is causing an audible click as the driver is abused by the noise cancellation attempting to overcome the rattles and bumps of the bus. This is especially pronounced in the right ear. It sounds like the driver is physically striking something, or perhaps the noise cancellation is creating a square wave as it tries to keep up with the noises as I ride.If you are simply trying to listen in an environment with a constant noise level, and not traveling with these,  the sound is phenomenal and the noise cancellation removes much of the low tones an office AC, computer fans, and the world in general creates.  But these lack both the physical resilliance and the noise cancelling programming to prevent them from being damaged in a commuter's daily usage. Even damaging themselves just by their designed function.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for mass transit commuting.

    ","The Sennheiser Momentum Wireless have surpassed my expectations. I've had these for about 6 months now, and I feel like I'm qualified to write a full review about these headphones.About me: I am a college student who has always invested in audiophile headphones. The only pair of non-audiophile headphones I have had are the Apple Earpods. I listen to alternative rock, rock, classical music, and hip-hop.Noise-Cancelling---Since this is one of Sennheiser's biggest selling points on these headphones, I will start with this. I have tried the Bose QC35, and the Momentums can definitely compete with the QC35's noise cancelling capabilities. The QC35's noise cancelling capabilities are better than the Momentum's, but not by far. If you're looking for the top of the line noise cancelling headphones, go for the Bose QC35. however, the Momentum surpasses them in other aspects.Sound Quality---If you're looking for flat audio (i.e. the way the artist intended the music to be listened to), do NOT buy these headphones. The sound is bass-boosted, very much so, but for an average consumer, this is a plus. It is on the edge of overpowering, but not overpowering. I don't have to use an equalizer with these headphones because the bass is at a high level. The mids are very mellow and clear, which is excellent for rap music. The highs, which Sennheiser always nails, are again very crisp. When I listen to classical music, my ears don't get fatigued by punchy highs.Comfort---The headband is lacking padding. There might as well be no padding at all, you won't tell the difference. However, I don't get fatigued by this. I just wish there was more padding. The earcups are exceptionally soft, and I am a huge guy, but my ears fit well inside the ear cups. I take walks outside frequently, and I don't feel them overheating after two hours of walking in 80 degree weather. It must be noted that I do feel fatigued after wearing these for five hours.Durability---I always stress test headphones I receive in order to test how durable they are. I do not recommend doing this, but I stretched these headphones to a complete straight line. The headphones are still wearable, however, they did feel loose on my head after this stress test. I sent them back for repair and received a new pair.Customer Service---I love Sennheiser's customer service. They will replace your headphones for almost any issue with your headphones. These come with a two year warranty, and within this period, you can send them in for repair whenever absolutely FREE. Thanks Sennheiser.Misc. Cons---I don't recommend taking off the earcups because they are EXTREMELY difficult to put back on. This is a minor issue, but take my word for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing.

    ","I bought these primarily to watch my new 2016 model Samsung UN55KS9500FXZA 4K SUHD TV, which will not support wired headphones.  The Momentum 2.0's  simply would not pair consistently, then eventually would not connect at all.  I purchased a pair of Bose QC35s at Best Buy and both those and my inexpensive Avantree headphones would pair with the TV.  Moreover, the Momentum 2.0 offered poor sound cancellation and were not comfortable after about 30 minutes, whereas I can wear the Bose headphones for much longer.  That noted, the Momentum 2.0's sounded better: they offered cleared vocals, more precision, and better separation.For those seeking to compare headphones, I also tried the Sennheiser PXC 550s and the Sony MDX 1000's.  Neither would recognize the television at all.  Sony and Senn representatives confirmed that they are not compatible with my TV.  The Sony's also sounded somewhat better than the Bose, but what good are bluetooth headphones with compatibility issues -- particularly in that price range?  It also makes me wonder about my relatively high-end Samsung TV, but I have two sets of bluetooth cans that connect with it without problem.Ultimately, I ended up keeping the PXC 550s.  Even as Bose tops out in functionality, sound cancellation, I found it to be unbalanced and heavy.  It gave me hot spots on my jaw and the top of my head.  Plus, it finished third in sound quality, but it still puts out impressive sound.

    ","I'd only had these for a couple of days before I'd sent them back, so I this is only a perfunctory review.The sound was just fantastic!  I've never had a great pair of headphones, at least not before these, and was amazed with the clarity of sound these phones produced.  Although there was a noticeable improvement in sound quality when listening using the provided cable, the Bluetooth connection, via aptX, was considerably better than what I was used to with my Beyerdynamic DT770 phones.  (I've since found that this particular set of DT770's, the 600 ohm version, needs more power than my little portable systems can provide, so it's not necessarily the DT770's fault.)  These wireless Momentums sounded so good that I'd quickly become spoiled by the clean, lush sound, and am now on a search for a great set of headphones just for listening to music.  Which brings me to the reason I'd sent them back.The manufacturer, as well as many other reviewers, stated that the dual microphones worked very well, including and especially in fairly noisy circumstances.  When testing the mics usage via cell phone, I received reports of adequate sound quality when speaking under quiet conditions, but was told, in no uncertain terms, that they sounded ""irritating"" when used at only 45 mph, on a smooth road and with the windows up, due to the background noise.  This was while driving a fairly new Honda Accord which, while not as quiet as a BMW or Lexus, is about the norm for an average car.  Since one of the primary reasons for getting the Momentum 2.0 Wireless headset was to have better sound quality, both for me and for those with whom I'm speaking, than what I've found in the little in/on ear units that are the ubiquitous tool for the task.  So back they went.I had found them to be quite comfortable, but, as I was still evaluating them and was aware that I may send them back, I didn't wear them for any more than an hour or two at a time, and perhaps four hours total, so I can't speak as to long term comfort.If you are looking for a Bluetooth headset because you want to get rid of the wires leading to/from your music player and you don't really care much about using the microphone while driving then this would very likely make you a happy listener. That the already wonderful sound quality improves when plugged in directly makes these an even better bet for someone who wishes to do some fairly critical listening.  That you can use a micro USB cable for charging, without an adapter, is a bonus, and it does seem that battery life is at least close to what it is advertised to be, but I never did use up even half of its initial charge.  Five stars for sound quality, but one-and-a-half stars for the microphone.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The sound was just fantastic! I've never had a great pair of headphones

    ","These headphones are great. The quality is very nice and the sound is exceptional. I tried the momentum wired headphones and was impressed but wanted to have the ability to be chord free which these headphones allow for. The noise cancelling works so well, I can't hear my dumb roommates babbling etc. Very nice build quality. They come with a soft bag and an nice outer case that seems to protect the headphones quite well. Additionally compared to the momentum wired headphones these fold to become more compact which is a nice additional feature. The headphones cover the ear well and I have not experience any ear fatigue/pain while wearing them for several hours which is nice. I would recommend them to anyone who is shopping in this price range.Edit: After some months of use the finish on the right earphone is coming off (see picture) therefore I've dropped them two stars...I've contacted Sennheiser to see about a replacement pair but apparently they are backordered for months. I will update this review based on that experience.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Product! Worth the price. Edit: Finish on earphones may wear off, buyer beware."

    ","I'm picky, & I love researching things prior to spending my money.  I did extensive research before laying out the cash for these.  Spent time listening to the Boss QC35 & all of the Beats headphones as well.  After spending a week with my new Sennheisers I couldn't be happier.  These are legit.  Very well made.  Excellent sound quality (streaming from my iPhone 7).  The noise canceling is definitely there and works great.  When listening to the Bose I felt the noise cancelling created a pressure of sorts on my ears, which wasn't a problem when music was playing, but was bothersome when no music was playing.  The Sennheisers do not have that problem.  The iPhone does not use NFC, but the Sennheisers pair with my iPhone immediately as soon as I power them up.  I was also a bit worried about my iPhone not using the aptX codec, but the Sennheisers sound amazing, aptX or no.

    ","I bought these after having owned the original Sennheiser Momentum over-ear. These sound FANTASTIC for a Bluetooth, noise-cancelling headphone. Sennheiser definitely tweaked the sound profile from the originals, and in most cases, it's for the better. The bass is more present, but also less confined; it spills over a bit. The highs seem just as high, but the mids are less present, which I absolutely adore in the originals. Also, of course because the audio is coming through Bluetooth, things aren't quite as warm as they are on the originals. These cans are definitely more clinical. Which, initially, really turned me off to them when doing an A/B comparison with the originals. But as time wore on, and maybe as the cans got worked in, I came to appreciate how very neutral they are. In most cases now, I would rather listen to these over the originals. Exceptions are for artists such as Santana, Dave Matthews, Pink Floyd, and Michael Jackson, where I really need to hear the gentleness of the song.A HUGE positive for these over the originals is the comfort. My god, are they comfortable! Only after trying these for a while did I realize how almost painful the originals are. The originals always tended to squish my ears (and I'm a small guy). With these on, both the dimension of the ear cups and the superbly-designed memory foam and supple leather make your ears feel like they've sunk into a soft leather couch. I can wear them for hours on end.Overall, with just a little compromise on the sound profile, these were WELL worth the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"A little sound compromise, but well worth the money"

    ","I had a refurbished set of these in May and I was hoping it was going to be free of the Bluetooth (BT) problems but it didn't. Every now and again the sound quality would go to trash. I eventually returned mine because some of the coating had flaked off on one of the ears, the headphone cable would not lock into the headphone plug like it was supposed, the ear cups were a little small, and the BT issues. Not worth $400. BUT had those not been issues I would buy and keep the full price pair because:1) hands free talk was simple and easy2) the sound quality when it was working was excellent for a wireless connection3) the ANC was pretty darn good. I would say they are just as good as the Bose QC 25, which I had at the time for comparison, but just work with a different type of ANC sound, like the Bose sound more tuned for an airplane while the Sennheisers are lower in the noise's pitch. The Bose were a tad more comfortable I think because they accommodated for my large ears and glasses more.4) the controls are pretty intuitive and easy to use5) I think they look like a wonderful pair of headphonesSide note:  I would recommend at least a BT 3.0+ receiver/emitter because I had a built in BT 2.0 card on my laptop from 2009 and the sound quality was sub par. The little dongle things are pretty cheap only like 20 bucks but totally worth the jump in sound quality.Overall, these are a great pair of wireless headphones.

195,"on February 23, 2017",,"If you're looking for a headset, keep looking - if you're looking for amazing sound in Bluetooth headphones, look no further!I bought these, QC35's and Airpods to test them all against each other and the Sennheiser's far and away were the best sounding headphones. The bass, the mids, and the highs were all perfectly balanced and the sound stage was incredible. I found myself literally queuing up songs I haven't listened to in years just to hear them on these incredible headphones. If you're an audiophile and just want to listen to wireless music, just buy these.The QC35's noise cancellation was great (albeit a little uncomfortable) but the headphones became muddled if they were too loud and in too intense of certain music (i.e. intense classical or even bass heavy acapella). I just felt that if I listened hard, I couldn't hear individual instruments and things became mushy if too much was going on. The Sennheisers were a revelation in this regard - I could hear every little detail, every instrument, and all with incredible clarity. The Sennheisers felt like a Ferrari that couldn't get to the point of being stressed, where the Bose felt like a nice Honda or something that while very well done, you could tell it couldn't handle some things.I also realized, headphones are all noise cancelling if you turn them up enough - but to be fair I don't work in a particularly noisy environment and I don't commute on a train or anything, so I don't have the best comparison.I ended up returning these (Brandswalk was amazing about this) for one reason - the microphone. I bought these to also be a headset for work so that I could take calls wirelessly, and to be honest they just didn't do the job well enough (especially for $400 dollar headphones). I had regular cracky sounds on the line, and I got complaints regularly that I was breaking up. I also heard robot sounds from their end pretty often (maybe once a minute or two), and it just made phone calls stressful because I wasn't sure if they'd be able to hear me or not. Many people also complained that I sounded like I was on speakerphone. Since I'm on the phone probably 2-3 hours a day, this just wasn't tolerable for such expensive headphones.The QC35's were a little bit better with the microphone, but at the cost of the sound quality not being as good, and the microphone still wasn't perfect. A little better microphone for less quality sound at the $350 price point still feels like a bad deal to me.Then came the AirPods! Better sounding? Of course not - better microphone? It would seem so. I still get cracking in MY ears a little bit, but not so much that I can't understand - and I don't get any complaints on the other end. At this point I've realized that any bluetooth is going to cause SOME noise in your ear and occasional issues. But most important to me is that I come across clear to them and them to me, and so far I've had no issues with them.The best part about the AirPods which I didn't think I'd care about - they're light and literally barely noticeable in your ears. When compared to the Bose and Sennheiser Over Ear (which traditionally I love) it actually felt like freedom wearing the AirPods. I do everything with them in now. Stretching, working out, walking around the house or office. I especially love wearing them in bed at night and watching some videos so I don't disturb my wife, I could never do those with the huge bulky over ears. And popping one out to pause music and talk to someone is easy as pie.The AirPods aren't as seamless as they're billed to be, and I still have some bluetooth connection issues from time to time (ironically more than the Sennheisers, even though Apple has their ""wonderful"" special chip inside the AirPods for better connection), but at $169 bucks vs $400 I can stomach the little imperfections. The sound is good enough, and the microphone works quite well.If I ever want to buy an amazing pair of travel noise cancelling headphones for music, there just isn't a better pair than the Momentum 2.0's in the price point. But until then, I'll be sticking with pretty good sound and good phone call quality with the AirPods.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Momentum 2.0 VS QC35 VS AirPods - headsets

They're beautiful and reasonably comfortable, and the Bluetooth connection to the iPhone 7 is quick and stable.But - the sound. At first, they were fine - I was reasonably pleased but not blown away. For reference, I was coming from the corded noise cancelling Bose Quiet Comfort 20, which I love completely, but wanted to upgrade given the lack of headphone jack on my new phone. Within the first week, after 20 hours or so of use, the right headphone developed a loud crackling for a session, and on subsequent listens produces a noticeable hiss on that side.

    ","I bought this pair after much skepticism thanks in large from the product reviews here on Amazon. I looked at this pair of cans on B&H as well and went over to the head-fi forum before purchasing these.Along with my HD 598 and 700, this is my third pair of headphones from Sennheiser. I also own AKG's Q 701, and Audio-Technica's ATH-M30x. The other BT headphones I own are the Sony ZX770BN and Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear, the latter being utter garbage. The only noise-cancelling headphone I had prior to this purchase is the Bose QC25.I fancy the highs and mids on this pair, just as I did with the HD 598 and Q 701, but none of these cans are up to the HD 700. It has good lows (or bass for you younger people), but I found the ATH-M30x and Sony ZX770BN to be more 'impactful'. It's unfair comparing wireless vs wired, so this is just my 2c. The Bose QC25 has better ANC easy, but the M2's are good as well.The BT, as other reviewers have pointed out, could use a bit more work. I have yet to get choppy sounds with my iPhone 6 in the same room, but when I close 2 doors, walk 30 ft, and have a thick concrete wall between myself and the phone, then that's where the connection gets funny. When you skip to the next or previous song there is an audible 'clicking' sound; since I'm not too anal about it, I don't really consider it as a flaw, but it might be for some people.I will be replacing my Sony ZX770BN and the garbage that is Beats with these cans.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Headphones

    ","I really wanted to like these. The sound quality is incredible and they look nice, but it's almost as if Sennheiser was actively attempting to sabotage the design.The bottom line is that I ended up returning them due to a defect mentioned by many other reviewers, where a grey plastic sleeve broke in the tensioning part of the right ear piece adjustment, making the right ear completely loose. I had barely used the headphones. It seems like it was something that was broken upon delivery and just slowly worked it's way out of the metal band part.Also, these are quite uncomfortable. The hard leather headband creates a pressure point at the top of my head no matter how I adjust it. The ear cups are just barely too small and shallow, making wearing these a painful battle that I slowly loose over the course of an hour. In contrast the Bose QC35 fits like a glove, sealing perfectly with minimal pressure. Maybe Sennheiser's design is intending to maximize sound quality, but if it hurts to wear them, it's a moot point. Sennheiser makes other very comfortable headphones, so I don't know why they opted for the strange design of the momentums. They don't even fold up very compactly.Noise cancelling is good, but nowhere near as good as the Bose QC35 actually. Since I got these for a loud train commute, the better sound quality might not really matter if I'm still hearing engine noise in the background.I ended up settling on the Bose QC35 instead. Sound quality isn't quite as good, but the noise cancelling and fit and build quality is drastically better. I would love it if Sennheiser could just put a bluetooth and noise cancelling into something more like the HD600. But it seems like they tried to get all fancy with the design.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor quality / broken ear piece tension parts, uncomfortable"

I would recommend contacting Apple to go over the settings configurations with them.Please don't hesitate to reach out with any follow up questions.Have a great day.---------------------------------I have never had such issues with various other headphones I have used; so clearly this is their issue not an iPhone issue.

    ","So I have tried quite a few headphones over the past couple weeks. I started with the Bose Soundlink II wireless headphones, those were a great disappointment to a longtime Bose fan, I next tried the Beats Studio Wireless, those were not as comfortable as the Bose and definitely had overwhelming base and lacked emphasis on other notes, lastly before the Momentums I tried the Sennheiser Urbanite XL headphones. I use the Sennheiser earbuds so I have a good feeling going into those. The Urbanites were very uncofrmatable but had great sound. I returned them and purchased these and have finallyy sound my favorite headphones in the world. These have the best: 1.

    ","Very nice pair of headphone. Good sound stage and bass. Voice and instrument sounds a little blurry compare to my im03. Don't buy it if you are going for the sound, because the sound has no difference than the $350(now $250) version for Apple/Android so don't expect it be as good as others in the same price range, however considering other features it provides (Bluetooth, NFC, ANC, and Workmanship) I'd say I didn't waste twice as much money for nothing. It can still be cheaper. ANC is no comparison to BOSE but good enough. If you have enough money and you are looking for something that sounds better than beats/bose without looking ugly, this model will be a good choice for you.

    ","** UPDATE 12/25 - AT BOTTOM **Listening to music is subjective so here is the type of listener I am and if you are similar, this review might help you out.ME: I am not an audiophile. My ears are 40-ish years old and I believe I have typical hearing.  I travel on a long haul flight about once a year. I was looking for over-the-ear (OTE) headphones that I would use 85% of the time at home and 15% of the time when travelling. I had some ear buds and on-the ear headphones I had used on previous trips but decided it’s time to go OTE with some real noise cancelling. I wanted to go wireless and I know the limitations of Bluetooth. Frankly, I don’t find the Bluetooth experience that terrible (see sentence #1 – I’m not an audiophile).I watched a dozen video reviews and read the same number of reviews (you know, “best wireless headphones of 2016!!!”). Obviously, everyone pointed to the Bose QC35’s as the best noise cancelling headphones on the market. The new Sony MDR1000X headphones were equally regarded (if not, better by some people).I picked FOUR headphones to try. Let me put my subjective assessment of their sound later.** ROUND ONE: Sony Premium Noise Cancelling, Bluetooth Headphone, Black (MDR1000X/B) **I picked these first because they had all the nifty features. Specifically, you could swipe the outside of the ear cup to control your music (skip, back, volume, etc.). It was a bit finicky. They were very comfortable. Noise cancelling using the vacuum test was quite impressive. Helpful voice prompts. Modern design. You can turn the noise cancelling on or off.  They are plastic and leather or “leather” – not sure – but they feel very premium. The most expensive of all the headphones I tried.** ROUND TWO: Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless Headphones, Noise Cancelling - Black **The venerable QC35. I had to try them. I mean – every headphone is being compared to them. Somewhat old school in their design and controls. Not particularly good looking. However, these were definitely the most comfortable of all of these headphones I tried. They just fit great with the tilted ear cups. Noise cancelling with the vacuum test was as impressive as the Sony MDR1000X. Helpful voice prompts. The noise cancelling is always on. Controls are buttons and you’re going to have to spend some time training your fingers to feel and use them. Also very expensive but about $50 less than those Sony’s above. Bose has a quaint little phone app to control some basic settings on the headphones – no equalizer or sound quality controls. You’ll know these are plastic but the ear cups are soft, comfortable faux leather wrapped cushions.** ROUND THREE: Sony H.ear on Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphone, Charcoal Black (MDR100ABN/B) **I guess this would be the “cheap” pair in the bunch. At the time, about $100 less than the Bose and $150 less than the Sony MDR1000X. Also comfortable and bit smaller than their Sony big brother. Noise cancelling was good but not as good as the two above. You can turn the noise cancelling on or off. One glitchy thing I experienced was they wouldn’t always automatically connect back to my phone (Nexus 6P). The others did. I like the basic control toggle that you can feel, click forward/backward or click down in various combinations. You can find it easily by touch.** ROUND FOUR: SENNHEISER MOMENTUM 2.0 WIRELESS **Unique retro look and unlike all of the above, they are made of metal and leather. Very premium. I think the only plastic is in the round knobs that hold the ear cups. I am actually not sure if those knobs are plastic, could be metal. Noise cancelling is very good but not quite as good as the top two. It is always on, no switch. It’s a toss-up as to whether the cancelling beats or just meets the H.ear model. The toggle switch (press or toggle up and down) is easy to identify by feel and easy to use (the same as the H.ear). These seem to fit the least tightly. They just softly press against your head (and I have a bigger head). The ear cups are leather wrapped, soft cushy material. If you have a small head, there may be issues with fit. These aren’t tight.The only other pair I wanted to try were the Plantronics Back Beat Pro 2 that were recently released. Amazon didn't have them. Best Buy didn't have them. I didn't like the way you turn them on/off though.CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL OF THEM…---  All of them come with a corded option in case the battery dies. No noise cancelling without battery power though.--- Your ears will get warm after a while with all of them. I was able to go the longest with the Bose before I started to feel it.---- All of them have sound leakage. All of them have enough that its noticeable in a quiet setting. This disappointed me but then I thought about the fact that on a plane, the engine noise is going to drown it out.---- They all have battery life that is going to last an entire long haul flight including the waiting when connecting flights. I’m not going to wear them continuously.So… why did I end up with the Sennheisers and not those amazing noise canceling masterpieces? Sound quality. The Sennheisers sound great. They were the last pair I tried. I put them on, played various types of music and quickly realized they were the way to go for me.NEED THE BEST NOISE CANCELLING?If you need headphones primarily for transportation situations where noise is a problem (planes, trains, etc.), get one of the top two (I would pick the Sony’s). They have outstanding noise canceling capabilities. Don't get me wrong, they sound pretty great too.NEED BETTER SOUND QUALITY AND OCCASIONAL NOISE CANCELLING?If you are like me and the majority of your usage time will be in environments that aren’t noisy (like at home), get the Sennheisers... and the build quality, wow! [**SEE BELOW FOR UPDATE**]  If those are out of your price range, the Sony H.ears are a good alternative. They also sound better than the two big guys. I got them when they were $229. I had a friend try the top three and he picked the H.ear model as the best sounding. He didn’t get to try the Sennheisers.TIP FOR ANDROID USERS: I tried a few equalizer apps. I chose an app called “Equalizer FX” by devdnua and it further improved the sound of my streaming music.Hope this helps someone![I don’t show as a verified buyer because I actually bought the Sennheisers at Best Buy – Amazon was sold out at the time]**** UPDATE 12/25/16 ****I decided to go for it and try two more headphones on the higher end scale: Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wireless Headphones and the B&O PLAY by Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H9 Wireless Over-Ear Headphone with Active Noise Cancelling, Bluetooth 4.2 (Black). Those H9's are very expensive! When I put on the P7's, I couldn't believe my ears. Absolutely amazing! The only drawback is they lack noise canceling but they have quite a bit of passive isolation because they fit a bit tight. I heard things in my music I didn't even know were there!The H9's I got had a terrible time with getting and maintaining a Bluetooth connection. They have a cool app for adjusting the sound but it kept disconnecting. There were so many issues, I returned them as defective. However, when they did stay connected, the H9's sounded good but no better than the Sennheiser's in my opinion, certainly not for that price difference. The touch controls were cool but again, for that price, not worth it.When I bought my Sennheiser Momentum 2 Wireless, they cost less than the P7's so it seems the price of the Sennheiser's fluctuates.So - to sum it up ...If you want noise canceling, go Sennheiser Momentum 2 (although I haven't actually tested them on a flight)If you want great sound without the noise canceling, go Bowers and Wilkins P7.Hope this crazy review helps.",5.0 out of 5 stars,DETAILED review of FOUR plus TWO headphones from a regular guy - Sennheisers and P7's won!

    ","High-quality headphones. I've been seeking something with this quality for a long time. I read a lot of reviews here at Amazon for many products, read reviews at sound publications. I was really not happy about the much higher price than I wanted to spend... So, I looked into the USED sets, and called Amazon Cust Support to ask about used products. Often they are items that someone bought at Amazon, then decided for whatever reason they wanted to return them. Once box is opened, the items become ""used"", even if they haven't truly been ""used"" at all. Other times, the Amazon person said, there might be small superficial scratches in a place or two, which seller must (and does) disclose, but otherwise the full quality product. Refurbished is slightly different. She said this means the item has been ""repaired"" and brought up to new product specifications by Amazon's own repair center. ... I would not be as wild about ordering refurbished on this product. Too many components to get right. ... Anyway, I was amazed that my ""USED"" pair was in original box, packed really perfectly, and was indeed ""nearly  brand new"".. It had been a return I guess.A few things:  When you slip these on, even without sound input, there is some pretty strong amount of noise blockout by the padding itself. Then when you turn on the device, and noise-cancellation begins, it's amazing. My neighbor (apt bldg) has what i consider to be ****ty taste in music, and I have had to endure such **** all the time, usually having to play white noise on my computer to drown it out. This is a MUCH MUCH BETTER solution! ..... Also:  The controls for power on/off, bluetooth pairing, volume, next track, previous track, skip ahead, skip back are ergonomically smart:  The power button has, on either side of it, a slightly ridged protrusion which signals to your fingers you're on the POWER switch vs the VOLUME control. It's flawless thinking -- well designed ergonomically. The volume control is a spring tensioned small slider in one direction to riase volume; and slide in opposite direction to lower volume.I have had two issues which I can live with:  (1) Initially I was getting some less-than great sound- which sounded like little on-off pulses-- interruptions in the sound output. I googled this, and not specific to these headphones-- but rather hundreds of people all over web report sound interruptions — which have to do with imperfections of Bluetooth signals -- which can get interrupted by your wifi router, and also, who knew--- your microwave oven. If it's in the next room but someone is using microwave, it can stutter your sound. ALL bluetooth; not just this product. After I followed suggestions such as ""move your wifi router so it's not right near your computer (or other source of music)""... And sure enough, after I moved my wifi router, I got no more stutter-interruptions. I conclude that bluetooth, as a technology, is still not robust enough to be *perfect*.  But if you follow such suggestions, your sound is very reliably solid, continuous and uninterrupted.(2) I have some pairing problems with my Mac which require me having to take an extra step to open my Sound Preferences and making sure my output is selected on Momentum phones. But after you are paired for any given listening session, there's no issue. But I still as of yet have discovered what is causing this. I think it might be competing bluetooth devices such as my smartphone causing some indecision by the Mac. However, plugging these Momentums into my Samsung Galaxy smartphone, they get recognized pretty immediately and the sound is awesome.Oh yeah a third item:  When I got a phone call on my cellphone, sound routed immediately to my headphones ... And VOICE -- the mic just worked without having to do a thing. Everyone says the sound quality is superb, superior to talking right into your phone. And it is so nice to be able to walk across the room to grab something while taking and it JUST WORKS! Phone itself is on my desk but i am free to move without a damn cord constraining me.  But I had one snag happen:  Only one call so far, and it was a customer service call where the agent had to place me on hold for a minute or two. When the person returned to the call, suddenly my mic was somehow cut and I had to speak into phone again.. I can't recall if sound in headphones shifted to my phone's speakerphone... It's only happened once, and I attribute it, again, to the imperfections and lack of robustness of bluetooth as an overall technology.LOVE LOVE these headphones! Oh yeah ---- an incredibly detailed and thorough unboxing video and review on Youtube -- probably the best, smartest, clear reviews i've ever experienced with any product anywhere. This young woman knew her stuff backwards and forwards. Links aren't allowed here, so if you are on Youtube, just search for this: ""Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless: Unboxing & In-Depth Review""  -- OK but it feel bad that i didn't buy it from them... But these were out of reach for me if not for my buying USED on Amazon.  If this review helped you let me know, please!",5.0 out of 5 stars,High-quality wireless headphones — finally... Expensive— but consider buying USED on Amazon.

    ","I'm sending these back because the leather on the ear foam pads is not as supple as I was expecting,perhaps Sennheiser wants a sturdy leather?I own two other headphone sets in this price range (Bose and Oppo) and the leather covering the ear pads is very soft and supple on both brands. The ear pads also sat on my ears, not around them, I prefer they surround my ears. To be fair I have big ears but a friend with small/average ears tried them and also thought they sat on the ear, not around and surrounding the ear The sound seemed a little tinny in high notes, this occured while listening to music in blue tooth, the high notes improved when I used the cord. I think it's mentioned sound is affected by blue tooth use, I thought it was my hearing but others agreed, high notes seemd a wee bit tinny when in blue tooth mode. I've ordered Sony headphones in this price range, I'm hopeful they'll be a better fit.

It was especially bad walking around New York City. Every intersection caused the headphones to fail. When I complained to Sennheiser, and noted that online reviews named this issue clearly, they sent a long email talking about how the problem might be with my devices and how a tiny percentage of an old batch of headphone had the problem. I persisted and then they sent me to the repair site. I have now sent my headphones for repair twice in the last 2 weeks, and when they came back the first time, the Bluetooth was not working, and it is still not working.

    ","honestly, this pair of headphones is hyped up by reviewers online.  people say you can hear sounds you've never been able to hear before in the same music; that's only true if you are switching from 40 dollar crappy headphones.  if you already own several pairs of headphones between 150 to 250 dollars, you will be hard pressed to notice any difference.credit where credit is due, the momentum wireless does sound a little bit better than other headphones in the 150 to 250 dollar range; if i really listen carefully and pay close attention, i can say audio quality is probably around 4% better, but definitely not worth the 60%-160% extra price premium.  to add to the list of negatives, microphone works like absolute sh*t.  as a pair of headset, it blows big time; every single one of my friends complained i sound muffled, and they have really hard time understand me during calls.it isn't all lost though, the momentum wireless look great, and the ear cups are very comfortable even while wearing glasses, and the genuine leather material breathes rather well, so i can wear them for 5-6 hrs at a time without sweating or discomfort.  active noise cancellation does good enough job, and isn't as harsh and aggressive as the Bose QC35.Perhaps the biggest positive is that sennheiser was able to deliver any of these goods at all via wireless Bluetooth.  when comparing the momentum wireless against other audiophile grade wired headphones, these disappoint me to no end, and the audio quality doesnt cut it.  but when comparing against other bluetooth wireless headphones in the market, the momentum stands head and shoulder above it's competitors.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"decent, but not quite.."

    ",The audio quality is superb. My only gripe is the Bluetooth connectivity. It worked fine the first couple of days. As time went on it kept losing signal and the music was choppy. I believe it to be signal interference seeing as I can recreate when I receive text or using data on my phone.Update: Interference issue confirmed online. Also confirmed that turning on data on my phone causes the music to stutter. Would not recommend it you plan to use in area with high density of people. At home or for travel is fine.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Would be perfect if not for the Bluetooth issues

Tidal support is nice plus you get 90 days free on their HIFI plan if you sign up from the app. I do wish they would include more streaming services support though, but enough about the app. These cans scream luxury and craftsmanship. From the genuine leather ear cups that are just Oh so supple, to the steel construction and the beautiful ivory glass dust polyresin backs, to the stainless steel steel headband with holographic Sennheiser logos on each side. Holding these in my hands for the first time was just a joy and the images don't do them justice. The hinges and wires seem well made and should last for a really long time. Even though I was happy with my purchase just from the craftsmanship alone. Once I turned them on and paired them via NFC to my S7 Edge,  which felt like it paired instantly, the APTx codex kicked in and I was in love all over again with Sennheiser. Seriously, The ability to have this level of sonic quality/clarity out of a wireless headset is just brilliant. These serve their purpose and there is a reason why these are leading the pack of wireless ANC headsets. You can use them as wired via the included audio cable, but I do think Sennheiser should have included the cable with the inline mic and controls. Also, there is a nice hidden feature that is not documented anywhere, but you can use them as a wired USB headset as well via the included USB cable. Sound quality is even better using either the audio cable, and even better using the USB cable. The fact that you can use them via USB indicates this headset has a good quality  built in DAC. Very glad to see the inclusion of a hard shell case and a satin drawstring pouch. I tried the Creative Aurvana Platinum ANC headset, but they are made for people with insanely large heads, we're uncomfortable to lay down with, made of creaky plastic and leatherette that fit mouse ears, and the sound was muddy and unrefined. Ofc though these are $500 dollar headphones vs $249, but you truly get what you pay for. ANC was definitely better on the Creatives though.

And yet there have been no updates to fix the problem.I should also add that they are terrible for use with an iPhone, because the microphone is terrible.

    ","These headphones aren't cheap, but they sound great, look great and feel great. I bought them for air travel, and they do a nice job blocking noise. And the leather and ivory and steel are elegant, over ear headphones are much more comfortable on long flights than earbuds or over-ear headphones, and I'm expecting them to last a lot longer than plastic headphones. Some nice high-end touches: pairs with 8 devices (2 active at a time) so bouncing between laptop, tablet and phone is easy. It uses voice to tell you power level, bluetooth connection, etc. Comes with a nice case, cables, etc., as you'd expect. And one big positive surprise: when you connect to a computer via USB, it not only charges the headphones, it connects as a USB microphone and speakers, so you get great quality and no risk of battery ever running down. The only negative, and it's minor (many headsets do this), is that noise cancellation is always on when the headphones are on, and theoretically it'd be nice to be powered on (amplified) but with noise cancellation off. You can listen to music via standard audio cable when the headphones are off, but given the 22 hour battery life I'm expecting to need that too often.One thing: there are differences between the over-ear (AEBT) and on-ear models (OEBT). On-ear is lower priced, but the ear pads are smaller (on != over) and aren't leather. Oddly, the on-ear model is labeled ""on-ear"" but the over ear model isn't labeled ""over-ear"" - you have to notice that lacking the ""on ear"" means ""over ear"" which is easy to miss. So look out for that.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressed so far

    ","Couldn't be happier with these headphones. Ordered from Audiolab which is an authorized Sennheiser dealer. **Make sure you order from an authorized dealer in order to be covered under Sennheiser's warranty.** Received the newer version of the M2 Wireless, Rev 2, which apparently does not have the bluetooth connectivity issues or ear cup peeling issues of the earlier version. I have not experienced any connectivity issues so far.These are very comfortable on my head and around my ears. The ear cups are very soft leather and deep so my ears don't touch the actual speakers. The headband looks like it is very uncomfortable and I was worried about it, but it isn't and I don't feel any pressure points on my head.As for the sound quality, it is A+ in my opinion. Bass is definitely present but doesn't overpower the rest of the music. Mids and highs are great and the treble is not overly piercing or sharp, which is my preferred style. Other reviews out there state that treble may not be as good on these compared to other headphones, but I find the overall sound to be incredibly pleasing and balanced. Not at all fatiguing.When plugged into my PC (motherboard audio ""chip"" is Asus SupremeFX) these headphones sound almost as good as my wired B&O H6 2nd Gen headphones. The B&O sound overall is a little fuller and richer, more open. I would be happy using the M2 Wireless as my only headphones if I didn't have my H6 G2 which I can't say about other phones.The audio quality while wireless is very close to the wired sound quality which I was not expecting. The noise cancellation is very good but not as good as Bose QC35. There is not a noticeable drop off in audio quality in my opinion.Compared to the Bose QC35: The QC35 is more comfortable, I can barely feel them. The M2 is also very comfortable but its presence is felt more than the QC35. Noise cancellation does not produce any audible hiss on either of these headphones. Bose is in a league of its own when it comes to NC. Ambient noise almost completely drowned out with the QC35. The M2 is almost as good but ambient noise is a little more noticeable compared to the Bose.The M2 Wireless sound quality is better than the QC35, both wired and wireless. The sound is richer and clearer / more open than the QC35. I can't explain it in scientific terms, the M2 Wireless is just a more pleasing overall sound. Bass is a little punchier, mids are better, and treble is not harsh on the M2. Not that it is overly harsh on the QC35 either. I just hear more of an emphasis on treble with the QC35. The M2 sounds more in my face and more detailed / crisp. QC35 sounds a little dull and farther away in comparison. That said, the QC35 sound is pretty great. The M2 sound is fantastic is all. It is nitpicking.(Update 7/12/16): Another feature where the QC35 beats the M2 is the audio adjustment that occurs at low volume. The Bose is tuned in a way that amplifies the bass at lower volume to compensate for the lower volume. It is really cool that adjustments are made automatically depending on volume. Nice perk that the M2 does not have.Compared to the Plantronics Backbeat Pro: The Sennheiser ear cups are much more comfortable than the small circle shaped cups of the BB Pro. The BB Pro headband is among the most comfortable headbands I've tried though, better than the M2. My ears also get warmer using the BB Pro, I didn't experience this with the M2. The BB Pro is huge and they look ridiculous on my head. The M2 is much better and I can actually wear them in public.Sound-wise, the M2 wins Vs. the BB Pro. The BB Pro has elevated bass and it is too boomy. It gets in the way of the rest of the music and is artificially present in some music that doesn't require extra bass. Initially I liked it but have grown to really dislike the sound of the BB Pro. The bass is just fatiguing to me at any semi-loud volume. The BB Pro requires less volume on my phone (iPhone 6S) compared to the M2- it is louder at lower volume levels.The NC of the BB Pro is far worse than the QC35 and M2. There is an audible hiss when you are not listening to anything. Background noises are not nearly as dampened compared to the QC35 and M2. The only positive about NC with the BB Pro is that you can turn it off while using the headphones in wireless mode. Which is AWESOME. The sound is much better with NC off.(Update 7/20/16): One thing I forgot to mention about the BB Pro is that you can leave the headphones on your head and amplify outside noise if you need to hear / listen to something. Basically it is a ""reverse microphone"" that is activated when you press a button on the bottom of the right ear cup. If someone is talking to you, the microphone allows in and amplifies outside noise and you can hear the person just like you would if you were not wearing headphones. This is a great feature because you never have to remove the headphones if someone wants to speak with you.I really want to like the BB Pro, it has so much going for it. But the very large size and booming bass are deal breakers for me.So if you have the money and are torn between the Bose QC35, Plantronics BB Pro, and Sennheiser M2 Wireless, I feel that the most well rounded and pleasing of the bunch is the Sennheiser. The QC35 comes in a close second, with the BB Pro bringing up the rear.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Wireless Headphones; Layman Comparison Vs. Bose QC35 and Plantronics BB Pro

    ","First off, these are beautiful.  There's no denying it.  The leather band and ear pads really class up the joint around here.  In the sound department they're OK but still sound a little empty.  To me, the low end isn't punchy enough which isn't good since I generally like a fairly flat response.  The bluetooth on these was infuriating.  I returned 2 sets of them trying to get it to work with my PC which refused to find it.  The Sennheiser instructions are very basic, lacking, and simply inaccurate in places with bluetooth info. (For instance, to clear bluetooth it says to power on then hold both buttons for 3 seconds.  This does absolutely nothing.).  I also noticed these are quite uncomfortable for me.  The pads aren't quite deep enough so I was getting a lot of pressure on my ear.  One last thing I didn't like was the adjustment between band/cans wouldn't stay put.  It was always getting loose on one side.From here I've decided to stick with my wired headphones until someone can get this bluetooth mix right and try Creative Sound Blaster E3 Portable USB DAC Headphone Amplifier with Bluetooth and NFC with my dunu dn2000 in ears.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good attempt, over hyped"

    ","*Edit 07/13/16: The hinge on the right ear cup broke again (the little plastic circle that maintains friction), which makes the headphone slide back during use. Since the product is no longer within Amazon's return policy, I'll have to write to Sennheiser to see how they can be salvaged.*Original 5 star review:I've been using the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless headphones along with the Bose QC35 headphones for a fortnight now. For context, I am a business traveler and tested both headphones in flights and on the busy streets of NYC. I am by no means an audiophile.Look & Feel: Sennheiser wins hands-down! The M2 stands out with its metal-leather finish, while the QC35 looks much like its predecessors, elegant and understated, but a little bland.Build Quality: It's a tie. I had to return my first M2 since the hinge on the right ear cup was broken, making the headphone slide back during use. Amazon was prompt to replace it, and I do think that this was a one-off.Weight and Case: Bose wins hands-down! I was surprised at how light and compact the QC35 was as compared to the M2. The overall footprint was significantly smaller than that of the M2. The QC35 case is far sturdier than the dust-attracting felt case of the M2. I would love to see Sennheiser work on this area in the next iteration.Comfort: This was tricky, but I have got to give it to Bose. Given the M2's weight, it is a little uncomfortable to wear for long durations (2+ hour flight). The ear cups weren't a perfect fit for me, but I partially blame that on my longish ears. The QC35 was a perfect fit (just like the QC15, which I now rarely use) and way more comfortable for extended periods of time. I even wore the QC35 during a run, although Bose probably won't recommend it.Noise Cancelation: Bose wins. This was a no-brainer; the QC35 is probably best-in-class when it comes to ANC. I would give the M2 a 7 out of 10 compared to a 9.5 for the QC35 (there's always scope for improvement)Sound Quality: This was a deal-breaker for me. I mostly listen to film scores and the occasional pop album, and wow, the M2 just blew me away. That's not to say the QC35 sounds bad - it just produces very ""clean"" music. I would give the QC35 a 8 compared to a 9.5 for the M2. Sennheiser has done a great job with wired music output - music sounds way better in wired mode.Battery and connectivity were more or less level. Since I use iProducts, the M2 aptX codec was of no consequence to me.Logic would state that I keep the QC35 and return the M2. However, I did just the opposite, only because I found Sennheiser's audio quality to be much better. I would rate the QC35 5 stars as well - and it will probably be the go-to choice for way more people - but I will keep the M2.(Amazon/Sennheiser did not compensate me for these headphones or review)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 v.

    ","i was really excited about these, having experience with Sennheiser in the past. I needed good noise cancelling wireless headphones. the first pair i got i returned because the bluetooth connection would constantly drop out. it was extremely staticky and unreliable. after a period of listening they would just cut into an EXTREMELY LOUD scratching static sound that caused me on several occasions to have to quickly rip them off my ears. i thought it was just a defective product, so i exchanged them for a new pair. a new pair which has every problem that the old ones did with (so far) the exception of the random fits of static -- just persistent static and faulty bluetooth connection. wired? sound great. but if i wanted wired i'd have bought something else entirely. so two pairs of the same cans, they're simply unusable. sitting ~3 feet from my computer (i've tried 3 different computers) and my phone (apparently my phone just being in my pocket is too much) right near it, constant static and stuttering. for 500 dollar headphones from a trusted brand, this is a huge disappointment. I'm returning this second pair and will give another brand a try. I've heard a lot of good about Parrot Zik 2.0, at this point i just need something to keep a reliable bluetooth connection -- something as reliable as my jaybird bluebud X in-ears would be great, but i fear it's a pipe dream.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"do not buy these for the bluetooth ""functionality"""

    ","First off the bad:-In the wireless realm, I've owned the Beats Studio, Parrot Zik 2.0, Plantronics Backbeat Pros, and now the Sennhesier Momentum 2.0 wireless.  I would caution users in that the bluetooth stability of the Sennheisers is much worse than either of the other options listed above.  Audio dropouts and skipping is quite regular even in situations where the device is right next the headphones (i.e. sitting on my desk).  The headphones also appear to have intermittent issues with Apple Continuity when streaming from a Mac.  The problem is that when a call or text comes into the laptop the headphones can flip into a higher pitched static that is very painful on my ears. (Also, the wireless problems are not limited to me.  Scan for the message board thread on this specific headphone at a site like Head-Fi to find more detail).-Auto Shutoff does not exist.  Other headphones have an auto power off capability if you aren't playing audio.  These do not have that option so it's possible to drain your battery if you forget to power off.  Not a deal breaker at all, but something to keep in mind.The good:-Sound quality is the best out of Beats, Zik, and Plantronics.  Nice bass and great detail / soundstage.-Comfort is also the best out of just about every headphone I've owned.  The only headphone I've worn more comfortable is Oppo, but they are wireless and open back.  They are also very light and easy to wear hours on end.-ANC is decent.  It isn't to the level of Bose, but the tradeoff is a little worse ANC for wireless with much better audio quality.-Wired mode (passive) is also great too in situations where you run out of battery.  EQ curve is a bit more U shaped due to more bass, but still quite nice.-Material Quality:  Overall you get a hard case, a soft carrying bag, and the headphones ooze quality with the lush leather, detailed stiching, and metal elements.-Battery Life:  22 hours of battery life is not an embellishment.  These things get great battery life without carrying a weight penalty for it.Final Thoughts:This is so close to a perfect headphone for me.  It would probably be a true ""5 Star"" rating for me if it were not for the bluetooth problems.  If Sennheiser releases an updated model or firmware to correct the problem I will definitely come back and update my review.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound.  Great comfort.  Great battery.

    ","I owned a pair of Sennheisers for past 5 years and have never had a problem or a slightest issue with my pair of HD 25's.When the cord on my beloved HD-25's started to destroy, after thumbing and tearing for past 5 years, I thought it would be a good time to get a new cord and get an upgrade for everyday listening on the go.  Pros: the build quality is good, yet ears start to loosen up after a month or two because of the stylish knob they are placed on. It's a sliding construction that looks great and functions good, yet wears off with time. The SOUND quality is very decent for being wireless. The BASS is just right and not too aggressive, mids and highs are clear. I live in a fairly busy and loud city, yet with this pair haven't had a problem feeling like I am alone and isolated completely from reality when the music is playing.  When paired with my phone: picking up calls is flawless and effortless. Switching tracks is easy and thumbing with volume is intuitive.They are very easy to fall in love with basically.CONS: in past 4 months that I've owned them, 5 weeks have been in the repairs. Even though I have a chance to enjoy all of the wonderful tech features that this device is bustling with... I only get to do it on occasion.1st repair. The charging port on the headset failed, rendering them ""wired"", since I couldn't recharge them.2nd repair. The wireless feature stopped working, they wouldn't come up on any device as a Bluetooth pairable device.If they were working fine. It would have been an easy 5 star review.

    ","PRO: sound quality, aesthetics, comfort. CON: bluetooth buggy, problematic; noise cancelling mediocre. DETAILS: I love the sound, aesthetics, and comfort of these headphones -- But unfortunately, the bluetooth is hopelessly buggy, which defeats the purpose of wireless headphones. I am extremely disappointed to have to return these, as they were almost perfect in every other way. The other feature that is lacking: noise cancelling. Because the ear cups are loose and do not seal at all, sound leaks and the NC is not very effective. I can hear most of the sounds around me whether indoors or outside -- These do not shut out the world, like some other NC headsets. *Regarding the bluetooth problems, these have failed to connect numerous times to basic devices like phones and mini-PC. I get driver error messages, I get ""connected"" status but no sound, I get no results by turning everything off and on again... These have wasted a lot of my time by being buggy with bluetooth -- And I've used bluetooth headphones before, which do not have any such issues. So it's not me, nor is it my devices. Pairing with two devices and switching between them also causes problems. Again, I've done this with other bluetooth headphones no problem.

    ","UPDATE 2-25-2018: Yep. Still love 'em. Battery life continues to be amazing, as does the sound. Zero complaints whatsoever.I've just given these things a thorough workout on a trip around the world (USA -> Europe -> Asia -> USA), and can only say that I have been thoroughly impressed. The sound is clear, very detailed even over Bluetooth. I've been hearing things in music I've owned for over 15 years that I never noticed before, and this is not my first high-end audio purchase, either. I also own a pair of Beyerdynamic DT880 open-back headphones, some Audio-Technica M50x closed-back cans, and my last set of noise-cancelling headphones were the Monster Inspirations. I also own a set of Neumann KH120 monitors. These headphones are bloody fantastic compared to all these devices!Compared to my roommate's Bose QC15s, these don't have quite the same noise-cancelling abilities, but they were perfectly adequate for keeping me happy on the various airplanes, even while seated near engines. Putting these on and putting some music on was a great antidote for screaming children, too. On some bus rides, if the road was extra bumpy, that very loud bass interference overloaded the noise-cancelling circuits and distortion occurred. No idea how the Bose would stack up against that.Battery life: easily handled some VERY long days (20 hours at least of nonstop usage), and recharged quickly off my battery pack.Comfort: Reasonably comfortable. One of my ears felt a little pinched after several hours, but nothing I couldn't deal with. Tended to be uncomfortable in hot and humid climates, since the material wasn't exactly good for sweating around. Weight is light enough to where I was able to fall asleep with these on and not even notice, but I'm someone who tends to wear headphones for very long stretches of time anyways.Sound quality: like I said, it was fantastic. Very detailed, great bass response, very smooth across the entire spectrum. I was even able to successfully mix and master a song using only these headphones (had to hit a deadline!), and it ended up being better in a lot of ways than material I've done on my usual setup. This almost never happens on a brand-new set of headphones or speakers, so I'm incredibly impressed!

    ","Continuing Bluetooth issues. I purchased my original set of momentum 2.0 headphones in November 2015. After the initial debacle with Bluetooth was ""resolved"". The music quality was always top notch, streamed from my phone, computer, as long as it was music its sounded amazing. My problem was with the call quality over Bluetooth. After I initially paired with my phone (Samsung note 4, android 5.0.1 and 5.1.1), the call quality is fine, but after a few calls it degraded to not usable. Loud static pops, I sound far away and inaudible to callers. Sometimes un-pairing and re-pairing the device seems to help but most of the time not. So I sent them back to amazon on exchange, received a new pair: same issue. I've wiped my phone to default, updated to newest android, verified Bluetooth profiles: nothing helps. Bare in mind the music through bluetooth on the same phone works fine. Other headsets paired to the phone also work fine. I contacted sennheiser support and they said i can send it in via warranty for review. I don't think that will help considering this is the second set. So I'm torn. The music portion of the headphones continue to work fine, flawless even; but the Bluetooth headset portion is terrible.

    ","Had high hope for this one since I've read so many good reviews from some reviewers here who claimed that they are ""headphone"" experts.  OK, this could be that I mainly and ONLY want to use the bluetooth ANC with iphone for music and not for other purposes.  I've also (claimed) here that I've owned and listened to many pairs of in-ear phones, and head-phones ranging from Grado, B&W P3 (my reference and also the most neutral set of headphone that I've owned), Shure's, listened to Bose QC 15), and used to be an audiophile owning music systems costing over $30K, with horns like Advant Garde, electrostatics like Quad, Martin Logan, SoundLab, etc...Let me tell you that currently I'm owning the latest bluetooth, ANC from Sony, the one that you can get from Costco for $150 and compared that to this Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 wireless bluetooth with ANC, and the Sony comes out ahead as a more musical sounding headset than this one.The reasons why I don't like this one:1.  Ear pads are too small (some customers here had warned me already), but I ignored because I basically have a normal size ears, not large by any mean, but I still feel the pads are a bit small. Not a deal breaker, but I constantly felt that something is around my ears.2.  The weight is a bit heavier than the Sony and Bose.  I could feel the weight whereas I didn't notice the others when I was wearing them for hours.  Even my wife who tried on this Momentum for 5 minutes commented that it felt heavy.3.  The bluetooth started to cut in and out when I walked around away from the phone, the Sony didn't have that issue.4.  There was pumping noise when I was next to the washing machine, during quiet music passages, trying to compare ANC between the Sony and it.  Sony doesn't have that issue.5.  The headband is a bit uncomfortable and tight. I had a headache after wearing it for an hour.6.  The sound is not as 3-dimensional as the Sony.7.  The mid-range is hash at time, especially when I tried to turn on the music a bit louder.8.  It is not as sensitive as the Sony, therefore requires a bit more power to drive.9.  Mid-range seems to be separated from the rest of the bass and treble is rolled off.  The Sony has a more organic and integrated sound.  I could listen to the Sony for hours and it works on all music, albeit sometimes, it does seem to lack a bit of drive on certain music.  However, not all speakers or headphones are perfect for all types of music nor recorded materials, but the Sony sounds good on 90% of the music I listen to (Jazz, Alternatives, Indie, vocals, electronics...).  The Sony sounds so good with electronics music.10.  Bass seems to be in its own space and doesnt seem like it is part of the recording, very strange signature...All in all, if I pay $400 for this, compared to $150 for the Sony, does it make any sense?  With all of the issues that I've listed above, I would think hard of keeping this one even if it cost me the same as the Sony.The only things that are going for this headphone are:1.  The workmanship is very good.2.  The leather pads are nice and soft (even though not large enough).3.  The ANC, when it is working properly without the pumping noise, seems to be good, but so does the Sony.The Sony basically has leatherette and kind of hot, especially if you use them in a hot day, but it has everything else going for it....Even though I write this review for the Momentum but I think if you're out looking for a headphone wireless with ANC, for the price you get at Costco, you can't go wrong with it.

    ","I believe this was designed by a sadist as a torture device. The sound quality is absolutely amazing and songs I've always enjoyed were experienced in a whole new way. I felt a cloud had been cleared as the music seamlessly unfolded within a quiet, soft cushion surrounding my ears and blocking out sounds of my loud 4 year old. I couldn't get enough and wanted to listen to more and more songs; songs I hadn't heard in years were heard as if it was the first time. Laying down with these quality headphones was perfect. When I stood up to rock out in my own world as my husband answered ""why?"" and ""can I have...?"" one-hundred times within a very short time span, I noticed a pain starting on the very top of my head. I tried finding a way to adjust the headphones but nothing helped. I considered placing a very small pillow between my head and the band, living my life in a supine position, and wearing a thick winter hat (in Texas) under the headphones but couldn't locate a small pillow nor a thick winter hat. I was reminded of when a massage therapy student thought it would be a good idea to compress the top of my skull with an exorbitant amount of force and I thought for sure she was going to pop a whole in my head. Once the discomfort was noticeable from the headphones, the pain grew and grew. I eventually had to choose between ending the pain and listening to my extroverted son and husband discuss appropriate places to poop intermingled with bouts of chasing each other around the house while screaming or remaining in music heaven in my nice little introverted brain. I would have made any true sadist proud of the pain I endured but eventually used my safe word ""Return"" and engaged in the strangest conversations imaginable with my 4 year old while dreamily thinking about magic in my ears and floating away.Sir Sennheiser, let us depart with mutual respect for one another and I wish you well in finding your perfect partner.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect torture device recommended to any true masochist

This is not an issue with the headphones but with the OS, don't fool yourself thinking that there is a fix in the web, there is none-iMac w/Yosemite - same as above-PS4 - via BT, no support (unclear if it is going to happen in the future). This is for any BT headphones, not limited to these. My fault for not checking. Via PS4 control it can connect but Sennheiser didn't send a cable with a mic so not for gaming (extra $100 and not sure if it would en up working). Also may have impact on quality as it has to go through controller before it gets to the headphones.-Apple TV - doesn't support BTIn summary, sound, looks and quality are great and BT connection to iPhone is good and so I will keep them but I would have spent $500 if I knew the above issues.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have mainly have Apple/PS4 electronics, think twice before buying"

    ","I ended up returning these headphones for two main reasons: comfort and sound quality.  I have to preface my thoughts by saying that my opinions are very much related to the price of these headphones.  If these were much cheaper I'd be much easier on them, but seeing as they are some of the most expensive bluetooth headphones in the world I feel justified in holding them to a very high standard.Let me start with the comfort.  This will be subjective and depend on your head and ear shape, and obviously many people are perfectly happy with the comfort so take these thoughts with a grain of salt.  I'll start with the good, which is that they are very light-weight, which always helps alleviate some headphone comfort issues.  However, I found that the earpads were a bit too small for me which led to discomfort after 30 minutes or so, and that the lack of ""clicking"" positions for the adjustable bands prevented me from locking in the headphones into a position that best worked for me.  Because the adjustable bands slide around freely, I always felt like the headphones were sliding into an uncomfortable position where too much pressure was being put either right under or right above my ear.  I also felt that due to the lack of padding on the top of the band I was getting too much uncomfortable pressure on the top of my head.  The lack of locking or clicking adjustable band seems like an easy thing to engineer a fix for, while the lack of padding on the top and the smallish size of the earpads seems to be more of an aesthetic choice that leads to a sacrifice in comfort.Now for sound quality.  First things first I'll say that there is a bit of an annoying hiss when ANC is on but no music is playing.  It's generally inaudible when music is actually playing, but I bought these to sometimes just have on for noise blocking purposes and found the hiss distracting (your mileage may vary on this, I admit I may be overly sensitive to this sort of thing compared to many).  I will also admit that in general I find that I adjust to the sound of a given headphone over time, and that my brain gets trained to adjust to a given headphone.  That said, I was not immediately blown away by the sound quality of these headphones.  I listened to a bunch of music from a broad variety of genres, and my impressions were that these are good sounding, but nothing spectacular.  I think this might just be because these are $200 headphones with another $300 worth of electronics, design, and marketing, not true $500 headphones.  I tested these with a macbook pro with APT-X and high quality audio sources.To get some reference, I have Jaybird Bluebuds X headphones that I think sound almost as good, Beyerdynamic DT770 that I think sound just as good if not better, and AKG K702 that again sound just as good if not better.I personally did not have any issues with bluetooth dropping out, but I also did not stress them in any way and was generally listening within several feet of the bluetooth source with nothing in between.When I weighed the sound quality, comfort, price, warranty, and reports of others having bluetooth issues, I decided that these headphones just didn't justify the price and ended up returning them.  The market for high end bluetooth headphones is heating up and I'll continue to wait for something truly great.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"For me, did not justify the price, I'll be waiting on the next top of the line bluetooth headphones..."

    ","I have used 2 Sennheiser headphones before I bought the Momentum 2.0 wireless. The first 2 sennheiser headphones were great until I found Parrot Zik which sound a little better and that is what I am using now. To my amazement, Momentum 2.0 wireless which I expect to improve on the previous Sennheiser headphones, failed in many respects: it produced a muffled sound (low S/N ratio) as opposed to the clear sound Sennheiser is noted for; the bass is deep but it rumbles; the high note/ treble is scratchy; the mid-range note is indistinguishable from the rest of the music. The general appearance of the headphone is nothing to write home about. It has no supporting equalizer or apps. I decided to return the headphone the very day I received it. Sincerely speaking, I will not recommend it to anybody.",2.0 out of 5 stars,The first 2 sennheiser headphones were great until I found Parrot Zik which sound a little ...

    ","While audio playback the Bluetooth connection breaks out at ~60% of my usage scenarios/places (home, gym, street, sports field). Tested with iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 5s in my hand or in my packet.Sometimes the Bluetooth connection to my iPhones (both 6 plus and 5s) completely brakes down, such as the  audio output goes to the iPhone speaker rather than to the Momentum 2.0, but both iPhone(s) and Momentum 2.o indicate bluetooth connection up. This is IMO a Bluetooth 4.0 protocol implementation error which unfortunately cannot be resolved by a firmware update, because Sennheiser does not offer a firmware update capability.I verified that the playback source used in all tests is ok by playing back through a wired headphone.I re-settet the iPhones and Momentum 2.0  multiple times, but the Bluetooth connection problems are persistent and reproducible.I compared Sennheiser Momentum 2.0  with 2 other bluetooth headsets I own: Sennheiser MM 550-X and Plantronics BackBeat PRO which both were able to keep the Bluetooth connections up at 98% of my usage scenarios/places and never lost a Bluetooth connection completely.Sennheiser USA support agreed that Momentum 2.0 should be able to maintain a Bluetooth 4.0 connection at least as well as Sennheiser MM 550-X (Bluetooth 2.1), which is not the case in my tests (Sennheiser MM 550-X has a shorter range, but fewer break outs). Support suggested to hard reset Bluetooth in Momentum 2.0 by draining the battery completely and waiting 15 min., which did did not change anything.Bluetooth connectivity issues killed this deal for me and I returned Momentum 2.0, but kept Plantronics BackBeat PRO.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth connection to iPhone 6plus and iPhone 5s breaks out too frequently

    ","Very disappointed with these headphones, at first I thought they are a good performing pair of wireless headphones. I had bought them after a good day at the casino and was about to board a plane and decided to splurge on noise cancelling headphones and I'd bought a few pairs of Sennheiser cans before and was impressed by the sound and build quality. These worked well for about a year when suddenly they decided to stop accepting a charge. They were never abused, actually always stored back in their pouch and look almost new. They never got wet or were used in any inclement conditions. They were mostly used on planes in active mode (noise cancelling), and trains with my Chord MoJo headphone amp/DAC in passive mode. My main problem is with Sennheiser customer support. Even though they haven't even existed as a model for 2 years they refused to honor the 2 year warranty listed on the box as I did not keep my original sales receipt (my bad I was traveling) but as a repeat customer who bought one of their high end products I would have thought they would take care of the customer, but instead offered me a flat rate repair offer of $245?! After letting customer service know that was an unreasonable amount and that I would not consider paying such a sum, but would consider a reasonable repair offer, they seemingly ceased communication. All in all, good sound quality that does not over emphasize any one area of the music, but absolutely shoddy build quality and customer support.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound good but shoddy quality not built to last and poor customer service!

    ","There is no way I can improve on Twister's review. I'll simply do an addendum here.My retail box was very tightly packaged, and it took a few minutes to get the lid off (seriously). Sturdy and well-packed are adjectives that come to mind. The shipping box is definitely made to protect the headphones well. Good job Sennheiser!The USB charging cable is pretty sturdy. You can charge the headphones one of three ways: 1) plug it into your computer or laptop; 2) use an automobile charger adapter; or 3) use a wall outlet AC adapter. It would have been really nice if Sennheiser had included both adapters, but I guess you can't have everything. I had a spare AC adapter lying around, so I used it.No matter how excited you are, let the beauty charge up for 3 hours first. You'll save yourself some frustration, trust me. While it's charging up, download the full instruction manual from the Sennheiser website and read up.The headphones' 3.5 mm audio cable felt a bit on the thin and flimsy side. However, as long as you exercise normal caution and care with it, you should have no problems.There is only ONE LED on the cups. At first I thought there was another LED that wasn't lighting up by the power switch, but no, there is only ONE LED that lights up either red, purple or blue (depending on the charge state and the pairing state). It might be a good idea (like I did) to use a small flashlight to see everything clearly, or just use a strong overhead light.The volume switch doubles as the check-battery-status switch and the phone calls switch. This leads me to a small nitpick.Sennheiser gives you pictographs to show you exactly how the switches work. They, of course, give you a legend to show you how to interpret the pictographs. By the way, don't bother with the Quick Start Guide. It uses the pictographs all over the place, and it will only confuse you until you download the PDF file (full instruction manual) from the Sennheiser website. You do not get a full instruction manual with the headphones, so, again, no matter how excited you are, just download it from the website and your life will be easier.Also, make sure to download the Sennheiser Updater to update the firmware. That's at the main website also. On edit: As of Nov. 7th 2015, there is NO firmware update or Sennheiser Updater software update, so for right now, you can skip this step.Despite my minor nitpicks, the build quality is truly outstanding. With reasonable care and caution, they should last you years.Needless to say, the audio quality is superlative. These are the best headphones I've ever owned. They are very comfortable on my ears, which are average size (I guess) for a tall man (6 feet 3 inches). My head is, I guess, average sized for my frame.Enjoy!  :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful headphones! Download the full instruction manual FIRST

    ","I mainly listen to classical music and jazz. For those two music genres these are excellent headphones. Very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and their attention to detail including bass punch is very satisfying.The only drawback from my giving a 5 star rating is that they don’t get as loud as other Bluetooth headphones (Focal and Klipsch come to mind; Klipsch go to deafening levels and Focal too will go much louder than these but each have their drawbacks as well. Frankly I wouldn’t choose either given what these can do).Noise cancellation is good; doesn’t compete with the likes of the Sony 1000XM2 but the level of ANC those provide give me a dizzy spell; these do not. I will say though that those looking for a higher level of ANC with equal sound attenuation should definitely give the Sony 1000XM2 a try. They definitely give these a run for the money.It’s impossible to get everything you want but these are overall very good headphones and I wouldn’t hesitate recommending them to anyone who isn’t looking for deafening, head-banging volume during their listening experience.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Top of the Line Headphones

    ","I'm a big fan of Sennheiser's headphones.  I currently have the following:  these Momentum 2/M2 along with the HD 700, HD 580, HD 280, and HD 598.  I also have a pair of their IEMs that are no longer in production, though I cannot recall their model number.  I've had headphones and IEMs from other manufacturers over the years (currently also have Ultimate Ears triple.fi pro earbuds as well as the Audio-Technica ATH-MSR7GM.  Previous sets owned and used include the Bose SoundLink On Ear (the most comparable set to the M2), Sony MDR CD 6, and the Stax Lambda Pro.I'll start with the positives of the M2:  Very comfortable.  Attractive looking (for a full size headset).  Nice construction.  And, most importantly, very good sound.  I would place these between my HD 700 and HD 580.  If you know the sound of either of those sets, then you will know that is high praise.  The Bose bluetooth headphones I used to own were a gift, and they were my first bluetooth headphones.  I liked them well enough for the several months I used them, forgiving their unnaturally bright presentation because I finally didn't have to have a wire connected to my music player at the gym.  The M2 provides an entirely different level of music experience.  Some have claimed that the bass is a bit bloated, and I will admit that it is perhaps a tad too present on recordings that have a lot of mid bass information.  In reality, though, on most tracks I don't get the sense that the bass is obscuring other frequencies.  The midrange and treble are very nice.  This is where Sennheiser typically shines, even on their less expensive headphones.  Instead of accentuating the treble to give a sense of excitement, Sennheiser is typically a bit more laid back.  As a result, the listener can actually distinguish the different sound quality between different recordings.  That might not sound like a good thing to someone who just wants accentuated bass and treble so the music comes screaming out at them.  For people who prefer a greater sense of realism and who understand that the midrange is the most important spectrum to get right in terms of audio equipment, I much prefer Sennheiser's philosophy to focus on midrange clarity.As I write this review, I am listening to the M2 wirelessly streaming from my tablet, playing a collection of popular hits from the 1970s.  Tracks that are well recorded in that they have a full frequency spectrum along with some sense of soundstage sound wonderful.  When a track comes on that wasn't recorded and/or mixed so well, the M2 presents those flaws.One might expect a 5-star review given my comments above, but here are the things I don't like about the M2:  Bluetooth connectivity is spotty with some devices.  I don't seem to have the same problem with dropouts on my Samsung tablet that I do with my Nexus 6 phone, and the dropouts on the Nexus are inconsistent.  Some listening sessions have few to none and others are plagued with multiple instances where the sound cuts out for a split second.  Sennheiser supposedly addressed this issue with the Revision 2 model of this headphone but my box indicates ""Rev 02"" and I still have this issue.My other real complaint is that exorbitant price of the replacement earpads which seem to only be available direct from Sennheiser, with no generics available (at least not that I have been able to find).  Even Sennheiser doesn't list the earpads on their parts website; I had to email them to learn that they were, in fact, available at a cost that's close to 15% of buying another pair of M2 wireless headphones and about 1/3 the cost of the wired version.  Given that people buying a pair of bluetooth headphones might be wearing them out and about and sweating while wearing them, pricing replacement earpads that high is simply not customer friendly.  I've only had my set about 9 months and I am already wanting to replace the earpads due to salt stains from sweat.The astute reader might notice that I didn't address the noise canceling feature of these headphones.  I cannot really say much about this since this is my first set of headphones with this feature.  I can definitely tell when I turn the headphones on that some of the room noise is significantly attenuated, so their performance in this regard is good enough for me.  A word of caution, however: the noise cancellation feature is always on when these are used wirelessly.  The only way to turn off the noise cancellation is to connect these via the included cord and then leave the headphones powered off.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and great sound quality with a few issues

    ","Purchased on Prime NOW as somewhat of an impulse buy.  I have numerous headphones and would consider myself a bit of a hobbyist.  I am NOT after an ""accurate"" sound signature, but do enjoy detailed sound with good instrument separation, along with quality bass.  My hearing range across all frequencies is good and has not been affected by loud music;  I typically listen at less than 50% volume.  My profession requires I take care of my ears, but I digress...BUILD:  Excellent.  Just top notch.  The earcups have the highest quality memory foam I have experienced in any headphone.  It's almost like it was cut straight from a memory foam bed.  Hinges work well and are put together nicely.  No complaints here.SOUND:  Here's where it started breaking down for me.  After reading all the rave reviews, I thought I would be taken to another plane of existence, but unfortunately, i was not too impressed with the sound.  The signature, to my ears, was quite mid-forward, which also favored the mid-bass frequencies.  While there is a lot of detail to the sound, it is almost too detailed, such that instrumentation is almost blended together.  The highs are a bit rolled off and do not have the brightness that, say, the B&O H7s have.  If you're using an iPhone, forgetaboutit. These do not support AAC, so buyer beware if your primary device is an iPhone.  I tested it out with both my iPhone 6s Plus and my LG G4 (aptX), and yes, aptX does make a difference over SBC.  NOTE:  My sound evaluation was based on my experience using my LG G4 over aptX.BLUETOOTH:  Another area of weakness.  I had Version 2, but BT pairing was very slow and didn't connect with my Samsung 4k TV purchased in 2015.  There were also other 2015 devices in my home it just simply refused to find and pair withANC:  Not too good.  Called ""hybrid"" for a reason.  Just a small layer of noise cancellation to help with the ambient noise, but nowhere near the Bose QC 35s or even the Sony MDR-100ABNs.  To me, the ANC on these cans is just a ""perk"", not a true selling point for someone that needs ANC.To me, these are OK.  If you can pair it with your device, then the connection seems to be stable, however, for me, it's incompatible with many modern, name-brand devices.  Again, the sound, to me, is about average and a bit ""veiled"".  Instrument separation is not good.  If you're coming from BEATS, then yes, these will sound absolutely spectacular.  If you are coming from B&O H7s or even something like the Sony MDR-100ABNs, then these will not blow you away.RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVE W/ ANC:  Yes, I'm going to say it, the Bose QC 35s.  I'm not a Bose fanboy, but those headphones sound really good.  Instrument separation is excellent.  They are not mid-forward and have a nice clean signature, with just a slight bass bump, which goes quite deep, down to around 10Hz.RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVE W/O ANC:  B&O H7s.  Sound signature is similar, except these have better clarity and instrument separation.  They also have both AAC and aptX, so they will sound good on Apple and Android devices.  There is also a nice app that gives you different EQ options, but it is not a typical EQ.  Rather, the app connects with the headphones and seems to actually adjust the on board DSP vs. post-processing the signal after the DSP pass.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, Not Great."

    ","I bought this from an audio store in town. The Best natural sounding headphones I ever owned. Comparing this to the Beats Studio Wireless which is half the price.Starting with the Comfort ability of the ear cups. They Cups measures the same 2.75"" x 1.75"" (2.5"" x 1.5"") ear size comfortable fit. One major difference is the Depth, Sennheiser Momentum has about 1/8"" advantage. For a long duration use, the Momentum was comfortable. I used the Beats for a 13 hr flight, and used the Momentum on a 14 hr return flight Continuous usage. Beats made me a little uncomfortable after about 4 hrs of usage, Had to re-position constantly. Momentum had no issues on over usage.Weight - Momentum feels half the weight of Studio. Making it more comfortable for a long trip. I travel a lot. Momentum seemed to offer all the comfort.Audio Quality - Momentum reproduces the notes and tones accurately. While Beats have tuned Bass. For my playlist Momentum did a good job. For others, This is something to keep in mind while selecting.Max Volume - Momentum at 65% of volume = Beats Studio at 57% Volume. To make a decision, Remember the Quality you seek and the Volume you would listen to.Active Noise Cancellation - Momentum has a subtle ANC, while the Beats Studio has an aggressive ANC. This can be measured on a Flight trip or a simulated Flight Noise for efficiency. Due to the nature of the ANC developed.Bluetooth Versions - Momentum is 4.0+, Beats not sure.Compression Code Momentum -  apt-X (Great for the Audio CD quality like .flac files , Not .mp3 files)Battery Life - 20 Hrs for Momentum vs 12.5 hrs for Beats Studio.NFC paring - Momentum only, Beats studio does not have this.Conclusion - This is an ideal headphone for a balanced sound output and comfort.

    ","I have NEVER paid more than $120 for a pair of headphones and when I did I still felt foolish. However this time I was looking for a very difficult solution set. Wireless, noise canceling with built in (non-boom) microphone and I gave my self a huge budget of anything under $500. After lots and lots of searching I decided on these. I have been using them for almost 6 months primarily hooked up to my MacBook.I'm very happy with honestly everything from fit to sound quality (of both input and output) to battery life. The construction of the product is impeccable IMO as well as the design. I don't feel like a total moron wearing these on a video conference call. My only complaint isn't a big deal, but because the microphone uses the same inputs for noise canceling as well as speaking, when you jump onto a call the noise canceling completely shuts off. You get use to it after a couple days. It technically makes sense, they would need t double the inputs to avoid this.I'm writing this review only now because after perhaps 6 months I had an issue with noise canceling in the right headphone. I logged my ticket with Sennheiser and they immediately shipped me a brand new pair upon receipt. I was really surprised by how easy the process was and how great the experience was.

    ","I got this a few weeks ago. Overall, I'm quite pleased with the product. Before this I had a pair of still functional but very warn out Sennheiser 380 with passive noise cancelling. I have annoying neighbors, so active noise cancelling is definitely an upgrade. At the same time since I'm used to the 380 I want to decent audio quality as well. I mainly use it connected to my imac via bluetooth for music listening and netflix. Being able to walk around is nice and works within a 5-8m radius. The sound quality is excellent.The noise cancellation is quite good but not perfect. Some examples, my imac at full blast while playing a game is completely surpressed. While cooking and enjoying some music I realized that the kitchen exhaust was in fact at full blast and not on the lowest setting; even with my head stuck under it it sounded like it was at the lowest setting.  My neighbor's noise (TV noise, subwoofer noise, etc.) is filtered out quite effectively. With the 380 I definitely had cases where I could hear my neighbors even while playing music. With the momentum 2.0, it's quiet even with the music off.So, I'm mostly happy with this except for the following issues; none of which are showstoppers for me:1) bluetooth connectivity is very sensitive and seems to be affected by the microphone settings when using in combination with OS X. For example I had the microphone set to internal while listening to some music on the momentum 2.0. The sound was vey choppy. This went away completely after switching over the microphone to the momentum 2.0 as well. Similarly, I fiddled with the gain settings on in the input preferences and that created a lot of distortion until I moved the slider back down. I've also discovered that e.g. my microwave interferes a lot when it is on. Some of these issues may be OS X specific; apple has had issues with their bluetooth driver on several occasions. Important for me is that with the settings fixed, things seem to work without distortion.2) Every time it connects to my imac it says ""connected"" and then switches to the phone answering mode for a few seconds before announcing ""call ended"". I guess OS X switches on the microphone and then the Sennheiser figures out that in fact there isn't a call going on after all. Kind of annoying. While it is in phone answering mode the sound quality is s***, which I guess is a side effect of having to share the bluetooth bandwidth for bi directional audio. I have no idea how to fix this.3) Compared to the 380 the headband is harder, stiffer, and quite tight. I would have appreciated a bit looser and softer. My ears don't quite fit inside the earpads either and the stiffness in combination with glasses is an issue. Definitely much less comfortable than the 380.4) There is a button combination that lets the Sennheiser announce how  much battery it has. This does not work while connected to anything. So kind of useless. Supposedly, it should be possible to read out the battery level from a mobile phone. I've yet to see this work with my nexus 6p. Maybe this is IOS specific.5) In general the button combinations are kind of hard to memorize and the buttons are kind of fiddly. The volume rocker sort of is also a push button but it is easy to get it wrong. It works fine for adjusting the volume but getting next (two pushes) or previous (three pushes) right is a bit hit and miss. Half of the time I get it wrong. So, I tend to not use that. Supposedly you can also answer calls and fast forward. But I can't be bothered to memorize the  combination of rocking and push motions I need to memorize for that and I'm pretty sure I'll never answer a call with this thing or that if I try I actually end up doing something wrong.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good headphones but not without issues

    ","I wanted to get a noise cancellation bluetooth headphone and was confused in choosing between:- Senheiser HD1 ($500), or- Bang Olufsen BeoPlay H8 ($455), or- Bose Quite Comfort 35 ($350).Reading reviews from Amazon did not really help me because I didn't see any direct comparison between the products. In addition, I had no clue how those reviewers tested the device (what music, what emphasis they were looking for).I consider myself as an audiophile. I play music a lot and sound quality is a definite imperative. I never had a noise cancellation headphone as I own Shure SE535 earphone ($450) non bluetooth. I still wear my SE535 when I work out as it tucks nicely in my ear and secures behind my head.Now, I wanted to buy a noise cancellation headphone with bluetooth option as it can be handy for air travel. I am aware of the trade-off, i.e. sound quality with bluetooth is sub-par and cannot be compared with cable connected ear/headset.I decided to buy the 3 devices mentioned above (Senheiser, BeO and Bose). As soon as they arrived, I tested all 3 devices. I even compared it with my Shure SE535. This is how I tested the device:Sound test via Bluetooth connection, all music were streamed with Spotify (with Bass Booster On)1. I played James Blake ""Limit To Your Love"". It's a semi ""electronic""  song is simple and is really heavy on bass at different frequencies.2. Cello Suite No.1. Johann S. Bach played by Yo Yo Ma. It's a classical cello play which again emphasizes on bass.3. ""Spiegel im Spiegel"" by Arvo Part. Another classical work heavy on piano and violin.4. Nine Inch Nail ""Closer""5. Royksopp ""What Else is There?""Results:Bass and trebles come out better in both BeoPlay H8 and Bose QuiteComfort 35. Senheiser HD1 is definitely inferior. Hence it's going out of my door for return. For the $500 price tag, I was really surprised Senheiser HD1 delivers no sound quality at all compared to Bang Olufsen or Bose. I also had trouble in finding out how to turn the device off. It looks cute and expensive regardless.I did not try Senheiser with the cable connected to my iPhone. The bluetooth sound quality was already terrible, so it's pointless to try with the cable.As for the BeoPlay H8 and Bose QuiteComfort 35, this was quite difficult to narrow down.When they are on Bluetooth mode with my iPhone volume cranked up at maximum, BeoPlay H8 sound quality was a little bit muffled. The Bose however seems louder by about 2 step up. But when I tried playing those music with the cable hooked up (non Bluetooth), BeOPlay H8 delivers better bass/treble, really superb overall sound quality.In terms of ""Noise Cancelling"", both BeO and Bose are about the same.In terms of design, Bose covers you whole ear, BeO does not do that. BeoPlay H8 gives a good fit though, it feels secure and more solid (it is slightly heavier than Bose).BeoPlay H8 has a touch control for volume and to play/stop. This feature can be annoying or beneficial - depending on user. I personally am not used to it yet, but I think I'll adjust to it very soon.Conclusion: Senheiser HD1 is a NO-NO! Instead, I am keeping my Bang & Olufsen BeoPlay H8For those who consider buying headphone at this price tag, make sure you choose the one you like best. You may find what I did (testing each device head-to-head directly) useful. You don't want to end up with a $500 device that you will hate.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Comparison Among Senheiser HD1 vs. BeoPlay H8 vs. Bose QuiteComfort 35

    ","The Sennheiser Momentum is a product series whose goal is to merge the two most difficult attributes in modern day headphones, style and sonic performance. Here before you is the refinement of the original Momentum that started it all, the Momentum 2.The Momentum 2's packaging is typical of Sennheiser and immediately showcases quality and first class workmanship. Upon removal of the lid, the much reduced in size case is first apparent. The cable is mostly similar to the first iteration but no longer does it have the steel constructed in-line microphone and controls. You then get your typical quick start guide and Sennheiser's 2 year warranty registration booklet. Here is where the Momentum 2 simply outclasses nearly all headphones immediately. Not only do you get a protective zipper case, you also get a pouch. Nowadays the trend for such expensive headphones is to only include a pouch which is a slap in the face for such a costly investment. To even go further, Sennheiser includes foam to help keep the integrity of the pads composure while folded up. Now that's what I call quality packaging. And yea, folding, the new Momentum's can now fold which is nothing new in this day and age, but hey better late than never.The Sennheiser Momentum is simply gorgeous to look at. It's a very simple design at heart, but it's so well executed and tastefully down from the stainless steel arched headband, the glistening holographic Sennheiser logo and the stitched leather on the top of the headband. The ear pads are entirely redesigned and are soft to the touch. Finally, these can be safely called over the ear headphones thanks to the much larger in diameter opening of the pads in comparison to the previous iteration of the Momentum. The headband is essentially the same and maintains that fashionable low profile design that keeps the uniformity of the arch close to the head and reduces the bulge effect of larger headphones. Here we see steel reinforced folding mechanism that grants the Momentum 2 the ability to collapse down upon itself for storage. This should fare much better than something from the Beats Studio or Solo series with their plastic construction.The beautiful sculpted sound signature that I lusted over in the previous Momentum is thankfully unharmed. There's something about the level of refinement and soothing spark to the attack of the Momentum signature that is all too addictive. It's a very forgiving sound that still showcases the refinement that Sennheiser is all too well known for.The bass is very linear from 20hz to 250hz creating this sense of ease to the presentation. Immediately apparent over the previous iteration is the tighter control of the attack and the more precise rendition of decay resulting in one of the best bass performances that I have heard, period. It doesn't quite reach that last bit of laser tight composure of my planar magnetics like the Hifiman HE560, but boy does it deliver a dynamic slam when the music calls for it. Integration into the midrange is seamless like with the previous Momentum, but now due to the quicker pace the bass to midrange bleed that occurred when the bass became too complex in the recording that sometimes flawed the original momentum's has vanished.The midrange presentation is sonic gold. Sennhesier just simply knows the foundation of the music and the tonal balance required to reproduce all of the information recreating a true to life experience. Vocals, guitars, pianos or whatever instrument lies in this frequency all have this robust composure that remains grain less and endlessly smooth with incredible low levels of harsh transient that also induces vocal sibilance. Overall, the midrange is quite linear with a slow descending slope into the lower treble which highlights the lower midrange and restores the natural heft in the sounds in that region. The level of detail rendition is also simply stunning maybe due to the heightened level of treble over the first Momentum or just a superior transducer at work.The treble is very articulated, but most importantly more in-line with the music in terms of emphasis. The first Momentum simple was too subdued here and resulted a closed in soundstage that reduced the sense of speed and clarity of the music. The Momentum 2 raises the treble just enough to revive the harmonic decay in the upper stratosphere, but not cause them to be too bright for their intended use. This welcoming improvement in the rendition of the treble music grants the Momentum 2 one of the biggest soundstage performances that I have yet to hear from a portable headphone. The stage is larger in width than it is depth, but it's very satisfying to hear.In summary, Sennheiser has listened to the feedback from its consumers and reconstructed the Momentum both physically and acoustically to better adhere to their goal, uncompromising mobile performance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser sound on the go...

    ","Amazing headphones.This is a review of the new HD1, Not older Momentum 2.I did not buy on Amazon. If you chat with Sennheiser support, they will give you a 10% discount code.Build quality is tops. Nothing but leather and metal for the important bits.In spite of others not liking the one button control, I do. I'm 56 years old so I'm not a kid who masters tech in three minutes. So the control should not be a concern in my opinion.They are comfy. As in, as good or better than the Bose QC35 which are great.There is also an on-ear version but I prefer over ear.Noise cancellation is not what Bose are. Not meant to be. No gimmicks to play with, just good most cancellation for plane hum, car noise, etc. You can hear people talking. If you want all board blocked look at Sony or Bose. These play music better though. That's the trade off.Music sounds fantastic. I have played them a couple days 24/7 to burn them in.Also used a couple apps to blast tones to help break in.I listen to lots of rock and classic rock as well as classical, blues etc. They're awesome. And they are plenty loud too. Using with iPhone 7.Bluetooth works great. No issues.Only thing I wish these had are magnetic ear pads like the B&W PX.These are expensive but when you look at $350 beats and others that are all plastic, you get the pricing.Comes with case and pouch. All cables.Ready to rock with nothing else needed.Have not played yet on the wire but they are supposed to sound even better.Noise cancelling is on always with Bluetooth. This is not a gimmicky set of cans. All business. All class.They fold as well.If you want apps and other stuff to play with these are not your pick. If you're skateboarding they're not your cans.If you want the best, hassle free music without a cable, look no further.",5.0 out of 5 stars,HD1 are the standard for Bluetooth music.

    ","I purchased the PXC-550 and the Momentum 2.0 wireless at the same time to compare the two.I am returning the Momentum 2.0 wireless.The PXC-550 just sounds better, the noise cancelling is noticeably superior, it has more useful features, is more comfortable, and is more compact. It is also arguably better looking.All testing was done using an iPhone 6+ with the Sennheiser CapTune software.  I listen to everything from European Viking/black/pagan metal, Trance, Dubstep, Indie, 90's Alternative, Classic rock, Chopped-n-screwed rap, and lots of Beatles (they have the best stereo effects, especially with headphones).I have owned and enjoyed Audio Technia ATM-M50s, VSonic V07 Bass IEMs, and Sennheiser 598 open back headphones.PXC-550I received the PXC-550 first.  Connecting to Bluetooth was simple and sounds good enough for casual listening, though I can tell the sound improves through the hardwire connection.  This is my first wireless headphone and there is something liberating about the lack of wires, and getting tangled up in them.  I like the touch controls and have only accidentally skipped tracks a couple times.  Probably the best part of the touch controls is just tapping it to pause the music when you need to concentrate, talk to someone, or take them off.  One thing about the touch controls that is slightly annoying is whenever I turn the headphones off or disconnect from a source (go from Bluetooth to hardwire), the volume resets to a pre-set medium/low setting, and I have to flick up to get them loud/where I like them again.  THESE HEADPHONES ARE EXQUISITELY COMFORTABLE!  I wear them for hours and hours and just forget they are on.  No pressure from the headband, which has nice soft padding.  The ""holes"" your ears go into the cups seem small, but they are ear shaped and has been no problem at all.  I think my outer ears may be touching the pads, but it is so ergonomic and soft that it feels good, like wearing very nice earmuffs.  I'll be honest: I like having these on my head than not!  FYI: I am a 5'11' man with normal ear size for my build.  I am onboard an aircraft carrier, and between the loud ventilation, server racks with multiple cooling fans, plus aircraft taking off and landing right above me, they do a great job of cutting down the noise to a barely audible ""fffffff"" in my workshop.  I will say that they don't handle wind very well.  One of the air conditioners in my shop blows right on me, and it seems to cause the noise-cancelling some fits and oscillations if the breeze hits the headphone's ambient audio sensors at a particular angle.  It sounds like a low, dull, midbass flutter.  I turn this AC unit off due to this reason, plus it gets way too cold in here!  These headphones fold up into a small travel case that can easily be thrown in my backpack.  One feature that I LOVE is the auto turn-off when I take them off and rotate the earcups.  Way smarter than an on/off switch that you can forget to do.  The CapTune app is pretty cool, and lately I've been using it more than the regular iPhone Music app.  It features several great adjustable equalizers, allows you to customize the controls.  It also allows you to access a ""Director"" mode, where you can modify Boost, Spatial, Reverb, and DLC.  Playing with these can make the headphones sound either interesting or simply BETTER, depending on what you are listening to.  The ""SoundCheck"" mode will give you a choice between 2 EQ curves.  You click ""A"" and hear the music and see one curve, or click ""B"" and hear it through another curve.  You just select the one you prefer, and after choosing between 10 pairs of EQ curves, CapTune combines them all into your preferred EQ curve.  I found the results generally pleasing (it is now my default EQ curve). The overall sound quality, even with the EQ on FLAT, I would best describe as ""smooth"". These aren't bass cannons, or reference headphones.  But they never hurt my ears, and I have sensitive ears.  Super shrill and loud upper mids can send my ears into a crackly convulsion.  However, I do enjoy my music LOUD.  I wish these headphones would get louder than they do, but they get as loud as I probably need.  Any more and I'm probably not doing much service to my long-term hearing.MOMENTUM 2.0 WIRELESSI bought the Momentums thinking I'd prefer them over the 550s.  They look to have an AWESOME build quality, and they do.  I ordered the ivory edition with the brown leather headband.  I was a bit put-off with the ivory color, which looks more yellow in person than the white-ish it did online.  The first thing I noticed was the box was much bigger than the 550s.  Opening it revealed the travel case, which is easily twice as big as the 550's (not nearly as portable).  I opened the case to reveal the headphones.  Touching them, the ear pads feel almost gooey... they are that soft.  However, they just don't feel right when I put them on, and they don't seem to cover my ears completely.  Perhaps it is because they are oval, and the 550s are ""egg"" shaped?  The headband is not comfortable at all and causes me discomfort, and I usually don't complain about that with any headphone.  From the moment I turned on the Momentums, their upper-midrange was so shrill it caused my right ear to go into a crackly seizure until I turned the volume way down.  It's like the upper-midrange is boosted.  Or maybe I'm too used to V-shaped frequency responses?  Either way, I don't like it and it is painful.  No amount of EQ adjustments using the CapTune iPhone software could get the Momentums to sound as smooth as the 550s.  However, the bass on the Momentums seems punchier overall than the 550s.  Another bummer I discovered while trying to sort-out the painful mids was the ""Director"" options are not available with the Momentums.  Apparently, that is a PXC-550 only option.  I have also noticed that the noise cancelling does not seem to be as effective as with the 550s, but I do not notice as much wind buffeting.  I actually had to check if the Momentum's noise cancelling was working, or if it was the effect of over-ear headphones muffling the noise.  To turn on or off the headphones, you have to find and hold down the small button for several seconds.If the Momentums sounded like the 550's, and had the same electronic features, I would love to keep them.  But as it is, they are being returned.  They were a big disappointment.",2.0 out of 5 stars,SENNHEISER PXC-550 vs SENNHEISER MOMENTUM 2.0 WIRELESS

    ","I currently own the Sennheiser Urbanite XL Over-Ear Headphones, which were my go to headphones when I wanted something over the ear. In terms of sound quality, the Momentum 2.0 is right on par. While these are wireless, I still won't be sporting these to the gym or while running outside.

    ","Simply amazing sound quality for bluetooth headphones. Noise cancellation isn't the best, but it's still great at eliminating common room white noise like ventilation systems. Voices, not so much. Ironically sounds less lively using the wired connection, but battery life seems great and sound quality is excellent for its class. Far superior to the Beats Studio (or Solo 3's) for the money.The earcups aren't as soft as on other products though, and for an over-ear the cups are surprisingly small, so if you have huge ears you may want to try these before you buy. Very lightweight though and fairly small for a full over-ear.

    ","As a frequent traveler I am a bit nutty about earphones, and prefer wireless.  Let start by immediately eliminating the Zik 2.  Besides the dismal battery life, the build quality is poor, customer service is historically terrible, and the ""lighter version 2's"" still are not terribly comfortable for prolonged wearing.  The Parrot App doesn't add much to the listening.  I found the B&O and Momentum 2 similar in certain respects.  Both have great audio ( but different and worth sampling personally rather than reading about ), and with the new Momemtums and BeoPlay BT connectivity is a snap.  Both have similar ANC, but the Momentum with the overhear gives better isolation and less hiss than the BeoPlay.  I found both to be inferior to the Bose QC25 ANC,  but at least for air travel when listening to music or white noise the difference is not meaningful and the audio on the wireless headset was superior.  In terms of comfort the Momentum are more comfortable, as I found the Beoplay to be a bit too tight.  Both the Beoplay and Momentum are well built, the Beoplay are a bit smaller but come only with a cheap sac, while the Momentum come with a well constructed case.  Finally for phone calls on an IPhone I found the Momentum to be superior both on the caller's end as well as the listeners.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Momentum vs Beoplay vs Zik - Momentum wins BT race for now

    ","I've been using these roughly 8-12 hours per day since I received them Monday. I did considerable research on which pair of wireless noise canceling headphones currently available is the best overall model. The consensus pointed to the Momentum 2.0 Wireless. The package itself wasn't anything out of the ordinary, and the case is nice looking, but I prefer something with a harder, sturdier exterior. This is a relatively soft fabric, although it does feel durable and well constructed.The headset itself is quite different from the one I've upgraded from--the Bose QC 15s. The Sennheisers feel slightly more fragile upon first handling, with the size shifting mechanism coming across as both unique and also bordering on somewhat flimsy feeling. Over time, I have gotten used to this construction, and the headset does come to feel pretty familiar quickly. There's no doubt it's a more fragile construction than any of the Bose around ear models I've owned. The fact that the wires are exposed leading from the headband to the ear cup was a bit alarming at first, although since I won't be exercising in these I don't think it will come to be an issue. These just are not designed for exercise; that's certain.In terms of the control mechanisms on the headset, I do think it has superior capabilities to the Bose models I've been using recently. You can control multiple functions by pressing the multipurpose button in different successions, and it's pretty straightforward. The sound quality itself is excellent. I have them connected to both my iPhone for music and my TV. The sound quality is absolutely stellar over Bluetooth. I haven't even bothered to spend time listening to these with the wire attached to my phone, although I do plan to compare the sound quality once I'm slightly more familiar with the Bluetooth quality. I haven't had any connection issues so far, other than when a solid door comes between the headphones and the audio source.The quality of music on these is absolutely fantastic. The noise canceling function is also seriously impressive. These headphones can cancel out just about any noise when music or TV is playing through them. As far as I can tell, they also retain noise well when secured around the ears fully. They look a bit large on the head at first, but over time I've gotten used to the fit and overall style.My expectations for these were high, and I would say they have met them in every way. They're a solid 90-95 out of 100. The only real downside is that they are a bit heavy. After wearing them for hours on end, they definitely come to feel a bit bulky around my ears.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Solid 90-95 Out of 100

    ","I picked these up a few weeks ago — while they were on sale down at $350. First off, you won't regret purchasing these in the mid-$300 range. If they were full price at $500 that may be pushing it.Quality - Amazing. Overall look and details are the best on the market. Quality leather earcups and headband. I have bigger ears and they fit over them fine. I wouldn't say these are true 100% over the ears — they're sort of midrange over the ear and slightly on ear. But it really doesn't matter because of how soft the leather earcups are and how comfortable the padding is. So don't stress on the size. With these being portable — it's somewhat preferred to be a little on the smaller side IMO.Sound - Ridiculous clarity. Deep lows, high highs and the mid-range is where it truly shines. The sound picks up every little nuance in the music. It's pretty unbelievable. I had the Sennheiser 280 Pros before this pair that i was always pretty happy with — and they sound incredibly flat in comparison. There is a BIG sound difference. I've also compared with my friend's Beats — and same thing. The Beats have a little bit louder/punchier bass — but the rest of the sound palette isn't even close. Now if I had ONE complaint — it would be that these don't go all that loud. I mean, they go loud enough — but the Beats go much louder. As did my 280 Pros (although they were wired to be fair). Then again — the noise cancelling on these is so good — how loud do you really need to get the music? At some point the volume gets too high and just starts destroying your hearing (a la Beats).Bluetooth - I've seen a lot of complaints on this front and i have had no issue whatsoever. Maybe these newer generation ones they've gotten fixed? Because my headphones connected to my iPhone X in like two seconds. Always connect quick, never lose connection — even when walking, moving, etc. And in my office I can walk at least a good 30 feet away from my phone/desk and not lose connection. So i'd say they're fine in the bluetooth department.Battery - Pretty unbelievable. Pulled them out of the box and listened to them pretty non-stop for 4 days before needing a charge. And then they charged fully in less than two hours. Couldn't believe it. Wish I could listen to music while they charged — but that's a pretty minor complaint.Overall, if you're on the fence or having a tough time deciding on headphones (as I was) pull the trigger on these. There's no way you'll be disappointed. As a big music-lover who listens daily while working (and probably 75% of the time when I'm not at work) I have no idea why I didn't get these years ago. You're just flat-out not hearing the same music until you've heard it on cans with this quality.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best in Class Bluetooth Over-the-Ear Headphones with Sound that MUST be Heard to Appreciate

In addition, the bluetooth issues have been completely resolved with the HD-1.

    ","I love everything about them...other than the ear cup size. Like many other people out there I just find them just too small.I've owned a pair of Sennheiser PXC450 for 5 years which are excellent. I wear them for long periods and they are super comfy. The only think missing from them is wireless, hence my decision to upgrade. The ear pads on the Momentum 2.0 wireless look bigger in the photos, similar to the PXC450, but in reality they are significantly smaller. I don't have freakishly large ears but the pads push against the top, bottom and sides. 10 minutes for me is uncomfortable, and since I want these for long haul flights and for extended periods in a noisy open plan office they sadly are just not fit for (my) purpose. It's very disappointing, i'm a total Sennheiserrphile. I just wish they'd made them bigger. The sound quality is fantastic and the call features work really well.Any amount of money for uncomfortable headphones is just a non starter for me, even if technically they are great.

    ","Let me start by saying that I am comparing the Momentum 2.0 BT to my previously owned Momentum (original, wired), B&O H6, Razer Megalodon, Audio Technica M50x. When I list out the cons, they are in comparison to equally priced or more expensive headphones and would be called nit-picking by some. If you've never owned a niche audiophile headphone, nothing will prepare you for the rich, life-like, open sound staged audio that it can feed you. I might point out a laundry list of shortcomings, but if you are presently listening to lifestyle audio brands (Bose, Beats, Skull Candy and the likes), we are actually comparing apples & oranges. These are all comparative statements / wishlist at this price point, but doesn't glorify the lifestyle audio products in anyway.Pro:1. SOUND QUALITY. Melodious and energetic music abilities. Warm, realistic male voice. Female voice is not perfect but the sound never gets sharp, sibilous or irritating2. FORM FACTOR. Packs into a small form factor with all the folding hinges. It is cool and has a very reasonable looking but easily dust catching, velvety carry bag.3. LOOKS. Looks as cool as the momentum series always did. On a casual look it doesn't take rocket science to realize it isn't run of the mill mass market item.4. BATTERY. Battery lasts really, really long. In fact, I've never run out of battery, even running it for hours & days on end, till finally I am convinced that despite the female voice inside the headphones telling me '3 hours of battery life left', its well over the claimed 22 hours of battery time and I just recharge for the heck of it.5. BLUETOOTH. Bluetooth pairing is easy and fuss-free. In fact, it has been the most user-friendly Bluetooth product I have owned. I've faced more trouble pairing with $500 headphones, $800 speakers and $2500 laptops.Some will not pair, some will keep forgetting the pairing after turning off and some speakers will claim DJ queue as a feature and then waste half an hour re-pairing a system because your friend tried playing a song through his smartphone. However, this Momentum will just pair to multiple (just tried 3 simultaneous gadgets as yet) devices and seamlessly transfer between them. Case in point, When watching YouTube on laptop, it will take a call and pause the playback automatically.6. NOISE CANCELLATION. Noise cancellation is pretty decent. Every critic on the internet seems to think that Bose QC is better, however, I feel this is more realistic. It attenuates sound without building up huge back-pressure on your eardrum. It is a pleasure without being a threat. You can comfortably listen to these for hours without earache, something Bose QC will do but leave a residual dull aching feel after you remove it. The biggest advantage I get is, they quieten out my loud window AC, which is not passively achieved by good earmuffs.7. COMFORT. The earpads are comfortable, large and actually 'around-ear' in the momentum 2.0. Doesn't hurt your ear cartilage, the way original momentums used to. What they do same as the previous generation momentums is, feel secure and light on the head, after a few minutes you tend to forget that they're on your head.Cons:1. Sound Stage. The sound stage is not as wide as the wired, 1st gen momentums. The previous momentum used to be like being transported into a huge hall but this one keeps you in a rather claustrophobic room. However, It goes down deeper into the bass frequencies and vocals are more 'legible'.2. Size. The 1st gen momentum was small, cute, oval-ish. This time around the headphones are larger and rounded. They've lost the petite, sensual appeal of the original. It was a constant crib from all previous owners that 1st gen momentum was barely around ear and mostly on-ear, so the pad size had to be increased and is a good thing, however, why lose the oval shape, most of the volume of the circular shape is just going to waste anyways.3. Headset Microphone. Despite all my ranting about the user friendly Bluetooth, as a headset they are very inconsistent. There are days when you can have an amazing, clear conversation at a very low voice and then at times, the microphone skips, breaks and is simply unusable as a headset. All this in the same place, same signal strength, same phone and 4 inches distance between the phone and the headset. There are occasions when I have to turn off the headset and take the call from my phone, since it is not able to convey a third of the words spoken.Edit - 28 Oct 161. Tried the headphones in wired mode, and it is as close to real life sound as you can expect from a closed back, moving coil headphone. There might be better alternatives available out there but none at this price point and definitely not closed-back. And add to that the fact, that the wireless sound is so good that I didn't feel the need to connect it in wired mode for over a month. The little point I'd raised about the female vocals not sounding very convincing, that gets totally negated in wired mode. Harshest of rock from bands like 30 seconds to Mars and Chevelle, bands known for harsh, edgy, thrashy, extremely chaotic signature sound, also sound controlled (not warm), without losing any energy.2. The battery runs for close to 24 hours of play at just under half the max volume. But takes a lot of time to recharge from low levels. It is almost 4 hours since I started charging and it still hasn't reached 100%. I guess that's not bad for 24 hours playtime, but dash charging smartphones have raised the bar in this regards.3. The next lot of shortcomings I found:(a) The multi-function button for changing volume, track and checking battery level is too fiddly. Besides it just refuses to work in intended manner most of the time. I require to open the manual every time I need to check battery and yet it misinterprets my button click combo.(b) There should be some sort of a visual clue to battery and volume levels on the headphone itself. There is no way of checking without wearing the cans or connecting them to a phone (blue tooth) or laptop (wired).(c) There should be a mechanism to turn off the noise cancellation. When in wired mode, it picks up too much of the key clatter from my typing, when in wireless mode you have to ensure you are out of the path of the AC airflow. Besides, except for bragging rights, most of the routine daily chores do not require noise cancellation, just the passive attenuation of the ear cups is adequate.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely User-Friendly Wireless Headphones that sound better than most wired headphones in the price range.

    ","After trying out every wireless, noise cancelling, over-ear, headphone on the market, I chose the Bose QC35. The Sennheiser HD1's have a slightly better sound quality than the Bose QC35's but not by much. The main reason I went with Bose was because the Sennheiser HD1's were outrageously uncomfortable to wear. They feel like they are almost twice as heavy as the Bose and while the leather is super soft, it is almost TOO soft and is unable to hold the weight of the headphone on your ear, making my ears hurt after only 30 minutes of wear. I adjusted the headband multiple times and I could never get it comfortable. Maybe its because I have big ears idk....All other features are amazing. The wireless is definitely 2017 quality and the sound controls are very intuitive and easy to use. The sound quality is second-to-none in the wireless-over-ear-noise-cancelling market. However, if you cant stand to have them on your head for more than 30 minutes is the sound quality really worth it?  Especially when they are listed as $150 over the QC35's?Disappointed that I had to return these, but Im sure the weight will come down in future models as wireless and battery technology gets better.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Weight and fit are a deal-breaker

    ","I have zero complaints about the sound from these headphones.  For the price, the sound better be good... and it is.  It's like listening to your favorites songs for the first time.  If this is your first pair of high-quality headphones, you will likely hear things you've never heard before in your favorite music and movies.The padding on the ears and headband is nice and comfortable.  It is very easy to wear for long periods of time, at least with my medium sized ears.  The noise cancellation works well and I'm very much looking forward to using them on my next flight.  The battery life is nice and long, too.There is a power button that also connects you to Bluetooth devices, and a sliding button that performs multiple functions.  You press the button to play/pause or answer a call.  You can also hold it down to activate the voice dialing feature on your phone.  On my Android 6.0 phone, I can use it for searching for nearby stores (including review ratings, distance, and automatically dialing their number), Google searches, or for simply dialing numbers or calling contacts by name.  The same button also rocks back and forth for moving between tracks and adjusting the volume.  The control is very easy to use and it located on the right earphone's edge.I'm very happy with these high-quality headphones.

    ","I own a pair of these and they are great - definitely my favorite pair of headphones. I use them every day while commuting to work on the train. That being said, I also own the Bose QC 35s (and a bunch of other headphones).I prefer the QC35s ANC (active noise cancellation), interface and comfortability.I especially like how you can switch between the paired devices on the QC 35s using the headset itself and not having to fuss with the bluetooth settings on your paired devices, which you'll only have to do if you have multiple paired devices within close proximity of each other. It's also a bit easier and more consistent using Bose's interface to skip forward and go back to previously played songs. I also think the volume control is better on the Bose headphones.However, I prefer the sound signature of these headphones, as well as the build quality and style. They also aren't exactly uncomfortable, I just don't find them as comfortable as the QCs. Even though these HD1s don't support AAC, they still sound great on my iPhone.Unfortunately, I've looked high and low there is no perfect pair of wireless headphones at this time. If you could combine the good features of both headphones and include AAC to sound better on my iPhone, you'd then have the perfect pair.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sounding headphones - almost perfect!

    ","REVIEW SUMMARY:You probably have already read several reviews and are probably still confused about which one to buy. Here is the final verdict: Stay away from Bose Quiet Comfort 35 & Sennheiser PXC 550 because of very poor sound quality & also stay away from Bowers Wilkins PX because of painful clamping pressure applied by the headphone on your head. The winner by many miles is clearly the Sennheiser HD1. Buy the Sennheiser HD1 and delight in spectacular sound quality with good noise cancellation.DETAILED REVIEW:All three headphones except the Sennheiser PXC 550 were tested by me personally in airplanes in-flight. I will focus on sound quality first, comfort second and noise cancellation third.Sound Quality: I am an audiophile - defined as someone who can tell the difference between high quality audio file vs. very good quality audio file. Sennheiser HD1 & Bowers Wilkins PW both produce spectacular sound. The kind of sound that would truly want you to go back through and listen to all your songs again. I personally like the clarity of the treble better on the Sennheiser HD1. Bass is excellent on both Sennheiser HD1 and Bowers & Wilkins PX. Sennheiser HD1 also is the winner on midrange voice sounds. You for sure won’t go wrong with sound quality with either one of these - they are beyond impressive, actually better than many wired headphones. The sound stage on both are also amazing, at times you’d think the speakers are 10 feet away from your head - it is really that impressive. Sennheiser PXC 550 produces below average sound and was ruled out right away and returned to the store; hence it will not be discussed any further in this review. Now, about Bose Quiet Comfort 35, the sound quality is nowhere close. Bose sound quality is below average at best. Compared to Sennheiser HD1 and Bowers & Wilkins PX, the sound quality of Bose pretty much ‘sucks’ - that about summarizes it.Comfort: Bose Quiet Comfort 35 is supremely comfortable followed closely by Sennheiser HD1. Do not buy the Bowers & Wilkins PX in terms of comfort - the clamping pressure is way too high on your head. Can’t bear it for more than 30 minutes. This is the reason why the Bowers & Wilkins PX was returned to the store.Noise Cancellation: Sennheiser HD1 and Bose Quiet Comfort 35 cancel out lower frequencies in an airplane very effectively. Bose wins for overall noise cancellation, but with a major caveat - it creates a lot of pressure around the ear to accomplish the noise cancellation. Sennheiser HD1 creates no such pressure around your head to create the noise cancellation. Bose Quiet Comfort 35 does a better job of canceling mid range frequencies. To be clear both Sennheiser HD1 and Bose Quiet Comfort 35 do allow voices to come through and you will hear crying babies on an airplane on both. Bowers & Wilkins PX does a good job with noise cancellation in an airplane as well, but I’d rate it’s noise cancellation below the Sennheiser HD1.THE VERDICT:Buy the Sennheiser HD1 and truly cherish how music was supposed to be heard in comfort & with most background noise tuned out! The treble, voice clarity, and clear bass punches will sure make you listen to your music on the headphone instead of your expensive audiophile grade home theater system. Sennheiser HD1 does produce sound that is that mind-blowingly amazing!",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Final Verdict on Sennheiser HD1 vs. Bose Quiet Comfort 35. vs Bowers Wilkins PX. vs Sennheiser PXC 550

    ","The headphones fit pretty well and pair quite easily--better than nearly any other device I've used. Unfortunately, they do not play DSD files (wirelessly) so they are worthless to any audiophile. I have no idea why they won't play DSD since the decoding is done on the player. But Sennheiser support and the manual have confirmed this. So if you're buying them because they sound better than the Bose, don't bother as they are larger and won't play high quality files. (I don't know if the Bose play DSD but will research that after having been burned by these.)",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worthless--won't play all types of music wirelessly (e.g., no DSD support)"

    ",These are my first pair of high end headphones. By no means am I an audiophile. I've had Bose QCs and beats studios before and I can honestly say these are the best head phones I've ever had.Build: Extremely sturdy. Feeling them you can tell they are expensive. High quality material as expected from Sennheiser. Man those ear cups are comfortable with the memory foam. Forms a tight seal. The brown leather with ivory exterior is so clean.Sound: I love bass but I want a good pair to not only have bass but something I can listen to classical on. I've tried the sony mdr xb950b1 and the bass is the best but they're so ugly. The HD1/momentum 2 wireless bass is tight and clean and the mids and highs are crystal clear. When I bump the bass up on the EQ the bass can compare with any bass headphones like sony mdr xb950b1. Overall sound quality is like the qc35 in clarity with more powerful lows/bass. Without eq bass is just ok. I listen to softer music on flat. Overall this pair had much versatility can can be used for any type of music and sound including movies.Noise Cancelling: not as good as QC35 but still very good.Wireless: just as advertised. Easy and reliable.Do not regret the price for these they are totally worth it considering total package.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny

    ","the senheiser momentum is really a great headphone if you have the money . Forget about the other reviews saying that this headphone sounded bad or is like a pair of $100 dollar headphone .-about the other negative reviews :you need high quality  audio files for a better listening experience 320kbps or above or lossless(flac) . People who says that this sounded bad is maybe because they 1.have low quality audio files (128kbps or lower)or 2. They don't like the sound signature of this headphone because it is more natural and balanced than the others they have .-about the amp : you don't need amp because this headphone is pretty good without an amp as this is a more Of a portable headphone .-about the Bluetooth connectivity: having Bluetooth in these days is really handy , because  you don't need to plug in to your phone every time and having headache about breaking the cables when you walking around or doing something else.-momentum 2.0 vs  momentum 2.0 wireless: this is exactly the same as the momentum 2.0 wired with the extra Bluetooth feature , it is like the beats studio 2.0 and beats studio 2.0 wireless.The sound quality in this version is as good as  the momentum 2.0 wired ,because they use now a technology called aptx so you can listen uncompressed music through Bluetooth . And when the battery dies you can still listen it through cable .-about the price :The price is what this headphone makes you think and think before you decides whether or not to buy it . It is $499 as writing this review ,It is not overpriced ,because all newly released products is always pricey . But if you can wait for several months , this will surely dropped in price for a lot just like the original momentum went down about 1/2 the price (approx $379to $175 ).Conclusion :- if you really  need a headphone that is high in build quality ,sound great and mostly WIRELESS , then this is the one for you .-if you need a headphone that doesn't have to be wireless but sound great , go with the senheiser momentum 1.0 , because it's much cheaper than the momentum2.0 and there's not much difference between the two .",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Top quality headphone , but you also need good audio source."
480,"on October 2, 2016",,"I chose these headphones to live in them: to wear all day in my home office so that my music and conversations wouldn't bother others in house.  My verdict is that they live wonderfully: luxurious, comfortable, wonderful sound, good phone conversations and a battery that lasts for days.Luxurious - the headphones come in a beautiful cardboard and foam box containing the semi-hard carrying case, the headphones, cords and a two prong adapter for certain airlines.  Every piece feels high end - not necessarily the most durable case, but it's deep black. soft to the touch and provides enough structure to protect your investment. The soft leather on the cups feels wonderful enveloping my head, and the steel band looks retro cool.Comfortable - I wear these headphones all day without fatigue.  Yes, they press a little on the temples of my glasses, but, not enough to bother.  I can feel the headband, but, it doesn't press on my skull.  The design spreads the weight and pressure evenly and well.Wonderful sound - this is where these headphones really shine.  First, unlike the new Bose, there is no pressure on the ears from noise cancellation when there is no music.  There is just less background noise, and that which comes through is mostly in the vocal range so my wife can talk with me without my taking off the headphones. When the music is on, there is just perfect music: wide sound stage, even equalization, deep, warm bass, accurate mid-range and treble.  Nothing stands out, everything sounds real.  You can just about see the band on stage in front of you.Good phone conversations - these headphones handle the transitions between music, phone calls and videos from my computer completely seamlessly.  I just paired both devices and the headphones do the rest.  People on the other end tell me that I sound clear and natural through the Sennheiser's mikes which also screen out background noise.  They are at least as good as my dedicated Bluetooth earpiece for the phone.Battery life - as advertised. I charge them every two or three days as needed instead of every night because I get over 20 hours of use per charge.Weaknesses?  I'm not sure how long the case will last if I carry these a lot traveling.  The headphones feel plenty durable, though.  The big knobs that hold the cups to the band do look a little odd on the sides of my head in the mirror, but fortunately, I don't see myself most of the time I'm wearing them.

481,"on December 27, 2016",,"Audiophile quality is where I start with these.  Everyone loves to compare them to Bose. Okay lets do that.  The only redeeming value for the Bose is their nose cancelling is slightly better but no great leaps.  The Bose have a flimsy hand feel.  Now lets try the Momentum, the sound quality is the real difference and I find this when playing different types of music, most headphones sound okay when rocking but get into Jazz or Classical and you hear a warm rich sound with full range. The device you use to transmit your music with can make a difference.  Make sure your downloads are of a high quality or tap into a good stream with a high bit rate.  Using the cord did not do much to improve the sound quality. The Bluetooth was very impressive.With the use of Apt-X I comfortably used them on several flights this holiday season with much comfort and no sound lag.  The Momentum feels luxurious and gives you that feel of quality.  No they are not heavy as I wore them for several in flight hours and they did an excellent job of noise reduction.  Actually I would say the ear cups feel like little pillows.  Bring along the cord to plug in for inflight movies.  The battery lasted an entire day of travel with transfers without recharging.  My only gripe is the amount of space they took up in my briefcase but I'll tolerate that to get that great sound quality.  I've gone through many pairs of noise cancelling headphones and this pair by far is the best sounding and most comfortable.

    ","Pro:The sound quality is one of the best among all Bluetooth headphones: sound stage is good, clarity is good, the bass is not too overwhelming.In comparison, the overall sound quality of this headphone is better than the Beats Studio wireless. It is close to the Sony MDR-1RBT MK2. It is also better than the Bose soundlink II.The noise cancelling function is good. It's better than the Beats Studio's ANC, but it is nowhere close to the Bose QC25.The background hiss of the ANC is barely there when you are listening to the music; however, when you are not playing music, it becomes fairly noticeable.The fit of the headphone is fine with me.The call quality is okay even in a moderately noisy environment.The battery life is really really good.Con:If you are streaming high resolution music (i.e. 24/192 FLAC) via Bluetooth, music frequently stops for no reason.The strength of the Bluetooth is poor, it can barely penetrate a thin dry wall.The headphone will not automatically turn off when you turn off the Bluetooth function on your phone.There is noway for you to turn off the ANC while using the Bluetooth function.The carrying poach will not provide enough protection for the headphone, you should replace it with a hard-shell one.Update:The headband lacks good cushion, which makes it kinda discomfortable to wear over long periods of time.",3.0 out of 5 stars,6.5/10 review on Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless with ANC

Nice soft and smooth feel on them. Can wear for hours. There's an understated clean timeless design about how they look.The sound quality is superb (as expected from this brand). The sounds are crisp throughout the range. Great bass. I enjoy listening to classical works, rock, and electronica on a regular basis and all of this sounds great on this thing. Add in the noise cancellation, and the music comes up front without needing to crank up the volume.Oh, and the noise cancellation. I reallly enjoy how the Momentum's implemented it. I owned some older Bose's headphones with noise cancellation and the characteristics on how the sennheiser's produce it sounds more effective without a hiss (can't compare to the newer versions). Truly quiet and sometimes wear it just for the silence this can provide.Wireless range is phenomenal. Walk around the house with it and can get at least 20-30 feet with it with walls. The fact that there's also no wires makes this thing quite effortless to wear without the worry of straightening things out.Bottom line is these things are worth it.

    ","Ordered the directly from Sennheiser because I couldn't wait for Amazon to have them in... I've had them for two days so far and I'm already in love!I've been wanting a Bluetooth wireless headphone that also had noise canceling, for quite some time now. I don't like Beats, as I'm not a fan of the excessive bass, and Bose didn't have anything on the market. Being a long-time user of Sennheiser (HD 202 back in the day, HD 380 Pro a few years ago, and a set of ear buds) I decided to go with the MM 550-X. The APT-X codec was appealing, and they should sound great since they're Sennheisers, right? WRONG!The MM 550-X were probably the worst headphones I've ever had. The removable battery kept falling out, and the sound quality took a dump when Active Noise Canceling was turned on. The the ANC button stopped working after only a week of use! I sent it back. And perfect timing, too, because right after I mailed them these beautiful ones were announced at CES. For once I actually had good luck.So far, the Momentum Wireless headphones are perfect! They're light, comfortable (I have an average-sized head and average-sized ears), and the sound is pretty freaking good! The real leather and memory-foam ear cups are a really nice touch, and they look fashionable, if you care about that. The controls are easy to reach and use, and the headphones have their own volume setting independent of the my phone's setting which is useful since I always my phone set to maximum volume (I use my phone in my car too!) and I don't like punishing my eardrums.The sound is where they really shine, though. Clear crisp sound across lows, mids, and highs just as I have come to expect from Sennheiser. The Active Noise Canceling feature doesn't seem to affect sound quality at all, which is good because it cant be turned off... The noise canceling isn't as strong as Bose, but I really don't mind. It's good enough to silence the really annoying stuff and it helps set the stage for music, which is all I really care about.I don't really know what else to say here, other than if these are on your wish-list, GET THEM! You won't regret it. They are seriously the best Bluetooth headphones on the market, and they have Active Noise Canceling.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!

    ","The Sennheiser Momentum is a product series whose goal is to merge the two most difficult attributes in modern day headphones, style and sonic performance. Here before you is the refinement of the original Momentum that started it all, the Momentum 2.The Momentum 2's packaging is typical of Sennheiser and immediately showcases quality and first class workmanship. Upon removal of the lid, the much reduced in size case is first apparent. The cable is mostly similar to the first iteration but no longer does it have the steel constructed in-line microphone and controls. You then get your typical quick start guide and Sennheiser's 2 year warranty registration booklet. Here is where the Momentum 2 simply outclasses nearly all headphones immediately. Not only do you get a protective zipper case, you also get a pouch. Nowadays the trend for such expensive headphones is to only include a pouch which is a slap in the face for such a costly investment. To even go further, Sennheiser includes foam to help keep the integrity of the pads composure while folded up. Now that's what I call quality packaging. And yea, folding, the new Momentum's can now fold which is nothing new in this day and age, but hey better late than never.The Sennheiser Momentum is simply gorgeous to look at. It's a very simple design at heart, but it's so well executed and tastefully down from the stainless steel arched headband, the glistening holographic Sennheiser logo and the stitched leather on the top of the headband. The ear pads are entirely redesigned and are soft to the touch. Finally, these can be safely called over the ear headphones thanks to the much larger in diameter opening of the pads in comparison to the previous iteration of the Momentum. The headband is essentially the same and maintains that fashionable low profile design that keeps the uniformity of the arch close to the head and reduces the bulge effect of larger headphones. Here we see steel reinforced folding mechanism that grants the Momentum 2 the ability to collapse down upon itself for storage. This should fare much better than something from the Beats Studio or Solo series with their plastic construction.The beautiful sculpted sound signature that I lusted over in the previous Momentum is thankfully unharmed. There's something about the level of refinement and soothing spark to the attack of the Momentum signature that is all too addictive. It's a very forgiving sound that still showcases the refinement that Sennheiser is all too well known for.The bass is very linear from 20hz to 250hz creating this sense of ease to the presentation. Immediately apparent over the previous iteration is the tighter control of the attack and the more precise rendition of decay resulting in one of the best bass performances that I have heard, period. It doesn't quite reach that last bit of laser tight composure of my planar magnetics like the Hifiman HE560, but boy does it deliver a dynamic slam when the music calls for it. Integration into the midrange is seamless like with the previous Momentum, but now due to the quicker pace the bass to midrange bleed that occurred when the bass became too complex in the recording that sometimes flawed the original momentum's has vanished.The midrange presentation is sonic gold. Sennhesier just simply knows the foundation of the music and the tonal balance required to reproduce all of the information recreating a true to life experience. Vocals, guitars, pianos or whatever instrument lies in this frequency all have this robust composure that remains grain less and endlessly smooth with incredible low levels of harsh transient that also induces vocal sibilance. Overall, the midrange is quite linear with a slow descending slope into the lower treble which highlights the lower midrange and restores the natural heft in the sounds in that region. The level of detail rendition is also simply stunning maybe due to the heightened level of treble over the first Momentum or just a superior transducer at work.The treble is very articulated, but most importantly more in-line with the music in terms of emphasis. The first Momentum simple was too subdued here and resulted a closed in soundstage that reduced the sense of speed and clarity of the music. The Momentum 2 raises the treble just enough to revive the harmonic decay in the upper stratosphere, but not cause them to be too bright for their intended use. This welcoming improvement in the rendition of the treble music grants the Momentum 2 one of the biggest soundstage performances that I have yet to hear from a portable headphone. The stage is larger in width than it is depth, but it's very satisfying to hear.In summary, Sennheiser has listened to the feedback from its consumers and reconstructed the Momentum both physically and acoustically to better adhere to their goal, uncompromising mobile performance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser sound on the go...

    ","I bought these retail because I could get same-day pickup, but since I heard about them on here I figured I'd post a review here too.Convenience:They stay connected to my computer all the way into the office kitchen, they block out all of the building's mechanical noise even without music playing, and at a comfortable listening volume they block out almost all of the conversations and other noise going on around me.  Also, I can listen while they charge or even using a headphone cable if i don't have a charging source available.  They also do some clever bluetooth trickery to communicate with two devices at once:  If you're listening to music on your phone and pull up a youtube video on your computer, they'll pause your phone's music while the youtube video plays, then restart the music once you stop the video. Most importantly, they're comfortable even having them on half the day and I don't have to take off my hearing aids to use them.  Exceptionally convenient.Audio quality:  (I'm a musician but not necessarily an audio junkie)These are fantastic.  Clear sound all across the spectrum and solid bass that doesn't wash out other sounds.  Active noise cancelling doesn't seem to do anything weird to the audio quality.  Standard bluetooth connections sound better than any other bluetooth devices I've used.  Bluetooth AptX (If you're on an iPhone/Mac for sure, some Android devices too.  Maybe Windows?) capability sounds indistinguishable from using a cable.  The best sound seems to come from using the USB audio option though: the headset will appear to the computer as a USB Output Device, switch to that!  Great sound quality while you're charging up.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect companion to an open floorplan office

    ","I'll start out by mentioning that I have owned more consumer and professional class headphones than I can count, in-ear, over-ear, circumaural, wired, wireless, you name it. I've taken a shine in the past few years to bluetooth headphones that support aptX codec for active (gym, etc) use since I don't mind some degradation in quality in exchange for portability and freedom from wires while still providing noticeably superior sound to plain SBC encoding over A2DP. With that said, the benefits are more obvious with some aptX devices than others; the headphones/earphones are only as good as their weakest link in the audio chain which is usually the drivers second only to the person wearing them understanding how to maximize the potential of their headphones (a skill that seems to be noticeably worsening among consumers in this age of fragmentation).On to the HD1 Wireless Over-Ear headphone review, which I'll keep brief: these are hands-down the best bluetooth headphones I have used when used with aptX compatible transmitters and decent source material. The soundstage is full without feeling overly EQ'ed or ""dramatic"". There is plenty of bass capability (especially when it's clearly boosted in the source audio) but no particular frequency seems to dominate, though there is a slightly noticeable lift in upper midrange frequency as is common with Sennheisers. (They almost remind me of studio grade headphones but are perhaps a bit less neutral). As others have mentioned, when wired, they sound even better, especially when playing lossless audio. Some have mentioned that they find the controls annoying or confusing but I do not agree: I have no problem remembering the various multifunction commands but perhaps this is a byproduct of my using BT headphones for so long. The fit is exceptional on these; they do not fatigue my head much when worn for hours at a time, though an occasional break for 5 or 10 minutes helps alleviate any mild squeezing sensation that begins to accumulate after awhile. I have giant protruding ears - I'm not kidding, people stop and point at them - and the ear cups are just deep enough to sit over them comfortably. If you have an unusually wide head, I could see this being a potential fit issue since the cups don't pivot at steeper angles, so perhaps that is the source of some of the comfort complaints I've seen. The build quality seems quite good being composed of mainly leather and metal with little plastic visible. The controls seem slightly flimsy so I'm guessing that this will be the first thing to fail on these. I'm also not in love with the quality of the provided optional cable but it appears there are higher quality aftermarket replacements available here on Amazon. The range on the bluetooth appears to be excellent as is the ""in pocket"" range. Virtually all BT headphones cut out while my phone is in my pocket but these do not. The noise cancellation is mild but effective without getting in the way of the audio quality, which is a good thing since it cannot be disabled when used wirelessly.All in all, while these cans are fairly expensive, they have the best balance of features, comfort and quality I've seen for anything in it's price range. I've also seen them go on sale from time to time here on Amazon that puts them at a price that should make them a no-brainer buy for most in the market for wireless headphones like these.",5.0 out of 5 stars,We have a winner

    ","Was looking for a hi-end headphone. Looked at tons of reviews here and online. Settled on Sennheiser HD1 after comparing with Bose, Sony, PX and PX7 at local Best Buy. Paired my phone to all 4 and played numerous songs from Spotify/compared audio on all headphones. HD1 had superior sound with a variety of genres. ANC not a big deal for me. Another bonus was being able to also listen wired and ability to change earpads. ANC - can be turned off in wired passive mode. So do compare headphones. Best Buy will match Amazon prices, most Best Buys have demo headphones. If you travel a lot and not too concerned about sound quality - do buy Bose for ANC and comfort.

    ","The sound is amazing. Sennheiser has done a really good job of making these headphones perform well through a bluetooth connection. I was so surprised the sound was so rich with excellent depth.  The headphones support wired and wireless operation but since the sound is so good in wireless mode, I have been using them almost exclusively wirelessly.  These do a decent job of isolating your music from outside noise but I prefer my old Bose QC15 for noisy environments. The fit is slide adjustable and comfortable. There is just enough pressure to keep the headphones in place for normal use. Because these are over ear, I have found that my ears heat up a bit after several hours of use.  I also find that my ears experience a slight soreness from extended use.There are a few cons:1.The headphones are bulky and do not collapse down well hence do not travel nearly as well as the afforementioned Bose QC15 or a pair of Sennheiser MM 400-X headphones I had.2. The wired cable that comes with the headphones should really have included an iPhone or Android microphone/remote so that you could still interact with your phone.  The way it ships, you can only listen to music when there in no power mode.3. In wireless mode the volume is controlled by the headset and the highest setting for volume didn't blow out my ears. If you are a person who likes really loud headphones you will likely be disappointed by these.I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for a pair of wireless headphones for daily use but not as your primary headphones for traveling.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound for wireless headphones.

The fact that they are wireless, comfortable and light, make them the perfect addition for a working musician.

    ","In this review I won't be going through technical charts or DB graphs showing how much the signal is attenuated at different frequencies. I won't use pompous adjectives to define the sound characteristics either. This will be a straight-to-the-point review based on how the headphones feel and perform when playing different music genres.## Hardware Quality**Rating: 10/10**You don't see this level of quality in headphones often, not even in high-end offerings, category which is definitely occupied by the Momentum headphones. The metallic head band is wrapped in yellow-stitched leather. Although the ear cups are made of plastic, it's high quality and feels very solid. The matte finish helps repelling those nasty fingerprints we've come to hate.The parts of the cups touching your ears are made of a very soft and pleasant leather. The included cables (yes, there are cables, more on that later) are not extremely thick (i.e. not like the ones you would find on Shure earbuds), but that's not a bad thing.  The case is made out of leather, very soft to the touch but sturdy at the same time.If I had to criticize something about the quality, it would be related to the play/volume/skip button. It has a plastic feel that somehow seems out of place in headphones like these.## Hardware Design**Rating 10/10**The design of the Momentum headphones exudes minimalism, thoughtfulness and good taste. It's really hard to pull that off without being austere or overly simplistic.Buttons are almost hidden in the right can. However, they are very easy to reach out to thanks to the raised dots and ridges in the cup. The included cable doesn't have the fancy stereo connector the original Momentum headphones had.  However, it makes sense to do away with it for a headphone that is meant to be used primarily on wireless mode. One thing to note is that you have to properly align the stereo plug before inserting it in the right cup hole, then twist it so that it stays in place. I guess Sennheiser went for this design to prevent the cable from being accidentally pulled when in wired mode. A decision I must say, I'm not a fan of.The new Momentum Headphones can be folded before being stored in the included case, which is great for travelers. Talking about the case, it perfectly complements the looks and feel of the headphones.You can't talk about design without talking about comfort. On that department the Momentum headphones also excel. The headband provides just the right amount of pressure in your ears, and the leather lined cup cushions effectively go over the ear without leaving areas uncovered, not even while using eyeglasses. These are also much lighter than similar offerings from competitors, which is a huge advantage when using them for long periods of time.## General Performance**Rating: 10/10**Let's get to the really important part: sound performance. The Momentum headphones can be used in two independent modes: **wired** and **wireless** (i.e. Bluetooth 4.0). In each mode, Sennheiser's proprietary noise reduction technology *NoiseGard* is used. You can also use the headphones turned off in wired mode for passive noise isolation.If I had to describe it with one word, it would be **balanced**.  I couldn't sense a particular range being prominent. Lows are bold and well defined, mids and highs are crisp and clear. Daft Punk's One More Time is great for testing the bass performance at the beginning of the song and high frequency response towards the end.  The guitar and vocals in Creedence's Fortunate Son and Travelin' Band  are nice and detailed. Diana Krall's voice in Glad Rag Doll sounds crisp and clear (all these songs were played in their lossless format)### Noise reductionAs mentioned above, Sennheiser uses their proprietary technology - *NoiseGard* - for noise reduction. I have never been a fan of active noise cancellation as it seems to drown music when the *canceling* signal is introduced, especially low frequencies. I have noticed it with several pairs of Bose headphones and it's not pleasant at all. I'm happy to say that I didn't get the same feeling with the Momentum wireless.I also performed some tests using the headphones in wired mode and turning *NoiseGard* on and off (by turning on and off the headphones as a whole), and although there was an noticeable difference in performance, I wouldn't  say it was considerably detrimental.## Ease of Use**Rating: 10/10**Using the Momentum wireless headphones is pretty straight forward, for the most part. Operations associated to the Bluetooth connection like pairing, pausing music, skipping tracks, making calls and adjusting volume, are made by clicking/sliding one of the only two buttons in the headset. This is pretty standard for wireless headphones and Sennheiser has included graphical instructions on how to perform these tasks.## Other Pros**Rating: 10/10**This section is intended to account for features not usually found in similar products. In the case of the Sennheiser Wireless Momentum headphones, *NoiseGard* is definitely one of those features. As explained above, it's basically active noise cancelation that really works.## Battery Life**Rating: 8/10**Sennheiser included a 600mAh Lithium-ion polymer battery inside the headphones. They claim it lasts 22hrs, but I could only get 18 hrs out of them. Although it's a good amount of time, I'm disappointed I couldn't get the rated duration. Also, it takes approximately 3 hrs to charge them, which it's just too much for such small battery.## Price**Rating: 7/10**These headphones retail for about $500, which is a pretty high price. You can find similar offerings from other manufacturers for much less than that, but you would obviously lose on quality and most likely features.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Top-notch sound quality and comfort.

    ","I was looking for a set of headphones that could do both wired and wireless modes, and also have active noise cancellation. I purchased the momentum over the ear 2.0 wireless headphones (these headphones), and was amazed by the sound quality. After owning it two months, however, the resistance fit between the right ear cup and the metal band failed, so I sent it in for warranty repair. After a month, I still didn't get it back, but I eventually got a letter from Sennheiser indicating that this particular Momentum product was having Bluetooth issues and that sales and production of that product have been suspended until the issue was identified and fixed. In the interim, they sent me a complementary set of wired momentum 2.0 on ear headphones (not these headphones) to tie me over.About two months after using those headphones, and while still waiting for my real headphones to get QC'ed and sent back to me... The right ear cup goes loose on these temp headphones also. I noticed a white tab or shim was jutting out of the interface between the ear cup and metal band, and realized this was probably the same problem that developed with my original headphones. This tells me this Sennheiser ear cup design is bad and will fail early. Not a good sign having the same design failure occur to two consecutive product family members that I received. I expect this from Beats or some cheapo brand, but not Senneheiser. I've purchased 5 prior Senneheiser headphones before, and while I was happy with the sound quality, the build design was very poor.I sent those in for repair and replacement and Sennheiser sends me back a refurbished pair of momentum on ear 1.0 headphones, so they seem to be regressing with the headphone models they provide until my real headphones arrive.

    ","I got to try out these bad boys at a local music store for a while because the store was practically empty and the manager was fine with it and I gotta say for the price, these are stellar head phones. This is my review of the Sennheiser momentum wireless headphones:__________DESIGN: The design in this unit is subtle yet eye catching. It is not trying too hard to be noticed out in the streets but people may lay there eyes upon them. They are versatile and can fit in both casual and formal settings in my opinion. It is smooth and sophisticated. When you look at the unit close up, you notice the metal finish and the fine attention to details Sennheiser has put out for this phone. And the leather and metal working together is not only a joy to look at but also to feel as well.___________DURABILITY: The metal construction and the leather really does a great job at satisfying the durability department here. The absence of plastic definitely means the the headphones can last years to come if handled properly and the adjusters as well work nicely and hold their resistance.___________WIRELESS AND NOISE CANCELLING: The noise cancelling feature is excellent at blocking out ambient noise but if you are looking for the best in noise cancelling, go for BOSE. This doesn't mean that the headphones are bad at it though. The noise cancelling is great for cutting out distractions and does not produce any hiss effects. As for the wireless. I was able to walk around the store(Big two story store) with not interruptions to the music I was listening to so the wireless range is excellent.___________BATTERY LIFE: Battery life is great and can last about a month if you listen to it an hour a day. The average time it took for me to get a new charge was about 23 hours so that is awesome because, I can last days without needing to charge again.___________SOUND QUALITY: Sound quality is excellent. I am not a full on audio phile but I can say that the headphones does a really good job at producing sounds without making muddy highs and mids and bass is great as well. It is not super punchy in bass though so if listening to Dubstep or Electronic or bass heavy sounds you probably will not get a big of an effect in comparison to beats by dre. This unit is great for all around listening and creates a good neutral range.___________CONCLUSION: If you have the money and are considering this headphone, I hope my review has helped you. It is great and I wish I had the money to afford one myself. BengirlxD approved.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow

    ","I wasn't sure how to rate this product. 3 stars for me, but might be 4 stars for others. I will write this review as explicit as possible since I think people have different expectations from headphones. Spoiler: I had to return it with a deep sadness, and bought Sony WH1000x M2; I will explain three reasons in detail. However, to sum up, I have done my best to keep these pair of headphones with incredible sound quality. As I started using the product, I started to experience breaks in the Bluetooth connection (I have an LG-G5 phone), when I'm walking in the street while my phone is in my back pocket. I did everything on my phone, including opening it and re-adjusting the Bluetooth antenna to increase the signal. It didn't work, I tried to use different Bluetooth speakers and headphones, I didn't experience the same problem. At that point, I wasn't sure if that was a defective item or the product was built that way, I replaced the item, in the second time, again, I experienced the same issues so I had to return it. I'm really sorry that I couldn't use these headphones.Sound quality: 10/10I'm a fan of the natural sound, with natural I mean hearing what the producer has made without any adjustment in the levels of frequencies, i.e. higher bass, lower mids etc. When I put these headphones on, I wanted to listen to everything I listened before since everything was super clear and natural, for the first time I could hear every instrument in detail, and in many songs, I found some details I've missed. This is the first time I've ever used a pair of headphones with this kind of a perfect sound quality.Active Noise Canceling: 8/10The active noise canceling works fine, it leaves a little hiss behind. It is a little less effective than Bose, however, there is no pressure on the eardrums. On the other hand, it doesn't isolate you completely from your surroundings so while walking, you can hear your surroundings slightly. This is not a really bad thing, however, I would like to have the ability to control ANC level through the app. I cannot say I didn't like the way it has worked but it was not the best I've ever tried.Material quality: 10/10This might be one the most durable products in the market, all the material is extremely durable and shows high quality. The metal design with leather reminds me the nice pairs of headphones I used when I was a teenager in the late 90s and early 2000s.Comfort: 3/10Having a decently smaller head than average, I rarely feel uncomfortable using headphones. However using these headphones for 7 hours straight I had a terrible headache because of the pressure on my temporal bones. The second issue was the size of the earcups. My ears are not the smallest but they are not too big either, however the earcups of the headphones are so small that they tightly cover your ears by kind of ""trapping"" them inside.This might not be the worst thing for using them for a short amount of time, however, the heating over the ears and discomfort feeling grows by time. Overall, if you are looking for comfort this is not a good choice.Wireless Connectivity: 2/10This is the real reason I returned these headphones. They work poorly with Bluetooth connection. When I experienced this problem, having tried everything I could, I contacted the customer support and got an answer I will put at the end. However, having a pair of Wireless headphones which doesn't work with Bluetooth connection steadily, this is kind of a big problem to me.P.S. Switched to Sony WH1000x M2, I haven't experienced any connectivity issues.Here is the answer by the customer support to my inquiry, please decide yourselves:""Dear OzanThank you for contacting Sennheiser Technical Support.The most likely cause of consistent Bluetooth drop outs is a corrupted Bluetooth signal so delete the Bluetooth connection between the headphones and audio device, then turn off both the headphones and the audio device completely and then turn on both devices and re-establish the Bluetooth connection.If the above does not resolve the issue then it would need to be determined if the issue is the environment or one of the components that is causing the issue.The easiest way to test this is to take the headphones and audio source to a different location and test in that new environment. If the issue is not present in the new environment then that would indicate that the components are fine and the original environment (or something in the original environment) is the issue.If the issue is not environmental then it needs to be determined which component is the root cause of the issue. The easiest way to do this is to pair the headphones to an alternate device and preferably a device where audio is a primary function (ie: iPod, tablet or cell phone) rather than a secondary function (ie: computer). If the issue is not present on the alternate device that would indicate that the headphones are fine and the issue is with the original audio device and needs to be resolved there.If your phone is in your back pocket, see if moving it to the front or shirt pocket and see if it has better connection.  The human body is mostly water, and water blocks Bluetooth transmission.  Bringing the antennas closer together should improve connection.If the issue continues on the alternate audio device that could indicate an issue with the headphones and they would need to be assessed by a Service Technician.The majority of Sennheiser products have a two year warranty from original date of purchase.

I first thought my phone had problems, so I ran a series of tests with my other Bluetooth speakers, but none of them had a problem. Then I thought that product might be defective, so I requested a replacement for the unit. The replacement has arrived but the problem is not really solved. I still experience the breaks in the connections, if my phone is in my back pocket. If I put my phone in my front pocket I don't experience these problems. I love the sound signature of these headphones, the build quality, and the material is fantastic, but I really am disappointed as well. I wanted to reach out to you before I decide to return the product to let you know about these problems and ask you whether you are aware of these problems and if this is not a hardware related issue, whether you have any plans to fix it. Thanks.Sennheiser Electronic CorporationOne Enterprise DriveOld Lyme, Connecticut 06371,USA""Personal opinion: If you're selling a pair of Bluetooth headphones and saying that our body is mostly water, it's just BS.Pairing and Other electronics: 10/10I couldn't make NFC work but I haven't tried hard as well, I really don't care about it that much, pairing via Bluetooth is already easy. I really liked how I could connect to my computer as a wired or USB headphones, even though I couldn't pair it via Bluetooth (which I didn't try hard as well), the microphone has a noise filtering system it's super nice to talk on the phone.Mobility: 7/10This pair has a carrying case and they are foldable. However, they don't become a really thin when they are folded. You need a decent space in your backpack if you want to carry these around. But still they are foldable and the carrying case is really nice.App (Android): 1/10I haven't seen any app this useless. You cannot use the eq settings if you're streaming music from Spotify or some other app. The app has no features to control the headphones, you need to have music downloaded on your phone to use it. Really, who is downloading music today? Even if I buy music, I stream it instead of downloading it and using my limited space.Design: 10/10This is a really stylish product, I really liked it. It completed my style, I really liked wearing them. Also, they almost look like they are saying ""Listening to music is a serious issue, wherever you are. Don't you think so?"" If you like retro style products, this is it.Overall, this is a nice pair of headphones, with the perfect sound quality, if you use it for short time periods, like a couple of hours, where your phone is somewhere visible, or you use a wired connection. They are not really wireless headphones because of the connectivity issues, I would change the product name as ""Wired headphones with a wireless option"". I really miss the sound quality of it but I needed a comfortable, and a wireless headset with slight adjustability.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, if only Bluetooth connection worked (Returned)"

Seems Amazon is selling junk now.  They seem not to have quality control even though they attest to same.

    ","Update 26-Nov-2015I am updating my original review with this one.... earlier I had placed 5 stars. It so happened I used this headset for 29 days and happened to buy Bose Soundtrue headphones..... as soon as I put the Bose headphones on, I found the sound from Bose was much more clearer, accurate, lively. Instrumental music sounded as if I was sitting right next to the musicians as they were performing. Every guitar strum, the touch on xylophone before it went ""ting"" could be perceived with no distortion on the highest volume. On the other hand, Sennheiser did have a more punchy bass and treble than Bose Soundtrue, however, sound of instruments was bit undifferentiated and not so real as compared to Bose. I tested both headphones on several players, with and without equalizer. My verdict: If you appreciate accurate sound, go for Bose soundtrue. If you want more bass and higher treble, go for Sennheiser. I returned my $500 Sennheiser to the local store where I got it from as sound is not worth the price paid for it. Bumping down to 3 stars...",3.0 out of 5 stars,Just okay!

    ","Complete garbage!Ordered these cans as I was having troubles with another competitor’s headphones of a similar price range. Was excited to receive these but upon opening the box and pairing the headphones to my MacBook Pro, the signal started cutting out. To make matters worse, I was just sitting in my living room within 4 feet from my laptop.Tried it on my wife’s newer MacBook Pro as I thought the newer Bluetooth technology would yield a different outcome. No dice! If I walked away to another room away from the laptop, it cuts out thus yielding an intermittent audio signal.Tried it on my iPhone as well… guess what? Only lasted about a minute before the irritating symptom started to drop the audio signal.I went to Sennheiser’s website while searching for the Bluetooth range on these mediocre, bottom of the barrel, afterbirth headphones. While browsing the site, a pop up appears and it is customer service online chat. I connect to it and ask what the range is while being hopeful it is something that can be fixed on the spot. The CS rep comes back saying these headphones’ BT range is 300 feet! NO WAY as I can barely get 20 feet away from the audio source.I even deleted the pairing profile on my MacBook and iPhone as suggested by the Apple resource site and from the suggestion of the Sennheiser CS rep.  STILL NO DICE!!!When I told the online CS rep that I did all they suggested and that it did not work, they left me hanging for about a minute before they just dropped off the chat. The chat window completely disappeared.That did it for me. If Sennheiser’s customer service sucks by just dropping the chat as a sign they perhaps they have no clue, or they are just plain idiots that try to pass as being rude, then they can have this complete garbage they call HD1 headphones.These headphones are not ready for main production as the BT really sucks and shows that their QA at Sennheiser is lacking. It is a shame as I own a different model but they are wireless. It is a shame that they are made in China. I know... everything is made there. But really, this is a German company with a heritage of high quality, craftsmanship and attention to detail. They can do better. I am more than happy to pay their retail price if these are truly made in Germany and that they work flawlessly. I think for the price, you are basically paying for the leather.While troubleshooting them, I’ve come to discover that the signal gets blocked and the audio becomes intermittent if I place my hand on the right can. Tested it several times and even had the wife do as well and voilá. It seems to have something on the right side that has failed QA standards. If you have a pair of these, try it and let me know, please. Maybe I had a lemon…Sennheiser, try again but improve your QA! I am not rich but I came close to tossing them against the wall. This product does not deserve a one star.",1.0 out of 5 stars,COMPLETE GARBAGE! THEY ARE NUTS FOR THE PRICE THEY ARE ASKING. Read why!

My gaming headphones with dedicated USB wireless dongles (like the Logitech G933) sound much better than this.I have a lot of trouble staying connected to my Windows 10 PC via Bluetooth. I even bought a new Bluetooth USB adapter (with HSP and HFP) and got that working for a short time. For some reason, that stopped working and I'm unable to pair the HD1/Momentum2.0 my computer anymore.

    ","I'll start out by saying first I am aware of the recall out on these headphones. They were purchased for me as a gift before the recall and I didn't hear about it until I had been using them for about a week and even then I wasn't searching out for this information as I have yet to experience any issues with my set of cans.  From what I gather, if I ever do experience the Bluetooth connectivity issue in the next two years (I registered them with the company the day I got them in the mail) I can send them in and get them repaired/replaced at no cost to me...so even if I bought them I would be ok at the moment with my purchase.  On a related note to this, I only use these in and around my home so that may play a part in why I've not had issues...time will tell. Also, I use an iPad Air 2 and an iPhone 5S with these...not sure of that matters but like I said I haven't experienced any issues.With all that said, let me now get to some more specific observations about these headphones. I've had them about a month now and feel like they are the best headphones I've ever used...but like I said I've not had the connectivity issues some have experienced.First, these are comfortable. I usually hate having headphones on for more than 10/15 minutes but these are good to keep on for hours at a time. The ear cups are just amazing and feel truly luxury, as you should expect given the price tag.  The headband is also adjustable and seems to keep its place so you don't have to readjust them to keep them positioned how you like them.Second, the sound quality is first rate.  Given that it is a wireless connection I am very impressed by the quality of the sound I've been getting. These beat out some pairs of wired Bose I've had before and definitely beat out wireless Beats. I've yet to experience a better wireless headphone in terms of sound quality. But again, I haven't had connection issues like some have had.Third, battery life is truly over 20 hours...I haven't tested it exactly but I have been getting at least 20 hours before I need to recharge these things. Charging is also very easy with the included usb cable so no complaints here, just compliments on the long lasting battery.Lastly, the overall build quality of these headphones feels and looks to be of the highest quality.  The metal band feels sturdy and the leather is top notch. The ivory panels on the side are also very attractive and make these things stand out. It is to the point that I wouldn't want to epwear them in any...sketchy places...for fear that I would get robbed. These seriously look high dollar and I expect them to last years. looking great along the way.",5.0 out of 5 stars,No issues here - top quality on all levels so far

    ","I don't usually write reviews, but I had such a great experience with Sennheiser customer service that they really do deserve 5 stars. I had an older pair of Sennheiser bluetooth headphones that I absolutely loved, but the head strap broke rendering them useless. I filled out a warranty claim on the Sennheiser website and upon submitting it I immediately received a shipping label from their warranty claims department. I sent the broken headphones in and waited. A week or so went by as I expected to get an email with more information that would inevitably lead to a debate about what the outcome of this situation would be. Instead, I just got an email from the warranty claims department with a shipping confirmation for a new pair of headphones (these, which are significantly more expensive than the ones I previously had) and I had them within a week. I don't know that I have ever had such a painless warranty experience with such a good outcome in my life. They have also repaired my brothers headphones completely free of charge, his process being similarly headache-free. Absolute A+ for Sennheiser in terms of customer service.As for the headphones themselves, I would probably give them 4 stars. These headphones are awesome, but  at the price point I would more or less expect to have everything exactly the way I want it. They look and feel great. I use these things connected to my iPhone to talk on the phone all the time and the people on the other end can always hear me very clearly even with a ton of background noise. The sound quality with music is absolutely phenomenal, I would say pretty comparable to my dad's Bose QuietComfort, although the QuietComfort noise cancellation may be a touch better. Despite this, I frequently use these headphones while operating heavy equipment and can hear the music loud and clear with very little background noise from the noisy machines.  My only complaint when it comes to sound quality is that sometimes songs with REALLY heavy bass can sound a little choppy.  Disabling bass boost on the source is a must when listening to rap music, although with bass boost disabled, the bass can still come through pretty hard and is really clean. I have only ever had problems with the bluetooth cutting in and out when the headphones are simultaneously paired with two devices (say my computer and phone, which I don't really need to do anyway), but other than that the connection seems to be pretty consistent. The only other reason I wouldn't give the headphones themselves 5 stars is because I feel like they should be able to go a bit louder. I usually listen to these headphones on 100% volume, which is always audible given the noise cancelling, but I'm out of luck if I really want to jam out. My other Sennheiser bluetooth headphones had the same issue, which is a much less significant issue with the noise cancellation that these headphones have.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Product, Exceptional Customer Service"

    ","I received these as a Christmas gift and compared to the Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear headphones.A few major take-aways:1. The Beats headphones are a tighter fit, which is either better or worse for the individual depending on tolerance. After wearing them for 4-6 hours (nearly straight), I found them somewhat uncomfortable. The pads are fine but there is too much tension. The Momentum's on the other hand feel loose, almost, as the pads are buttery soft rather than firm. At first the difference is unsettling but over the longer term, the Momentum's lead to more comfort because of the relatively low tension. For those asking, yes, I adjusted both headphones and am not simply commenting on tension because I didn't bother modifying the fit for my own head.2. The active noise cancellation is excellent. Having tried Bose QC25's in-store, the Momentum headphones do nearly as good a job -- if not better. It is difficult to compare them side by side without having both in-hand. That said, I did try Beats/Momentum side by side and can confirm that the Beats' active noise cancellation system is nowhere close. My testing consisted of a consistent actual noise such as a washing machine, simulated white noise, simulated rain, and etc. from a noise-making app, and the Momentum headphones cancelled everything far better.3. Unlike Beats, the Momentum headphones respond well to tweaking. For example, I played with equalizer settings on an iPhone connected wirelessly to the headphones. By default the Momentum sound is a bit flatter but boosting bass and treble, for example, resulted in positive/significant changes to the sound profile. Beats did not respond as significantly but sound brighter by default with more bass and treble, a feature (good/bad, your choice) of them. Therefore I consider this flexibility a win for the Momentum headphones.4. There's no question that of the three (Beats, Bose QC25, Momentum) the Momentum headphones are the most striking look. More an audio-phile look, less fashion (some may disagree, given the ivory option). Beats and QC25 are sleeker, especially in matte-black. But if you're like me and spend most of your time listening while stationary (at a desk, or at home) then this contrast isn't a deal-breaker.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Noise Cancellation, Comfort, Flexibility"
520,"on September 27, 2017",,"Noteable comparison headphones I've owned.  Sennheiser HD280s, Bose Quiet Comfort  25 (Noise cancellation and voice, not wireless). These are the only headphones I've owned that are suitable for noisy environments.Ease of setup - Assuming your bluetooth drivers are up to date, pairing is easy and you are able to connect to multiple devices.  I will seamlessly transition between laptop to phone to car.  However, my phone has been taking priority, so will need to disable bluetooth on phone when I prefer a different means.Sound quality - Pretty standard for mid-high end.  I was actually rather surprised on the quality from the wireless bluetooth.  In a quiet room, I still prefer other headphones, but these are more than capable of producing the base, mids and highs.  I would say momentum have a  more soft tone, then other HQ headphones.  The HD280s pack more punch on the low ends, but unless I'm listening to heavy bass music, it doesn't bother me.  Dubstep/chillstep still sounds great on the momentums, where on the bose they are lackluster.  Out of those three I like the momentums, but still prefer open back style for most of my tastes.Voice Quality - Voice quality is adequate, Nothing much more to say.  I haven't heard too much on my end, but haven't had any complaints from coworkers/family.Noise cancelation-  I work in a environment with a lot of fans, high/low/mid running at various speeds.  The HD280s are still the best for this environment, but I dislike wearing them for long periods.  Both Bose and Momentums clear out the low hums extremely well.  The bose tend to allow more of the midrange fans through, and neither cancel the highspeed fans.  In both cases, the sound quality is still good, you are just dealing with noise.Bluetooth - Had some issues setting up with my PC (old bluetooth driver).  In high wireless network traffic areas I do occassionally get dropped/static.  Maybe 1 second every 20-30mins. In lab, where there is less wireless it is fine.  This is the main reason I am not rating 5 star, and my believe is it is more to do with the bluetooth technology.  Custom wireless is still better in these scenarios, but you loose the flexibility to connect to just about everything.",4.0 out of 5 stars,pairing is easy and you are able to connect to multiple devices
521,"on June 9, 2017",,"Note: I received the Momentus 2.0 Wireless, not the HD-1.If you want Bluetooth headphones, and you can afford a pair of these, stop thinking about it and get them. They sound amazing, particularly when using aptX and a good audio player app like JetAudio or Neutron. Snappy, reliable Bluetooth performance. I don't find the buttons to be perfect, but nearly so, and far better than any other BT cans I've tried. I haven't even bothered to listen to them cabled yet, as the sound over BT is excellent. Very comfortable, though I find myself fussing with them a bit to get my ears perfectly placed in the earcups. Users with large(r) ears might find the cups too be too small. I'd prefer if the earcup mounts had a bit more friction on the band. They haven't slid much, but I'm worried they could loosen up over time. The pads are very comfy and seal well against my head. I have yet to run the battery down, so I have no idea how many hours of listening I'll get. The obligatory English-accented fembot voice that announces every function (""Connected,"" ""Power on,"" ""Max Volume,"" etc.) is clear and inoffensive, though usually unnecessary, and kind of a silly cliche. I'd have gone with subtle, understated indicator tones, but it's nice to imagine that there's an attractive (though invisible,) British lady paying attention to my gadget usage. She'll probably become tiresome, over time.Very nice style, and incredible build quality. The noise cancellation is very effective. While not as aggressive as the Bose, it doesn't have that ""eardrum sucking"" feel that they and other NC headphones have. The cancellation works very well, but I didn't realize how well until it until I thought to pay attention to it--which is exactly how I like it. I dislike the weird, low pressure feeling of other NC 'phones I've worn, finding it actively uncomfortable at times. This isn't at all the case with the Momentum 2.0. Quite importantly, I believe the sound quality of the Senns to be markedly better than the Bose. With EQ and sound processing tweaks, these sound better than any of my wired headphones, including other Sennheiser models.Sound over Bluetooth isn't absolutely flawless--I've gotten infrequent, tiny dropouts when using aptX, locked to the highest bitrate while playing FLAC files, w/ audio processing & EQ turned on. Using SBC or variable bit rate, this doesn't happen. I'm running the DP3 build of Android O (8.0.0,) so the dropouts (which are truly minute and rare,) may be related to some aspect of the beta OS.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Whew.

    ","I own roughly 70+ headphones, hanging up around my recording studio, most of which are in this price range, my personal favorite still is AKG K702 for over ear and Shure SE535 for in ear. Lately I have been trying various Bluetooth headphones, in that endless search for amazing quality with no wires.I don't post reviews often, but these were the worst range of sound headphones I have purchased to date. My throw away $7 Skull Candy in ears sound better. The mid was muddled and the most prominent range, the high's weren't there, and the lows were distorted and so faint.  I was surprised a headphone this bad got so many good reviews, and internet top 10 lists, I was steered so wrong by this. With the shock of how bad these were I was curious if I got a defective pair. Only on head-fi.com I was able to find a forum post showing the same thing with lots of people posting the same expirence. The range posted on Sennheiser's website and the actual range of these headphones is very different as measured by dozens of Head-fi.com users. Despite this I figured I would give them a chance because they were so beautiful, light, and fit my head and ears perfectly (A rare find in headphones). So I decided to burn them in for 3 days, I have had a few headphones that didn't open up until at least 24 hours of continuous play, so figured that was what was missing. This is the first pair of headphones I have ever owned that got worse after burn in, again my $7 skull candy headphones had a better burn in experience, that is shameful. I then played with the EQ on my connected phone, connected laptop, and other various devices, still bad, could not dial these in.Normally I would just add them to my wall, but this time I couldn't justify it, I had to return them, so disappointing.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"No Range, sound muddled, makeing them sound horrible.

    ","IMO, this is a very high-quality BLUETOOTH-ONLY headSET, and high-quality WIRED headPHONES.I've had this unit for months now, and am impressed with the features that it has.It was not clear to me that when you use a cable, as I sometimes need to do, this is NOT a headset...only headphones.Bluetooth headset function works on every application I've tried so far, except one, and for that often-used app, I have to use my old, cheap wired headset.Just know what you are buying, and Sennheiser is not forthcoming with that fact.The other issue is more my mistake. I envisioned a single device I could use as a noise-cancelling headset for air travel, a bluetooth headset for my PC, and bluetooth headset for my Android. I'm not happy with the resultant compromises:- aforementioned lack of wired headset capability- the cable provided seems delicate, and slightly under-sized, and would not work in two different airline's jack (had to use the crappy airline supplied  headphones. (an old noise-cancelling headset bought for $40 or so also worked fine on every airline ever tried)- The bulkiness is a bigger turn-off than imagined for smartphone use - fine at home, but who wants to carry this thing around with them?- The noise cancelling seems very specific. It drastically reduces the ""aircraft-created"" cabin noise in the aircraft (sweet!), but only moderately reduces other sounds, like voices, screaming babies, etc. Oddly, perhaps because of the sealed, over-the-ear thing, if walk barefoot with a quick stride, you can hear each step in a weird way....hard to describe.So, if you want a bluetooth headset, orbluetooth/wired headphones, and don't care about bulk, both the audio and mic quality are great. People report my voice sounds ""like I'm standing in the room with them"". If this is the only consideration, would be 4.5 or 5 stars.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Bluetooth headSET, wired headPHONEs"

    ","I really wanted to love these headphones. They are so good looking. Aesthetically I couldn't have asked for more. They fold nicely into the packaging and the extra bag to keep them in is a nice touch.The first problem I noticed was with the Bluetooth when I went for a walk. The sound would cut in and out a bit when my phone was in my pocket. I'm tall but I'm not that tall. It was well within the recommended 30 feet. I shrugged it off as possibly just some interference. A one time thing. Like I said, I really wanted to love these headphones. The next malfunction came later that same night. I had a call come in while the headphones were connected to my iPhone 6s and I decided to just take it on the headphones. I read that the noise cancelling was supposed to be excellent and the multiple microphones wrapping around the sides really enhance the sound for the person on the other end of the call as well. After talking to the person for about 30 seconds the caller joked ""are you on T-Mobile or sprint because I can't hear you"". It's a common joke made between us referencing how (in our opinions) they are bad cell phone carriers. I accepted defeat and was thinking I should just give up and return them. My friend advised me to swap them out instead.  Coincidentally he had recently read about these headphones and was thinking about buying a pair for himself. I was to be his guinea pig. I agreed and swapped them out the next day.Pair #2 was just as perfect in design. That same excitement came over me as I opened the box and got a whiff of the new leather and felt the soft back. I was sure these are the ones I would love. I had just gotten a bad pair that first time. All was once again right in the world.The next day I had a short flight planned so I charged and packed my new headphones eager to pimp out my flight. I was probably more excited about testing the headphones during the flight than I was the destination of my trip. Very quickly I noticed that these did not have the same comfortable feel that the previous pair had. I played around with the memory foam wrapped in soft leather to see if maybe it had been pressed too hard and needed to be adjusted. I fluffed them like little baby pillows and tried again, and again. Every time, they would start off soft and comfortable but within 3 minutes it felt like the cushion in the foam would go flat and I could very distinctly feel hard plastic or medal parts inside my ear, digging into the top of my head. I remembered the pocket test from my first pair. Would these get intermittent if played from my pocket as well? I put my phone in my pocket. I turned my head and looked to the right I got nothing. I turned and looked to the left it worked. I decided I couldn't look the other way any longer (no pun intended). They were going back. I wanted to love them, I really did..but I didn't even like them.Couple of points that may be of interest to some:I got the same results when switching to Samsung s6 edge so it was not my phone. I did this on both models.The second pair of headphones had no problems with talking on the phone. The caller said I sounded great.I still don't think they are bad headphones. Several people stopped me and complimented them and asked where they could buy them. There is no better looking headphone out right now IMO.I could have just been super unlucky and gotten back to back bad headphones and the rest of the headphones coming off the line are perfect. At the very least there is a quality control problem here. I hope they can get it fixed. I really want to love them.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Sexy.. I'll give them that

    ","So far, so very good.  My corded over-ear Sennheisers are over 12 years old, and still good.  I'm the interim, I have had Sony, Grado, (non-noise-cancelling, Bluetooth) Bose, and Able Planet noise-cancelling headphones.  The old Sennheisers have what I think is the best sound overall.I am very pleased with the Momentum phones. They are comfortable, their sound is lush, the noise-cancelling is effective without making me feel like my head is hermetically sealed, and it's nice to have the Bluetooth option.  I have NOT tried taking or placing calls over them; in general, I don't like talking on the phone through....phones.  (When I have to make sure a caller's voice is kept private, I use a corded earbud with a microphone.) So, though I will make a point of trying it out so that I can report on it, the phone call connect feature is not something I care much about.My experience has been that problems with noise-canceling headphones tend to show up after w month or two.  The phones I bought at Christmas and had to return three weeks later had their left channel go wonky.  And the Able Planet phones I bought in June to upgrade my old ones whose noise-cancellation feature no longer works developed a really irritating buzz in the noise-cancelling mode within about six weeks. So I am just a bit wary, and have my fingers crossed. SO FAR, I am very pleased.

    ","Great headphone/headset but one major flaw for Apple users:  DOES NOT SUMMON SIRI!!!I just got off the phone with Sennheiser tech support and they have confirmed that this set of headphones DOES NOT support summoning siri on apple devices.  I am very surprised and disappointed.  Especially given the high price tag.  I have had many headphones and headsets (LG, BlueParrot, Klipsch) that ALL allow you to push a button to summon siri and then request her to perform certain actions.  This is NOT the case with the Momentum 2.0 Wireless headphones.  You can push the button on your phone to summon siri and then use the headphone mic to direct her but that requires you to touch your phone (not ideal when it's across the room or in your pocket).  Tech support mentioned the possibility that this is a licensing issue with Apple because they sell competing products.  I'm not sure but I know they need to work it out.  Voice control is the future (Siri, Alexa, Hey Google, Cortana, etc) and this is a major omission in my book (I rely on Siri heavily most days)...This is a real shame because otherwise these headphones are great and probably worth the high price.  The sound quality is great for a bluetooth connection (and I'm somewhat of an audiophile).My only other gripe is that they are not quite as comfortable as other competitors such as the Bose QC line.  The Momentum Wireless headphones should have some cushion in the headband to make them more comfortable.  If they had the cushion and Siri summoning they would definitely be 5 stars and worth the retail pricetag",3.0 out of 5 stars,DOES NOT SUMMON SIRI!!!

    ","As they are not sold in Turkey bought this headset on my Hong Kong trip.Sound quality is ok.Noise cancellation, i would say ok but after I tried Bose, Sennheiser is nowhere close.Bluetooth, don't believe in the people saying problems are solved. I bought this device on November 2016 and my android phone disconnects every second when i connect with these headphones. On my PC, situation is even worse. Only connects when 1 feet close to the bluetooth dongle, disconnects, and if by luck it's not disconnected yet there's a latency in sound. With the ipad there's also connection issues. These all devices connect with other bluetooth devices without any problems.Anyway, I wanted to buy this product a year ago, but couldn't find at the market.

    ","This review is about the manufacturer.We bought quite a few sennheiser headphones over the years. Sound was nothing to call home about and ,at any price range, alternatives were actually cheaper. We listen to headphones probably once to 3 times a week for about (4 ?) hours altogether per week.The problem is this company does not stand behind their products. When the headsets failed IN WARRANTY I contacted them. After days, a guy with German name, an engineer, (might have also been L'Inspecteur Clouseau, how could I verify his location) replied to describe the nature of the defect. I explained in a couple of emails and every time I had the feeling they did not want to honor their warranty by making it extremely difficult to handle it. It took weeks to get a reply and by that time I forgot what was it all about. They even wanted me to pay for shipping so they look at it and if truly (!) defective to repair.At their price point, customer service is really poor.I am sure they did not invent anything new this time around and whatever they offer others have it too.

    ","These would've been nice had they been 50 bucks. First of all, the noise cancellation is not very powerful at all, and you can still hear basic things around you that you would not with other noise cancelling devices. Secondly, the overall sound quality is not that great either. When you turn up the volume it greatly distorts the quality of the music. While this is normal, this is less the case with other noise cancelling devices I have used. And thirdly, the isolation is just crap. It doesn't matter where you are, everyone around you will be able to hear what you are listening to, which can be pretty annoying for you and your surroundings.I have always been a great fan of Sennheiser, and felt I could trust whatever they brought out, but these headphones are an affront.

    ","Its hard to justify the cost for these headphones. There are some very critical aspects one must consider before purchasing these. I am not an audiophile. Ears are 40 years old. Phone used was iPhone 7+First - feature set, dates back 3 years. Basically coming out from Sony MDR-1ABT headphones that I use daily for 3 hrs or more, these were going back a generation. There is no way to change tracks from the headphones themselves. So while walking in Chicago cold, I could'nt swipe to swtich tracks. Ok, pull out the phone from pocket and change tracks.Second - DAC Amplification. The sound from these headphones is kinda low. After max volume on my phone, I was surprised with 'thats all they could do'Third - Bluetooth connection. Since I use my Sony MDR-1ABT daily, I never have this problem walking same route everyday: There was a connection break while crossing busy streets. Its bad. You basically cant listen to anything if you are standing on a red light on a busy intersection as the bluetooth would skip again and againOther Mediocre things (for a $378) headphone:1. Noise Cancellation is good for an already quite environment. I tested it with Sony MDR-1000x MK1 that I own as well, and as Sony literally shuts a fan drone, HD1 was only quites it to some extent2. The metal part of the band: If you are sitting and lets say wearing a jacket, the metal part would hit your collar causing noise in the ear piece. Of course you wont hear it with medium volume, but this is a serious design flaw in my eyesI am sorry I dont know ""that Sennheiser sound"" people talk about.

Sennheiser is bulky looking.  Bose is what it is nice style but no head turner but nice sleek minimal design- Noise Cancellation - Bose QC-25 the best but Parrot is very close 2nd.  Sennheiser is by far distance 3rd.  Noise cancellation is not very good on Sennheiser so I would not buy these based on that feature because it is weak- Construction - Sennheiser appears solid and my guess would last the longest- Bluetooth - I had dropouts and skipping playing music so Sennheiser Bluetooth connection is not solid.  Parrot is better.  QC-25 N/A,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser and Parrot are close but I give the edge to Parrot because Sennheiser does not load at all and sounds like it is at 1
