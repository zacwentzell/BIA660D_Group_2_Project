    ",All I can say is WOW. I owned many top of the line Bluetooth ear buds and these are the best money can buy. If your looking for great sound meaning highs and lows these are it. They make you feel like you are in the studio with the bands. They also have a app where you can adjust the right and left ear to the way you want to here your music. One more thing the bass is great and I never did adjusted them to the app. They were great right out of the box. Hope this helps with your  decision. I believe you have 30 days to return them. Built very well.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I owned many top of the line Bluetooth ear buds and these are the best money can buy
1,"on March 20, 2018",,"Wow, great sound for wireless bluetooth. Most of the time I use wired IEM, B&H C5s for listening to music on my phone. Very good all around sound compared to others I have tried like plantronics back beat go 3's. This has them beat by a mile.  Yes, I know, listening to music on bluetooth is not supposed to sound good, but try them. . .  My phone I listen to MP3's. For lossless music, FLAC, I listen to FLAC files on a pioneer XDP-300R player using SONY MDR-1A headphones.  That player is a little big to carry around, so sometimes I use my phone with MP3s. Oh yes, most wired stereo bluetooth headsets I tried tend to drop the signal when I put my phone in my jeans pocket---this headset, Sennhieser HD1 Free does not drop a signal . . .love it for casual music listening.  Sounds good on calls too.BTW  using the B&W C5 is still my favorite for music on the phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW, great sounding music for a bluetooth headset . . ."

    ","I wanted to like these I really did but the battery life just doesn't hold up. You never get 6 hours. You barely get 4. I got comply tips bit they still fall out probably due to how they hang out of your ear and how heavy the controller is and the battery. The down angle of the ear piece is an issue I think.  And the control scheme of holding up or down for a second to change the track just doesn't work for me. I want to be able to double tap a button. On the plus side, sound is terrific. You can't go wrong for sound with these. Nice highs and lows for my tastes. If you guys make these changes I'll buy again and buy for family.",3.0 out of 5 stars,So close!

I have not tried going down 2 levels.  They are reasonably comfortable as ear buds can be. Like others have said, I wish the magnets were a little stronger to secure them around the neck when not in use. The magnets disconnect with too little resistance so I just place them in a pocket when idle for fear of losing them. I teamed it with the Sennheiser HD-1 app on my iPhone and set the graphic equalizer to my preferences. I am very pleased with the resulting sound.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The sound is superb.

    ",These earbuds are amazing. I had a set of Jaybirds that I used for many many years and they never let me down. Finally I decided to get a new pair as I felt the Jaybirds battery was starting to hold its charge a little less than it should.I am very happy with the sound quality of these earbuds and love how they wear around the neck. The magnet strength is a little weak but it is a non issue with me. The only change I made was purchasing a set of comply foam tips as I do not like the fit of silicone tips. I did recently take a 6 hour flight and between a couple movies and music this battery died just about the same time we touched down so the battery life seems spot on.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality, Quality, Quality,"

    ","Beautiful-sounding headphones!! One of the best I have listened to...and I have listened to a lot! I felt like the sound wasn’t overly sculpted. There is a little boost in the bottom end, maybe. But it is not overly done. The bass/sub-bass is not boomy or muddled. So they are not completely flat, but well modeled. I heard things in my music I have never heard before.They also have much better presence than many do. Even in this $125-200 range, many aren’t clear, without being harsh. So sound like you have a thin blanket over them, dulling the fell on depth and breadth to the “room.” They sound much bigger and fuller than their size portends.My only knock, and it is personal, is that I couldn’t get a great, solid fit. If I was moving, I didn’t feel like they were locked in. I certainly couldn’t have been too active in them. But that has mostly to do with the shaped of my ears, and they offer fitments. So I would definitely not consider them a sports earphone. I didn’t try to find a triple-flange tip for them, but that mights work.Overall, the best sounding pair I have listened to, under $200.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful-sounding earphones!

    ","Have been a big fan of Sennheiser and had the wire versions of these headphones. I can say the sound quality is audiophile level and without a doubt it stunning for a bluetooth headset. Have been using everyday for 2 months now and battery lasts with plenty to get home from college campus and recharge at night. The bluetooth connection is a little odd for apps...if I'm listening to Spotify I have to manually close that app to listen to a video on youtube?

    ","I’ve been a fan of Sennheiser headphones for years and these HD-1 Free definitely delivered the sound quality I was expecting. They have amazing sound; very clear and full, and the bass is great.However, the earbuds are not the most comfortable to wear because they get pulled down by the weight of the control and mic pieces. Personally, I don’t like how long the earbuds stick out from my ears because that gives me a hard time wearing my motorcycle helmet over them. From the picture I hadn’t expected the earbuds to be that big/bulky. I also think the cord should be a little shorter. You can adjust the cord to pull the ear pieces closer to your neck, but then there will be an extra length of cord sticking out behind your neck.Another bug I found is that if your Spotify app is opened and you want to watch another web video, the video sound won’t play unless you also play Spotify or close it. This is a very weird and annoying bug.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound but with some cons

    ","If I actively held the earbuds in an optimal position with my fingers, the sound was fantastic. Otherwise, the weight of the battery and control dinguses on the cord would pull down on the earbuds in a most irritating manner that also tended to mess up the positioning and spoil the sound quality. In this case, the ""newer"" model is definitely not better. I am replacing these with the Sennheiser HD1 Wireless which have the same earbuds but they connect with just a lightweight cable to a ""collar"" piece that rests at the base of your neck. The weight of the battery is then around your collar and not pulling down on your ear canal. Also, with that design, Sennheiser included a larger battery, so that model lasts ten hours instead of six on a charge. This purchase was a big mistake, but fortunately there is a better choice for the same price.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Pulls down on your ears!

    ","The Sennheiser HD1 Free Bluetooth Wireless Headphone provides excellent sound clarity with fine definition and exceptionally good bass response. I listened to both CDs and FLAC files of piano and orchestral music, since I find that recordings of acoustic instruments without much in the way of additional processing are a good way of gauging whether or not a given headset is biased in one direction or another. Not only did the bass on the piano sound realistic without ""booming"", but the strings of the orchestra were well-defined, including the lower strings. I noticed distinct variety of coloration in the piano at various volume levels. I'm sure that the headphone will do justice to highly ""produced"" music as well, including that with drums, vocals, etc.I was initially concerned that the weight of the control and battery might tend to pull the earpieces out of my ears, but luckily they are light enough not to have that problem. Once you get used to where the controls are, they are easy to use. Volume adjustment, skipping tracks, answering a phone call, etc. works as stated in the downloadable PDF user guide. The rubber earpieces are comfortable.The only qualm I have with the headset is that the microUSB charging port is covered by a flimsy rubber flap, which I can see tearing from repeated use. We'll see.Without a doubt, the Sennheiser HD1 Free Bluetooth Wireless Headphone is the best sounding Bluetooth headphone I have had the occasion to use. I happen to have a phone compatible with the newest BT modes, so that probably helps in terms of overall sound quality. As this set is not cheap, you'll probably want to have a less-expensive set for when you're out and about in all sorts of weather.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound, exceptionally good bass and definition"

    ","For the pricetag, the sound quality is garbagr. There are zero lows and everything sounds tinny and devoid of and depth. Also the segments containing the bluetooth and battery are asymmetrical on the cord, and weigh significantly different so it drags to one side and feels awkward in use. Those segments are also quite close to each earbud so it looks quite bulky.TL;DR - Bad thin sound, bulky and uneven design.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed. Usually Sennheiser is great...

    ","These get five stars for the sound alone. Really great for such a small, light headphone. And the cords are not those tiny, thin floss-like delicate wires you get on a lot of earbuds that snap if you tug on them a little too hard (terrible if you ever get your earbuds caught around a door handle or around a wrist, etc.) - the cording on these is thick and durable.But a few things I don't love:- as another reviewer noted, the charging set up is cumbersome- it comes with a little USB cord you plug into your USB brick (haven't tried charging the headphones directly plugged into the back of my iMac) and into one of the ""control bars"" (don't know if there's a technical term for those) that are on the cords for the headphones. It would have been nice if the charger were somehow integrated with the little case that comes with the headphones. The tangle of cords on my desk is already too much, so adding the headphones into the mix with the charging cord makes me feel like I'm in a spider's web.- the magnet that is supposed to hold the headphones together when you wear them around your neck is super weak on my set of headphones, so they don't really stay stuck together.- there are only a few buttons on the ""control bars"" so you have to use one button for multiple purposes- hold one second for one function, tap it once for another, etc... I know they were trying to keep these headphones streamlined and minimal, but they could have added just a few more buttons.- I wish they came in other colors to match the rest of my tech (matte silver or white).Otherwise, these are great. Like I said, the sound is phenomenal- worth the five star rating.",5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT sound with a few design-related quirks

    ","These are worth it for the sound quality alone.  You obviously don't get a surround-sound/depth of sound stage with movies, but for a stereo setup, I was very impressed.Pairing these was straightforward to both my phone and PC, (the fact that I can have both paired simultaneously is both a time and frustration saver), though I can't say I'm a huge fan of the multifunction button which is anything but intuitive to use.The charge actually lasted 6+ hours but there's room for improvement with the charging setup.  When sitting next to a smart watch with a magnetic dock, these feel two-thousand and late.In use, it's easy to forget you're wearing them.

    ","In reviewing the Sennheiser HD1 Headphones, I have a couple of criteria.  I'm not a pro audio tech...I'm a discriminating consumer and right off I will tell you that these headphones rocked my world.  My criteria were sound, comfort, usability (including charging, keeping clean, etc.)First, the sound is terrific. I've had Bluetooth connections before, the sound that comes through these headphones has to be heard to be believed. It sounds like my father's old stereo, the one he paid thousands for years ago that had to be adjusted with the precision of an engineer. These sounded that good. I particularly liked the bass, rocked my world on both classical and rock.  The jazz highlights (trombones!) were also pretty amazing.Normally, on good headphones, you need to expect some girth to them.  But these are light and comfortable both in the ear and hanging loose around the neck. I had them in my ears for 4 hours for a long car trip in which I was a passenger, watched two movies and wasn't ever uncomfortable or tired of having them in my ears. In short, they were great...Last, I know other reviewers pointed out that the headphones may feel a little awkward to plug in for charging but I had no problem doing so. I have it plugged in\to my car so I have them charged and ready to go when I want them.  There's a little flap that is meant to keep dust out of the plug but it  looks a little light, we're see how it goes.  So far, its fine...we'll see if it holds up longer term. If not, I might just use a little piece of tape to keep the charging plug safe and clean.All in all, big fan of the headphones. If you are looking for a good pair, these are amazing, particularly at their price point.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Review: Sennheiser HD1 Bluetooth Wireless Headphones  Executive Summary: Better than I expected and I expected a lot.

    ","Looking for quality bluetooth in-ear monitors (IEM) since your phone jack got kicked to the curb? Me too. I am running on a Pixel 2 XL and have been hunting for a high-quality sounding wireless IEM with aptX and without the neckband/collar rig. I was not looking for gym/running/sweating it out earbuds, but generally something to fill-in the blank for my wired RHA T20s for use at the office or out and about. My wife picked these up for my birthday since they had the right specs and I have been pleased all around with the experience. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a similar use IEM.If you want more details then read on below since these were the details I was looking into when researching. I will assume that folks know about the realities of microphonics from any cable going into the ear, the fact IEMs will not have the same soundstage as over-the-ear planar magnetics, and fit within the ear is as productive as arguing over one size fits all gloves.The sound (for single driver IEM in this price range): 8/10Similar to the RHA T20, but the Sennheiser has better mids. The spectrum is all there and the mids really shine as the winner. The highs are good for real hi-hats and rides yet sounded too static-like and sharp for higher pitched electronic cymbals. The lows are present and are not boomy. The lows are a little challenged when trying to recreate a low pedal tone while balancing the other ranges. I am rather impressed with the soundstaging for these IEMs. Not in the audiophile listening domain yet certainly better than anything I have heard without taking a monster leap in price and which must be wired.The functionality: 9/10Bluetooth hooked up without issue and my phone confirmed aptX connection. The CAPTUNE app integrated nicely with Tidal and then allows some fine tuning of the EQ to better suite orchestras versus bands. I do not have any crackles or dropout with the connection. Buttons seem easy enough to manage...only 3 of them with ample size from my perspective. Battery life is on par with 6 hours with medium volume. Want more juice then you have to wear the battery weight.Calls: 6/10Call quality is ok while listening. The distant end seems a bit muted when I hear the callers speaking. The other end says that the call is clear but they hear rustling sounds if the cord is moving around on your shirt/collar. So the calls are doable while not up to Plantronics call standards.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Still searching for quality sounds in your earbuds?

I have been using these headphones for about a month now daily and so far I am getting closer to 8 hours out of the battery before needing a charge and when I do need to charge, I can pop them on for about an hour and get another 6 hours of life. Sennheiser really knocked it out of the park with these, great looking, sound is fantastic, and they somehow made the battery life awesome. My only gripe is with the captune app, it is just not very user friendly.

    ","The sound and comfort of these earbuds are excellent.  When I cannot use my Bluetooth Bose Quiet Comfort headphones, these are now my go-to phones.There are some non-optimal design features:  the rubber flange that covers the charging port when the phones are not being charged is flimsy.  I would be surprised if it lasts six months before simply detaching itself.  The earbuds are supposed to be magnetic....but, not so much.  That’s not a big deal for me, but would-be purchasers who are counting on that feature should know that it’s not really there.  Finally, I wish the sound isolation were a bit better.

Firstly, while they work with my iPhone, they don't work with my Macbook Air or the PC at work. Apparently, you need to buy a separate dongle, which means I've got to remember to carry something else around, and will probably lose along the way. Effectively, this reduces these headphones to one which only works with my phone and nothing else. Secondly, the battery lasts for only a few hours.

    ","On the up:- Excellent sound quality- Pairs readily with the iPhone 7 and 8Issues:- Quite heavy because of the control device and the battery, so slowly falls out of my ears- Control device is very small, if you have fat fingers you may end up turning the tune off just when you're trying to turn it up even higher- Randomly doesn't ring when I'm listening to music, which is totally annoying but could be I haven't set it up properly?- Never gets 6 hours of battery life - the last 40% lasts about 30 minutes, 20% lasts less than 10 minutesRounding up from 3.5 stars to 4.",4.0 out of 5 stars,3.5 stars

    ","Although you don’t need to use the app after that.My Sony Xperia phone would not pair until I installed the app and then when I returned to the Bluetooth settings, the earbuds were finally listed after many tries.  Although I had no hair by that time I was glad I was finally connected.  hahaThe manual explains things in symbols and my pet peeve is the “multi-functional” button.  Press it 4 SECONDS to turn it on, press 2 to turn it off…..To pair, the lights blink red, then blue, repeating until you get it paired.  Press the button 1 TIME for music.  Of course I will just use my phone controls except to turn it off and on, or I would lose my mind. :-)The sound is awesome and the fit is really good, snug but comfortable and they are light. These feel light enough for me to forget I am wearing them which is important to me.  I bought my daughter a pair of Sennheiser headphones about 4 yrs ago, they are still going strong and she still loves them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome earbuds but download the Captune app first!

    ","These sound absolutely amazing for both music and calls.  Honestly, the best I have ever used. Crazy easy to connect and not one issue connecting to two devices (New Chromebook & note 8) at the same time.  Why two stars? If you only wear one, for a call, the weight of the other side pulls down and eventually, the control with the buttons is behind your neck.  These are awesome if you only wear them both at the same time, otherwise, no.  Crazy disappointed by this overlook from their QA dept.  I wanted to love them so much due to the sound & call quality, and the connection strength.  :-(I tried everything I could think of to make them not do this.  No luck.  Returning.",2.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to love them.
