0,"on December 21, 2017",,"Got these headphones on 12/20/2017, so this is just preliminary.  The sound so far I would say is very good, very clear.  I was able to pair with multiple devices successfully, and that works well. I wish maybe the control buttons protruded just a little tiny bit more, but that is minor.No issues on calling or music listening.  It works ok on pc as well.  I can flip between pc and phone easily enough, will try pairing with car and some other devices as the opportunity arisesNot sure yet on the battery life or durability side, but I don't see any issue so far.  I would adjust rating upward if those two aspects work out.",4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a high quality set with very good sound

    ","Sounds good, fit well, long battery; microphone doesn't always pick up voice - other person on phone calls can't always hear and functions like voice commands are spotty.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds good, fit well"

    ","Now that I've lived with this headset for about a month, I feel ready to write a review.I enjoy wearing these.  They are lightweight and comfortable.  The flanges that are on the product when shipped fit my ears fine so I didn't try any of the other included sizes.  These give surprisingly good sound for a set that doesn't need to actually be firmly pushed into the ear canal.  In the past, my experience with earbuds has been that they sound extremely thin when not shoved into my ears far enough to make a seal.As to the sound quality, it's eminently enjoyable while exercising.  Because I think that's the kind of situation earbuds like this are designed for, I will give these high marks for sound quality.  They have that classic Sennheiser musicality that makes Sennheiser my preferred brand when it comes to headphones/earbuds, with no portion of the frequency range being exaggerated relative to the others.  In a more quiet, still environment, however, depending on the type of music you listen to you will start to hear the CX 7.00BT's shortcomings.  The biggest of these is just an overall sense of congestion.  The more complex the musical passage, the more you will notice that these struggle to keep everything in focus.  In comparison, the other IEM I currently have on hand -- my old standby, the Ultimate Ears triple.fi pro 10 -- is better able to handle complex musical passages even though it, too, gets a little muddy.  Comparing this to Sennheiser's over-the-ears, full-sized bluetooth Momentum 2s, though, is an -- ahem -- ear opening experience.  No doubt that the Momentum 2 excels in every way, but one should expect that given the large cost difference as well as the headphone design itself.  Is it really fair to expect any pair of earbuds to compare favorably with a good quality, full-sized set of headphones?Pairing was easy.  Like the other Sennheiser bluetooth set I have, the one complaint I have is that there is insufficient battery level notice.  The manual indicates that a voice prompt should indicate when the battery is low but I've never heard it, even after using the set for close to the full amount of time the battery is rated to run.  The same is true with the Momentum 2.  I used to have a Bose bluetooth set which had only one advantage over Sennheiser -- the battery level was announced every time the set was turned on.  I wish Sennheiser would incorporate something similar into their products.So, all in all, I would recommend this product for its intended use -- a good quality set for use on the go.  Not the be all and end all if you're using it while sedentary, though, so if that's your plan you might want to consider other options.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good quality earbuds for active people, but not the ultimate in sound quality"

    ","This is a good set, but it's not without flaws.  The upshot is that there's a lot I really like, and only a few minor annoyances, so ultimately I really recommend this set.Pros:* It links up cleanly and easily to my phone* the battery lasts a long time* it has great sound quality* It's comfortable* It blocks ambient noise pretty well* I like the design, how it goes around my neck and then the earbuds come up off of that.  This makes it less likely for me to put down and lose my earbuds, or accidentally run the earbuds through the wash.Cons:* The volume buttons on the band are very tricky to find and use.  At this point I just use the phone to adjust the volume because the buttons are too annoying to work with.* People I'm talking to can tell I'm using something other than just my phone. I get asked a lot if I'm using a headset or something.  So it's distorting my voice or something.Basically those cons are pretty easy to deal with.  I don't care if I sound a little strange to people, and using my phone to adjust the volume is no big deal. So overall, I really like these headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones. Biggest issue is how my voice sounds to them.

    ","10 hours of battery life (for real), good bass, clean audio, great highs, good midrange. What's not to love? I figured Sennheiser would be great quality, so jumped at the chance to try these. Glad I did - they're terrific. Four sizes of earbuds are included for ""customized"" fitting. Took less than 2 hours to charge up via USB.Haven't tried pairing with two devices, just need it with one for now. But apparently that's doable too. No trouble quickly pairing this with my Samsung Galaxy S7, and the audio quality and call quality is phenomenal.Very lightweight too, 1.7 oz. After a while I forgot I had it around my neck. Really great.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality, easy to wear."

    ","Not a bad headset, but has a few issues.Pros:Sound quality with music and calls is very goodStay in place, even when you need to exerciseBattery life is goodAbility to swap earbuds for differently sized ear canalsCons:Lots of complaints from people on the other ends of calls about noise and poor voice qualityVery tiny buttons that are nearly impossible to use without looking (which requires removing the headphones)Overall, an okay set if you're just listening to music, but if you plan on using them for many phone calls, I'd look at other options.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, not great"
