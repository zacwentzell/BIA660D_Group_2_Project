    ","Edit: a couple of nags. No carrying pouch. The included case is too complex for the needs. Otherwise I am happy.Brief review of sound quality:Without using an EQ or any custom settings the sound is very V-Shaped.Treble: Well balanced with the occasional harshness in cymbals or guitar chords but nothing bad. Treble is very clear lyrically and allows melodies to come through in songs without getting muddied by the bass.Mids: Relatively missing, as with V-Shaped. I personally like mids to balance out the high and lows, there's just not a lot of detail here. If you are not the type of person to care for V-shaped, avoid these.Bass: Very well balanced. can be EQ'd up easily but otherwise they are there. They aren't booming but they are there undoubtedly.Other Notes:I replaced the earbud tips with memory foam because I personally cannot stand silicone in my ears. They are very light and extremely comfortable. I didn't think I would like the mic and battery portions on both sides but it balances out very well. No awkward pulling. For reference, I had tried the Beyerdynamic BT headphones before these and the treble on those was extremely harsh. I couldn't wear them long at all.In summary, the Sennheiser CX 6.00 BT are very well balanced and sounding headphones for the money. I am not an audiophile but I have spent decent money on a DAC/amp combo for my desktop. These headphone will likely replace my daily use Zero Audio Carbo Tenores just because I need the convenience of cordless.Update: Reducing by one star because it does not include a useful carrying pouch, the battery life could be better, and the band tie on the cord cannot be removed. Also, the remote buttons sit unnecessarily flush with the other buttons and remote body.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price if you like V-shaped audio profiles

    ","Considering the price, these sound pretty solid. It has a very clear and crisp sound and just enough bass. These are not bass heavy earbuds, so if you want a ton of bass then check elsewhere. The sound won't blow you away but, they sound cleaner than most other earbuds in this price range. Sound is pretty good. If you want even better sound check out the HD1 Free for double the price.As far as fit goes, I'm surprised how well they stay in my ear. These are NOT workout headphones so trying to use them for workouts will most likely lead to frustration. However for casual use like at the office, taking walks on break, doing groceries, etc these stay in place surprisingly well.Overall I'm very pleased with these. The sound great for the price, fit well, and slim enough to put in my pocket when not in use.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Solid sounding earbuds for the price
2,"on April 10, 2018",,"Great sound quality and super comfortable. The battery lasts all day and charges pretty quick. The earbuds fit in my ear nicely and stay put well enough for my day-to-day activities. I also love this design, when not in use, just hang them around your neck and tuck them in your shirt. They're so light weight, you won't even notice them. Best part, as with all Sennheiser BT products, is its super easy to use and connect - the earbuds talk to you, ""power on"", ""power off"", ""connected"", etc.Overall, could not be happier!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent BT Earbuds
3,"on April 6, 2018",,"Bought this to replace my Jabra Sport pulse wireless headphones but I'm returning these.The sound stage is a giant V.  The lows are good, the mid is non-existent, and the highs is like somebody maxed out the treble.  It actually hurts my ears on songs with how prominent the highs are.  As a Sennheiser fan, these earbuds are definitely disappointing.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"The lows are good, the mid is non-existent"

    ","Wired headphones are going to be ""retro"" devices very soon. You'd might as well get used to the fact that wireless headphones are charging forward whether we like it or not. I have mixed feelings, since I have a nice collection of wired headphones that I really like, but fewer and fewer devices I can plug them into.The Sennheiser CX 6.00 BT are reasonably priced for wireless headphones, particularly for a pair from a highly respected headphone maker. The packaging is nice, but I would’ve preferred they’d invested in a storage pouch of some sort. It comes with 2 additional ear “adapters” of varying sizes and a very short, micro-USB charging cable. The set of ear adapters that were already on the CX 6.00 are what I used to test with.Pairing the CX 6.00 was simple and the connection stayed solid throughout my testing. Range was excellent as well. I tested it with a Samsung Galaxy S8 mobile phone and an Apple iMac desktop computer and listened mostly to music from Apple Music and videos from Netflix/Amazon Prime/HBO Go.I found the CX 6.00 to be comfortable to wear for about an hour at a time, before having to take them out and take a break. Switching the ear “adapters” to Comply foam tips may improve comfort for longer periods of time. I don’t really like the way they look while I’m wearing them, however. The CX 6.00 has the remote on the right side, but another piece of electronics (mic?) on the left side and both sides flare out a bit, making me look rather goofy while I’m wearing them. The remote works well for switching tracks, changing the volume, and starting/pausing audio. It’s also convenient for answering/ending phone calls, if you still do that sort of thing on your smartphone.Sound quality on the CX 6.00 isn’t quite what I was expecting/hoping for. The highs can get a little harsh, but detail is good. The low end, while responsive, can overwhelm the mids. The mid-range is lacking for the most part.Feature-wise, I think the CX 6.00 is great. However, I wasn’t impressed with the overall sound quality. I expect Sennheiser headphones to have superior sound, regardless of the price point, but I think the CX 6.00 misses in that regard. You can find generic wireless headphones with “good enough” sound quality for 1/3 the price of the CX 6.00.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good features, but not the typical Sennheiser sound quality I was expecting"

    ","Bought this through Sennheiser when it was first announced at CES. I've had about 1+ month of daily usage and I have to say, it's an excellent set. I had the wired earbuds from Sennheiser before this for several years and the audio quality and bluetooth consistency is legit. I can also have two devices simultaneously connected, which is great at work between my phone and laptop. Personally, it's totally worth the asking price, but feel free to wait for a sale price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound in a small portable headset

    ","As you would expect from a company with Sennheiser's reputation for making quality headphones, these Bluetooth in-ear headphones deliver an audio quality that's superior to most comparable in-ear products I've tried. I'm also impressed by the extremely light weight.  You may need to experiment with the different ear bud sizes (all provided) to get the right fit, and I'm not sure how well they will stay in my ear if engaged in vigorous activity like running, but otherwise this product is a cinch to charge, connect to your audio device, and use.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight With High Quality Sound

    ","These are comfortable and sound amazing. The quality difference between these and my older Jabra bluetooth workout headphones is quite obvious. I don't know if it's because these implement a newer, higher bandwidth bluetooth technology or if they are just better drivers. Probably both.I love that they include a number of different ear fittings so you can find just the right size. I was able to get them snug but still comfortable.My lone complaint is that these do not automatically sync to my iPhone X when I turn them on. Each time I turn them on, I then have to go to my iPhone's settings page and manually click on them to get them to connect. Once I do that, everything is great. But it's a bit of a hassle.",4.0 out of 5 stars,great sound!

    ","I haven't had these earbuds for long, but already I'm not exactly impressed. The sound quality leaves much to be desired, with a fairly tinny sound. There's no way to edit the sound profile, and it has very high tilted audio. So the bass is quiet, and anything high is far too loud. I also wasn't able to connect it via bluetooth to my computer, while it had no issue connecting to my phone. In the past, my other bluetooth earbuds have been able to connect to both easily. Not a bad pair of headphones, but I'd expect a lot more at this price point.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but not worth $100"

    ","These are a powerful little pair of earbuds that are extremely comfortable and high quality. Because they have different sizes to choose from, you don't have to worry about the discomfort of extra pressure or too little security while enjoying your favorite music and programs! Sennheiser is an excellent brand for a durable, long-lasting purchase that you will not ever regret and these are well worth the buy. Just connect and GO!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sound and value

    ","I have been through quite a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years. Very few of them have sounded better than something you can buy at the dollar store, regardless of how expensive they were. Unfortunately, this item isn't much better than others I have tried, most of which cost far, far less money.To me, the biggest single factor in rating headphones is how they sound in the real world. Earbuds are notorious for their tinny sound and lack of bass response. These rate as about average when it comes to bass response, which is to say, there is hardly any bass to be heard. Complicating the matter is the design of this product. While it comes with a number of different sized ear pieces, none of the ones I tried seemed to fit well and kept falling out anytime I moved my head. If you use the smallest earpiece you can actually get the buds to fit into your ear canal, but due to the fact that underneath the earbuds is basically a hollow, metal tube the product is very uncomfortable to wear.I was hoping to use these to replace my old Bluetooth headphones, but they are too uncomfortable for me to keep wearing. The $14 headphones I already had sound better and don't irritate my ears the way these do.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not That Great
