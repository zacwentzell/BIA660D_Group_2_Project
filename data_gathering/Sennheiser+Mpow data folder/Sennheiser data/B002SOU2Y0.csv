    ","Below is my evaluation after having used them regularly for about 60 days.SUMMARY:Before buying these headphones I did a great deal of research on the available options out there, looking at factors such as cost, comfort, performance, clarity, noise leakage, usage time between charges, and the type of power source.  My primary purpose for these headphones was to watch TV in bed, without disturbing my wife.  These do the job admirably and have performed very well to date, although they could get a 5 star rating from me, with a few small improvements.USAGE:Using these for the first time is simple, once you get them out of the nearly impenetrable and difficult to open plastic package.  Simply plug in the transmitter to a regular A/C power source (or use batteries instead, if you prefer), and then plug in the 3.5mm audio cable into your TV's Audio Out slot.  Then press the power button on the transmitter (it has a blinking green light once it is on).  There is also volume control on the transmitter, which can increase or decrease the max volume on your headset.The headset is easy to operate. Install two AAA batteries, one in each ear piece (see the photo showing one of the battery compartments).  Then install the earpiece cushion covers, which turn slightly to lock in place.  [Note: There are two AAA rechargeable batteries in the package - but you can also use regular alkaline AAA batteries instead, if you prefer.] Now just press and hold the power button on the headset until the green light on the outside of the right ear piece lights up.  [Note: That little green light also alerts to you if you have a low battery, by blinking faster when the battery is running low.]  The volume on your TV will NOT impact the volume on your headphones.  Accordingly, you can turn your volume all the way down on your TV, if desired (the TV volume works independently of the headphones, so if the headset is being used by one person, other person(s) not wearing headphones can listen at a different volume).Now the headset should be functioning and ready to go.  If it is not operating, check to verify the following:  (1) That you have the 3.5mm audio cable from the transmitter in the Audio Out slot (many TVs have an Audio In slot as well, so it can be easy to plug in to the wrong receptacle by accident).  (2) That the AAA batteries are in correctly, and that the green light on the outside of the headset is blinking slowly.  (3) Verify that the transmitter is on by looking for it's green flashing light.  Unlike the headset, the transmitter has an auto-off feature, and may turn itself off if it is either inactive for some time.PROS:Sound:  Excellent.  No complaints whatsoever.Volume:  Good volume range, with a mute feature (it mutes if you press the volume down button after getting to the lowest volume setting).  Only oddity is the volume on both the transmitter and the headset (see the CONS below for more info on this).  There are separate Volume Up and Volume Down buttons on the right earpiece, one on each side of the power button (see attached photo).  Unlike some older 900mhz wireless headsets, the transmitter does NOT cut out and give you loud static if there is a low volume in the TV broadcast. Instead, it transmits as much or as little sound as being broadcast on your media (like your TV's built in speaker).Ease of Use: Good.  Press and hold the power button on the headphones until the green light flashes, and do the same on the transmitter.  Now ready to use.  To turn off, just press and hold the power button on the headphones until the green light stops flashing.  You can also turn off the transmitter manually if desired, or you can just let it turn itself off.Clarity:  Excellent.  No popping or distortion at all, just as clear as a wired headset.Range:  Good.  The range is perfect for a bedroom or living room setting.  However, if you walk more than about 20-30 feet away, the sound may cut out temporarily (you have more range if you have direct line of sight without any obstructions, and less range if you walk into a garage or have multiple rooms between you and the transmitter).  The nice thing is that unlike older 900mhz wireless headsets, you do NOT get any loud noises when you go out of range.  Instead, the headset simply goes silent until you get back in range, and then resumes on its own once you are back in range.Comfort:  Very good.  The headset can easily adjust on both the left and right side, for those with larger heads.  The over-ear pads are soft and easily conform to your head.  The only minor issue is that the standard earpiece cushion looks like thin faux leather, and can be a little bit warm and sweaty after using for an hour or two (see the CONS below for an explanation of this issue, and the easy solution).Battery Life:  Good.  The batteries last about 2 weeks if you use them for a couple hours each day.  Battery life is not quite as long life as with some older 900mhz units, but then again, the quality of sound in the RS160 headset is completely worth it. Battery life would likely be better if the headset used AA batteries instead of AAA, but that would also add weight, so hard to say if it would be worth it.  Replacing batteries is a 30 second affair, just gently twist the earpiece cushions to pop them off, and replace both of the AAA batteries (one on each side).CONS:Button Function & Placement:  The volume up and down buttons work fine, but even though the Volume Up button is slightly larger than the Volume Down button, it is easy to hit the wrong button by accident (especially if you don't have tiny child-size fingers). What makes this worse is that Sennheiser has put the power button in the same spot, such that you can hit the power button by accident. [Note: There is a SLIGHT imprint on the power button that you can feel if you pay attention, but it is very easy to press a volume button together or instead since the buttons are small and a little too close together.]  IMHO, the headset would be far easier to use if the power button were either moved further away from the volume buttons, or if it were merely an On/Off switch.Transmitter Auto-Off:  This is the only wireless headset I have had which has a transmitter that needs to be turned on every single time you use the headset. Why does the transmitter turn itself off at all if it is plugged in?  IMHO, it would be far better if Sennheiser just deleted the auto-off feature, or used a traditional On/Off power button.Lack of any Headset Auto-Off:  Unlike the transmitter, which is plugged in, it would make sense for the headset to have an auto-off feature when there is no transmission for a period of time (say, an hour).  However, there is no auto-off feature on the headset.  With it being difficult to know for certain if you hit the power button to turn the headset off (such as when you fall asleep with the headphones on), it is easy to accidentally leave the headset on for hours/days, running down the battery.Transmitter Volume Adjustment:  Really don't understand why there is a volume adjustment on the transmitter.  If you increase the volume on the transmitter, it increases the max volume and min volume on the headset.  Why not just give the headset more range of volume on its own and ditch the separate transmitter volume???Sub-Par Material on the Ear Pads: The standard earpiece cushions look like thin faux leather.  I have seen this material deteriorate over time on other similar products, and based on the other reviews I see here, apparently this occurs over time with the standard RS160 ear pads as well. However, more importantly, the earpiece cushions get a little bit warm and sweaty after using them for an hour or two. However, you can order the Genuine Replacement Ear pads SENNHEISER RS180 HDR180 Ear cushions Foam Earpad as perfect fit replacement, and get the superb velour earpiece cushions from the more expensive RS180 Sennheiser headset instead (they are a little pricey, but are worth the price).BOTTOM LINE:Very good product with excellent sound, clarity and comfort.  Glad that I purchased them, and would do so again.  While the Sennheiser RS160 has some minor drawbacks, in my opinion it is still the best option in this price range.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great headphones with excellent sound and usability, with only slight design imperfections."

    ","I purchased these as a gift for my girlfriend in December 2016. We live in a small apartment and wanted a way for one of us to watch television while the other one was working. They work fantastically well for that. It is great to be able to read or study while she watches TV or vice versa. No more arguments. The sound quality is excellent and it is so much easier to hear all the words and all the details in a movie with these on. So much so that we are probably going to get another headset so we both can have one when watching a movie together. The three star rating is due to the fact that Sennheiser offers a fairly comprehensive two year warranty on their products if purchased from an authorized dealer.  But, according to the Sennheiser website, Amazon is NOT an authorized dealer. If you are worried about buying an expensive headset only to have one side short out after a year, it would be smart to purchase it elsewhere.",3.0 out of 5 stars,It is great to be able to read or study while she ...

    ","I own four pairs of these, and use them frequently.  They are parked in various rooms with TVs at residences of mine and my sweeties. GEnerally I like them a lot, but only after I modified them. There are, some significant both pros and cons with these:Pros:These are exceptionally comfortable headphones, which can be worn without issues for long periods of time.  They fit fine over glasses.The sound from these is superb. Perhaps those who spend $600 to $2000 on insane audiophile headphones might have issues, but as a user of Sennheiser HD 598 corded headphones, and as one who has used a dozen different other headphones, these certainly rank high in the real world of non insanely expensive headphones, included when compared to corded headphones.The radio link range is pretty decent.  Solid sound at 30 feet from the transmitter, and I often (tho not totally consistently) can pick up sound when in many other rooms of my house, including the a floor down from the bedroom transmitter and in the basement.Cons:Insanely, unpardonably STUPID STUPID STUPID ... grossly incompetent user interface design... placement of the power on button right between the up and down volume buttons on the headphone... which one has to reach blindly.  The tiny blip on the power button does not help at all, and the buttons are otherwise flush with each other.  One WILL time and again turn off the headphones when trying to adjust the volume.Note that it's a bad design in the first place to use multiple tap up and down volume buttons instead of a continuously moving knob or disk (whether analog or digital behind the knob is not the issues... it's the feel of a knob or disk that is the issue).  But can live with press up and press down buttons, even tho I don't like them, but NOT with the power button put between the two and a requirement to reach for the buttons blindly.On all four of the ones I own I opened them up, soldered wires to the power on button, installed an alternative button off to the side, and cut out the actuator plastic pad for the power on button. Now I can trivially feel where the up and down buttons are and never hit the power button accidentally.  Sadly, few consumers of this product have the skill and experience needed to do this (admittedly relatively simple) electronic tinkering task.A less serious criticism for most users, I still am disappointed that these lack a Left-RIght balance control, which is nice for those who have hearing loss and for whom hearing is significantly different between left and right ears.Finally, overall construction, which employs plastic throughout, is less than rugged.  To be fair, I've not had any of my headphones break, but they are obviously easy to break if even mildly abused (as in sitting on them the wrong way).Thus, if you can live with (or in the case of the power button, FIX) the flaws, this is a very good-sounding, very very comfortable wireless headphone.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound, Exceptionally comfortable, good wireless range, but some seriously poor design in other areas."

    ","As a former owner to RS130 the 160 is not much of an improvement especially the price difference.Sound (edge to RS160)RS130 - will create noise if positioned a certain way (especially lying down on leftside), the sound is great. The surround portion is really noticeable.RS160 - has a bit better sound clarity, but the surround sound is not that noticeable compared to RS130.Ergonomics (edge RS130)RS130 -  the ear padding feels just great and can listen for hours without feeling I have to take off the headset.  I think even Chuck Norris could kick a few bosses while listening to music or movies with this headset.RS160 - The ear padding gets hot....i don't mean lukewarm I mean really hot - I cannot make through a movie without at least giving my ears some air.Controls (huge edge to RS130)RS130 - The controls with the volume dial makes it very easy to adjust volume and can do so without taking off headset. I especially like the on/off being on the otherside again noticeable difference compared to RS160.RS160 - The controls are simply the WORST thing on this headset - they are too close together...They put the power button inbetween the volume controls -- You have to take off the headset to even know which one is which....bad design. simply horrible.Overall wireless, connectivity etc...RS130  - came with a charging station you simply place the headphone onto and it charges.....works great.  I started with two RS130's but down to one after about 2 years...don't know what happened to the other maybe shorted because I noticed the electical line cracked and might have shorted it. the electrical lines are the worst thing about this as they are skinny much more than models they are rail thin... The distance is pretty decent can go to parts of the house without issue ...but you will know the farther you walk the loud the noise.RS160 - Seem to be built pretty solid and come with two parts a receiver and a headset...you have to plug in the headset instead of placing it on a self charge stand and the power receiver.  All - in - all this is fine except that to turn off the headset fully without battery drainage you must turn off the receiver too.Note: the RS130 were discontinued which is sad as they were great headsets and would buy it again in a heartbeat, but the RS160 are an OK replacement for about $50 more than I paid for the RS130.  I would look into the RS180 but that price they better come encased in platinum and have corinthian leather for luxury feel around the ears.",3.0 out of 5 stars,RS130 vrs RS 160 head to head

    ","I bought this unit to replace the existing RS120 that I have which wear out from everyday use. The unit's instructions are absolute crap so I went to Youtube for a better take. Found out I needed an earphone Female plug to 2 RCA male plug adapter. WENT TO THE STORE. What I found was a male earphone to 2 male RCA Adapter and nothing else (and it worked). Once I plugged everything in and figured out how make it work it worked very well. The first thing I noticed  is the sound is much better but the range of the headphones is about 1/3 what the old pair was. Also note that the packaging is basically bomb proof and very hard to get the item out of the box with out breaking the unit.What to improve: Try including all the parts you need, don't make the packaging bomb proof and include instructions. This means in a readable font and size. Also I am not in France, the Czech Republic or Panama or the many, many languages you include. Also if you are going to make the writing that small, please include a microscope. Other than the lost range it works very well.Update:At first I liked these. The sound quality was better than the Senn. RS120s that I replaced. Lately they have become very glitchy, and I often have resist the urge to tear them apart with my bare hands and then throw them against the wall. The range is about a third of the RS120s. Ordered the now obsolete RS120s again. I just need to be able to hear the TV with out stunning small mammals, and keeping everyone awake at night.

    ","I would rate the sound quality itself for these headphones as upper midrange. They could use just a touch more bass, but clarity and overall sound is great. I will agree with other reviewers that the range is not as good as advertised and I don't understand Sennheiser advertising this product as convenient for carrying around. If you want something like that, grab a bluetooth headset.NOW for the deal breaker (for me). I bought these to use in a home recording studio. Wireless headphones sounded like an awesome break from annoying headphone cables. Alas, there is the tiniest of latencies from the transmitter to the headphones. It's barely noticeably if you're just listening. But when you try to play an instrument along with a click track or other tracks, it will have you all kinds of tangled in confusion. Took us a minute to figure out what exactly was happening. SO if you want these to use for recording, look elsewhere.I gave this 4 stars because my issue is probably true for just about any wireless headphones I'm now realizing, and the actual quality of these as normal headphones is 4/5 stars in my opinion. I kept them as they're great for wearing around the house during the day when I don't want to annoy my neighbors with loud music!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality, latency makes it no good for studio applications"

    ","great system for watching TV late at night without disturbing the family.  I sometimes get home late from work (midnite) and need a short movie to unwind.  I just press two buttons and I can watch my movie without waking the family.Just plug the system into your TV audio headphone jack, set your TV preferences (Sony TV), plug into the wall for the recharger.To use, just press the pair button on the headphones and the button on top of the main controller, and you are connected.  Volume is controlled from the headphones.  I can walk around the room, kitchen without audio interruption.The headphones are very comfortable and soft to wear.There is a slight signal interruption if you turn 90 degrees from the TV.  I suppose it might be an antenna orientation issue.  Audio is immediately restored once you face the TV againI like it.

    ","I am not an audiophile, but I did put time into researching headphones when it was time to replace mu current pair.  I'd never owned headphones that last more than a year or two.  I suspect that was purely because I bought crap headphones that looked ""cute"".  I'm older, wiser, and have different needs.When looking for headphones I had some things on my wishlist.  I would be using this at my PC and I would be using them for long periods of time (work and gaming).  Most headphones would make my ears hurt in short period of time and needed and over the ear set.  I have dealt with peeling ear pieces so I wanted to find one with easy replacements and options (I purchased the ""velvet"" RS 180 for this set as a spare).  I did not want a large receiver.  I also did not want sound canceling headphones (say what? Yes, you read that right).  I wanted an adjustable band that had cushioning and flex...and something in a neutral color like black/grey.  I was also looking for something that could get me by for 8-10 without having to charge it and that would still give me sound at about 20 ft away.Many reviews were read, many weeks passed, and eventually I decided to pony up the money and get a decent head set from a reputable brand.  This met all of my expectations, simply put.  It's wireless, I can move around about 35 feet from my location and still hear, it gives (as far as I can tell) great sound.  If someone is talking at me I can still hear enough around me to shift an earpiece off address that person without doing being complete disconnected from the world via noise cancellation (not a popular feature for many people but it is for me).  I have had these for a few weeks now and I never, ever have been uncomfortable wearing them, even with earrings.  I can get as much as 12 hours of use out of them without hooking them up to charge, but I do still need to charge them overnight.  If I am going to spend a weekend gaming then I do need to take break to let them charge.  When I am ready to use them I just put them on, hit the receiver button and then the button on my headset.My only qualms are things I didn't even consider or that came to light as I used them.  I cannot use them while charging it seems.  So if I am in the middle of something and the battery dies I cannot simply connect the charging cable and keep going.  Also, the charging port is a little tight and require quite a push and pull to hook it up.  Those are my only complaints. They are minor inconveniences I can live with.I hope to get around 4+ years out of these before I need to consider a new pair.  If these perform that long (or longer) I know I will invest in a more expensive pair.  So far, I am very happy.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent pair of headphones that met my needs.

    ","So, let's keep things short and sweet.Pros:- Sound--In short, it's incredible. Crystal clear. I can hear the whispers fine, and the bass doesn't overpower everything else during a movie. Then again, Sennheisers are known for their great sound quality, so I'm not too surprised.- Signal--I feel like I kind of addressed this with the sound part, but there is absolutely no hiss with these, and I've walked quite a ways away--okay, twenty to twenty-five--with no degradation in sound quality.- Comfort--Plan on binging a season or two of your favorite show, this weekend? If so, get these. They are, without a doubt, the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. The ear cups are ridiculously soft, the headband clamps just enough to stay put, and the build is surprisingly light. I've worn these for almost half a day before without once needing to take a break. This alone makes them worth the price.- Battery Life--Bear in mind, these don't have a cradle on which to charge. A cable plugs directly into one side. Now, when I use mine, I usually just set them beside my chair. No plugging them in, no charging. Because honestly, they don't need it. I plug mine in maybe once every two months with moderate use, and they're fine.Cons:- Build--I know I said I like the light build--and I do--but comfort comes with a trade-off here. These just don't feel like a pair of headphones you could throw in a checked bag for your flight to Japan, and be completely confident they'd come out in one piece. They don't feel cheap, but they do feel somewhat delicate.And finally, for those thinking the price should be a con for whatever reason, let me say this--I also have a couple pairs of Sony MDR-IF245RK headphones I bought before these for about sixty-five dollars, and the extra fifty-five I spent on the Sennheisers was well worth it. The MDRs hiss, they lose their signals at something like seventy degrees from the front, they don't get much distance, and their comfort level is about a tenth of these. Which isn't to say the MDRs are HORRIBLE, of course. They're great for the price. But these are phenominally better.I'd say spend the money if you have it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spend the money if you have it

    ","The Sennheiser RS 160 Digital Wireless Headphones have crisp, clean sound without hiss or interference.  They have good range as well: I maintained excellent signal 30 feet away and through two walls when I took them through my house, and the KLEER technology kept the sound nice and clean.  I experienced no disconnections or transmission background noise (i.e., static) associated with broadcast silence as reviewers have noted with other headphones.The base unit is powered by either optional AA batteries or an included AC adapter with built-in splitter that will also recharge the headphones, which are powered by included rechargeable Eneloop AAA batteries.  According to the manual, the base unit will switch to AC when using the adapter, and will not charge batteries in it, regardless of the type used. The manual also warns against using the headphones with non-rechargeable batteries and plugging it into the charger (which is a no-brainer for most people familiar with rechargeable battery devices, but may not be obvious to everyone).The headphones are reasonably comfortable but not perfect, and have supple, synthetic material on the circumaural cushions that may cause some people to sweat if wearing them for long periods of time.  I have no problem wearing them with glasses.The build quality is good, though not as good as my Sony MDR-DS6500.  I would have bought another set of the Sonys, but was swayed by Wirecutter's choice of the RS 160s as their top headphone pick last year.  The 160s cost eighty-five dollars less than the Sony headphones at the time of this review and are adequate for simple TV viewing, but do not have the 7.1 surround sound some purchasers might want.  They are strictly stereo.The one thing I would have liked would have been a charging stand like that included with the Sony headphones.  Sennheiser has a stand/cradle with other models such as the 165s, but not the 160s.Overall, these are good headphones at this pricepoint ($115 when purchased in Feb 2015) if you're happy with stereo and don't need a charging cradle. They sound great, have excellent range, no static, and adequate build quality.  The Sennheiser RS 160 Digital Wireless Headphones are a keeper.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sennheiser RS 160 is a keeper for good, clean RF stereo sound"

    ","They are the best headphones  I have ever owned! The sound quality is amazing, crystal clear, and you can hear every detail of a song. The head cushions are exceptionally comfortable you can wear them for a long period of time and not get sore.  The range is awesome too I left my phone downstairs and went all the way up into my master bathroom and could still hear the music with no weak signal. The only thing that I would complain about is it doesn’t say that  what looks like the headphone charger is actually the transmitter. So you have to plug-in the transmitter into any device that you were listening to in order for your headphones to receive the Sound. So if you were planning on listening to music with your phone in your pocket you have to also have the disk plugged into your phone with it.  That is my only complaint, I read all the reviews and questions and no one ever said that so just wanted to make sure that everyone is informed. In short they do not have Bluetooth connectablity.",5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING!! Just one thing

    ","Since I live in a house with my parents and grandparents, who both go to bed much earlier than I do, and we have really thin walls, I had been thinking for quite awhile about getting a pair of wireless headphones to use with my TV, so that I wouldn't keep my family awake. Because I couldn't afford to spend a little more money and get a good pair, and I didn't want a cheap pair that broadcast through FM transmission (the sound and signal quality are usually quite poor), I hadn't really seriously started looking at them until a little before my tax refund came in. Well, I was so glad that my tax refund allowed me to spend a little more money and get what I really wanted. I looked at these and the more expensive RS 170s and RS 180s. I chose these, as I could not bring myself to spend $230+ on headphones, and I also love the portability you get with these. I am so thrilled with my purchase. The sound quality is superb, with crisp lows and highs and mids. I find that my TV shows really come alive with them and have even started using these as my music listening headphones as well. They are also very comfortable. I have worn them for hours at a time with no discomfort at all. The signal quality is terrific as well, with perfect clarity pretty much anywhere inside the house. The Kleer technology has also eliminated the constant hum and static that tend to be problematic in cheaper wireless headphones. The setup was very simple, and I also love that they come with adapters for 4 different countries, so they can be used around the world.There are a couple minor negatives. The first is the build quality. I would like to have seen a metal headband adjustment mechanism, and they feel a tad flimsy to me, considering they are about $115 (plus tax), but should hold up if they are taken care of. Also, I was not a fan of the packaging. Now don't get me wrong, the presentation was very nice, but it was almost impossible to get into. I ended up putting some minor scratches on either side of the headband when I was trying to cut it open. These are minor negatives however, and the positives far outweigh them. If you are looking for looking for a good pair of wireless headphones that can be used with a non Bluetooth device such as a TV, look no further. These are worth every penny.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Headphones!!!

    ","There are good and bad points with this purchase and I'll start with my initial observations. The packaging as some have mentioned before is unlike the newer models of headphones with a box and plastic casing that easily opens up (Basing experience from RS 195) but those hard plastic cases where you need to cut around to be able to access the contents inside. It was a pain to open and it'll take a bit of time. Once I took the headphones out I noticed that one of the top cushions to the head wasn't entirely stuck on but was loose in the middle. I had to push it back on to make it normal again. I've used the RS 160 or ""HDR 160"" just for the headphones for around 14 hours now and that cushion will get loose from time to time. Your mileage may vary as I probably got a dud cushion.These headphones are light and the material is mostly plastic and mine had a little mark on the bottom so it's very possible to scratch them if you're too rough on them. The glassy part on the outer ear cup looks good though. The transmitter matched the ""HDR 160's"" as it also had the black glossy design. After the 16 hour initial charge I was ready to try them out and making the connection with the transmitter and HDR 160's was very easy. It really is plug and play as they say.So the very first time I used the RS 160 it was to watch music videos on TV and I was impressed with the sound as the detail seemed to pop and became clearer than the other headphones that I've used in the past. The high frequencies are really good to hear instruments. It also makes sword fights more exciting as you hear the loud ""Clang"" clearly. At first I thought the volume couldn't be turned up really high as the volume knob on the transmitter is already at or near max and the volume on the headphones are maxed already as I heard a beep. Then I realized the TV volume can turn it up even more and is most likely because the 3.5mm cable is connected on the TV's headphone jack. That's good news however, if the volume is turned up too high you will notice some noise similar to a hiss but not sounding exactly like it. Turning the volume down helps but I'd rather not have to do that. When watching a Blu Ray TV Show recently that 'noise' is a different kind of noise from when I watched a Blu Ray movie and it's a bit weird.. like hearing some internal noise (hard to describe). It's possible the analog signal is making this noise more obvious but I still need to wait for my converter to arrive before I can test and see if a digital signal eliminates this problem. Though watching normal TV is fine and isn't as easy to hear any noise.As I mentioned earlier, I've used the headphones for about 14 hours now and I read it could last for around 20 so that's a pretty long lasting battery which is great for wireless. A negative is that it doesn't have a charging stand like the newer models which provides convenience by holding the headphones and charging them at the same time. Instead you'll need to use the split cable to connect the transmitter and headphones. Also the ear cup material is a standard for Sennheiser and while wearing glasses and then moving them or adjusting the ear cups could make squeaky noises which is annoying to me at least.A negative that is really new is the pricing that I found out about today. It seems that Amazon suddenly has some stock of their own and also slashed the prices which means I bought the RS 160 two weeks too early. That's about $25 USD including shipping so not stoked about that.Update (5th January 2018) - Initial charge gives an impressive 32 hours. Usage after 2nd charge drops to around 20 hours though for some reason.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Perfect But Sound Is Good Quality.
13,"on October 21, 2016",,"I owned audiophile grade wired Sennheiser phones before for decades, now need a wireless phone and looking for possibly better sound than bluetooth, which I am not super happy with. Exclusively for classical music, mainly chamber. Having used this set for several weeks, these are my thoughts.Sound--on par with my Sony bluetooth (MDR ZX 770), no better, no worse.  Normal non-exaggerated base.  (Thumping base would be deal breaker for me).  No statics, but instead drop outs (not often enough to be a nuisance) either from interference or distance from transmitter.Controls--more straight forward than Sony, but lacks forward and backward skip (major inconvenience).  Also buttons are too flat for touch identification.  Transmitter has volume control, somewhat redundant.  Gladly trade this for skip function on headset. No noise cancellation but occlusive enough to exclude most ambient sound.Comfort--good, on par with Sony. One of the two pads on the headband fell off, due to weak adhesive, easily put back, no big deal.Value--Sony would be a better deal.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"OK product, mildly disappointed, expectation raised by too much hype"

    ","I'm slightly larger than average at 6'+ and these RS 160's completely cover my ears and are extremely comfortable to wear for extended periods. Their frequency response is nearly flat across its entire rated range. They have good clean bass (may not be enough for some listeners), solid clear mids and crisp accurate highs without being overly bright or hissy. They also have very good spatial presence even though they lack any true surround feature.These RS 160's are just a pleasure to use and they are a very cost effective set of wireless over-the-ear cans that do great justice to both audio and home theater applications. They don't come with a carrying case but do come with enough charger outlet options to satisfy any world traveler. They also come with a 3.5mm M-M cable extender and a charging unit splitter cable for the cans and the base.I'm not a paid reviewer, just a guy looking for the best bang for my buck. I've tried a few of the Bluetooth headsets but have been unimpressed by the technology bandwidth and the relatively high price of the current offerings that have tended to sound pretty poor overall.I have the RS 170's ordered to arrive later today and will compare them to these. Frankly, at nearly double the cost, the 170's are going to have to pull some pretty special rabbits out of their hat to be as good a value as the 160's. I'll post a review after a thorough comparison over the weekend.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best Bang For The Buck!

    ","The background for this review is as follows: I am an older male who has a hard time hearing all of the dialog on my television and even turned up it doesn't always help and it does bother my wife when loud. I have a new Vizio M series that I drive through an Onkyo for surround sound and both are connected through an ARC connection. The Vizio has an Optical Audio Out which was not being used. I drive everything through an HDMI cable. I purchased this headphones with a dbtech DAC. So Optical Audio Out cable which came the dbtech DAC attaches the Vizio and the converter. The analog out from the DAC is attached to the transmitter for the Sennheiser. It took me longer to open the plastic clamshell packaging for the headphones than to get everything attached and a digital connection with the transmitter/headphones. In fact, after I put the rechargeable batteries in the headphones the handshake was completed before I got a chance to press any buttons to begin the process. The sound is great in the speakers, the surround sound system still functions for everyone else. It doesn't make any difference if I am watching Satellite television, PS3 movies or music from the WIFI connections on the Vizio. All are crystal clear. This is a great setup for those with hearing loss as well as anyone wanting to listen in the quiet. Great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"For Older Listners with some hearing loss, here is your solution with quality."

    ","This headphone has the best sound quality in all the wireless headsets I have used, but unfortunately the bad usability made me return it.1. The buttons on the headphone were designed and built poorly. It is hard to know when you properly pressed them, especially when the batteries are dead, so I would press the on button again and don't know whether I just turned it off again or it is just the battery, very frustrating.2. Battery life sucks. only last about 2-3 hours, and it doesn't give you any indication of the battery life, so the only way to make this thing usable is to keep freshly charged AAA batteries available all the time, anytime when the headset can't be turned on, put the new batteries in.3.

17,"on February 19, 2016",,"These headphones are great.  Purchased them to watch TV at night without disturbing anyone else. They are comfortable and offer great sound quality. We also purchased the HDR160 secondary headphones and we needed the Y cable to hook them up to our TV.The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is the instructions.  The instructions come in 10 languages that are not very clear at all.  I couldn't get more than 1 set to sync up. Until I figured it out. Then I was able to sync 3 headsets to one receiver.  Here are basic instructions to syncing these up:Once  RS 160 RF is hooked up, hold down the power button on top of the receiver for 7-8 seconds, until it's flashing ( I count to 10 slowly)Turn on the HDR 160 by holding down the power button on the headset for 7-8 seconds, until it's flashing fast.Wait until both sets blink or flash at the same time and speed, this is about one blink every 2-3 seconds apart.  Now you should be able to watch the same show on both headphones.This is where it gets tricky, sometimes the headphones just turn on, but don't flash fast, therefore don't sync up. Sometimes the receiver turns on but doesn't flash  (or blink) fast.  This is the key point, if they don't sync up you have to turn both units off and start over.Once they sync up it's easy to use on a regular basis.

    ","My wife has trouble hearing dialog on the TV clearly. Our purpose with this purchase was to replace a set of TV Ears that were uncomfortable for her to wear and that required infrared to work. This Sennheiser headset fills this purpose beyond our expectations!Without going into a lot of technical mumbo jumbo, this device is easy to set up and sounds great. Even better, it works independently of the TV sound. I can turn the volume up or down on the TV without affecting the volume in the headphones. They are lightweight, comfortable to wear, sound great and are easy to use.This headphone uses rechargeable batteries located in each earpiece. (The batteries are provided in the box.) The ear pad turns counterclockwise to remove it and reveal the battery location. When they stop being functional, which based on my experience with rechargeable batteries will be a very long time, they can be easily and inexpensively replaced.The other thing I really appreciate is that these headphones use a technology called Kleer, which at the time of purchase I was unfamiliar with. They do not use or need infrared. That means they work perfectly in our entertainment center, even with the glass door closed! That's a major improvement over TV Ears.I can't speak to how the sound compares to, say, Beats, but for our purpose, which was to allow my wife to listen to the TV clearly, they score 100%. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife loves these headphones
19,"on July 23, 2015",,"I've had the Sennheiser RS120 earphones that I bought used. When they finally quit working I looked for the RS140 to replace them since I also had those that I really liked. Both of those were analog earphones. Unable to find them, I reluctantly bought the digital RS160. Fantastic improvement in sound quality. However the range, though quite acceptable, was less. I had become used to the range on the 120 that allowed me to listen to the TV anywhere in my house and even when I went to the mailbox. The 160 is good nearby the den where the TV is but not through the house.A major complaint I have for all Sennheiser earphones is the volume controls, and particularly the RS160. Not being able to, of course, see the controls while wearing them and with my fat, clumsy fingers, it is difficult to find the correct button to raise or lower the volume. One reason I like earphones for watching TV is that with my hearing impairment I need to turn the dialogue up but hat the loud music, so I am constantly adjusting the volume as I watch. A simple solution for earphones like the RS160 that has separate buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume is to have the two volume buttons separated & preferably isolated from other buttons. Hopefully Sennheiser will read this review and implement such a design change. My difficulty with the volume controls is the main reason for four stars instead of five. The other reason is that I have to switch the transmitter on every time I use the earphones. Since the transmitter is powered through an electrical outlet, not batteries, a hard on/off switch would IMO be better.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but could have better controls

    ","Fits well, comfortable, doesn't hurt the ears at all. Sound is good, and very importantly, volume can be adjusted on the headphones themselves. The base is tiny, but I've read other reviews where they claim the base is huge, which makes me think the reviewers never actually used the RS 160, and are really just the competition posting fake reviews. In any case, I have this hooked up to my LG 47LB5800 (no analogue audio out or 3.5 mm jack) via toslink cable and the ***Orei DA21X Premium Optical SPDIF/Coaxial Digital to RCA L/R Analog Audio Converter with 3.5mm Jack Support Headphone/Speaker Outputs*** thus circumventing the need to buy an audio receiver or use a cable box.It's not the sturdiest unit out there, though if you don't manhandle it or carry it around in a backpack cammed with junk, it shouldn't break on you too easily.There's no charge base, so you need to either plug it up to AC, or put the batteries in a recharger.It was a toss up between this or one of the turtle beach sets, and every review I read had the RS 160 way ahead, so I pulled the trigger and two days later they were on my back porch. I think I made the right choice.",4.0 out of 5 stars,I recommend Sennheiser to everybody because their stuff is premium

I like music in the early and late hours but don't want to disturb the household. These work fine for that purpose. Haven't tested the range; more than adequate for my 12 x 14 foot office. Work best with controls set flat on the system. + treble = tinny and harsh; + midrange = flat and lifeless; + bass = rampant distortion. Otherwise sound quality is good or better. The small buttons are a bit hard to find and operate, but I use the remote for my system to control volume anyway. The 'phones accept enough gain to hit the upper threshold of my comfort level with no distortion. They're comfortable and easy to adjust for fit.

23,"on July 7, 2017",,"For my purposes, this model is vastly superior to the replacement model RS 165. The low rise of the transmitter means I can place it in front of the TV without blocking the TV, and it takes up little space on a limited surface area.

(The batteries recharge in place without need of removing them from the headphones.)The sound is perfectly adequate for my needs. My main use is to be able to watch TV without disturbing others that may be trying to sleep. I also like the clarity of words through headphones. The headphones are reasonably comfortable out of the box. I would prefer slightly larger ear-pads, but these don't give me any problems.The only real drawbacks have been mentioned in other reviews. The transmitting station powers off automatically after a number of hours. Meanwhile the headphones don't, draining the batteries. Further, it can be difficult to tell if the headphones are on or off. No doubt with practice it gets easier. I wish they had a hardware volume dial, but it seems basically no one has that.

This isn't usually a problem, but there are some shows that I watch that would wake my wife up while she was trying to sleep.  There is limited room in this recessed section, so some of the other wireless headphones I had found were too large on the base, and required the headphones to sit on the base to charge, which just wasn't going to work for me.  It took me a while, but I found these Sennheiser RS 160 headphones and thought they would work considering that the base is small and the headphones don't need to sit on the base to charge, and I was correct!  They have fantastic sound and cancel out surrounding sound fairly well.  They get about a 30 foot range before they start to crackle out, but this is plenty enough for me to use the restroom or go to the kitchen and make a snack without having to take them off or loose any reception.  There are volume controls on the headset as well as a mute function.  They are very comfortable for extended wear, and I often fall asleep in the recliner with them on.  The power cord for the base is also the charging cord for the headphones, so they will need to be in a place where the headphones can rest on a surface near to the base.  The cord splits, so the base can be powered and the headphones can be charging at the same time.  I have my base placed under the TV in the recessed area and charge the headphones just in front of the TV and it works very well.

    ","First off, let me explain what I didn't like, since previous reviews are mostly positive.The rechargeable batteries these come with take 16 hours to charge for the first time. In an age of instant gratification and short attention spans, this seriously detracts from the overall package. Honestly, who has time to wait 16 hours to set anything up?Another gripe I had was that there was no ""quick start guide"" or directions in lay-man's terms on how to get things working, just a CD enclosed with the headphones. Sure, I was able to figure it out, but it might be helpful for the less technically adept consumer to have the order in which you have to  turn things on explicitly stated (first the music source, then the transmitter, then the receiver).Other than that, these are great. Transmission and sound quality are great, the ear cups are comfortable, and everything seems to work well.Despite the fact that these are obviously going to be musically inferior to the RS-170 & 180 models which cost a whole lot more, the smaller wireless base makes the whole package much more portable, and even mobile if you wish to stick AA batteries into the transmitter.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality, wireless, and portable."

My biggest complaint with a couple of other more expensive phones that had leather earmuff pads was that the leather disintegrated after only a few months' use. Won't happen with these, because the earmuffs are covered with a very comfortable and flexible (yet durable) plastic. One has to unscrew the ear cups to change out the batteries, but that's not a hardship. The remote transmitter is quite effective over a surprisingly long distance, and using the on-off control button is straightforward.

    ","In the Amazon product description in the section provided from the manufacturer, it states ""Selectable Dynamic Bass Boost delivers deep, slamming bass response on demand, while Selectable Surround Sound simulation provides immersing depth for a state-of-the-art movie theater experience."" Here it does not specify which model(s) has this feature and the same exact sentence is found in the description of the Sennheiser RS 170's. Thinking both models had these features, I opted for the RS 160's only to find out that it does not have either feature. The Bass Boost and Surround Sound features are only on the RS 170 model, not the 160.Aside from this, in the couple hours I tried out the headphones out of the box (before realizing the mistake), they sounded pretty good. Very crisp and clear, but noticeable that they needed a fair amount of break-in time before having a more fully developed sound. The wires connecting the transmitter to an outlet, and to your audio device, and to your headphones (when charging) can get a little cumbersome, but when charged up and in use they work well and it's great to be able to move freely without worrying about getting tangled up as with conventional wired headphones. The headband on these seemed slightly uncomfortable (due to the hard plastic in between the two pads still making some resting contact at the top of the head)--a poor design in my opinion. Why not opt for the fully padded headband for a premium brand like Sennheiser? One may never know. But they're not terribly uncomfortable, it's just a minor nuisance that most would probably grow accustomed too.One last note, the packaging is horrible. Get out the box cutter, industrial sheers, buzzsaw, whatever you need, and have some band-aids on hand for the sharp plastic as you try to finally pry open the small sections you managed to cut into.I'm returning my 160's to get a pair of 170's instead. Still expecting the comfort issue to be present (and looking forward to another round against the impenetrable packaging), but hopefully the Dynamic Bass and Surround Sound features--along with the other minor positive trade-offs--are worth the heftier price tag. Wish there were better wireless headphone alternatives that could match the sound quality of Sennheiser. Maybe some day.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon description is wrong
31,"on July 3, 2014",,"These are the lowest-cost headphones I could find that use KLEER technology, and at about $130 shipped it's a pretty big investment .  You can look up the details of KLEER if you want specifics but the bottom line is take all the cheaper RF, bluetooth and IR-based headsets and throw them in the garbage can.  There's just no comparison.First, as the name implies KLEER just sounds levels better than those other technologies, with the exception of maybe bluetooth.  There's no background hiss like on IR and RF sets and sound quality is excellent, rivaling high quality wired sets.Range was generally excellent and superior to everything but RF, but the max ""usable"" range of RF is not as good as this set, which is around 40 - 75 feet depending on obstructions.  This set will start to cut out entirely when it gets to its max range, whereas  RF will start to get overly hissy and static-y (i.e. degrade) as you get too far from the base station.  If you want decent sound from RF, you need to stay within 30 feet with no walls between you and the base station.  Thus, KLEER still wins.As for this particular set, despite being the cheap and cheerful entry, the sound is good to excellent depending on the source material.  I played some base-heavy techno and these headphones deliver so much bass they actually vibrate and I had to EQ things down a bit.  The bass is slightly boomy but tighter than your average consumer set that just tries to push out as much bass at the expense of sound quality. The mids and highs are also solid but also a bit brassy.  Ideally you are hooking these to your home theater receiver so you can make adjustments as needed.These headphones can get pretty darn loud if you need them because you're hard of hearing.  In fact, I got them for my dad because he now watches TV with the subtitles on, or with the volume cranked (neighbors have complained).  My mom is going to love me for getting these for my dad.  And the neighbors are going to think they sold the house.These seem pretty comfortable though the padding on top of the headband could start to annoy during long viewings.  They're an over-the-ear style and quite bulky, but that's not a bad thing necessarily for their intended use.  While wearing, the pads don't really press on your ears at all.  They rest against your brain cage proper.  Turned off, they block quite a bit of outside sound.I can't comment on long-term durability because I only just got them, however, some of the pivot joints and adjustment points do feel a bit on the cheap side.  If you accidentally sit on them you can probably kiss them goodbye.All in all, as the ""low-cost"" entry into this technology this is a great set of headphones.  If you're debating spending $80 - 100 on other headphones, I recommend you save the extra cash and go with these.  The step up is definitely worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,and at about $130 shipped it's a pretty big investment

    ","Review Updated on 5/11/16:I have used the headphones almost daily as I live with my parents and they get really annoyed when I use my speakers. That is about 1000 days of 1/2 hour to 4 hours of usage.These are great wireless headphones from sennheiser.-----------------------Pros:1-Sound quality is amazing for a wireless headphone. It sounds alot better than the Bose Bluetooth headphones that I own and some sound systems I have heard. The base is very strong during base heavy music but does not muddy up the rest of the music. This is a huge issue I noticed in many high end portable speakers and in many stock car audio systems. The mids sound clear and powerful. The highs sound great also.1.5- These are closed back headphones so others should not hear the sound. I notice that some sound leaks out and others nearby can hear can some of the sound.1.6- There is no static. These sound like good quality wired headphones.2- These headphones are very comfortable as they have a lot of padding and they are loose. I can wear them for a couple of hours.  -I have found many headphones to be tight including a set of portable Bluetooth sennheiser headphones that I used to own. I have replaced the portable headphone with the Bose Bluetooth headphones which are more comfortable. I have also turned down other headphones in the past due to them being too tight and uncomfortable.  -The downside with loose headphones is that they can fall off your head if you move around a lot. These headphones are best for sitting at a desk or couch. NOT working out or doing yard work.2.5- The pads on the headphones are removable. This is good as you can buy replacements if they become damaged. I am noticing some small tears on mine. This is not unexpected considering how much I use them.3- range is pretty good. You can walk around the house and still have perfect reception. you may not receive good reception if you take the headphones outside.4-the transmitter runs off of A/C power or 2 AA batteries which make it versatile. Also there is an additional volume control on it. this may be confusing at first but it became handy for me. I use my headphones with my A/V receiver when i don't want the speakers playing. i like to leave my receiver on a specific for the speakers (which is medium) while the headphones i like on low. the volume knob on the headphone's transmitter lets me adjust the volume outside of the receiver so i can leave my just receiver on medium and yet have a different volume coming in to my headphones.5- This headphone uses any AAA(2) you want to use. I purchased 4 high quality enloop rechargeable AAAs. I keep the extra two on a charger so I can swap them easily when the one on my headphone discharges (typically weekly).6- Value. I purchased them used for $160 used. Now they are $85 used or $110 used. WOW. I never have seen high quality wireless headphones for a low price. I have seen lower priced wireless headphones (I'm not talking about Bluetooth) but they were complete garbage. They were stiff, extremely uncomfortable, and had terrible sound (static sounds and poor sound quality). Don't buy the cheaper ones.--------------------Cons:1-the headphones do not automatically shut off when they are hooked up to an A/V receiver after not being used for a while even after the AV receiver is no longer turned on. This is a HUUUUUUGGGEEE pain because if you forget to turn off the headphones the battery will wear down.1.5- Once a week I go to watch a video and the sound cuts out. This means I have to stop what I am doing and change the batteries right away. I am starting to wish I got the model with the charging base.2- I the past I said the controls were nice to have. The controls on here are volume up, down, and power. These controls are terrible as its tough to pick out each button by touch. The volume down is almost impossible to find by touch. I use the controls on my keyboard and receiver to control the volume as its a lot easier.3- I was tired of just having my headphones lay around on my desk when I am not using them. They get in the way sometimes. I ended up getting a nice aluminum headphone stand. I could have avoided the additional purchase by buying a higher end model as they come with a stand.-----------------Overall:These are great sounding and comfortable wireless headphones best used at home for a TV or Computer.I hope you found my review helpful. I almost never write a review or spend this much time when I do but I use and like these headphones so much I figured I would do a long review this time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds great and is a good value

    ","I expected good things from these headphones, and I wasn't disappointed. The base unit plugs in to my receiver's headset jack (with a 1/4"" adapter that I provided) and I didn't have to do much tweaking before I was up and running.Before I get on with the rest of my review of the product, the ""except""... Each of the headphones houses one AAA battery, which you have to install before you can use the system. On my unit, one of the tabs holding the battery cover on to the headphone was snapped prior to opening. Fortunately, there are several tabs, and it's a rotating mechanism to lock the cover on; I won't be using these in any kind of active way, so I don't figure I'll break any more - it works unless another one breaks.Now on to the rest...Performance: Bass response is excellent but not overpowering, and treble and midrange are nice and clear; I'd rate it among the best headphones I've owned. (Though I've never gone out and purchased reference headphones, I don't buy cheap, either...) There's no hiss like on an analog wireless headphone - just crystal clear digital happiness. I'm using it in a living room, so no complaints about the short range of the digital transmission from me. Note that these are closed headphones, and they have a definite muting effect on surrounding noise - you don't want to wear these anywhere that you need to hear your surroundings.Power: The base can be run on battery or on (supplied) power adapter (with multiple tip adapters for various countries). The headphones run on rechargeable battery; for this unit, the headphones recharge by plugging the base unit adapter into the headphones instead - no fancy charging dock, which is a bit inconvenient but not bad so long as your base transmitter isn't buried somewhere. You have to power off the base and headphones separately - a press-and-hold until the light turns constantly green does the trick.Controls and Adjustments: There are volume controls on both the base unit and the headphones, which might cause some confusion - if either the base or the headphone volume are set too low, you might get the mistaken impression that these headphones don't work well. Volume on the base unit is controlled via a knob on the back near the power jack. Volume on the headphones is via a pair of buttons located low on the side of one of the headphone speakers, with the power button located between them. With the base unit volume set in the middle, my RS160 headphones are about the same perceived volume as my speakers. My wired headphones provide about 10dB more volume than the RS160 at this setting, which is significant - but by turning the base unit volume up a bit less than full I was able to match the two sets (though I think having the receiver provide the extra volume makes for a richer, cleaner sound). I find the control buttons on the headphones to be inconveniently located and do not plan to use them; I set the main receiver volume via remote, so I don't need the controls on the headphones anyway.Conclusion: A great set of headphones without the extra bling that you might not want. No dynamic bass enhancement, no simul-surround, no recharge dock - but wow, what a sound.  (Note: the current Amazon product info says this unit has dynamic bass and simul-surround - if it does, I haven't found the buttons to do that, and the quick start guide doesn't mention it.) The only reasons to upgrade to the RS180 in my mind are the convenience of the docking cradle and the open headphone design.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"An exceptional wireless headphone system, except..."

    ","I love these headphones.  This is the second set i bought and I got it for my bedroom TV.  I found I was jacking up the volume at night and  I liked the first set so much, I bought a second set.  I live in the land of the barking dogs and these help so much to cut that noise. They are comfortable and the sound is amazing.  I can hear my TV ok in the living room but I found I was using closed caption on a lot of shows, especially British dramas that I like, to get all of the dialogue.  With these headphones, I can make out everything that is being said without having to read it.  The range is really good, too.  I can get up and move around and still not miss anything being said.

Unfortunately, we had issues with volume to the point that we both had to turn volume down to the point that neither of us could really hear a program.  I added these to one TV and the problem was solved immediately.  The sound is better that the TV speakers.  They connect to the transmitter fast and reliably.  I probably get about 3 nights of use on a single charge.  If there is a negative with these, it is that the ear cups can be a be hot at times.

37,"on February 15, 2018",,"Was going to upgrade from the base model 120s since the price on this model has come down but absolutely hate hate hate the design on these! So disappointing because the sound quality is better that the 120s and the portability feature is nice--meant we could have one pair to easily move between different rooms in the house since the transmitter can run off battery or AC. But the pairing of the headphones with the transmitter felt overly complicated (hold the button long enough but not too long) and worst of all, the ""multifunction"" button you have to use on the headphones to turn them on and pair them with the transmitter is in between the volume up and volume down buttons, and they're all flush and tiny so there's absolutely no way to feel which button your hitting while fumbling around to adjust the volume and of course you're most likely to hit the middle button and accidentally turn them off. Can't believe someone thought that was a good idea. They just seem entirely counterintuitive compared to the 120s, hard to believe they're made by the same manufacturer. I'm sure they work fine for some users, but they're definitely not for us. Back they go.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Design fail?
38,"on July 25, 2016",,I bought two of these over the newer version (165's) because I read reviews saying the newer ones weren't made as well. So far these have been very good -- not great. Not great because I get distortion with lower sounds (like blasts or things blowing up while watching movies -- like the latest Star Wars). So I'm kind of disappointed in that regard. Outside of that they work well. I also wish the volume buttons were easier to feel out while on your head. Perhaps the newer versions have solved that problem. I do really like the small and unobtrusive RF base (shaped like a hockey-puck). It's the perfect size to fit behind a solid cabinet door so we don't have wires and headphones stands sitting out all the time. Overall good product. If you are looking for better sound though with movies I'd search for a model with more range which may cost a bit more than this one.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Value!

Crystal-clear transmission of sound from the base station to the headset.My only issue is the relatively cheap build quality. For the price, you might expect more metal than plastic, leather instead of leatherette earpieces. Alas, the headphones are largely plastic, and the earpieces are foam plus a tragically thin leather-like sheeting which is very similar to the kind which, over time, begins to flake away and makes you look like you've got curiously dark dandruff.I really like the sound quality, but the build quality leaves much to be desired. I will consider this next time I'm in the market for Sennheiser headphones.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great functionality, lacking build quality"
41,"on December 13, 2014",,"One of two drawbacks that kept this from being a 5-star review, is that the control buttons are very close together, not raised and not a different color.  That makes them difficult to work for an older person with a more limited sense of touch or vision problems (or both).The other issue is that you cannot walk far from the transmitter and still pick up the signal.  Our previous versions (same brand), you could walk to the other end of the house and it was still clear as a bell.We paid more for these - Sennheiser is an expensive brand name - but know that the product is dependable.  Our older Sennheisers however, have flat ear muffs that press against the ears.  Again for older folks, this can become uncomfortable.  This model works so much better for them, as they are 'shells' that don't touch the ears and the padding is very comfortable.  They are also a bit lighter.One last minor complaint...three of us here find it a bit difficult to get the charger plug into the socket on the headset.

Then I have to go thru this torturous untie, retie, move this here, put that in this hole in order to charge the batteries.  Its clever but not intuitive until you do it four times a week.  I'm sure the batteries would  last a LOT longer if I remember to turn off both headphones and transmitter each time, but who can remember that!  I can't even remember to turn my car off sometimes. Why not have an automatic shut off after five minutes of non-use??  Oh yes, and try controlling volume and pairing with the headphones on...without a mirror and a flashlight! Why not knobs.

43,"on August 24, 2015",,"Very easy to set up.  Comfortable to wear.  Sound is crisp and clear with TV.  Have not used with music.  My criticisms are with the mechanical design of these. I would prefer a rheostat dial to push buttons to control volume.  If you try to adjust volume while wearing the headphones, there's some guess work involved in knowing whether you are feeling the increase or decrease button, or are feeling the on/off button until you've pressed one.  The on/off button sits between the volume buttons, with no spacing between them.  Again, a volume dial would have simplified this a great deal.  In my opinion, this is enough of an issue to pass on this model.Updated Jan 2016:  Still like the sound quality.  Chews up alkaline batteries.

And I presently own probably a dozen pairs or more.  The are comfortable, produce great sound (though this does depend on the input - and I'm not a true 'audiophile' in terms of using high-bit rate MP3s and whatnot, though I do have a good ear).  I use them largely plugged into my surround sound receivers so that I can watch movies or play games after my wife goes to bed without disturbing her.  They last many hours/sessions between charges - so many in fact, that I have yet to be able to accurately gauge just how long since they've never died on me yet.  The range is also phenomenal, I'm able to walk all over my house and garage with these on and not lose signal (the transmitter is in the center of a ~2000sq ft building).The only cons, and they are slight, it that the headset is fairly builky - though it is not heavy and certainly not bigger than other audiophile grade headsets out there - and the wiring arrangement could be better.  What I mean by the wiring arrangement is that they provide an AC adapter that powers the base or charges the headset.  If you want to do both at once, you have to plug in an inline spliter (also provided) to turn the one charging port into two.  While this certainly works, it either means you're stuck changing plugs around any time you want to charge, or you have to have one ""free"" end hanging around any time you're not charging which might be hard to reach if you're putting this in a cabinet.

Also, there is no prominent indicator of the connection, so I have to war the headphones, press the button on the base, run some youtube video to make sound, blindly feel around and press the power button on the headphones and hope it reconnects.

    ","My mother is in her 80s and wears a hearing aid, but still struggles to hear some of the more nuanced sounds in television shows (I have to admit that I do too). I own a set of RS120s and enjoy using them to listen to TV shows because it allows me to hear all the sounds. For Christmas, I bought two sets of RS160s for my mother (one for her living room and one for her bedroom) because I read some really good things about them and, while I really like my RS120s, there is some ""tuning"" in the headsets to the transmitter. I wanted plug and play for her. I have been completely disappointed. The headphones un-pair with transmitter and there doesn't seem to be any combination of button presses that will get them to reliably reconnect. You have to disconnect the power from the base, turn the headset off, reconnect power to the base and then power on the headsets before you can press the buttons to get them to reconnect, far from plug and play. Very poor design. Maybe the sound is better than the RS120s, but I don't think so. The RS120s have better range and are louder. My only beef with the RS120s is the ear pads. The RS160s have over the ear cushions, the RS120s have on the ear pads. I bought a set of replacement RS160 ear cushions and put them on the RS120s. They fit almost perfectly.

    ","I live in a tiny apartment next to sensitive neighbors. I bought these headphones to share between my PC, TV, and iPod. The great thing about this product is the transmitter can be powered by AC (adapter included) or by 2 AA batteries (not included, but I have plenty of NiMH around), so I can move it around easily. The headphones themselves are powered by 2 AAA batteries, and they even include rechargeable Eneloop AAAs which can be charged through the headphones using the same AC adapter as the transmitter (the AC adapter splits so you don't have to unplug it from one to stick it in the other). I'll probably use my standalone charger to keep an extra set of AA and AAAs precharged. I'm not sure what the battery life is yet, but it's pretty long for sure.The audio quality is immaculate. I can't believe how perfect they sound. The Kleer technology uses a 2.4 GHz band, but in my apartment full of wifi devices I didn't have any issues with interference or latency. You can crank the headphones up really loud and the bass is pretty good (perhaps not as bassy as wired headphones, but plenty for my taste). There is a physical volume knob on the transmitter which I leave cranked up all the way and I use the buttons on the headphones to set the level to my liking.The only drawbacks I find are the lack of track play/pause/ff/rew controls (which is impossible to implement since these are audio only, not bluetooth), and I think I look kinda goofy wearing them.

Clarity is there, this is a Sennheiser phone after all. The problem comes when any out of ordinary demands are placed on the drivers for low frequencies. They can rattle from too much bass if you equalize to make up the difference. The base unit is somewhat to blame. It has a limited input and output, I assume, to manage battery life. I can cause the base unit to flash red simply by turning up the input headphone volume to much, which causes audible distortion in the phones. It has great wireless range - even through walls.

    ","I've had the Sennheiser RS 160s for about a week now and each night that I use them and watch more content I appreciate the sound quality more and more. These are not surround headphones, however…The other night, watching Avatar, the sound seemed to be surround, as I could hear sounds off to the side as the character walked by bushes. I had to take off the headphones to make sure. I had a big smile on my face, knowing I made the right purchase. I defiantly wanted to avoid the hiss or interference that other 900Mhz or Analog headphones may cause. These headphones had great reviews so I went with it. You do have to buy the RCA cables to 3.5mm converter, but once you plug that in, get the power cord on, nothing else to it. I charged them for a few hours until the charge light went off, I did notice that the volume buttons seem to me are in reverse order, but not a negative, just need to learn it.The headphones are a bit tight and do get warm, but I think with time I am getting used to it, the sound is just amazing, very clear voices, and during action scenes they are able to produce big sound. Obviously the bass doesn’t rattle the windows like a home theater system, but for night time watching and headphones I am very happy, the gun shots sound deep and crisp when they hit, not like small headphones.

61,"on April 12, 2015",,"If you need to watch tv with headphones, this is the way to go.  I've had several earlier versions of Sennheiser wireless cans, and these have definitely improved on the ones in the past. For one the sound is clearer with much less radio interference.  The disc transmitter leaves a thankfully smaller footprint and I just hide mine behind the TV on the wall.  Charging the batteries is more of a pain this way, but overall I like it better than the old ""hang it on the rack to charge"" type.  Let's be clear, bluetooth headphones would be MUCH better and much more convenient - but they simply aren't an option on most TV/Cable/Sat box setups.

    ","When I first tried these headphones, I was blown away by the audio quality. I had been using mono RF headphones that were always staticy if I wasn't in the the perfect position, and when I put these on I heard sounds and instruments in my TV shows and video games that I had never heard before. No static, no matter how much I moved around.However, I quickly became disappointed, for the following reasons:(1) Although there was no static, the audio would often cut out -- even when I was sitting directly in front of the TV. Presumably this was because there was too much wireless interference, but the amount of wireless signal in my apartment is hardly exceptional: a dual-band wifi network, 2-3 wifi networks from neighboring apartments, a bluetooth keyboard about 30 feet away, and my old mono wireless headset system, operating on a different frequency.(2) The range was not nearly that advertised. In my small 1 bedroom apartment, if I walked into the next room I heard mostly silence rather than music(3) The bulky headphones quickly grew uncomfortable if I wore them for an extended period of time(4) The volume up and volume down buttons are tough to find and distinguish when wearing the headphones, and I couldn't figure out how best to increase / decrease the volume, whether to hold the buttons or tap them repeatedly(5) LEDs on the base station and headphones that were completely unintuitive regarding the status(6) Every time you want to use these headphones, you have to walk over to the base station and turn it on.I ended up returning these and getting the Sony infrared headphones instead. They are 1/3rd the price and have none of the drawbacks listed above. The one downside on the IR headphones vs. these Sennheiser digital ones is that the audio isn't crystal clear, the way it was with the Sennheisers, but it's still very good, and it doesn't cut out the way the Sennheiser ones did for me (presumably because there was too much wireless interference).",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too expensive for the product
63,"on September 1, 2015",,"I have a problem that I have given up trying to beat.I go to sleep with the TV on...this wouldn't be an issue if my wife of 25 years shared the affliction.Our compromise is that she can sleep with the TV light, but not the sound.

64,"on March 27, 2013",,"I ordered these headphones for use mainly while watching TV in bed to keep from disturbing my wife.  I'll have to say that for that purpose they work well.  The sound quality is excellent, the range is more than acceptable, and so far I haven't had any issues with comfort as some previous reviewers have stated.Setup is relatively easy and intuitive if you've ever set up anything audio related.  My particular television has both a 1/8"" headset jack and RCA audio-out jacks.  Using the headset jack defeats the purpose, because plugging something into it will completely mute the TV's speakers.  If my wife wants to hear the TV, she can't.  So, the RCA jacks were the way to go.  You can turn the volume down on the television and still get audio to the transmitter.According to the item listing, there is an RCA to 1/8"" adapter in the box.  Not so.  There are, however, multiple AC configurations for the power adapter.  Those are useless unless you're going to travel with the headphones.  What would be more useful would be to include the RCA adapters, at least in my case.  Wish I could find some way to let Amazon know their listing is incorrect...The major annoyance is that the transmitter will shut off when no audio is sent to it for a short period of time, even when it is plugged in to the AC adapter.  I can see that would be a good feature if it were running on batteries but why turn it off when it's plugged in?  You may think this is a minor issue, but think about this.  If you turn the television off to go to sleep and place the headphones on the nightstand you're going to have to get up and go turn the transmitter on again if you want to resume watching either later that night (insomniacs) or the next morning (early risers).As some reviewers have said, the placement of the ""multi-function"" button that turns the headphones on and off is a little clumsy.  Right between the volume up and volume down buttons on the back side of the right ear cup.  It's going to take some getting used to because to adjust volume or turn the headphones off you just have to learn to ""feel"" the buttons.The ""quick start"" instructions are enough to get set up, but if you want more detail you'll have to insert the included disk into a computer and open a .pdf file.  I copied it to my iPad for easy reference but if you had to read it on a computer it would be awkward.I suppose I'll get used to the quirks and most times remember to turn on the transmitter before going to bed, but that's just poor planning on Sennheiser's part.

I also chose these because there is minimal (if any) noise-bleed.

In order to set the headphones up I had to make a trip to Best Buy and purchase a connecting cable which allowed connection of the transmitter to my television, an additional expense of $ 10.00.In order to listen on the headphones, you must first turn on the transmitter then turn on the headphones.  To recharge the batteries, you must connect a cable to an electrical outlet and hook the headphones to it.  You must do this each and every time you want to recharge the batteries.  Alternatively, you may use AA batteries in lieu of rechargeable batteries but do not plug the headphones into A/C for a charge while these batteries are in the headphones.  You might damage the headphones.An audiophile might think the quality of sound adequately compensates for the hassle of setting up, charging and using these headphbones. But I, for one, disagree.

    ","I'm sorry if this review seems amateur. I admit. I'm no crazy audiophile. I'm just a teenager who likes music. Of course, even I can see that these headphones are wonderful quality compared to the things I've been listening to. When I decided to splurge on a pair of headphones, I decided maybe wireless, because my parents hated me blasting my music.And, I didn't want a pair of ""hipster phones"", because those didn't sound any better then the bad little ten dollar earphones I used and they were...I admit. A little overrated.When I started researching, I started out with Monster beats: The classic choice for teenagers. Despite their glamour and glitz, they were pricey, and when I tried them, I was dissappointed. I don't know why, but they just seemed overdone. I went from there, searching. Until I found these headphones. I was smitten. It was like love at first sight.I went to a couple of stores to try them out, and possibley buy them. I was just furthormore convinced these were for me. They were very clear, and for once, the background wasn't a hazy mess of one melody over static. Voices were so pronounced like never before. Although the other headphones I tried did have similar traits, these were wireless and that was what caught my attention.So, after finding a cheaper version here at amazon, I bought it. When it arrived I was ecastatic. The first song I played was Nessun Dorma, sung by Pavarotti. I was amazed by the rendition and the headphones. Putting on a playlist of Billy Talent i walked around the house while the transmitter was in my room. Despite what the ad says, these headphones have incredible range and CAN go through walls.Overall, I am throughly satisfied with my purchase. The headphones have been quite durable to survive long trips in my backpack. I love the quality, and have trouble listening to the earphones that I've been using for years. I hope this may be the beginning of an audiophile. The range is great, and the headphones are VERY comfortable. I can wear them all day in my house (cook, do laundry and clean my room with them). The headphones may be considered headphones for a television, I use them for general music and as a plug into my computer.I have a few qualms. The transmitter, when used portably (which is something I do ALOT), require buying alkaline batteries. Also, the headphones aren't the most stylish. The headbands circle your head, and it makes the htop of your head very wide. Despite these two troubles, I was happy with my purchase and how these headphones have changed how I listen to music.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sennheiser RS - 160's are really good, but decently unattractive."
72,"on May 26, 2014",,"I bought these to replace an aging set of Macally bluetooth headphones (that I've had for over a decade, despite the amazon reviews saying they die within the year!).I'm impressed by these headphones. I have a couple of comments however.If you're looking for ""deep driving bass"" these are not the headphones for you. I believe these have a much more flat response (at least that's what I'd expect from Sennheiser.)Don't get me wrong, these deliver with very high quality sound, but you won't get ""rattle your brain bass"" out of them like most headphones will force upon you.Battery life is very long (as compared to my aging Macally set). I can probably wear these for over 24 hours continuous music listening and they'd still be alive. (It may be more, I'm just estimating.) I run them on eneloop AAAs.The range on these headphones is also very good. I'm not sure what it's specced for, but I can walk over my entire two story apartment without any dropout (through many walls as well.)I do have to mention that these are not ""perfectly quiet"" without anything playing. I CAN hear a very quiet high pitched buzzing sound when I turn them on. (I have good hearing, and for some reason I can almost always hear electronics hum even when other's can't.) However, it is by NO MEANS audible when listening to anything. Heck, the buzzing may be coming from pickup along the audio cable or because I have the base station plugged into the wall. Who knows. Other headphones may do it as well, but these are extremely easy to check since they have a power button on them and you can turn them on and off while they're on your head!Anyway, I'd recommend these to anyone.

    ","This is a good product and, with comment, I would recommend it to friends.1)  Sound:  In spite of having old ears (70) I listen with critical intensity and am still aware of limitions in many CDs, LPs and speakers. I consider this headset ""very good"" -- with clear highs and midrange.  I would prefer 10% more bass but could easily provide it with my intermediate amp.Separation is excellent -- true stereo, no matter where you sit. Of course, this is a benefit of using a headset rather than discrete speakers.Presence is good -- one feels that the singer or lead instrument is up-front, clear and emphasized.Although I am not aware that anything specific is missing, the Depth of the orchestra seems limited -- no instrument is farther back.  But this is also true in most bookshelf and medium floor speakers. It's not that something is missing in the headset; it's that something ""extra"" exists in large, high quality speakers (or multiple speakers).2) Range: Less than advertised but not a problem.  In the house, my signal quits about 30' to 40' from the base unit.  This is through 2 walls, which may be the determining factor.3) Setup: Simple, except that I was unable to determine if one needs rechargeable batteries in the base unit.  Documentation suggests No but I finally decided Yes to avoid any damage.4) Convenience: Good -- depending on your physical setup.  I leave everything routed, taped down and on Charge.  To listen, I activate the source (WMP/MP3@256Kbps); unplug the headset from the charger; press the Base-unit button; and, press the Headset button.  (My amp is always On, or that would be another step.)The headset buttons are poorly designed but are not a problem.  One can feel the raised icon for the On/Off and can remember that UP-volume is directly behind.With zero effort, one can unplug the Base unit and carry it to another temporary sound source (TV?).  (An A/B switch could also be used to alternately switch the source.)5) Comfort: The ear pressure is greater than I expected and I am afraid to bend the headband for fear of breakage.  Additionally, the ear cushions cause some sweating.  The result is that every 30 minutes I am aware of discomfort.  After an hour or so, I'm ready to quit -- but that is usually enough.6) Isolation: This closed-back model shuts out most (normal) external noise.  I can read a book and listen to music while my wife watches TV in the same room.  An unanticipated problem is that she has trouble getting my attention... and resents it.  Possibly, the open-back headset would be a better compromise for comfort (heat elimination) and less isolation.All in all, an excellent product which I would purchase again.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"As advertised, with limitations."

I wish the transmitter would just stay on and connected, regardless of whether the headphones are charging.

The transmitter base would normally be powered by the included plug-in power adapter instead of batteries.  The headphones can use standard AA cells or rechargeable batteries which are included.  Although I gave these headphones a five star rating, there are some minor issues that could be improved on by Sennheiser.  The charging cable plug is a tight fit into the headphone socket and difficult to disconnect.  It might be better to remove the batteries and charge them in an external unit provided by the user.  The multi-function and volume control buttons on the headphones are very close together and difficult to determine which button to press while they are on your head.  Sennheiser should have separated them from the tight adjacent group or provided some tactile identifier for each button.  Don't let the negative items prevent you from purchasing these headphones.

83,"on January 25, 2013",,"For the past 10+ years I have been using a pair of Sennheiser's basic wireless headphones.  They were OK, but didn't have much range and static would often disrupt the listening experience.  Ten or 12 days ago, they gave up the ghost when one of the earpieces fell apart as I took it off the charging cradle and the pieces of plastic that controlled the power on/off and volume settings fell onto the floor.After some research, I decided to go with the RS160 set.  I liked the idea that you didn't have to recharge it on a cradle, a finicky process that required precise placement to engage the  connection. These headphones recharge by simply plugging in the wire that extends as a ""Y"" from the main power wire that connects to the small transmitter.  An overnight charge gets you 24 hours of listening (says the company), but I haven't put it to that test yet.However, I can say that these 'phones are very comfortable, and I much prefer the way they fit around your ear, as opposed to my prior set, which had a simple piece of foam that pressed against the ear. The fidelity is truly excellent and static free-- I guess this is the benefit of digital transmission.  When I listen to TV or watch a DVD, the quality is superb with excellent stereo separation.  Movies actually seem to be in surround sound, though I know Sennheiser also has very expensive ""surround sound"" wireless headphones.In closing, I think these are just about the perfect wireless headphone.  True, they are not cheap, but after using those old $100 headphones, I can say you get a lot of extra quality by spending the additional $80.  These are much more solidly built, very cool-looking, and the sound they deliver is at least 5 times better (if you can quantify these things).",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best choice!

These are my first pair or wireless headphones & I wasn't sure what to expect but I must say I am very pleased. Right off though, the reason for 4 stars & not 5 is because of the lack of bass. They are very loud, crystal clear, absolutely no static or hissing ( don't stand near a working microwave though cause they will stop working), and dialog and music come through very clear. I've rewatched several moves that before I couldn't quite make out the dialog because of all the background noise or music in some scenes and I can understand everything perfectly with the headphones on.  Range is pretty good as well.. I can walk through most of my house, which is 1 story and a little over 2000 sq. ft., with no problem. Can go into the backyard a little ways because that's near the transmitter, but not into the front yard at all. I didn't buy these to listen to music all over the house so this is not a problem for me but if you want to put these on and go do yard work you may need to move the transmitter. That's another great thing about these headphones though: portability. I've moved these to several different tv's in my house with no problems and because the transmitter can be run on batter you don't have to move the power cord.  No problem with charge time either for me. I've used these for a 6 hour stretch a couple of times with no problem, and to charge them back up only took about a hour or so, which I didn't even need to do at that time but I always leave them plugged into the charger.  So a little more bass would be nice but otherwise I'm very happy and would recommend to my friends...",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent but for the bass
88,"on January 22, 2015",,"I've been staring at Sennheiser wireless headphones online for years, never before being able to bring myself to buy anything that cost more than a few dollars, unless it's a gift for my family.  I finally bought the RS 160, b/c I did not want open headphones (RS 180) and don't care about ""surround sound"" (RS 170).  They sound crystal clear, as good as my HD 428 set, and the range is great.  From the 2nd floor where the base is connected, I can go to the 1st floor or 3rd floor, and the only time the unit has dropped out was when the batteries needed to be replaced with a fresh set. It comes with a cheap set of NimH rechargeable triple A batteries, and I recommend having an extra set so that you alway have fully charged batteries on hand.  I have not used the included charger--I'm not going to wait half the day to charge batteries.  I also haven't read the instruction booklet yet.  It appeared to be pretty thick, and I'd read enough online to know how to turn the device and base on/off.  My only complaints so far are 1) As others have stated, the buttons on the headphones are so flush and indistinct, that it takes time, and a careful feel of the fingers to determine which button you're pushing.  The difficulty is due to the buttons being so flat, smooth and closely mounted together, and the only distinction between them is the embossed power symbol on the center button.  Instinctively, I wanted to use my thumb initially, to control the headphones, but I have discovered that my index finger works best, and is more sensitive to distinguishing the three buttons.  2) The stock ear cups get very warm.  I have never had this issue with other headphones, but for some reason these things get noticeably warm.  I read another review where the purchaser ordered the velour cups which I believe are stock for the RS 170, at which point the price would have been the same as just purchasing the 170 to begin with.  Because of this, I am considering exchanging these for the RS 170 for this reason.  I don't really need the added range of the base that comes with the 170 and it will be one more large vertical device that I don't care for, but there's no point in having these and needing to purchase the alternate ear cups.  In comparison, the HD 428 wired headphones cups are made from the same material, but they don't get warm like these do.",4.0 out of 5 stars,These wireless headphones are the coolest thing ever--and also the hottest.

    ","this is my second sennheiser purchase in the past week. i first got the pc 350 for my own gaming needs, and they were awesome. then my dad tried them and they worked so great for treating his tinnitus with audio, that i got him this set. he didnt need a mic and a wireless solution best fit his needs. i was torn with all the options available, and did i really need to spend a bundle on a headset. the answer was no. i mean, sure, if you have a cpl grand lying around for headphones, then im sure you can get better. but for the price, these are perfect. speaking of a cpl grand, there is a tinnitus treatment device, i forget the name, that my dads doctor suggested. it cost 5k. this plus a sounds of nature cd, and free online noise generators and gnaural, an open source frequency generator cost a total of 215.00. savings of 4785.00 for my dad for something that works great.there is absolutely no buzzing in this set and that can be attributed to the Kleer technology. ive had wireless in the past that just never should have been made. these are crystal , ehhem, kleer. the range is good enough that my dad was able to wander from attic to basement and outside to the pool and it never once hiccupped. the construction of the house, and materials used, have always made wireless anything a challenge to set up in the past. and these just performed beautifully from the get go. no hassle with base unit placement.my wish for these is that they came with a standard audio input adapter so i could have set him up with the tv as well instead of having to drive to an electronics store during my visit. i also wish they came with a ""stand type"" base unit that could cradle the set while not in use, instead of the circular ""desk space taker upper"". not real serious issues, and neither effect sound quality. if i could have taken half a star away for design i would, but this certainly did not warrant me taking a full star off, so 5 it is.the ear cups are comfortable and soft. the set, like my other sennheiser experiences, are a bit heavy, but ive come to prefer that over flimsy breakable models and brands. another win from sennheiser. i will never by another brand again.",5.0 out of 5 stars,sweet sound of sennheiser

    ",The RS160 headphones work as advertised and are real easy to set up.  I was real pleased with the clarity of the sound and the fact that there is no noticable lag between what is on the TV and the audio through the headset.I can walk all over my 2400 square foot home and the reception never faulters.  I did notice though that going outside cuts the reception down quite a bit.  In my Garage there is no problem with reception but as I head out to the driveway the sound starts to break up.  To me this is not a big deal as I plan to listen to TV and music while in the house with these headphones.The unit is easy to set up and comes with almost everything you need to connect to your TV or stereo (It did not come with an adaptor for the old 1/4 inch jack on older Stereo sets).I highly recommend these for those who want good sound quality but have a strict budget.

    ","I really enjoyed the portability and clear (kleer) sound of this unit.  I powered both the headphones and the transmitter with eneloop batteries, planning to just swap them out when the batteries needed recharging.  Worked great for a week.After a week of use, (probably no more than 12 hours total), the next time I wanted to use it, the transmitter light did not go on when the button was pushed.  AND the unit became hot to the touch, which was not normal.  And then I smelled burnt electronics.  And this was just from batteries, no wall current.I gave it a 3 rating because I was torn between the 0-1 durability, and the 4-5 of usability of the product.Edit - up the rating from 3 to 4.  My second unit has been working. I don't use it that much, maybe once a week.A problem has developed.  The batteries to the headphone unit drain while not in use.  I've learned to remove the batteries from the headphone unit if I don't anticipate using it again soon.  No problem with the base unit (and it's unplugged from wall current, just use batteries.)  I'd rate the sound as being below my KOSS PortaPro.  But the RS 160 is good enough to enjoy and I like not having wires.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"1st lasted a week, 2nd working for 2 years now"

    ","Having this product for over a year, I feel like I have some experience to share. Comfortable to wear for a descent period of time, a couple hours and you can't wait to rip them off. You can exercise in them, but depends what kind of exercise. You cannot move your head too much or they will try to fall off. I am a little disappointed in the distance they reach. I love in a very small house. If I'm 15 feet from the sensor behind a wall, I occasionally loose signal. When I'm on the second floor, it gets even worse. My house is the size of a average town home. The signal should be able to be reached everywhere in this space. Its also in a rural area with no neighbors so there are no interference for the signal that I know of.

    ","I had these at 4 stars but I'm retracting that to 2 stars but only because the sound quality is excellent.Original review: My first gripe is the volume control buttons on the headset are hard to find when you're wearing them.  Bad design.The second issue is the base unit can connect up to four headsets.  This is fine except if you push the power button on the base unit it switches to single headset use.  I have no idea why anyone would need this feature and I just spent 20 minutes figuring out why only one headset was working,  if you only want one headset just turn the others off or make this feature more difficult to accidentally set.  Bad design.  They do sound good though.Additional comments:Lately, I've noticed the sound cutting on and off at random.  It's as if the unit is losing connection and needs to reconnect.  This is with two headphones connected and the base about 4 feet away.  It totally ruins a movie when this happens.  I tried everything I could think.

    ","I ordered these after X-mas and wanted to wait to do my review after I used them for awhile and I have to say that I love my headphones!!!! I wanted a pair of headphones to walk/run on the treadmill and watch TV at the same time. The treadmill is so loud and we have a small house that I had to crank up the TV to hear it with the treadmill and my husband would then have to crank up his TV in his den area. Alot of noise going on!!!Now I can watch any show and still hear it while on the treadmill! There is no interference from the TV and the treadmill running. I can hear everything clearly. The only thing I don't like is that I have no place to hang up my headphones when I am done with them. I just lay them on the table next to the TV, but wish I had a stand. When these evenually die I might get the model of these headphones one step up so I have a stand and I don't have to redo the plugs to charge it. Other than that, I am very happy with my purchase!I would not recommend having others use your headphones after working out on the treadmill as you do sweat and the ear muffs do get sweaty.

    ","Purchased to compliment the new HDTV in my bedroom. Ideal for watching movies at night. Wireless is a Godsend. Very clear sound, very happy.My one complaint: Sennheiser includes a stand with the 170 & 180 models but not this one, the 160. Feels like a cheap move on their part. You will need a stand of some sort in my opinion. Otherwise looks cheap just laying them on a table. I ended up buying a banana stand from a local retailer and they hang from there. I think Sennheiser should have included some sort of stand. Even if it was made of cheap materials.I also recommend you purchase a set of 4 AAA rechargeable batteries and a charger. You get 2 rechargeable batteries with the headphones. It's a pain to charge the batteries using the headphones and adapter. Just buy stand alone batteries and life will be a lot easier when you run out of juice (keep 2 AAA batteries charged as a backup at all times).",4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost Perfect.

    ","Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend b/c he works nights while I work days and likes to watch tv and videos at the wee hours when I'm sleeping. Being a very light sleeper wireless headphones are a relationship saver. I bought these pricey headphones b/c we've had no luck with the cheaper ones that use radio signals. They always pick up radio and not the tv or they'll work for a little bit and then die, so I thought these would be worth the investment. So far they have been. He seems happy with them and coming with the recharging batteries and charger is a big plus. They give uninterrupted sound b/c they come straight from the source. Minor annoyances that had me not give it a full 5 star rating are: the thing you wanna use the headphones with has to have a headphone jack (not really big deal being that most new tvs have this, but older tvs don't), you have to keep unplugging the connection from the source and re plugging in when you wanna use the headphones (unlike the cheaper ones that use radio signal that you can keep the audio connections in when not using), and lastly the 2 volume controls one on the signal receiver and one on the headphones is a little annoying to adjust all those volumes including the actual thing it's plugged into (the tv or stereo volume itself). Oh yeah and if you have your tv connected to your computer (using tv as computer monitor) the sound only comes out of one ear when using headphones if not directly connected to the computer.

Great sound and the buttons are easy enough to find while wearing the headphones.  My one complaint is that the ear cushions on this model are a lot more plush than the HD 558.

I just contacted Sennheiser customer support to inquire about this.Edit:  Sennheiser said that the RS 180 ear pads will fit but will be a slightly different color.  This will hopefully resolve the sweating issue.Sennheiser's Exact Response:""Thank you for contacting technical support, I agree with you both systems are amazing, at the same time they are different from each other, one of the main differences between them is the acoustic design, the HD 598 is an open air design, which allows air in and out of the ear cups, giving you a better sound staging and keeping your ears cooler. The RS 160 is a close cup system, it normally give you a better bass but because there is not air movement, the ears tend to sweat, our RS 180 is our wireless audio file wireless headphone, this headphone will be very close to the HD 598 as far as sound, quality and design, also, if you are interested, the ear pads for the RS 180 will fit the RS 160, they are just a different color, the part number for it is 534469""",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones but the ear cushions make my ears sweat

I can really get immersed in my movies using these and no cord bugging me. Yea, they sound ok for music but I don't really think these are really for that so I'm not judging based on that at all. The fact that you can connect multiple headphones at once to the same little receiver is an awesome perk but I rarely buy headphones to share the sound with others. The battery life is not great either buts its rechargeable so its more than manageable. The receiver really needs to be away from too many other electronics to work properly. I had this next to my modem and the sound was cutting in and out. I moved it away from there and no problems since. If you need wireless headphones for your TV or computer (even gaming if you don't need a mic like me) than by all means get these.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones

I wanted the convenience of not having to pull out a 20 foot cable (and put it away) every time I wanted to watch my tv late at night.  It's much easier to simply plug the transmitter into the headphone jack on my receiver and turn on the switches on the transmitter and the headphones.  Additionally, I'm able to walk around my house and still receive a good signal from the transmitter (not very far outside, though), if I want to listen to music, for example.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Convenience worth the cost

    ","I have hearing loss and watching TV in the evening with the wife was difficult at best. Her hearing is fine. I would turn the volume up so I could hear better and she would turn it down again. Also, I would stay up late after she went to sleep and I had to keep the sound so low that I couldn't hear half the time. These headphones solved the problem. The sound is very clear. Now the wife can turn the sound down and I can still hear great. I can hear subtle sounds that were completely missing before.  The head phones are reasonably comfortable, nothing to write home about.The range is adequate and varies depending on the placement of the transmitter. I can walk to adjacent rooms during commerical breaks without dropping the signal. I purchased these because of the KLEER technology. The other kinds like IR limit your mobility and the RF type seem to have static which I have plenty already from my Tinnitus. I like the their use of NiMH rechargeable batteries. I have plenty of spares on hand and no need to purchase special batteries.  Changing the volume while wearing the phones isn't easy as it should be.  The location of the +- buttons needs to be improved. Something as simple as an obvious tactile difference between them would help. The other change is to include a Digital Coax and Optical Toslink connections on the transmitter. This would make them more versatle, because alot of the new HDTV's no longer have an analog RCA audio output. When I upgrade my TV next year I wiil need to purchase a digital to analog converter.

    ","Overall, I really like these headphones.  They are used daily at work.  Battery life seems really good since I have never ran out of juice.  They seem to be rugged.  Sound quality is very good in my opinion.  (I'm no audiophile, but I use headphones a lot and these seem really clear without any hissing or other background noise that I have experienced with cordless units before.)  Range has been very good and a noticable improvement over my previous Sennheiser HDR 80 headphones.My minor complaints:1. The plug-style recharging is a little bit inconvenient compared to the higher end models.  It's not a big deal though.  The cord connection is tight, which is good from one perspective but it's so tight that I always am nervous unplugging them to make sure I don't stress the cables or the connection.  No problems though.2. While not bad, these headphones are a little less comfortable and a little heavier than my previous Sennheiser HDR 80 headphones.  Sometimes if I don't get them just right they hurt my ears after an hour or so of use.  I can usually adjust the position a little bit to help though so I don't consider this a huge negative.3. Battery charge time seems very long based on the light.  It is not uncommon for me to use them for several hours one day, leave work at 6PM, and come back in at 8AM the next morning to see the charge light still on.  Most of the time I just start using them again anyway and I have never ran out of power, but still...  Based on days when I just leave them charging, it looks like charge times can easily fall in the 12-18hr range after what I would consider moderate use.  I can't complain too much though because I haven't ever completely ran out of power and since the batteries are AAA I could easily just stick in another set of rechargables.Bottom Line:  This is a great set of headphones and I'm very happy I purchased them.  While the higher end models may have been even nicer, I think these represented a good match of performance for the money.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Good Overall - A Few Minor Complaints

The range is pretty good, definitely won't get 60 feet if you're going through walls and stuff, but since I just use them for watching movies and shows, I'm pretty close to the receiver already. I'd say you can get about 30-40 feet of range if the transmitter has to go through walls/floors of a house. To comment on the reviewers who mention an audible hiss while having these on, I can hear it to but only when there is no sound during the movie/show. Once the action or dialogue starts up, it's like the sound never existed. Battery life on them is great as well. I make sure to keep them charged, but even so I've gone through watching 5 James Bond films and the batteries never died. Since these don't offer the wireless charging station, I though I'd miss out on that feature but I really don't since I tend to only charge them one a week at the most. Just plug it in after watching it and leave it until the next day.

    ","Overall, the RS 160 functions fine.  That said, I owned the RS 140 for about five years until it gave up the ghost and I would have bought a replacement if Sennheiser hadn't dropped it.  The send/recieve distance for the 140 I owned was more than twice as far as the 160 I own today.  Since I have traumatic hearing loss from my Army days I only use the headphones for watching TV with my wife and I've noticed I could hear her speak to me more clearly wearing the 140 so I assume the 160's are better insulated.  For my purpose though, I prefer to be able to hear things like the doorbell and phone while watching TV so again I like the 140 better.  I feel sound quality and volume is fine with the 160 but then I had no concerns with the 140 either.  Charging the headphones was easier with the 140 but I've had no problem with battery life in either one.  Fortunately, I have small enough ears to fit in the 160 headphones but I would definately not buy these if one has larger ears.  Also, the 140 fit on my head more loosely and were much more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time.  Although the volume control on the 160 is more difficult to feel and therefore to adjust while wearing, I prefer it to the volume control on the 140 as the 140 volume ""wheel"" would adjust by itself if I leaned back on the headrest of my chair.Sennheiser makes a decent product; I just wish they'd have improved some of the minor faults with the 140 as I prefer the 140's strengths over the 160's faults.",3.0 out of 5 stars,What happened to the 140?

155,"on February 2, 2013",,"I bought this as a gift for my parents to replace a cheap wireless headset they had for watching TV in their room.  One of my parents usually ends up watching TV late night as the other sleeps.  So, it seemed like a good idea to spend more and get a good set.  In the box comes the headphones, a receiver, 2 aaa rechargeable batteries, and a wire.  I read the instructions, set it up for them, and tested it.  Ready & easy to set up and use right out of the box. It's probably harder to get the stuff out of the package than using it.The receiver is relatively small and is plugged into the wall for power.  You also have the option to put batteries in if you want to roam with it.The headset is adjustable and has padding for the ears & top of the head.  Battery compartments in the headset are easy to get to.  You probably won't have to worry about access much after initially putting in the batteries until you have to replace them with a new pair.  That's because you simply plug the headset to the receiver to recharge.  Recharging frequency and duration will vary depending on use and the type of rechargeable batteries you use (some seem better than others).Read the instructions to ""pair"" the receiver and headset (pretty easy).  After that, it takes 3-4 seconds to use.  First push the button on the receiver for a second, then push a button on the headset for a second, give it another second for them to connect...and you're in business.Sound comes in clear without any static or hissing.  You can also walk into another room in the house without affecting the sound.  I thought I'd have some fun while testing and walked downstairs (their room is upstairs)...no problem receiving sound.  It came in clear.I think this is a good product if you just simply want to hear the TV without disturbing others.  No complaints so far.  Are there cheaper alternatives?

    ","I've had my 160's for over a month now, and I'm even more pleased than when I put them on straight out of the box.  Having lived in the country most of my life, moving to an apartment in town, even if only for a couple of years, is a tough adjustment.  I'm just off the highway, the neighborhood seems to be made of screaming children and four-bangers without mufflers, and a drum set had just moved in downstairs when I decided to adjust by buying headphones instead of cranking up the volume on my TV.  The Sennheiser 160's are a very welcome comfort.  They are surprisingly lightweight, the full-size ear-cup style minimizes external noise without having to abuse the eardrums, and the sound quality is far better than that of my MacBook (which probably should go without saying).  Although the refrigerator can momentarily block signal, and the batteries need changing a bit too frequently for my liking, I still rate these quite highly because they not only reduce other people's noises in my home, but also have transformed miserable chores (like vacuuming and washing dishes) into tasks that can be done while catching up on old episodes of Grey's Anatomy or listening to Carla Bruni on the iPod.  My stash of alkalines will dwindle and I'll order the more powerful hybrid rechargeables for peace of (battery) mind, and I may still require earplugs when the neighbor decides to try to learn how to play the drums, but my doctor would be pleased to see that my blood pressure has returned to normal.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfort in an apartment?

    ","Was just looking for a nice set of wireless headphones that looked nice, and sounded nice.  These fit it perfectly.Got them mostly because I was tired of tripping over the cord of my wired headphones, have broken multiple pairs like that.  Now I can listen to music/watch shows without worry.  And being able to watch from across the room now is nice, didn't have the option with my corded headphones as they didn't reach far enough.If there's alot of bass in what you're listening to, you can get an odd tiny echo, and bass just doesn't sound perfect, but otherwise sound quality is good.  Never had interference or anything like that.  I can go through multiple doors into the kitchen and still listen, although from that far it'll sputter if i move around too much.  So the ""line of sight"" transmission range doesn't totally apply, i got 15-20 meters through 2 walls and assorted other stuff.Battery life will last me 6-8 hours continuous use on a not-too loud setting, which is fine as I never need them for longer than that in a day.

    ","If you're like me, and really don't fit that audiophile mold but appreciate good sounding acoustics and use quality, discreet, and neat components, then the RS160s should be on your short list.Firstly, they sound great - just like a pair of wired headphones. Second, the transmitter is small and easily hidden - it also runs on batteries - HUGE plus.  And third, the headphones appear very well built, very comfortable and offer a 2 year warranty - perhaps a testament to German engineering.There's no hissing or popping since these are digital.  The range is very good - even without line of sight - I was impressed I could go upstairs and still receive a signal.  And when you do go out of range it just cuts out, not that ear shattering white noise you get on analog transmissions.  The battery powered(or AC powered) transmitter really rounds out this system, for the most part.  I hate wires and the messy clutter they cause - having the transmitter able to run on batteries was a HUGE selling point for me.  However, a good set of rechargeable batteries is a must if you're gonna opt for battery power.  It's also small and discreet and lends itself to traveling pretty much anywhere very well.Also - one negative thing I've read in many of the reviews is the button placement on the headphones and the difficulty in operating them.  Frankly, I have no idea what these people are talking about.  The buttons are on the right ear cup, the volume UP button is BIG, the POWER button is textured and in the middle, and the the only button left is the volume DOWN - which is maybe kinda small.  Use your thumb, not your index finger, you'll be perfectly fine, I promise!There are a few desires that I wish had made their way to the RS160s:Digital audio OUT - it's 2012, how about an OPTICAL audio out at least!Improved battery efficiency - these things eat through batteries fast.Ability to charge batteries through the transmitter - this would have been hugely amazing.You have to power on the headphones AND transmitter separately - it'd be nice if the transmitter powered on when you power on the headphones - think Xbox controller...If you're looking at these, you have probably already read through the fact sheet but are trying to decide if these are worth $180-$200.  Frankly, I'm not sure they are.  The question is how much are they worth to YOU. Regardless of the price, if you pull the trigger on these, it's gonna be hard to be disappointed - the RS160s are remarkable headphones.**Quick Note** - It is stated, under the WHAT'S IN THE BOX section that these come with a 1/8"" female to RCA male audio adapter and an 1/8"" female to 1/4"" inch male audio adapter.  Neither of these ship with the RS160 - I contacted Amazon about it and got an $18 refund - go and do likewise.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Headphones That Get The Job Done

The secret is that this set is fully digital, and therefore much less prone to interference than the many analog wireless sets available.  In addition, this set incorporates proprietary technology to further reduce interference. The outcome is excellent, and the set is comfortable and reasonably light-weight.

I have no complaints at all.UPDATE: (September 2013) Last year the last of the small plastic tabs that connect the ear pads to the headphones finally broke off. They broke off slowly, one by one. I couldn't find any replacements. I started off using double-sided tape to keep them attached, but with the need to frequently remove them to replace batteries, the tape wore off quickly. Finally, I just bought some rare earth magnets and rigged up an ugly but pleasing solution. The small plastic tabs are the real Achilles' heel of this product. I've used it several times a week for 4 years and everything still works great except for the plastic tabs.

We had two older pairs of 120's I believe, and they had finally been abused just a little to much after 5 years.  After a little research I settled on these.Simply put, I couldn't be happier with them.  They are very comfortable and as advertised have sound quality that equals wire headphones.  They aparently have a digital link-up, so you either have perfect sound, or no sound.  No static.  The range is very good to. Although not technicaly ""sound cancelling"", the ear cups block out a lot of sound.  I once forgot to turn off the stereo speakers and had the volume rather loud before I heard the through (over) the headphones.My two minor markdown were for these reasons.

It wasn't hard to do, it just wasn't in the ""quick install"" printed guide.As for ""beauty"", well, they're nicely made and comfortable (which is what they are designed for) but they are intended to be used, not looked at. Not really a bad thing, but for those who like to LOOK at their headphones, they're not what I would call 5 star.My only complaint (minor) is that the transmitter doesn't auto sense a signal and turn on by it's self like my older pairs do.

    ","The headset blocks out ambient noise pretty good.  However the ear piece is too small for my ears to fit inside them and therefore it's not comfortable for wearing longer than an hour.Battery usage is pretty good despite some reviews.  Just make sure to pickup extra AAA rechargeable batteries and charger so they can be charged outside of the headset while the headset is in use.  I find that having extra 3.5mm headphone jacks at different source locations helps eliminating the need to unplug the cable every time the source location is changed.Sound quality is acceptable to me as long as music doesn't fade out.  It does have pretty good dynamic range.  I'm picky with my music and so far I only listen to Lossless formats.I'm still trying to get used to the 3 buttons with volume and on/off so I don't press the wrong one.Its limitation is the range which is no where near what the spec says.  You can expect better range and reception if the headset is in the same room as the transmitter without any obstuctions.  But going to a floor above or below, down a narrow hallway or into a differnt room render the unit unusable.  But if you use it for just tv watching or music listening in the same room, you'll be ok.  But then it defeats the purpose of the wireless feature.I'm happy with the device and look at it as a gadget since I've not had better wireless ones but the price is a bit high.",4.0 out of 5 stars,ok gadget

    ","I'm familiar with something techy and I wasn't afraid too much about syncing up each headphones. So I didn't go with new way with new version 165. Actually the reason I went with this old version is that I need to use 4 headphones for my family and better price. The newer version only can associate with two headphones.Associating each headphone could be tricky but it won't be too hard if you see how each light blink carefully and follow instruction properly each time you turn on and off. I used it only couple of times so far but I didn't have a trouble yet about syncing.Buttons on headphone is fine for me. My only complain is about sound quality. It's not bad but also not good as I expected. I plugged the transimitter to receiver so that I can tweak sound to get better one. 160 has more treble, lesser bass than I think.Major issue to me was LR balance of headphone. More open sound feeling on the left than the right. I think it's because physically there are much more complicated circuit board on the right side of headphone so it sounds more closed on the right. It caused it sounds not perfectly equal so I should have reduced left level -3db. I'm not sure if other people feel that but yeah just my assuming.(It could be not the truth or my ears problem) It was bugging me a lot so I tweaked LR level balance with my audio receiver.With my receiver I tweaked EQ to add bass a bit and set with a better preset. You may want to do the same thing on your TV or computer or receiver.Will order two more headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great!

    ",I would give 4.5/5 if they has this option. Overall I am happy with this purchase. I wanted something as mobile as possible and I think RS 160 is one of the best optio out there. Its mobility is wonderful. Sound and bass are very good for the price. Sometimes it will cause wireless internet to reset which is a bit annoying. It will also not go through the walls so you'll have to take the laptop with to the room/floor you are in. A couple of suggestions for the manufacturer: consider including a case; updating the design to something more modern; and having the option to collapse the earphones so that they occupy less space when traveling. Again - overall a great product.,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product with small shortages

Hopefully they last as long as the Sennheisers I have in the bedroom, which I've had for about 4 years. These new ones are for the LR which get more use.I have gone through 2 sets of AR's (4 headfones) all broken within a year. Some of the AR's refused to work simultaneously with their mates, they also broke within a year. These 160's seem perfect so far, I'll check back in a year with a durability report.I purchased an additional charger from Sennheiser to enable charging both headfones away from the transmitter. The only small niggle is that you have to manually start the transmitter when you want to use it.

    ","The wireless RS 160 works perfectly as designed. I am so glad they are not Bluetooth. Every Bluetooth set of headphones always disconnected. These have not disconnected in about a week of use. Set up was easy. You have install two rechargeable batteries (included) into the earphones (one each side) which are super easy to install by twisting the ear cup slightly for access. Then you have to plug the connector from the base into the audio port on your desktop/laptop/tablet and power cord into an outlet or, you can use batteries for the base but I prefer to plug it in as I think you cannot charge to headset unless the base is plugged into an outlet (no running on batteries).Don't forget to charge the headset before use. They recommend 16 hours the first time before use. After a full charge they last about two days but, I don't listen to them but about an hour or so a day but they are on and ready to go the whole time. I find it worth having to remember to charge them than to deal with the cord of my wired Sennheisers.I can walk anywhere on the first floor of my house...up to 66' away, and they do not break up and they stay connected. The sound is clear but they lack a little base but, the music is clean. I can turn them up as loud as I care to without them distorting. They are not as comfortable to wear or as good sounding as my Sennheiser HD 518's as the ear cups are not as nearly as soft but, my 518's are two years old.AND THE BEST PART IS...finally NO FREAKING CORD!

    ","I've been using many different audiophile headphones over the years, and when my cordless pioneer SE-DIR800C cans finally snuffed it due to age (yes, I should pull the transmitter apart and see if I can replace the caps), I felt I should give these a try based on reviews.Well, first off: comfort. They fit well on my head and over my ears. I have a few cartilage piercings, so a bad headphone can really start aching after a few hours. The ear pads are soft enough to not put too much pressure on my ears, yet they block out quite a lot of outside noise. These also feel quite light, lighter than the Pioneer cans, probably because of the AAA batteries instead of AA.Charging: they can charge from the base via a special charging cable, which works well for me. I've used them for over 16 hours on a charge at low volume levels, which was, quite frankly, surprising to get such life out of them. If I charge nightly, I have run in to no problems keeping a full charge for a day's listening. As they take AAA batteries, I also keep a set of rechargable AAAs handy, just in case I do forget to charge for a few days, and I can just swap in the fresh ones and charge the old ones in a separate charger.Sound: as satisfied as I was with the Pioneers, they did have a problem with boosting bass at the low end, so I had to compensate with an equalizer. The RS 160s have a very flat curve, which I prefer greatly. Very clear sound transmission as well, with no dropouts anywhere in my somewhat small office.Drawbacks: Probably not a huge one, but the only input is a 1/8"" mini jack. no RCA, no SPDIF. The batteries aren't super convenient to get to, requiring removal of the ear cups (removal is quite easy, just inconvenient.) The biggest drawback is the button placement and texturing for the power and volume buttons. There is only one small bump on the center power button, and the volume buttons are smooth, giving no tactile feedback as to if your finger is on the right button. This is easily remedied by gluing a tiny black bead or sequin to the power button so you can easily slide from that to the up or down volume buttons without giving it too much thought.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"nice flat frequency curve, great range, AND comfortable, too!"

I can turn the sound on the TV off and control the headset volume all I want. If I have to leave the room, I usually pause what I'm watching, but occasionally I just walk out because I don't have to see - just listen.

    ","I'm really happy with these headphones. Sounds every bit as good as being wired. I use them for watching TV or playing xbox after my wife and kids go to bed. They are extremely comfortable. They fit ""over-the-ear"" which I highly recommend. Some other headphone model are ""on-the-ear"" which I find to be less comfortable.I do have a few small complaints/things to consider before purchasing these:I'm not crazy about the fact that their are volume controls in 3-places with this setup; I can adjust volume my stereo receiver, the RS 160 transmitter, and the RS 160 headset. Guess I'm just unsure of how to adjust all the knobs to get the optimal sound quality. The instructions say to have your sound source at a ""medium"" volume.As one other reviewer mentioned it's a little bit annoying that the RS 160 transmitter powers down when not in use even if it is plugged into the wall. This means every time I want to use my headphone I have to go into my cabinet to turn on the transmitter and also turn on the headset. It would be nicer if I could just grab the headset off my coffee table and turn it on.Also when you want to power down the headset you have to hold the power button for 1 second. If you don't hold it down that long the headset just goes into mute mode. It appears to be off but the battery drains. Not that big of a deal but not the greatest user interface in my opinion.Again I do recommend this product and I am very happy with my purchase just a couple of quirks.",4.0 out of 5 stars,A little expensive but worth it

Attenuation is above average with the comfortable pads; the range is more than passable for most of the wireless audio duties I assign it. I use it more with my TV going through Onkyo home theater equipment than anything else. It leans a little on the treble side of the scale according to my ear, but that is easy to adjust for usually.

The push buttons are difficult to adjust while wearing - a volume knob would be more appropriate.

    ",I bought these headphones for my father's birthday and he loves them! Having listened to them myself I can honestly say that the sound quality is superb compared to other wireless headphones I have tried. Setup is simple and takes less than 2 minutes. Some sites show the range of these headphones as being either 120' or 240' but the actual practicle range in a home is @ 50'. The packaging states a range of 20m or roughly 60'. At around 50' the sound drops out but up until that point there is no noticeable difference in sound quality.

    ","I Purchased these headphones on 11 February 2010.  I bought them to replace a pair of Koss wireless headphones that I had used for years.  I was never satisfied with them (Koss) because there was always a slight hiss in the background during quiet passages in the music.  To be fair, the hiss was due to the fact they were analog.  The hiss is present in all analog wireless headphones, regardless of brand.  I didn't want to live with hiss again, so I bit the bullet and plopped down 200 bux for the digital Sennheisers. I've worn them 8 to 10 hours a day, Monday through Friday ever since. I am completely satisfied!I opted for the the RS 160 because the base station is portable.  When running on batteries, I can go for several hours with no noticeable diminution of sound quality or volume.The sound quality is excellent.  These are not studio reference cans, but they are outstanding for wireless.  The fit and finish are good.  They are lightweight and very comfortable which makes them a joy to wear for extended periods.  I've used them when traveling cross country, via train.  I've used them with my laptop, smartphone, office desktop, and my 7.1 home theater system.  They excel in all applications.I don't abuse them, but I don't baby them either. They've stood up to constant use and handling over the last two years and they essentially look new.  I have not yet had to replace the rechargeable NiMH batteries that come with the headphones.  The base station uses alkaline batteries/AC.You can probably get better sound quality in a pair of wired headsets in this price range, but if you are like me, and want the total flexibility of use that you can get only with wireless, click the buy button.

Sennheiser claims these should maintain a clear signal for 60 feet (and I assume that is thru walls and ceilings, who has a 60 foot long room in their house?) and I think I've read other people's reviews where they are getting a good signal up to 200 feet away. I know I have a lot of wirelessness going on in my office as my wireless router is located there and maybe is causing the drop-outs. I use my router for many things: DirecTV internet, PS3, 4 computers, 4 phones, 2 MagicJack+, SlingBox, HD backups, and a printer. I know my MagicJack for the phone keeps giving me strange beeps so maybe I just have too much going on in that room.In response to this limited range, I bought the RS 170s and they actually have a much better range and better bass (when the bass button is activated). However, I actually prefer the smaller, portable base of the 160's but I'm still testing the 170s and they seem like keepers. If only the 170's included a small portable base as well as the little recharge tower that they come with.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Limited Range in my house

    ","If static and interference concerns you, pay a few extra dollars and get yourself a good set of digital headphones like the RS 160.  All wireless links are affected by low signal strength and interference, the effect on audio quality is a major difference between analog and digital modulation.  As the signal quality deteriorates in an analog system the listener hears increasing amounts of static.  Very annoying.  In a digital system, the audio is reconstructed from a bitstream (ones and zeros) received from the transmitter.  Sophisticated error correction routines are used to ""fix"" errors in the bitstream resulting from interference or low signal strength.  The result is perfectly clear audio until the bit errors overwhelm the signal processing in the receiver, then the audio simply drops out and you know you've strayed a little too far from the transmitter.The RS 160 uses integrated circuits by a company called Kleer to transmit CD quality audio, and that's exactly what you get.  The sound is fantastic and limited only by the hardware and cup design of the headphones themselves.  Audiophiles may want to step up to the RS 170 or RS 180, but for television, computer, or music at night when the baby goes to bed...these are perfect.  You'll hear things in your music you weren't able to hear before using high quality headphones.The on/off/mute button is easily found on the headset, as are the adjacent up and down volume buttons.  I put alkaline batteries in the headphones to test them right out of the box and put the rechargeable batteries in to charge overnight.  Every week (5-10 hours of use) I plug the headset into the power cord that normally feeds the transmitter to recharge.  The batteries have never run down. The over ear design of the cups blocks out some external noises, but not much.  Still, they are very comfortable and help to block out the neighbor's conversation in the backyard at night.  Setup is a breeze, you simply plug the audio jack into a source and turn on the base and headphones.  That's it, there are no channels to switch or tune.  The base and headset sync up in a couple seconds and you're done.  Up to four headsets can be synced to the same source.  The range is as advertised.  I'll find myself wandering outside at night to water the lawn while listening to the game.  I can't say enough good things about these headphones, they're great.Update 12/9/10 - After 10 months of nearly daily use these headphones are better than ever.  Physically they still look brand new, the ear cups have retained their original shape, remain soft, and show no signs of wear. All the controls work perfectly and the headband looks like it did when it was delivered.  Still using the original batteries, I'll charge them every 6-8 hours of use so they don't run out in the middle of something.  If I forget to charge them for a week or so and they run out, I just pop in some AAA alkelines.  I have read some other reviews complaining about having to push a button to turn the transmitter on.  Really? Pushing a button?  Not an issue.  These are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned, they are also the best sounding.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Crystal clear, static free headphones, plug in - turn on - perfect"

    ","So far, not working for what I need.I bought this kit and it works well. I also read the promotional material on Amazon's page for this line of products. It leads me to believe I could pair this headphone to up to three more for a total of four headphones playing the output of the transmitter included with this kit. Well, I bought one of the extra headphones...it pairs fine---BUT only one headphone will pair at a time. This means I either have some defective items, or these kits don't work reliably.  And, I am a very experienced broadcasting engineer who has been spending the last few years installing high end AV systems for clients spending thousands. I have already spent two hours of my own time trying to get these to work. I'm just about ready to write off Sennheiser.

But if you're using only TV speakers and your TV has audio out, either 3.5mm for direct connection or digital optical or phono to which you can probably adapt, your TV will probably allow dual audio outs just fine (receivers' headphone jacks cut speaker system output when headphone are used). Much depends upon the ports and settings of your TV and receiver because disc players can be connected to either and their sound ouput routed accordingly. It's a bit byzantine to understand. What's easy to understand—and do!—is using the right adapters connected where your speaker wires connect (in my case the two I mentioned above).

    ","Having enjoyed several Sennheiser wired headphones for $20 to $80 I thought $179 for the RS160 was a bit much to pay for wireless. So, I bought the RS120 for less than half the price. The 120s are very good and very comfortable. Then I saw refurbished 160s for just over a hundred dollars and took a chance. In sound, 160s are excellent and slightly better than 120s in all respects; in particular, the reduction in background hiss and removal of nasty static when source signal disappears.Although refurbished, the 160s look like new.The 120s have two benefits over 160s. First, having a stand which hangs the phones and recharges is a minor convenience. Second, the foam covers of the 120s are cooler for long-term use -or even short-term use in high humidity (I am going to try putting 120-like breathing foam covers on the 160s).As with all the Sennheiser phones I have owned, both 120s and 160s are excellent.Treat yourself to either - and don't be afraid of the refurbished 160s bought through Amazon.Update: Above I mention that the 120s foam covers are cooler for long-term listening. I removed the covers from the 120s and with double-sided tape attached them to the 160s to replace theirs. Works perfectly and makes the 160s more comfortable for wearing for more than an hour. Of course, not many people have spare 120s lying around. But if you cut a circle of acoustic foam it would work just as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!

    ","I bought these headphones based on the review from The Wire Cutter.  They do what they says it does, but as the review states, it has some issues with what sort of audio input it received.  Like iPhones, modern flat screen TVs don't have forward facing speakers so you either need something like these wireless headphones or a soundbar just for a decent viewing experience.  The sound quality is good, but not quite like a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 15, which I also own.The quality of the materials does leave a few things to be desired.  I would have expected better craftsmanship given the price.  I do use these a lot, so that contributed to the fact that I had to replace the ear pads which I could only find by ordering directly from Sennheiser.  They weren't cheap given what they are.  The pads feel light and cheap.  The fit of the headphones were initially rather tight, and I have an average sized head.  You can of course adjust the size of them, but I only lengthen them half way at most.  I used to fall asleep watching TV while wearing these and I would occasionally wake up with sore ears.  After a few years of use, they still seem to work like the same same day I bought them, except the stiffness of plastic has loosened to the point where the headphones are too loose and will slide off of my head if I lean over.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not great

Getting the connection between the headset and the transmitter to work is extremely difficult and time consuming. For the price paid this item should be much more easier to operate. I would not have purchased this headset if I had had the opportunity to preflight it.  I definitely would not recommend it to anyone.My previous headset was a Sony MDR 970R.

    ","Okay, so this is a really great headset.  I was really blown away coming from a pair of Creative WP-300 bluetooth headphones which sound great, but still compresses the audio and thus resulting in degradation of quality.  First off, these things ship with AAA Sanyo Eneloop batteries which are top of the line and last plenty. Plus you still have the option to just swap them out if you forget to charge. I live in a 1200sqft condo.  I have the receiver downstairs in the living area and don't lose a single anywhere in the house and can get a good ways outside. My cap size is 7&3/8 to give you an idea of how I'm grading these on comfort.  I have no complaints in the comfort department.  Some people complain about sweaty ears, but I honestly can't say I haven't had a case where wearing any set of headphones doesn't give me sweaty ears.  I just grab a cotton swab when my ears get to sweaty, so I don't really go for the whole ""they make your ears sweat"" thing because of course they do.  I also wear glasses and don't feel any added pressure of my ears pressing up against the frame.  I also found the volume level to be more than adequate.  I really can't hear too much of anything else with these turned up half way, included my wife's television shows.  Turn them up all the way and I can drown out police sirens. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this headset is if you plan to get the 170 or 180.  The only bummer is that you can't remotely pause media when using these with a pc or phone like you can with a bluetooth headset.  However, I'm just nitpicking at this point. This is a win in my book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed

The RS130 had a transmitter stand with a built in charger for the headset.  Simply hag it up and it recharges.  The RS 160 has to be plugged in to a seperate charge cord.  The off/on and volume controls on the RS 160 are not easy to find and operate.  The unit came with a 3 foot single 40mm pin jack type cord.  In order to connect it to the output of my Bose unit I had to go to Radio shack and spend another $11 to purchase a cord with 2 phono plugs.On a positive note the sound the RS160 delivers is excellant and the range is as good as needed for my application.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser RS160 Digital wireless headphone

    ","I wanted to have some portable headphones that I could use with my laptop and my desktop at work. In the year 2011, I think it's ridiculous for most things to have wires, but was appalled at the lack of wireless choices. The thing I like most about this headset is the compact transmitter and the ability to run completely off batteries. It's a great fit for most things. The headphones are a little bulky, but that's part of the over-the-ear style. I'm pretty happy with them and they're good for a lot of different use-cases, but clearly not exercising, nor do they support bluetooth. The best part is that you can plug the transmitter and the headphones into the charger (if they are using rechargeable batteries) and they will charge. That's a nice feature.Things that really could have made it better:* For this price they really could have included 2 additional NiMh rechargeable batteries for the transmitter - Disappointing* The charging time for the headset is unusually long, requiring an initial charge of 16 hours! I know there are faster charging technologies out there* The buttons that control the volume and power/mute on the headphone are really hard to find by feel, and that's the way you have to use them. They should have been made larger with more noticeable gaps between them.* For the nearly $200 price tag I really expected a bit higher quality headset.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, but not spectacular"

    ","These headphones are very, very good! The sound quality is outstanding and there is absolutely no hiss or interference. It sounds as good, if not better, than most wired headphones. The price is a bit high, but the headphones are very high quality. The ability to power the transmitter with batteries is very convenient when you need to take these headphones on the go. For me, the transmitter had a range of about 50 feet inside my house (through several walls) and the range increased when it was out in the open (direct line of sight). The KLEER technology makes the music sound crystal clear. The battery life (rechargeable batteries) is also very good. I will admit that these headphones do not have a booming bass, but i never liked playing my music that way anyway and i feel that the bass is perfectly balanced with everything else. These headphones are also very comfortable. I have been able to wear them for several hours straight without feeling any discomfort, with the exception of my ears warming up a little bit every once and a while. I would highly recommend buying these headphones if you can spare the money for them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Headphones!!

    ",I bought these not expecting much and was utterly blown away by the sound quality.  The KLEER technology they use results in audiphile grade sound without any of the noise or interference I have had with previous wireless units.  I have used them constantly for television and critical listening to music (I'm a musician) for over a month and the batteries in the phones are still holding up.  The batteries in the small transmitter gave way after a week but it was easy to set up the supplied wall wart power.  They are especially great for late night TV and listening to music in my condo without disturbing the neighbors.  Reception is great even upstairs.  The phones design is very comfortable and they are well made.  The only disappointment was the lag in transmission made them unusable for playing my guitar.  For everything else you don't really notice it.  Highly recommended and worth the price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,paradigm shift

I was previously using an inexpensive ""As seen on TV"" pair of headphones, but the foam wasn't plush enough, so my ear touched the speaker grill. Halfway through a movie, it hurt.The Sennheiser ones are comfortable, thick pads, and blocks outside sound - sorry honey!  It's amazing to be able to hear the subtle background noises, voices are sharper, and it makes watching TV or a movie much more enjoyable.My TV uses RCA jacks or a 3.5 mm plug.  Only issue for me was when the system was plugged into my TV's headphone jack, the tv volume was disabled.  I bought a RCA to 3.5 mm adapter, and now we can turn off the TV volume when I'm watching with headphones or turn it back up when we both watch.I appreciate that the package comes with a splitter so you can power the wireless transmitter and charge the headphones.The only downside is that every time I want to use them, I have to push a button on both the transmitter and headphones, posssiblt to sync them.

    ","Wow wow and wow is all that I can say right now.

Not only is it easy to set up but comes with every accessory you would need except if your tv doesn't have a headphone port you have to get the adapter for the audio cables(the red and white ones).  Besides that they are truly wonderful, they come with several adaptors in case you ever happen to travel to the UK, AUS, or Europe.  After set up with installing the batteries in the hp and turning everything on I was completely blown away by the sound quality and pure essence of what I was listening to.

    ","I'm an audiophile, meaning I have quality audio equipment and great speakers.  I love music, and I pay a lot of attention to the sound quality.I tested about a dozen different wireless headphones from $50 to $250.

They work 360 degrees around the transmitter, which most sets don't  most sets i tested used ir - infrared transmitters, while these use rf - radio frequency ).  They transmit clearly without losing sound up to about 50ft ... or more if you have limited interference.  They last for about a week on a charge if used regularly every day  I use rechargeable AA batteries ).  The transmitter can be plugged in to a standard outlet via a supplied cable, or be run off of 2 AA batteries so you can take it on the road.The only downside is that these do not have a connector that allows them to plug directly into an audio source... you must use the transmitter.  This is a hassle when you don't care about them being wireless like on a plane.  I basically don't use them in situations like this... but probably wouldn't anyway because they are large and not easy to carry.They are super confortable and I regularly wear them for 12 hours straight while I work.These freaking rock and stand out among all wireless headsets including others tested from Sennheiser.",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are the best wireless headphones under $200.

    ","Due to being retired and hard of hearing, I purchased the RS 140 about 5 years ago to watch TV since it was becoming more difficult to hear the TV even with hearing aids. I was very impressed with the comfort and clarity of the headphones and purchased an additional 5 headphones (HDR 140) as the others wore out. They were so comfortable that I could wear them for over 12 hours a day or even fall asleep with them on and they never felt uncomfortable.As my latest HDR 140 headphones wore out, I discovered that they were discontinued and so I purchased the RS 160 wireless headphones. Although I had read that some people indicated they were uncomfortable, I was hoping that they would be comfortable but like others that are old with big sensitive ears, I find them to be much more uncomfortable than the much larger ear pads on the HDR 140. Although my ears appear to just fit into the ear pads, the tops of my ears appear to just touch the ear pads making my ears very sore within an hour or less. Also because of the small pads, my ears sweat much more.Overall the product is a very good product but for the heard of hearing, comfort and clarity are the two most important qualities of a good headphone. Unfortuantely Sennheiser has decided to create ear pads for the twenty something (like other manufacturers) instead of producing headphones that are suitable for the aged. I would be nice if Sennheiser would sell a headphone that had larger ear pads for the aged even if it cost more than other headphones.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great but Uncomfortable

This unit has to be plugged into a wire to recharge.  I count this as a good thing because I have a Logitech 890 remote where the charging contacts in the cradle go bad every other year.Works without line of sight.Comfortable.  May be a little heavy and your ears may get hot but it is a small price to pay to look like princess Leia.

    ","The headphones come with a AA recharger when the device uses AAA batteries.  The volume control goes on its own to maximum volume with loud beeping noise.  Sennheiser  states in an email to me:  ""The beeping you are experiencing is most likely due to a stuck ""volume+"" button. If you press this button and do not feel a""click"", this would confirm the issue. It is a simple fix that we would be happy to do for you- it involves removing the ear cushion,unscrewing the element baffle, and moving the battery contact/wires lightly to allow the button to operate properly.The headset is ""thinking"" that the volume button is being continually pressed, and the beeping is its way of saying ""stop pressing me"". Some models in early production runs have exhibited this behavior.""  The sound quality is good when it is not beeping. The range is also good.

    ","I really loved my earlier Sennheiser which worked beautifully for about 7 years until it stopped giving any sound. So I bought these ones as replacement, thinking this is the nearest model to the one I had.The sound quality is is still great in this new headset, but the engineering is not upto the mark.1. It uses AAA batteries, and somehow the charge only lasts one movie. In my original headset, there was a Sennheiser battery which lasted more than 3-4 movies. Also, there was a backup battery with a back charge station. So I never would run out. Now I have to buy a separate set of AAA batteries as well as a charger so I will have a charged battery supply ready, in case I run out.2. The range is a bit shorter that my original one and does not handle obstructions well, even though it is RF.3. The charging process is a bit clumsy. Earlier I could just hang my headset on the transmitter and it would start charging through a set of contacts. Now I have to insert a pin into an awkwardly angled hole in the headset. It still takes me a couple of tries to get the angle right. Extremely clumsy design.4. My largest issue is putting the thing ON. There is a push button switch on the headset as well as on the transmitter. BOTH have to be on. If you put headset for charging, then the transmitter is turned off. After charging, you decide to take the headset and sit on the couch to listen, you push the on switch on the headset. Only to realize that the transmitter has to be turned on.  In my earlier headset, there was a simple on and off switch, a physical switch. I might return or sell this headset exactly for this reason. I just want a simple on/off switch and not a logical switch which is dependent on the state of some other setting ( in this case the transmitter).Another irritating issue.....even if I manage to figure out how to switch it on, there is a delay of 1-2 sec for the sound to come on....which sometimes makes me thing I did not press the button so I press it again....only to realize I switched it off. So I start the process all over again.I am still a Sennheiser fan....not just of this model though.One positive aspect is that this set is portable. That means I can carry it for outdoor sources.....i.e. you can even carry the transmitting unit and have it operated via battery. Not sure how long the two AAA batteries in the transmitter will last.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as prior models

    ","I was suffering with these headphones for the last 3 years and now, finally, will throw them away. Here are the main problems:1. Too short range. In the past I was using RCA and Sony wireless headphones and they worked OK in every corner of my small house and even on back and frond yard. But Sennheiser RS 160 has stable receiving only in the same room where the transmitter is. If I walk to another room, sound drops intermittently. So, if you live in a studio apartment, these headphones may work for you. But in a multi-room house it is very frustrating. Minus 1 star.2. When I warm up food in microwave oven, RS 160 reception drops too often. I learned to turn on microwave and then run away as fast as possible and as far as possible to avoid loosing sound. But it is frustrating. Minus another star.3. The most irritating is that headphones slip and fall too often. They are pretty heavy and earpads and headband are covered with some extremely slippery plastic. So, even a slight nod of the head and headphones slip and fall. I learned to keep my head even, do not look down or up, do not shake the head while wearing RS 160, but cannot prevent all slips - they drop on the floor twice a month on average and already have many pieces broken. Once they almost fell in the toilet - I caught it in the last moment. Extremely infuriating. Minus 2 stars.4. In order to establish connection I have to push button on the transmitter. Normally I turn on the audio source with a remote control and expect the headphones to start immediately (like Sony or RCA did), but RS 160 does not start automatically - I have to run to the room where transmitter is and keep pushing that stupid button for some time before I can hear anything. Minus 1 star.5. I am listening all day and have to replace batteries every day (I cannot recharge them in place because I am wearing headphones all the time). Normal headphones (like Sony or RCA) had traditional easy-to-use battery doors, but RS 160 requires me to remove each ear piece and replace batteries that are hidden behind them. I have to hold headphones in one hand, earpieces in another hand, old batteries in another hand and new batteries in yet another hand. How many hands do I need? Why cannot they make battery replacement easier? Minus another star.Wait, I ran out of stars already. Will try another brand now.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Summary of problems after 3 years of using RS 160

    ","I ended up getting two consecutive pairs of defective refurbished RS160 headphones!  The first set would automatically and randomly start jacking up the volume and beep over and over (indicating the volume was at max level) and the volume up button didn't ""click"" the way it was supposed to.  So, I returned them to Dahmart who was pretty good about it and they sent me a replacement.  The second set of ""refurbs"" (I put it in quotations b/c they were not refurbished to proper functioning order obviously) had one channel/earphone that was louder/bassier than the other one.  I even tested other headphones with my receiver and the channels on the other set(s) were perfectly balanced, so I knew it was the RS160's, and I notified Dahmart to return them once and for all, which I did.  In short, I will NEVER buy another Sennheiser ""refurb"" product again.  As a side note, this is coming from someone who has purchased many a refurbished product and hadn't had any problems up until now.And as a kicker, just in case you were still pondering buying these;  besides the defects that I experienced, the headphones were very uncomfortable as the space you see between the pads on the band digs into your head after about 10 mins. and pulls on your hairs randomly causing discomfort.  They had lousy $20 headphone sound quality with absolutely no bass and lousy treble (my hd202's are crappy and they sounded better), the range was pretty lousy, and they were very cumbersome.  Also you have to turn on the base before you can use them and it shuts off automatically after a few minutes of downtime, which is a very stupid feature on a wireless product.  Basically, buy yourself an extension cable for $5, get a nice pair of wired headphones for $30-$40 and have a much better experience whilst keeping some money in your pocket as a bonus.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Uncomfortable with lousy sound quality, stay FAR away from the refurbs"

They all had a low level buzz, connection problems and the sound quality was terrible on all 3 with too much bass, no mid and almost no high. I spent between $100-$230 on the SONY and they were all bad.Never used Sennheiser before so I thought the low price model was a good starting point and they are fantastic. One of the biggest selling points for me aside from not being blutooth was the fact you can replace the batteries on your own. SONY and pretty much every other headphone maker has built in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician at a factory or whatever and frankly thats nonsense. The fact I can just pop some new batteries in was an absolute deal maker for me.The only downside to these is the leather ear cups. They seal onto your head really well but make your ear sweat like crazy. But this is easily remedied by picking up a pair of cloth ear cups from ebay for around $6. Now these are damn near perfect for the price and I would recommend them to everyone.Mind you there are better headphones out there for sound quality and what not, but youre going to pay a premium. For the price of around $100, the value is outstanding and after nearly a year of daily use gaming and movie watching, I cant think of any real negatives about them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing value and quality for the price

    ","I have cheaper set of Seenheiser wireless headphones that I have had for a few years. The volume control was malfunctioning, so I decided to buy this new set.  The sound quality on these headphones is good, and there is no hiss.  But, I was disappointed with the volume.  No, where near the volume of my old set.  They are reasonably comfortable, but the ear pads have no ventilation causing sweat to form where they contact your head at just room temperature (70 deg F).  There are three control buttons near the bottom of the right ear piece, volume up and down and on/off.  It takes a little getting used to without taking the headphones off and looking at which button is which.  Plugging the charge plug into the headphones is kind of awkward and difficult if you don't have it aligned straight in.  And, why didn't they offer a charge cradle set up?  For the money ($200) I expected more.Update:  I upgraded my TV and it had no headphone jack and only digital audio out.  The only way I could get the these headphones to work on the digital audio out, was to purchase a digital to analog converter box.  After that they worked fine and with adequate volume.  I've noticed the earpiece material is cracking, perhaps it's from me wiping them off with disinfectant wipes.  Also, I've notice the microwave when running will interfere with reception.

    ","I purchased these for use around the office - mostly at my desk. They are comfortable, easy to get going - just a power button on the base and on the headphones, and there is absolutely no static, buzzing, or other noise. When leaving the room and going beyond the claimed 30' range (more like 15 through some walls), the sound just cuts out with no alarming or annoying disconnection noise. Sound quality until that point is the same as it is while sitting at my desk.The sound quality is fairly good in the mid to high range. Some very rich music can tax the drivers, causing a slight buzzing to mar otherwise brilliant sound. Turning down a slider or two on the equalizer remedies this and it doesn't really bother me. BUT the bass is quite lacking - even missing in some cases. I'm not a bass junkie, but I like clean, rich, tight bass. The bass on these headphones is clean and tight, but it doesn't seem to be present as it does when listening to the same music on other cans - even some that cost half as much (I know, these are wireless...). It doesn't seem proportional to the highs and mids. Turning up the bass through and equalizer doesn't really resolve the issue as it becomes less defined.I bought the 160s over the 170s for the following reasons:- smaller transmitter fit my cramped desk better.- I didn't need longer range.- I feared that the ""bass boost"" touted on the 170s would be gimmicky and not work well.I still don't know how well the bass boost on the 170s works, but knowing what I know now, I would buy them over the 160s even with the additional cost.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice wireless solution, but leaves me wanting a bit more."

    ","Soooo many wrong info in the bad posts, one even by a guy that admits he never even tried these great headphones. I got mine 2 months ago and have used extensively and can tell you the following:Wireless RF and certainly NOT IR! Means you can go say 50 feet from the base unit in any direction, and still get signal. Headphone battery strength and transmitter battery strength will affect distance. As most typically never leave the room, these are outstanding. 10 out of 10.Battery life in the headphones is pretty outstanding I think. I fall asleep and the phones are on for hours when I shut off and the next night they are still ready to go for another flick. I'd rate 8.5 out of 10.They are comfortable and cover the ear. When sitting listening, never got hot. Exercising tho yes, ears get hot. 9 out of 10 for comfort.The limitation this has is you cannot 'crank it up' without overdriving the transmitter to distortion. The flashing green power on LED turns red when overloaded. I would personally like to be able to turn the phones louder, but it is probably best not to as at top volume they are loud enough easily. 7 out of 10The sound quality itself is outstanding, especially with a good headphone amp. Bass is not overpowering but is to me, substantial. Perfect to lose yourself in a movie. Music is pretty sweet also, tho mainly these are used at night when the kids are asleep. 10 out of 10I would easily recommend these to anyone that doesn't want to be tethered down to a cord. These go on road trips for the kids. Add another headset and they both watch the DVDs and mom and I can talk. Perfect!

    ","I got those headphones as a replacement to my RS120.As the 120 are not digital you may have interference which those have not (being digital and all) so that is a definitive plus.Unboxing I was a little dissapointed to not find a RCA to headphone converter. I use them mainly for TV watching and my TV does not have a headphone jack, only standard (red/white) stereo out etc. So had to run and get one, no big deal but would have loved of they were included.Since those are also built for mobile devices i.e. you can carry the sender pod around if you put batteries in it, I understand that it does not have a charging cradle like the 120's. Still having to plug in the charging cable into the headphones is a little annoying.Last gripe, they turning on process. There were times where I turned them on not how Sennheiser thinks I should and they apparently got annoyed and did not play. You pretty much 'have to' turn on base first and then the headphones, each with a 1s press. Little odd, but no deal-breaker.The sound is awesome. Not too bass-heavy like some other overpriced brands. They sound just right, especially for TV.Small think I like is that volume controls etc are at the bottom and not the back (like on the 120's) which could be pushed accidentally brushing by the couch etc.Overall a great set - very loud if you want them to be.",4.0 out of 5 stars,RS120 replacements

    ","I am really conflicted about these. I can enjoy them (and I mean REALLY enjoy them!) for about an hour. Then the top of my head will hurt. I've tried adjusting them every which way, but the headband is just flawed. The basic problem is that the weight of the entire headphone rests on just one spot on the headband due to the missing section where the charger connector goes on the more expensive models. Where the headband should be resting on your head, evenly distributing the weight, there is nothing, so the weight is left for the rigid edges of the padding on either side of the gap, which slowly dig into your head.Why couldn't they just put a continuous pad on this model? There is no reason for the gap on this model. Or even use a nice tensioned band to evenly spread the weight?The volume control is not intuitive, and sometimes the power buttons act funny. It is also hard to get to the batteries since they are behind the ear pads rather than behind the outer shell like most other wireless headphones. I would prefer to remove the batteries for charging rather than charging them in the headphones, but that is not practical with this unit. However, these are minor problems compared to the headband comfort issue.The included batteries are nice Sanyo Eneloop NiMH AAAs, a big thumbs up there!The transmitter is quite small and has good range.The sound quality is wonderful. It is rich, clear, and interference free.In the end, I am disappointed in the flaws, especially at this price point.

I plan to stick with the rechargeable type.  Some say turning on the base to use the headphones is a pain, but how hard is pushing a button when you pick up the headphones next to it.  I have only had to pair the headphones to the base once, not before every use.  Finally the actual headphones are the most comfortable I have tried, better then RS120.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for what I needed

    ","I've literally never written a review for Amazon (even though I buy from Amazon all the time), but I felt compelled to write a review as I did a lot of research to find the perfect pair of wireless TV headphones for me at this price range. I had been using the Sennheiser RS 120 for maybe 4-5 years.  They were relatively cheap at the time (about $70), and great for the price- worked well, lasted long, etc.  They finally burnt out on me a few weeks ago, but I definitely got my money's worth with them.This time I wanted basically the same type of headphones, and the only real difference I wanted was to have leather ear pieces- which I knew would be a little more expensive but I was OK with that. These fell into my price range, and I felt like I was purchasing the same set of headphones as the RS 120 but just upgraded a little and had leather. However, I enjoyed the older cheaper RS 120's much better.The good about these headphones- Sound Quality. They are noise canceling and you really don't hear much around you when they are on unlike the RS 120. There is no hissing like the RS 120 and the frequency seems to be stable.The bad about these headphones- The volume doesn't go up nearly as much as my old cheap RS 120's, which is a shame. The leather has no ventilation so you really do start to have sweat drip down at room temperature (I saw someone else write about this and thought it was funny, but it actually is true). The volume control buttons and on/off buttons are REALLY a pet peeve of mine.  The old cheap RS 120's had a turn knob for volume, and a simple on/off switch on the side of the headphones. They were not fancy at all but did the job. These have digital buttons you must push. So moving the volume up and down takes a lot longer than the old looking 120's, and the on/off button is in between the volume up and volume down, and is extremely awkward to access.  Also, on the old cheap 120's, you turn the headset off and place it on a cradle to charge. Simple! On these, you have to hold the oddly placed on/off button down for a second, then go to the base and hold that down for a second, and sometimes its hard to tell whether it's on or off. It seems like such a hassle every time. And there is no cradle for charging the headset?? You just put it on the floor next to the base? How lame is that? (Hence why it is levitating in the picture). Why did I get more out of the old cheap looking pair? I would expect for the money- at least to have a place to set the headset.All in all my biggest gripes with this headset are the logistics and non-user friendly manner in which it is devised- which might sound petty but when you have to go through that annoying routine every single day it adds up and makes a difference. The actual sound (which is why we buy this product) is actually pretty good. Aside from the volume levels being sub par, the quality of the sound is definitely better than the RS 120's. But just keep in mind all the Con's to this product.  I probably would have looked for a more user-friendly headset if I had know..",3.0 out of 5 stars,NOT Exactly what I thought I was getting- Buyer Beware

874,"on January 2, 2014",,"Just got these as a gift from my wonderful girlfriend for Christmas. I was a little bit skeptical based on some of the Amazon reviews but as the title says, Sennheiser didn't let me down. I'm used to wearing cheap $20 Sony headphones or the Apple earbuds to listen to my music so naturally, these cans are a huge upgrade.AUDIO:Sound quality is actually very good. Very clear. At full volume hooked up to my Mac Pro and playing Spotify, they don't boast all that much in terms of bass so if you're looking for a lot of bass, look elsewhere. I personally can live without bass drowning out the other sound ranges so it's not the end of the world.FEATURES:The buttons on the actual headphones are little hard to get used to. I found myself hitting the power button by accident multiple times so I've opted to just get my audio levels figured out via the source I've got the receiver plugged into. In terms of charging the headphones and receiver, I'm not a fan of wires (hence buying these in the first place) so the fact that there is no charging dock is a little annoying but if that's what you want, they have the models above the RS 160.SETUP:Setup was very straight forward. You'd need to be a neanderthal to not figure it out.COMFORT:Comfort level is a bit of a let down. The very top of my head starts to get a little ""sore"" after a few hours of wearing, I've found that sometimes I need to take them off and take a short break. I luckily have not experienced the ""sweaty ears"" that others have.CONCLUSION:My girlfriend paid $128 for these so they're a huge bargain and I love them but I think my next set of headphones will be a pair of Sennheisers with the docking station. If not for the discomfort on the top of my head, I'd have given these five stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser didn't let me down.
875,"on January 5, 2014",,"I bought these at Best Buy online, which is why this isn't a confirmed Amazon purchase.I've been using a set of Sennheiser 380 Pro headphones for 3 years, mainly to watch TV without disturbing my family. But I got tired of seeing the extension cord draped across the living room, and tired of coiling it up after each use. When the RS 160 came on sale I bit.The 160s are not as comfortable as the 380 Pro. They're a little tighter on the ears, and the headband uses more spring loading to push the cans against your ears for a good seal. It's effective, though, since the 160s block out more sound than the 380 Pro. The cans themselves are smaller on the 160, which makes them a little less comfortable. I've used them for a week and have become accustomed to them. I don't mind them being a little tight.The 160s don't sound quite as good as the 380s, either, but the different is slight.  I experience no humming, buzzing or other extraneous noises while listening to the 160s, and the reception is perfect anywhere in our 1000 SF concrete apartment. The 160s produce fairly well balanced sound. For reference, my speakers are Def Tech STS Mythos, which really kick ass. The low end of these 160s is much better than I expected. Nothing can beat my speakers, but these RS 160s sound quite acceptable for movies and HD TV reception.In summary, while I won't give the sound and general comfort a 5, they're a solid 4 to me.Others have mentioned a few complaints about the RS 160s, notably the volume controls on the headphones and the difficulty plugging them in for recharging. Yes, the controls are hard to see and small, but I never watch with the speakers on - only with the headphone jack in to shut off the speakers. In this situation, it's easy to use the remote for the receiver to set the volume, so I never use the headphone volume control. YMMV.The charging jack is, indeed, a little difficult to plug into the RS 160s. It's a small annoyance which I'm willing to tolerate in exchange for going cordless. I prefer using the cordless without a charging cradle - it would just take up more space, and in an apartment, minimalism equates to a roomy, uncluttered feeling.The RS 160 isn't perfect. I'd give them a 5 if they had the comfort of my 380 pros even though they don't sound quite as good.  The difference in sound quality is minimal - perhaps I'd rate the sound of the 380 Pros as 9, and the RS 160s as 7 out of 10. I'd rate the sound of the 380 Pros as 8 out of 10 and the RS160s as 7. They're completely acceptable for what I want at the price I paid ($119.98) and I'm satisfied with this purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent value, Very good wireless headphone"

    ","Sound is great (which is a product of the KleerAudio Technology, and not anything Sennheiser engineered) but the build quality on these virtually all plastic headphones is disappointing.  First, the ear pieces keep breaking off their clips (and Sennheiser charges an unconscionable $25-30 for replacement of these cheap plastic parts).  I have gone through 4 sets of ear pieces now in just two years -- which means I have spent half again as much as the headphones themselves in spare parts.  Second, after just two years of moderate use my volume buttons stopped working, making it impossible to turn up the volume and, thus making the earphones unusable.Also, I bought the RS-160s precisely because the transmitter was marketed as ""portable"" -- which it is  -- but the transmitter base is HUGE (several times the size of most MP3 players).  Every other KleerAudio transmitter currently on the market that I have found are all quite compact and far more comparable in size to most mp3 players -- so why can't Sennheiser produce a similar small-sized transmitter, rather than this huge round, gargantuan disk?I will very likely stick with KleerAudio headsets in the future because their sound quality is great, but given the design flaws I have mentioned here with my Sennheiser RS-160s, I will likely go with another brand.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor quality, transmitter is too big for portable use...but sound quality is really good for wireless."

Seems there is no auto-off if you forget to turn off.  You really have to make sure you turned them off, by checking the led.  Sometimes it's a bit tricky to get them on, as they don't seem to sync properly, of you turn them off instead of on, vice versa.

    ","Overall these sound great, very clear. Loads better than the old RF pair I had. Zero hiss, zero buzz, just sound when you want it.  Three complaints: 1) They don't fold, so forget about these being good for travel--without at least a hinge in the middle they are strictly homebound.  This also makes storing them a pain, they take up a lot of room in a cabinet or drawer and don't stow away neatly.  Why Sennheiser makes the effort to have an option to use the transmitter on batteries to make it portable, and then makes the headphones themselves thoroughly unportable, I don't get.  (2) Slightly tight if you have a large head (like me).  Not large ears, I mean a big hat size. Comfortable, but after an hour or so I had enough and had to stop using them. (3) I know this may sound silly, but good lord, the freaking clamshell packaging! After narrowly avoiding damaging the headphones themselves trying to cut through the plastic with scissors, I cut myself and drew blood on the razor sharp plastic edge. I was furious at Sennheiser before I even tried their product. Took me 10 minutes of struggling just to get the things out of the package.

    ","I regret this purchase and am extremely frustrated by this product.I had some difficulty initially pairing the headphones with the base.  I finally had to follow a video from the website because I could not find good written instructions.  (I find this frustrating because I can read through a list of instructions faster than I can watch someone slowly speak on a video).If my initial experience was the only problem, I would have rated this product much higher.  The problem that I have is that 1 out of 3 or 1 of 4 times I try to use it, I end up spending ten or fifteen minutes trying to get the speaker to properly pair with the base.  Sometimes I just give up and decide to either watch TV without it or just not watch at all.Perhaps part of the problem is that the power button is used for initial pairing, and it seems to have something to do with how long you hold the button. It seems like if I release the button a half of a second too early, then I end up spending a lot of time trying to get it to work.I would not recommend this product or any of the Sennheiser wireless headsets to anyone, as some of the other models seem to use the same pairing method.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Great If You Love Troubleshooting Pairing Issues

Overall, I'm still very happy with them.  They lose feel also wasn't a problem.

However, my TV didn't have the headphone connection and only had the digital 'Toslink optical' out.

When I bypassed that device and just plugged up to my Samsung tablet the sound was absolutely great.  I'll have to return the DBTech converter and try something else to get it to work with the TV.  If the Sennheiser transmitter would have given more connection options I would have easily given this product a 5 star rating.

Problem is that I have a hard time hearing some of the lower voice talking on TV so I turn the volume up. Then all of a sudden there is a burst of sound from whatever and it's shockingly loud. I frantically try to lower the volume while she mumbles and punches me in the arm. Enter the Sennheiser wireless headphones. Now I can listen without bothering her at all. Perfect!  Some reviews have stated that there is still a small hiss being heard when they listen. I found this to be the case as well, however it is *not* the headphones. If I listen to the TV I hear that hiss, but if I switch to a movie or Hulu (smart tv) it goes away. I believe it to either be the TV itself or perhaps my DVR since the TV signal goes thru that fist. Something to keep in mind if this happens to you.  While these are pretty clear/nice/quality headphones, if you are a real stickler for music sound quality, you're probably going to want a much better wired pair. However my opinion is that these are great for an average listener who's looking for wireless convenience. While I use it for TV, I've tried music and it sounds great. I'll admit I'm OK with an MP3 bit rate of 192 and can't tell the difference really between that and 320. There's an audiophile somewhere that just stabbed himself in the eye. Sorry about that.  Others are looking for something to exercise with. The ear pieces are leather-like so you probably will sweat and slide a bit in these. You may be happier with the ear pieces from the 180 model as they are fabric. I believe you can purchase those separately if you decide the 180 model is not exactly what you're looking for.  I only have a 12 foot distance need, give or take, and they work great. I did try to walk down the hall and they managed to go about 20 feet before losing reception (about 3 walls resistance). I do have an older house with thick plaster walls and metal mesh lathe so any wireless electronic gets pushed to its limits in my house. I'd never have a real need for that distance so it doesn't effect my opinion of them at all. In a ""regular"" drywall application they likely fare better.  I did knock a star for the same reason others have knocked them for. The power and volume buttons are a little hard to decipher by touch alone. The power button is in the middle of the volume up/down and while it does have a raised circle on it, it's pretty hard to feel it out. It should be raised up more or the button moved entirely to better distinguish it. Perhaps power on one ear and volume rocker on the other. All three in one place just doesn't work well in my opinion and, like others, I tend to hit the power button and muting them while trying to feel for the volume. I find it easier to just take them off so I can see what I'm doing and hit a click on the volume and put them back on. I don't change the volume that much to find this bothersome anyway.  I had considered the cheaper model 120 at first, however I'm glad I went with the upgraded 160. The 120 is RF so it's like dialing in a radio channel. Maybe you get it spot on, but it could move or change over time. The 160 model and above digitally auto-tune so you don't worry about it. I find that a much better choice, particularly since I got them for in-bed usage and was afraid I'd keep moving the tuner by rubbing up on a pillow or something. Very glad I went with the next model up.  Battery life has been good so far. I use them for about an hour or two every night and they have been lasting a week or more without a charge. I actually have not encountered them running out of charge yet as I typically plug them in once a week anyway. With the headphone off the base turns off after some time as well which works well for me. I turn on the base, turn on the headphone, climb in to bed and watch TV until I'm tired. Take the headphones off, turn them off and put them on the nightstand. The base turns itself off at some point. I do like that they are rechargeable batteries but not molded into the headphones. They are actually ""regular"" batteries that you could take out and replace if the ones that come with ever stop holding a charge. That's a nice thought because the headphone may very well outlast the batteries anyway and it's a shame to toss a product just because the battery doesn't hold a charge anymore.  If you are still undecided, search youtube for ""Sennheiser 160 review"" or watch the videos from ""HiFi Heaven"". This guy does a real good job of reviewing Sennheiser headphones and others. After watching him, it pretty much solidified my opinion that the 160 model was the one for me, and I'm glad I got it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for average headphone user

Being born and raised outside of Selma, Alabama there was little to do but listen to a mono channel radio, while wandering the woods.

I found out I especially loved Acid Rock and Hard Rock songs which gave a meditation type emotion. Unfortunately  the radios of the early 70's to mid 80's were terrible sound reproducers....After I graduated from High school I found a job at the local Mall and the Radio Shack outlet. This exposed me to extremely high quality amplifiers/receivers and Supreme speakers which introduced me to the Excellent sound which I had not known before.

This is the first set of headphones that I've owned that cost more than $40.  I think they're great.  I've used them all around the house and out in the yard and no problems at all.  I almost canceled the order when I read that people were saying that you can't use them to watch video because of a sound delay.  I use them to watch TV with them plugged into the stereo and play Xbox.  I also listen to satellite radio via my computer with them.  I have had no problems with delay at all.  I even played the TV volume while listening to them to test for one and if it is there I sure couldn't tell.I really don't understand why anyone would have trouble plugging in the charging jack/plug.  Very easy, just like any other headphones that I've ever used.My only complaint would be the buttons.  They could have made the volume buttons a little easier to feel for and find.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy

    ","The sound of these headphones is wonderful but there are a few design features that I really don't like; i.e.,#1 Everytime you turn off the headphone, you also shut down the transmitter which means that everytime you want to turn on the headphone, you have to leave your easy chair to turn on the transmitter. Didn't have to do that with my old el cheapo Sennheiser HDR 116's. Transmitter was always on. And, believe me, the power consumption for that is minimal.#2  The volume and on/off controls are meshed together and embedded in the headset. Good luck adjusting them without removing the headset from your noggin!#3  Not a biggy but a battery charging cradle for the headset would be nice -- cheaper Sennheisers have it.This isn't a design issue, but the Canadian price @$299 (Best Buy, Future Shop) for these headphones is WAY out of line. Fortunately I found them in Ontario for $187 and Future Shop matched that, but in the USA you can pick'm up for $136!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound is great, but the design?"

    ","I really like the audio that these headphones produce - and the AA powered transmitter is all the better. I've never  had interference with them, and battery life seems is great on my set.Cons: In their natural form, they are made for people with large heads, and I'm a fairly small-headed guy, so I had to stuff the interior of the ear-enclosures with ruffled up paper so that they would make a somewhat air-tight seal around my ears. Without this, they lack bass response and tend to slip off of my head due to their own weight. Their grip appears to loosen with time as well, so it is really only a matter of time before they become unusable for me. Unfortunate, but small-headed people have to deal with this all the time.As always, Sennheiser makes a superior product.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great audio for large heads!
900,"on February 4, 2014",,"From a quality point of view, these headphones offer excellent sound, rivaling many wired headphones. Also, the included accessories are rather generous: additional tips for the power adapter so it can be used in 4 regions, and the Cadillac of rechargeable NiMH batteries (Eneloop).On the mechanical side, the only outstanding feature is the very small and hence unobtrusive transmitter. As a side note, it can operate from both batteries and the power adapter, although it will not recharge the batteries. Only the headset has a built-in charger.The downside from a quality standpoint is the mechanical build. The headphones are all plastic with no torsional stiffness to speak of. Most other brands will have a metallic headband for durability. The padding on the ear cups appears low quality, being thin leatherette (whatever that is) which will wear out fast. Sennheiser is likely aware of this, so they made the padding replacable, at a cost of $24 + $9 shipping + tax, which is very expensive for what it is. But at least it is replaceable. A further grudge is that the ear cups do not rotate a full 90 degrees, so you can't fold the headphones flat. Due to this, I ended up buying a Sennheiser HH-10 headphone holder. Then, there is the issue of the 3 control buttons on the headset, which are flush with each other and it takes some time to get used to.From a comfort point of view, they are excellent, no pressure points and they stay on.The MSRP is plain ridiculous. If you can get it for about 40-50% off, then these are very much worthy wireless headphones despite the mechanical flaws.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound, poor mechanics"

Besides that, if you can live with that to get an awesome way to listen to movies, watch sport or play video games this is a great buy.Oh I almost forgot to mention that you can plug any music devices in it if you want and use them as wireless headphones.

It's easy to accidentally turn the volume all the way down and go back and forth between the power buttons on the transmitter and the phones trying to get some sound to come out.  More tactile controls would be a big improvement: a real on-off switch with two positions for the power, and a thumb wheel for the volume.Finally, there's one forked cable to both power the transmitter and charge the headphones, so you have to store the phones near the transmitter.

An added benefit, IMO, is the RS 160 comes with rechargeable Enloop AAA[2] batteries which are precharged.The on/off, volume controls/mute are at the bottom of the right can, and it does take a bit getting accustomed to the 'feel', so they don't have to be removed to make the adjustments.I've experimented with a few wired and wireless headphones, and the RS 160 is the winning performer.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Out of The Box Delight.....

    ","Unfortunately, none of the digital headphone systems will allow you to watch TV with your loved ones.

Gotta say I am a little disappointed as I have had wireless sennheisers for about 7 years most recently the 120 series and the range on those were excellent. I could go out to my backyard while mowing the lawn and still get decent sound.  With these, if I go up the stairs to my kitchen (about 40-45 feet max) they just shut off.  That is pretty dismal if you ask me.  Sure the sacrifice is sound quality is better but people buy wireless cause they dont want to be tethered too close to the device at times. So both range and quality would have been a win. Also on the older units the volume controls could be easily felt with your hand without removing headphones from head as the mechanism was a turning knob as opposed to idiotic push switches where the +/_and on/off are located one after the other and if the headphones are worn inverted it is confusing on which is + and which is minus.  I gave the engineers at Plantronics similar advice (we buy a ton of their excellent products) but the stupid button on the voyageur pro did not stick out so had to pinch ear to turn on and off, I digress but bring this up since it is a similar issue that Sennheiser has gone backwards in technology.  Sure, Kleer is clear, much less hissing than the previous 120 series and what I also like better is that when I restart my video it instantly comes on, unlike the old series where there was hesitation (and hiss which Is why I switched in the first place.  Have always trusted Sennheiser for headphones for music or video (for voice only the nod goes to Plantronics) Other than the range, the volume control switches and the lack of any bass (low end and some of the midrange is muddy) I would say I am quasi pleased but not completely pleased.  The other thing that p_ssed me off was the fact that with the 120 series (cheaper model) it came with a stand where I could just charge the headset by hanging on the charging stand.  With this more expensive unit I have to do what? Plug a cord into the headphone itself? What a joke, and a step backwards again in technology? I must admit I did not do research and thought the disc base (from seeing it in picture) somehow was a charging stand that you could just simply place your headphones on top but boy was I surprised by having to plug in a cord. The other good thing though is that the charge lasts 24 hours (not tested yet) so that means you should be able to go more than a week without charging assuming using 2 - 3 hours a day. All in all, I rated these 3.5/5 stars due to the comfort, build quality, no hiss, great sound and 24 hr charge.  My last peeve was they did not supply batteries for the transmitter.

There is no static, they just cut out.  If it wasn't for that, I would give them five stars.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Good Around Microwaves
928,"on January 5, 2015",,Our Panasonic plasma TV didn't have a headphone jack so I had to do some research to see how I could hook up the headphones to the TV...was a pain but finally figured it out. The headphones work very well. One more thing...they do get a little heavy after watching a while. But oh so useful when watching TV whilst the kids are sleeping.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good investment

930,"on February 1, 2011",,"The unit works well with the TV in my living room.The slight sound delay observed by other buyers is perfectly acceptable for this type of usageThe unit fits well over the ears, the sound quality is definately better than what a flat TV can deliver.Some user complained about accidentally switching off the unit when trying to press the volume buttons. I ackowledge the issue, but in my case, the sound level is also controlled by the TV remote. It comes natural to adjust the volume this way instead of using the built-in controls.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well

    ",Excellent audio quality.....not happy that the volume cannot go loud at all. Its loud enough to hear everything is there is no loud ambient noises. With screaming kids around they are far too quiet.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent audio quality
932,"on April 1, 2012",,I have had this headset for over two years and it has worked very well.  Not sure why anybody would dislike this product.  I use these headphones for work and have used various other wireless headphones e.g. Sony and these are much better set being that this headset is digital.  They have a great wireless range.  I would recommend a set of these to anyone.  Buy them refurbished like me to try save on the hefty price tag.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Headset!

    ","I bought these based on user reviews here and elsewhere.  The sound is clear and full.  The ear cups are very comfortable for long wear. The head strap is also very comfortable.  I'm very satisfied with the sound quality and wear-ability.  But, the UI is pretty weak for these headphones.  Another reviewer complained about battery life.  However, I think that's probably part of the same problem.  What I'm referring to is the multifunction switch used to turn the headphones on/off and also to mute the sound.  If the phones are 'on' and you press the switch momentarily, you put the headphones into mute.  If left in that condition, the batteries will drain.  To turn the phones off, you have to press and hold for approximately 1 second.  That I can live with.  What really gripes me is that even when the base unit is plugged into wall power, it will shut off automatically whenever you turn off the phones.  This means that every time I want to use them, I have to press a switch on both units.  Why can't the base unit stay on when it's not being powered by batteries?  I mean, how many people are going to use batteries for the base unit anyway?  If that's a problem, why not program the multifunction switch to turn on the base unit when the headphones are energized?",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, comfortable, but why in the world..."

    ","I am not an audiophile by any means, but these were horrible, even for me (which is saying a lot). The hiss/static is incredibly loud. It was so loud even turning the sound all the way up didn't help to cover it. The static did not increase once turning up, but it was still very loud even under all the TV sound and drowned it out.I googled and watched videos to trouble shoot everything. I tried everything- different connections, standing right next to the transmitter, moving into different areas of the house and the awful noise would not go away. I tried changing volumes on the headphones, transmitter and TV. So, basically I did everything possible to get these to work.I also was disappointed in the sound quality. I have a pair of normal, corded headphones I paid under ten for and they are 10x better in sound. These have no bass at all. It is literally all treble. And these are hot. Very HOT. Within 5 minutes of wearing them my ears were sweating and uncomfortable. Again, my cheap headphones didn't even get hot!If you want to take a chance, go ahead, but don't say I didn't warn you.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am no audiophile, but these are very low quality"
937,"on April 30, 2013",,I had to adjust the volume on the headphones initially to avoid sound distortions. It has worked really well after that.

938,"on July 22, 2011",,"I recently got these headphones, absolutely love everything about them, super comfortable, great sound, everything. Only thing that has frustrated me is the range, if I walk from my room to the kitchen, most of the time I lose the sound, it's only like 25 feet. Do the walls really hurt the range that much?

    ","There are so many things wrong with these ""state of the art"" headphones that I'll start by saying, ""If this is what the digital, electronic state of our world is coming to, we are all in a lot of trouble!""  There is a real problem with trying to tell if they are on or off, if you take them off and set them down. The green light blinks off and on all night long......on or off!! There is no indicator light letting you know if they are on or off! (seems like a pretty simply thing to have on an item this expensive???). Everytime you turn the headphones off, the transmitter, sitting at the unit, across the room, turns itself off also.....so you have to get up, turn the transmitter back on. (Seems like a pretty stupid idea for a wireless unit to have???)There are dead spots on these as I walk throughout the house and it's pretty mind boggling why the inexpensive ones I had for the last 10 years never did that?? Do we really need to have TWO separate buttons to turn the volume up and down?? Don't Potentiometers (volume knobs, pots, etc!!)work pretty well for us, and for the last 100 years?? I just don't get why the puter geeks need to change everything instead of making what works better?  Do you really need to try and re-invent the wheel, when it still works pretty good? I am just an ordinary person, that wants something that works and is user friendly. Did they really have to put the off/on button between the volume buttons??? It does have a little raised feel to it, so we can avoid turning the unit up and down, when we're trying to turn it off, but this will take some getting used to, and I'm a pretty electronic person. For your money, AVOID these and see if you can't find something better, more user friendly! This isn't Brain Surgery and we shouldn't be subjected to others stupidity/in-ability/ineptness, just to try and listen to our music/TV's, in peace and quiet. Don't waste your money and look elsewhere. These are in no way worth the hassle.Just my two cents worth,Rocky!",2.0 out of 5 stars,You can get better then these!!!

    ","Purchased RS 160 headphones for 90 year old father.  Placed transmitter up high on top of furniture where the old 900 MHz transmitter was and cables already existed to A/V equipment in entertainment console.  Headphones worked pretty well out of the box.  Buttons are too close together and multifunction button is hard to locate by feeling and somewhat tricky for an older person to use.  When the headpones are set down for the evening or for too long a period of time, they will not work the next morning or after too long a period of time.  The transmitter will switch to standby mode and will not wake up unless you touch the button on the transmitter.  If you have placed the transmitter in an inaccessible location to hide it and give good coverate, you are out of luck until you gain access to it.  Multiple times a day.  Another example of a product designed by somebody who doesn't have to use it.  I would not buy these headphones again and I am attempting to return them.",1.0 out of 5 stars,RS 160 is a bad design

    ","We did not purchase these at Amazon, but we did read alot of reviews on the product and it seemed like a good selection for wireless headphones. We were wrong. The transmitter kept needing to be reset, even when I was sitting 2 feet from it! The sound was great - when it was there! Very frustrating and infuriating. The user manual was useless - obviously hastily put together in a low cost country because there is no technical information for troubleshooting. Problem with no sound? Hit the transmitter button - again! Ridiculous.Buyer beware! Obviously some sets work, but if you are not the lucky one, you could get a lemon like we did.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Transmitter does not work consistently

    ","I had a set of wireless headphones for 12 years that were absolutely fabulous - huge range, no fadeouts, little static.  In comparison, these, which are supposedly top of the line, are HORRIBLE!  They only worked if I was in the apartment, and even then, bizarre fadeouts lasted from 1-5 seconds, sometimes from left ear to right ear!  Today I attempted to take these outside to listen to music/NPR while gardening (one of my main reasons for purchasing wireless headphones).  I didn't even make it down to the first floor when they just faded out with no return.  I tested them by going in and out, walked to different parts of the yard and the house, each floor, etc.  The only outdoor space in which the phones functioned was the part of the yard closest to the den, where I have the transmitter.  These phones literally need to be IN LINE WITH THE TRANSMITTER!!  AWFUL.  I understand that you can take the transmitter and hook it up to any device, but that does me no good since I, like most people, have ONE stereo setup in my home.I also found myself dissatisfied with their performance with rock/hard rock/metal.  I love all types of music, but these seemed to work best with easy listening (Billy Joel) and classical.Setup : If you have owned wireless phones before, you can use the illustrated quick setup guide.  Otherwise, the user manual is on cd, in pdf format.  The short length of the trasmitter wires (transmitter to device) makes for cramped usage.Extremely disappointed.

    ","The Rs 160 is not an update of the Rs 130. It is a different technology. The 130 allows you to go from room to room and maintain your connection. I can even go out in the back yard. The 160 is Line-of-Sight. That means you have to be able to see the transmitter to get reception in the headset.  I have not used the 160 and cannot comment on the sound quality. The 130 gives good (not excellent) sound. The only drawback on the 130 is that the surround sound feature can allow the music to overwhelm the dialogue on some tv programs; however, that feature can be turned off.",3.0 out of 5 stars,NOT like RS130
