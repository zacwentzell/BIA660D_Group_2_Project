    ","I was deciding between Sennheisers RS 175 and RS 185. I knew going into it that the RS 175 would have given me more bass due to it being a closed headphone, but I've owned my fair share of Sennheiser wireless enclosed earphones enough to know that you sacrifice soundstage making a set of closed cans feeling more muffled. The other thing is closed cans can build up heat and make your ear area kind of sweaty, so I choose to go for the open RS 185's. The thing is, they were on sale at the time, only $30 more than the RS 175's, so I jumped at the opportunity and saved myself close to $100. Even so, they're still expensive, but, in my opinion, completely worth it.Like I said, I've had experience with Sennheiser RS wireless headphones, mostly with low end models where the static is pretty obvious as you walk around the house. These have no static whatsoever, whether you're connected by analog or digital. The headphones are still burning in, but the clarity is pretty amazing. These are considered to be wireless headphones for music and the RS 175's for movies and tv, but I don't see that as being as clear cut. What you lose in bass ( it's still there, but not thumping ), you gain in soundstage and I can't emphasize how well ALC ( automatic level control ) balances out audio from say speech that's too low or heavy action scenes that are way too overpowering where you end up putting the volume up and down to compensate. With these, you can pretty much find your sound level and leave it. The bonus is that these work exceptionally well for music and can immerse you in sound in a way that you didn't think were possible with wireless headphones.The downsides are that the digital audio output is about 25% down on the Analog output. That's not the Sennheisers fault per say, because the digital connection's audio level is the same with my Zvox sound box being lower than if it was connected by analog, but it's kind of a negative since you've got this crystal clear digital connection and hit the volume limit too easily. Wouldn't be so bad if you could compensate it with turning off the ALC button and using the MLC ( manual sound adjuster ) knob on the front to heighten the sound strength. Problem is ALC and MLC doesn't work with the digital connection, so you're stuck with this volume limitation if digital output is your only option. Fortunately Analog is still brilliant for sound quality and the ALC option gives them an overall balanced sound.Like I said, I'm still burning them in and expect the bass to get stronger and cleaner over time. I haven't had a chance to focus on battery life, but they seem like they'll hold up. The fit of these headphones will feel large if you've got a small head and it might take you a week or two to remember where the volume up and down buttons are on the head set probably making errors by pressing the balance buttons or the input button which is pretty much in the same general area. Overall, I've got no complaints and can recommend them for not just Music, but TV and Movies. If you are a basshead, then you'll go straight to the RS175 model, but you'll be missing out on better comfort ( due to less heat build up ), a more open sound, and a genuinely usable feature with ALC that makes for a more pleasant experience. 5 stars from me on this one.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"In this case, you get what you pay for!"

    ","I needed headphones to use with my new killer 4k home theater system since I live in a condo with paper-thin walls and and only have time to watch TV late at night. I also run Spotify on my HTS more than I watch Tv.  I purchased the rs175 and rs185 and compared over a week. The 185 sound is far superior. I thought I needed the bass boost and virtual surround effects the 175 has for music and movies...so  I was reluctant to consider the 185's. Well there is a reason those features aren't on the 185's...You don't need them! The natural unprocessed sound of the 185's is really that much better! Even so I wish they had a little more bass, but the bass, mid-tones, and highs ""as is"" are very rich, clear, and well balanced. The 175's sound was flat...and the bass was muddy and the mids and highs noticeably and almost uncomfortably harsh.  The only quirk for me is the open back so listening on the 185's isn't as private as the closed back 175's. But the 185's are also *much* more comfortable than the 175's, with super-soft microfiber earpads instead of the 175's ""leatherette"" (i.e. heat-trapping plastic) that made my ears feel hot and sweaty, so there's that plus too. Go with the 185's you won't be disappointed at all.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than the RS 175 for movies and music!

    ","In the past 5 years I have been the happy owner of the RS 180. When the RS 185 came out, it seemed like a logical upgrade to me so I went ahead and ordered them.My initial feeling was a bit of a disappointment as the RS 185 sounded like they had very weak bass compared to the RS 180. The highs were so overwhelming that they actually disturbed me when watching TV in the first hour or so. Now we're a week later (about 10 hours of use) and while the RS 185 are still not fully broken in, I must say they sound great. The bass are good (although I'd like a bit more of them) and the sound is so much clearer than on the RS 180 that I wouldn't want to go back. If you buy the RS 185, make sure you break them in before judging them. When coming out of the box they were impossible to compare to my RS 180 that had over 2000 hours of use.Here is a quick comparison of the RS 185 vs. the RS 180:Good:- The sound is much clearer with much better separation. It is so good that you can tell when your source is badly recorded (e.g. some TV shows). Now I feel that my RS 180 sound ""messy"" comparatively.- Thanks to the digital connection, there is virtually no background noise- The cups are a little bigger than on the RS 180, which is nice if you have bigger ears- The extension of the headband is a lot smoother than on the RS 180- The power button and the volume buttons are much more usable as their placement is better and the volume buttons are bigger- The headphones green power LED has been placed on the back, it's not too bright and it doesn't blink (this was sometimes disturbing on the RS 180)- The base station now has an auto-on. Only the headphones have to be turned on manually.- The range of the RS 185 is slightly better than the RS 180 but nothing to write home about. I was expecting a bigger difference. Note that I only tested the penetration through walls and not in line of sight.- The perceived quality of the materials used is slightly better than the RS 180 but they're not made of gold eitherNeutral:- The RS 185 have a pretty tight fit on the head which is good because they won't move but it makes them slightly less comfortable than my old RS 180. They may loosen up with time though.Room for improvement:- I'm not sure why Sennheiser keeps placing the balance buttons near the volume buttons. I don't need them and I tend to press them when changing the volume. These should be relocated to the left cup.- I really wish that the RS 185 would feature a bass knob to allow the users to tune the bass to their taste.- The RS 185 seems to leak more sound than the RS 180 (I personally don't care much about that)- They're expensiveBottom line, I don't regret my purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser did it again... and better

    ","Amazingly clear sound from this set of wireless headphones.  I previously owned the RS130, many years ago, and it was ok, did the job, but you would not mistaken it for an audiophile product.  I must say I'm a fan of headphones, I have over 15 pairs of headphones ranging from $100-$3,500, plus amps, DACs, etc... The only reason I mention this here, is to say, I like headphones, I have a wide range of them and I know what a good pair of headphones can sound like.I bought the RS 185 so that I could listen to TV at night without disturbing the household - I have a 7.1 system, which sounds wonderful, but not always suitable for late night TV listening. I have a pair of Sennheiser HD650, which I like very much and it's a great value for money pair of headphones - plus I prefer a warm sound, I listen to mainly female vocals and Jazz.With this in mind, I was expecting an OK sound from the headphones, but I have become used to Bluetooth headsets and I'm familiar with their limitations on audio quality due to the compression of the sound...I had some issues connecting with my Receiver (Onkyo 5009) - the pre-outs didn't work ... Then I read on the forums that the Onkyo only passes pre-out analogues for Zone 2 if it has an analogue feed in ... I'm using the Apple TV 4th Gen .. So HDMI out only ... So I needed to use the headphones out in the front of the receiver... The sound is very good, clear / detailed voices, good soundstage for a stereo feel to it... Very helpful pleasing...Afterwards, I thought I would try to with streamer... I have a Linn Akurate streamer, which is very good streamer if you like vocals and Jazz... Not rock anything too fast (go for Arcam for this...)... I connected the second output of the Linn straight into the Sennheisers (analogue in).... I was very pleasantly surprised to listen to the music.... Did sound to me almost as good as the Senn's HD650 using an Audiolab M-DAC and WooAudio Tube Amp (WA6)... That's a seriously nice setup, which the humble RS185 could sound close to ... With not right .... I was very, very happy with the sound for HiFi.... Someone not as critical as me, would be very happy with the RS185 as their only headphones, for both HIFI and TV/CInema music....The wireless range wasn't amazing, we have many walls (double brick) in our place, and we couldn't move outside the living/dining room without loosing the signal... That said, it is perfect for what I need....Surprisingly good sound, good for both music / movies / TV ... Clear voices, vocals.... Highly recommended!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"CLEAR SOUND, WARM, DETAILED, CAN'T BELIEVE ITS WIRELESS!"

    ","Ordered these a month ago, and have had good results.  I had tried a sound bar as a solution for listening to TV, and it failed after two days, so I replaced the bar with these, which were less money.I am 85 years old and have moderate hearing loss, corrected by in the ear hearing aids.  Unfortunately, no hearing aid can correct for the poor sound quality of recent TVs.  I wanted quality head phones which would correct this deficiency, and the RS 185 Wireless phones work and work well.No headphones (nor anything else I know of) can correct for TV programs which have so much ""background"" music played so loud they drown out the dialog, but these can overcome most of these situations, but not all.My sole criticism of the RS 185 is the column controls are difficult to master.  They are on the right headphone and I have trouble finding the correct button for changing the volume.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cure for Hearing Impaired Listening

    ","Not all that impressed to be honest. It's a decent alternative to watching TV or playing videogames late at night. But it doesn't sound great when it come semi high bass HD films or games, because it just drowns out the highs. Also note these are extremely sensitive when it comes to RF interference to the point that if my personal cellphone is inches away from the headset it will cause split second signal drop and rarely cause a ten second drop and gradually fade back to status. Looking to get rid of these and replacing them with either V-Moda's or Bowers & Wilkins or Focal.

6,"on December 3, 2017",,"These sound amazing and give crystal clear wireless performance with an open back design.  The plush ear cushions feel very comfortable,  even with long listening sessions. The top band also has two cushions that sit the phones comfortably on the vertex of the head--so much that it's hardly noticeable.  The speakers do not twirl like a DJ set, which I like because they are easier to set down and handle without things flopping all over the place.  The plastic body is hard and higher quality than typical headphones. These things can take a beating and still look like new!The only thing I don't like about these is the design of the power (mostly) and volume controls.  To turn them on,  after removing from the base,  you have to hold down the small power until a green light turns on,  there is a slight delay,  and the audio plays.  It sounds fine,  but in practicality there is no tactile feedback in the button or tone to let you know they are on,  only a green light.  Basically,  there is no clear fast reliable way to turn these on without waiting a few seconds watching the light and holding the button,  which means many times I've been caught in a cycle of on-off if I put them on first and try to turn on based on feel.  I swear sometimes I'll hold it and they won't turn on,  I'll hold again and then it will turn off right after turning on.  There is also a delay after taking them off the base before they will turn on,  making it even more of a hassle if I'm moving fast.  It might not sound like much of an issue but I'd much rather have a different design, like a slide switch.I occasionally use the volume buttons when I have to but try not to because they are all so close together with the fase buttons.  I'd prefer different shaped buttons or a wheel for better control.  My center balance button doesn't seem to work but I don't care about that.The only other thing that is annoying is that the bands leading to the top are a bit loose,  so the speakers tend to drop low and long over time.All in all,  I love these,  there are just a few annoyances that can be fixed for later models.(I use these for computer gaming using optical audio out.)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent sound,  reliable RF"

    ","I had time to review the RS 190 throughout the internet, Cnet, Youtube, etc. I was especially interested in the open ear design because the 195 that I ordered was not as impressive as I knew Sennheiser could be. The closed-back design with the faux leather pads made my ears sweat, and I knew I couldn't listen for longer periods of time. I returned the 195 and looked more closely at the 190, the previous version. However the 190's were still very expensive and reports of interference and short range made me think twice.  Same goes for the RS220. This led me over to the 185, the model below what I first ordered. I knew I would loose some of the features i.e. the speech mode - middle, and then the music emphasis, all done from the headphone wirelessly. But, I really wanted to hear the bass breath with an open back design.So, I ordered the 185. I got the velour pads, which helps to keep from perspiration, so I knew I would get some satisfaction over the 195. What I did not anticipate is the grand opening of sound by virtue of the open back versus the closed back. I realized I did not sacrifice anything, but gained much more. I do not have any remorse in backing down one level, instead think that it was a step up.However, the pads are a bit smaller than the faux leather of the 195, and I have one ear larger than the other apparently. Another con is that the headset is a little clumsy, or heavy. I can put up with that and eventually adjust. I decided to do a DIY replacement to a pair of Shure ear pads to compensate. I can confidently say without a doubt the 185 open-back confront me with better than expected sound quality that I wanted all along.

    ",These sound great and the distance with clear signal is pretty good.  No issues in my 2500sf house.  Love that it has digital optical in so you can use the higher quality (than most digital devices these days) digital-to-analog converter in the base station.  Purchased a Chromecast Audio which has digital optical out and plugged it into this to listen to streaming music services via my phone and have noticeably improved quality over listening through headphones on the phone.  Very nice.  Sound profile is very similar to my HD600 headphones but a little lighter (just a touch) on the bass.

    ","These headphones are amazing.  I wouldn't say that I'm an audiophile, but I do enjoy high quality sound and primarily listen to my lossless ripped CD collection.  The sound is very crisp and for a wireless solution can't be beat.  I think I would like a little bit more bass, but that is probably just my preference as I think they accurately produce sound.  These are perfect for anyone that wants a good set of headphones for the office.  If you are using them in the office (or even at home in bed) you should note that the open back allows people near you to hear what you hear.  For people that are concerned about noise pollution, you might consider the RS 175 or 195.Regarding differences between the old version (RS 180) and this new version:I also had the previous version of this headset and can say that there are a few very noticeable improvements to this version.  Firstly, they feel a lot more solid.  I think the 180 headset feels a little bit flimsy (almost plasticky), but the 185 headset is very solid (nice metal structure).  Secondly, the sound seems a lot more crisp -- particularly in the higher notes.  All genres really do sound amazing.  Thirdly, they removed the power button on the base station.  On the 180 I had to turn on the base and the headset which was slightly annoying due to the fact that the station does not weigh very much and would slide when pushing buttons.  With only the the single power button on the 185 headset I just have to pick them up and turn them on.Note:One thing to note on the 185 is that it does offer Automatic (ALC) and Manual (MLC) Level Control (ALC).  If you are using any sort of source which can control volume (DAC, Stereo, etc...), you will need to play with the MLC settings to configure the correct level for the highest volume of your input.  If you don't you will notice distortion as you raise and lower the volume.  You can always use ALC, but on the 185 it will automatically raise and lower the volume -- if you raise your input it will lower the headset volume to match the levels and you will have to use the headset volume control.  The 180 did not have a MLC mode and managed this setting automatically without changing the volume.  This is not really an issue and only takes a couple of minutes to configure.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Headset - Marked improvement over the previous RS 180

    ","These 185 headphones replaced my earlier Sennheiser 170 in order to take advantage of the optical connection on a new TV.The intent of this review is not to laud the many qualities of the 185, I'm giving them 5 stars and that is enough on this subject.The purpose of this post is rather to help all those users who, like myself, experience sound cut-outs regardless of audio settings on the TV itself and the various devices connected to the HDMI terminal. Very annoying issue and apparently quite common judging by the number of posts in the internet.After eliminating sequentially the various RF sources present in the house, I identified that the culprit was a Linksys AC5400 router which has 8 directional antennas. After adjusting all antennas to a vertical position all sound cut-outs to the headphones were eliminated.Hope that this will help others who experience the same symptoms.",5.0 out of 5 stars,In case of sound cut-outs.

12,"on January 4, 2018",,"This is a good product and I'm glad I purchased it. Actually purchased two of these kits so my wife and I can enjoy video gaming separately, together or just watching movies. It's a great setup that really solves some problems for us, but there are a few negatives that keep me from giving a five-star rating. Here are my negatives:1. Sound quality. It is decent, but nothing great. Those awesome movie/game explosions just lack any clarity or power in the bass. It doesn't sound bad, but you don't get a great experience either.2. Comfort. These cause me discomfort after wearing them for a few hours. They make my ears hot and I start getting a headache from the clamping force. Again the comfort is not bad, but they aren't close to as comfortable as they could have been. Sennheiser should provide alternate  (leather or similar) earcups as an option.3. Limited Range: The range on these phones is acceptable for my needs. However, they are supposed to have a huge range, yet just going to the bathroom or refrigerator - 25' away - causes them to start dropping coverage. This could be due to the wireless router in my house, but who doesn't have a wireless router? Coverage is adequate, but not as great as claimed.4. Build Quality: This is actually my biggest complaint. I owned a Sennheiser HD 595 headphone that finally broke at the weak connection on the headband/ear piece. These RS 185 headphones appear to be no better built, so I am expecting them to break eventually. Also any slight movements in the headphone cause them to creak annoyingly - just like my failed HD 595 did.",3.0 out of 5 stars,This is a good product and I'm glad I purchased it

    ","I ordered these more for the rest of the family than for myself. I'm a night owl and they aren't. I had previously owned a set of Sony MDR-DS5100 headphones which were great. Because they were infrared they had their limitations but I never had any real problems with them. Eventually they just plain wore out. So I began looking for a replacement and settled on the Sennheiser RS185. I chose these over the RS175 because of the fabric ear cushions. I wear them for extended periods of time so they have to be comfortable. More on that in the pros and cons below.The Pros:Very good sound quality. The open back design makes a huge difference in my opinion. My old Sonys had an open back design as well.The ear cushions are very comfortable. No problem with my glasses.Range is pretty good.Battery life is excellent. I haven't run them all the way down yet to get an idea of exactly how long they last but I used them for three straight nights for at least 3 hours per night with no problem.No latency issues that I've noticed. And believe me, I'll notice if there are.The Cons (all of which are nitpicking on my part):No HDMI input. All of my devices run into an AV amp and I want to pull the audio from the amp to the headphones so I don't have to do any manual switching. My amp only has an HDMI output. No optical or analog out connections that will provide all connected signals. I've gotten around this by using the headphones jack on the amp connected to the analog inputs on the transmitter.  In the end this could be viewed as a positive thing because plugging into the jack automatically shuts off the speakers so I don't have to turn them off myself. It also bypasses the potential problems of digital signal incompatibility. And since these are headphones, I'm not really loosing much with the analog input. Still in this day and age I'm not sure why all devices of this type don't have an HDMI input.While the ear pads are nice and comfy the headband is a little tight. Not overly so but enough to notice after wearing them for a while. I find the indentation for the charging points on the strap to be a little annoying too. They don't poke into your head or anything, it just feels a little odd to me. Both of these complaints on the comfort front really aren't that bad and are mostly nitpicking on my part.Price. They are a bit pricey in my opinion but in the end I'm willing to pay a bit more for something that's comfortable and works well.Recharge time is very slow. I don't see this as a big deal since I charge them during the day but if you were to discharge them completely in the middle of binge watching you current favorite series you might as well hang it up for the night. you wont' be using them again for several hours.One thing of note. In reading the reviews I saw several people complaining about signal dropouts. I have a pretty high degree of certainty that the problem has to do with the locations of the headphone transmitter and their wireless router or other wireless devices. These headphones operate in the 2.4GHz band and that's the same band that most wireless routers and devices that connect to them operate in. I can tell you for certain that this can cause a problem. I have a higher power access point (Pepwave AP-One)  located in a central part of the house. When I walk near the access point, say with 4-5 feet of it I begin experiencing dropouts. Move away from it the dropouts stop. If you are having this problem try moving your router or headphone transmitter if they are located fairly close to each other.  I'll bet that solves the problem. Wireless phones that operate in this same 2.4GHz band could cause the same problem. Potentially, if your router supports 5GHz and you can turn off the 2.4GHz band in the router, that would most likely solve the problem as well but could cause problems with devices that don't have 5GHz capability.So bottom line thumbs up or thumbs down: Thumbs up.

19,"on July 11, 2016",,"An outstanding set of wireless headphones that shows a very knowledgeable and detail attentive craftsmanship. First off, the sound is crisp and natural, an excellent resemblance of the source, with no additions or subtractions. On the head, they feel very comfy and stay so, while time flies in enjoyment. Controls are handy and easy to identify with one's tactile sense only. Transmission range is not outstanding but rather, adequate. First time charging of batteries it's an overnight affair but that's a good thing for prolonging their life span and usability.Latest multichannel encoding schemes used for optical sound transmission are not recognized by headphones'  decoding circuitry (unfortunately), however, personally I'm very satisfied with their analog performance and did not consider it a deal breaker in no way. Bear in mind that these are stereophonic headphones and are not designed for multichannel performance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,An outstanding set!

The 185's do not have VS or BB. The receiver also outputs a lot more sound by itself in comparison to Sennheiser's 160, 170 & 180 base station.They are basically the same weight as the 170, 180 but have bigger Plush ear pieces. They are ""Around Ear"" not ""Over Ear"" or ""On Ear"". They are more snug around your head/ear because the headband is of smaller length.Line of sight is around the same. Not good through walls or through multiple 2.4-2.48ghz devices on but I did notice less drops from this in comparison to the 170.I can't try the uncompressed option. My tv doesn't support analog out. Optical works great.A comment on Amazon said you can't listen to YouTube among other steaming services such as Prime. I can't comment on Prime but YouTube audio worked fine when using the app from my Sony TV.The batteries are 820 triple A's. Most rechargeable batteries in NA are 800 so I wouldn't recommend throwing in any rechargeable AAA battery.I'm still on my initial charge time from base. The light is supposed to turn green when fully charged but I have yet seen it change to green & it's been over 12 hours. Maybe I misread the directions or maybe the base charges slow.Overall sound from Brand New is impressive but sources which produce high levels of LFE I would not recommend listening to at high volume until they have been used for a few weeks. Slowly break these in is my recommendation. One observation I noted was the open back design does not leak much sound at all.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Out of box they definetly need break in but I immediately noticed LFE levels were better balanced & have more juice

I love not rolling over a cord, or stepping on them, and compared to my Turtle Beach x12's it is a huge jump in quality.

    ","Its good. But as some have mentioned the Optical Audio Input and Built In DAC cannot decode certain audio codec streams. If for example you want to connect a Optical Cable from an Apple Airport Express Optical Output into the RS185's Toslink Input at the Base, the Built in DAC cannot decode it properly and the sound jumps in and out. Using an mini to stereo RCA cable is fine though. At first, I was miffed, but when it came down to it, it was overall easier to use the headphone jack analog coming from my Receiver to output the Airplay stream that was decoded using the Receivers DAC (which handled the DAC conversion from Apple Airport flawlessly).",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, the sound is good.

The prongs on the earphones that latch them to the headset have completely broken off of the right headphone pad.

29,"on March 4, 2016",,"The Sennheiser RS 185 headphones are a real upgrade from my old Koss Pro 4AAs. The clarity of sound is superb, and I am constantly hearing things in the music that I haven't heard before. Given that they are headphones, they have a terrific soundstage. I listen mostly to classical and new age, and they perform really well for those types of music. Good old rock and roll sounds great as well, and there is plenty of bass. They are also far more comfortable than my old ones, which clamped on my head pretty tightly and limited my listening to short sessions.For this headphone purchase I elected to go wireless, as it makes it so much easier not having to connect cables and drape them all over the place every time I want to listen. I have not had any problems with the RF signal, and listening is a true pleasure. The fact that the transmitter doubles as a charging station for the headset is a really great idea. It's also great that Sennheiser had the foresight to include rechargeable batteries with the purchase.

Turns out I had the base station turned up about 3/4s of the way and the headphones set pretty low to get the volume I wanted. I guess if you have the base station turned up too high, it starts clipping and the LED turns read and you start micro-dropping. Once I turned the base station down to about 1/4 and the headphones up (same sound) the micro clipping went away!I still prefer the 180s, they felt a little flimsier than the 180s, but that meant they were more comfortable to wear all day.

    ","No one will ever read this, but here it goes. I've owned several pairs of wireless headphones over the course my audio nerd tenure. The only headphones that ever surpassed these (in comfort) were the  Sennheiser T60/HDR65 headphones. The 185's have a superior range and clarity (no analog transmission fuzz-outs) due to their digital transmission. The battery life is awesome with the 2xrechargable AA's (as opposed to the proprietary, cell batteries of the 65's). They will easily last you 20 hours in case you happen to forget to put them back on the charger. And if you do forget you can always slap in a couple of fresh batteries because it's very easy to remove the ear pads and swap cells. One small gripe is that you can sometimes not quite get the headset on the charger correctly, it takes a bit of jiggling here and there. A *very* minor gripe, but still there. They're amazingly comfortable to wear for long periods of time (I've worn them for upwards of 8 hours at a time - don't judge me) and the sound is amazing. If you've ever had a ""closed back"" system you'll understand that the bass on an ""open back"" might not crush your skull, but it also means that the entire sound spectrum sounds balanced and amazing and you can still hear things around you. Overall these are great headphones. The price is a bit steep but if you take care of them I can see them giving you an amazingly long service life. One final gripe - the controls on the side aren't the best. Who needs a L/R balance adjustment so often that it's on the headphones? The volume control is nice, but some very large braille-like, tactile difference on the buttons would be great. I have to feel carefully for 5-10 seconds to make sure I'm pressing the right thing. Overall I love these things, just a few minor tweaks would make them the best headphones I've ever owned. Sennheiser - take note!!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"So, so close to perfection.... but not there."

    ","We first tried three well-reviewed bluetooth wireless headsets with our home entertainment system. None of them were satisfactory. All of them had very limited range of about 15', and all of them lost their wireless connection at one time or another and had to be re-paired (a nuisance and not something my wife will do by herself.) Sound quality, audio volume, and battery life were also issues.These Sennheiser RF wireless headphones cost considerably more, but they're so much better all around than any bluetooth models. Great range (can go to the kitchen 20' away or to the bathroom around the corner without loss of audio), connection always comes back perfectly even after replacing batteries or after a power failure (unfortunately not that rare in my area), and much better sound quality with no hiss, fade, or cut out. I subtracted one star for two reasons: 1. The volume could be louder (I like it really loud, so they're probably fine for most people), and 2. They hold my head somewhat tighter than I'd prefer (although it's not unbearable, and the fabric lining of the cups is quite comfortable).",4.0 out of 5 stars,"For use with home theater, much better than any bluetooth wireless headphones."

    ","Before I go in to detail, I will be upfront and say that I do not have much experience with wireless headphones. I had the cheaper RS 120s before, and the quality was disappointing. I have not tried any others.With that said, here are my thoughts on the RS 185. These are adequate for what I need. It's a wireless headphone, so I won't go too much in to audio quality. Needless to say, I would not use these for listening to music on a regular basis. I would say the sound reproduction is below average. Considering the cost, it is even more disappointing for music. But that isn't what I bought them for. The RS 185 is more than adequate for everyday use to watch TV or movies that are mostly conversational. Because they lack sufficient bass, depth, and soundstage, they are not as good for major blockbusters, action movies, or sci-fi movies that have more dynamic sound requirements.Although the base seems well built, the plastic quality of the cans themselves feels cheap for what I paid, but if the design goal was to make it light, then the use of plastic makes sense. The band feels relatively durable, but not sure how long it will hold up. It isn't too tight, so it fits snuggly without causing discomfort. The ear cushions are comfortable, but feel cheaper than what I expected.The range is fine. I don't walk around the house, since I use these for watching TV at night without bothering the rest of the family. Unlike my older wireless phones that eventually fell apart (also Senn), the quality is clear. I have not had any issue with interference or dropouts so I'm satisfied with that aspect.For the cost, I am not sure I would recommend this, although I have not tried the cheaper models. If the wireless quality suffers in the cheaper models, then there isn't much choice. I admit I was a bit disappointed in the audio quality, but these cans do fine for watching news or other TV programs that don't have a lot of challenging audio tracks.(Note: For comparison, I currently own and use Grado SR225i as my daily use cans on my iMac through NuForce µDAC2SE, use my Grado RS2i for purely music enjoyment, use my Bose QC-25 when I travel on long flights, and use Sennheiser PMX-80 for workouts. The sound quality of the RS 185 is inferior to the SR225i or even the Bose QC-25.)",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for Everyday TV, but Marginal for Music and Movies"

    ","I hesitated to spend so much on headphones but since I am deaf in one ear they really are a necessity if I'm to clearly hear and understand television programs. These headphones were totally worth it and I don't regret the expense at all.First I should say I am not a specialist in sound quality or any of the technical details. I only know what works for me and what I like. I have been using the headphones since April 2016 (about 3 months at this time) and have been very pleased . I wanted a pair of headphones that would allow me to lower the volume in the deaf ear. Though I can't hear in that ear, I can feel the pounding of the sound. These allow me to do that. It does not move all the sound to the hearing ear. It just lowers the sound in the deaf ear. I also wanted something easy to use. These also fit that bill.  Previously I had the 110 headphones. They were analog, not digital, and if I paused my program too long I would hear loud static. These do not do that. That alone would make a five star rating!The sound is great. It is easy to replace them on the stand to charge. I do this every night and have never had a problem with the rechargeable  batteries. The one time I forgot to recharge them, I heard a loudish beep that indicated the battery was low. I have not had to replace the batteries, but to do so is fairly easy. Instructions in the manual on p. 18. You just twist the earpad to see the battery compartment underneath.I had to get used to turning the headphones on and off before wearing them and adjusting the sound while wearing as it is a little different than the other set but it has not been a problem. They fit nicely, covering my whole ear rather than just sitting on the ear. There is a nice bit of cushioning at the top also which makes them comfortable even though they are obviously heavier than wearing earbuds or a lightweight pair of cheaper headphones.  The quality is much better than those.I am including pictures with details. I hope they are large enough and helpful. [I added a picture of the battery compartment to answer someone's question.]",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, nice fit"

    ","I have owned the RS180 headphones for around 2-3 years and was happy with these.  I use them to mainly watch movies and TV.  I was excited when the the RS 185 were released, particularly as it gave the option of an optical connection as well as analog.  First impressions were very positive and the build quality is a definite improvement over the RS 180's. Further, the  headphones buttons seem better positioned now.  The cups seem bigger, covering the ear completely, which , in my opinion improves the sound and experience.  I connected via the optical input and was immediately impressed with the improved sound.  The sound is crisp, expansive and bass is taut. This was a definite improvement on the already impressive RS 180's  Listening to movies with these was immensely enjoyable.  HOWEVER, and this is the flaw, they proved to be very uncomfortable to wear for any lengthy period.  I found myself removing them frequently whilst watching a movie, due to the tightness on my ears.  My wife also complained of the same discomfort, something that we never associated with the RS 180's .  The discomfort was too great to bear and I returned them, going back to my RS 180's.  The RS 185 are in my opinion, a great pair of headphones which sonically are very, very good.  The build quality is fantastic and at the price here on Amazon, they are great value. I really wanted to keep them, but the discomfort from wearing them was too great.  I know some reviewers have commented how comfortable they are to wear, and may fit into that category and by doing so, will bag yourself a great pair of wireless headphones.

I've schedule a return on these headphones for a couple reasons-- No ""wow"" factor for most expensive headphones I've ever purchased- Too heavy for me personally. Coming from a wired Sennhesier these are considerably more heavy, I should have weighed both for comparison as on paper they don't appear much heavier than an average set on Senny wireds. However, in practice the wired set feels weightless by comparison. The 185's for me were not comfortable for long periods of time and required removal and breaks. - Never had this issue before.- Bass is nonexistent even with using equalizers.- Cost, if these blew me away I would be fine with the price but that just isn't the case. If these were 25%+ cheaper I would then justify the non wow factor.As for good things... despite the weight these are decently comfy on the ears and head. The sound clarity is superb. These are crystal clear.Controls are easy to use on the headset and its super handy to have volume control wirelessly. Mute button on the set as well.Batteries last a whole work day easy.So I could see these working for certain people and not for others. I would really like to try the RS 180's that are out of manufactured- they're lighter and supposedly have better bass. I may also compromise with a set of 175's which supposedly have more bass as well.Also, I tested these phones on various devices and had some interesting results. I'm primarily using these with a PC and MAC computer.I tested:ASUS XONAR PCI-E Sound Card Headphone Jack via RCARealTek Onboard OpticalRealTek Onboard Headphone Jack RCAMac headphone Jack via RCAThe optical connection sounded like GARBAGE. Which I was really surprised at. The sound felt flat and lifeless.The Asus Headphone and RealTek onboard headphone were both much louder and much clearer than the Optical. I could not discern ANY difference between the $$$ Asus card and the $ onboard sound card on my motherboard. I ended up using the Asus despite being able to hear SOME NOISE out of the cans in this setup, only with high volume and dead air. The optical had zero noise at any volume.

I was impressed at how well they sounded since RF technology is inferior to Bluetooth, or at least that's what I have heard.I have been experimenting with headphones.  Just within the last 60 days I must have bought at least 7 or 8 high quality pairs and returned all of  them.  I am sensitive to microwaves right up against my head I suppose.  I don't put my cell phone up to my head because after a minute I feel a difference.  Its hard to explain what it feels like but I don't like it, its like numbing sensation all around your head.  So cell phones produce microwave and RF radiation and so do Bluetooth headsets. So I am trying to avoid any headphones that pump out RF radiation. I bought Skull Candy's Uproar and Hesh 2.0 headphones, as well as Sony's H.ear On and Sony's XB950B1 Extra Bass, and also Bose SoundLink around-ear headphones.  Unfortunately I returned all of them.  I tested a few pairs with a RF and microwave detector [Cornet ED78S EMF RF Meter ElectroMagnetic Detector] and the [Trifield 100XE EMF Meter].  The headphones usually pumped out between 20 and 55 mW of power.  And Bluetooth class 2 will always pump out around that level of power.  All consumer Bluetooth headphones are probably class 2 at this point.So we know Bluetooth is bad for the RF radiation. So I choose the Sennheiser RS 185 RF Wireless Headphones to see if they would be a little better than using Bluetooth frequencies, and yes the standard RF technology is slightly better but not by much.  These Sennheiser headphones pumped out about 30 to 40 mW of RF.  I tested the headphones and the base.  The base puts put 50 to 70 mW of RF.  But the base isn't the problem its the headphones since they are right up against my head.....  So unfortunately I have returned these as well, but they are very good headphones.The only pair of headphones I own that are wireless and that don't seem to emit any radiation are the Sony MDRRF985RK Wireless RF Headphones.  They are cheap and pathetic and the sound quality its not what I want, but there's no RF radiation detected!  and that's neither from the base nor the headset.  This makes me believe that there are more RF headsets out there which don't pump out RF radiation [especially when all it has to do is receive and not transmit]  but it will be more trial and error trying to find them.  And right now I don't know what to do or where to go next besides continuing to order headphones, testing them and send them back if they pump out too much radiation.hmmmm.. perhaps what I should do is try to find headsets that don't have buttons which transmit back to the base.  That way the headset has no need to transmit anything.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Its hard to explain what it feels like but I don't like it

The sound from the RS 185 also drops as soon step foot on my backyard deck, about 30 feet from the transmitter and there one interior wall and one exterior wall between the transmitter and the headphone.As a comparison, I have the Sennheiser RS 120, which I ended up giving to my mom (the reason for getting another wireless RF headphones) The RS 120 is supposed to have a range of only 120 feet.  The location of the transmitter for the RS 185 and the RS 120 is the same.  I would use the RS 120 and listen to the TV while I am working in my garage (60 feet from transmitter) and when I am in my backyard (over 120 feet from the transmitter). The RS 185 would not work in my garage and in my backyard.  I purchased the RS 185 (over $200) as an upgrade, and I wanted more range, but the RS 185 range does not come even close to the range of the RS120 (less than $70). I used the RS 185 for a couple of days and was unsuccessful in improving its range. Thanks to Amazon, returning the RS 185 was easy and painless.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Range is not good -  It claims to have a range of up to 328ft/100m (line of sight).

    ","Overall I'm happy with the purchase, and I think they're the best wireless headphones I've had yet (compared to steel series H wireless, Logitech G930s, and Corsiar Vengeance 2100s).  Mainly, I was just excited to get a pair of open backed wireless cans.  They can sit on my head for a long time before they become uncomfortable, and they don't feel like someone is squeezing my head.They'd get 5 stars, except that I notice an outstanding amount of interference from laptop wifi.  If I have my macbook anywhere near the base station, any wireless traffic at all completely interrupts the connection to the headset.  Downloading a file completely kills the connection for the duration of the download, even refreshing image heavy sites causes momentary loss of audio.Since I primarily use these with my desktop, it's not enough of an issue to really change my opinion, but beware if you want to use with a laptop on wifi.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great.

    ","The volume control does not go to 0, it goes to about 2 out of 10 on the volume scale. This means if you're watching TV and a commercial comes on you don't want to hear, you have to take the headphones off.There is an annoying 'beep' when you reduce the volume to the lowest setting - which isn't off; you can still hear everything.The headphones are heavy weighing in at  11 oz, compared to Bose ComfortQuiet which weighs 8.8 oz.The spring-loaded headband makes the headset too tight on the ears; and I have a thin head, relatively speaking.They take a 1/2 day to charge, or more.Other than that, good audio.",3.0 out of 5 stars,A few issues.

    ","It arrived very well protected during shipping.  Everything is solidly encased in a plastic shell that actually comes off easily to get the various pieces out.  It comes with four different power plugs, so you have a lot of international usage options here.  I like that it even included the optical cable.  I have some, so didn't need one included had I planned on using it, but many people won't, so it's really nice that it's included.  Batteries are also included.Just like the 180's I have, the ear pieces are the softer velour, not the fake leatherish stuff that makes the head sweat so easily.  I shave my head, so any non breathable material around the ears will get moist where it covers the skin and doesn't allow any kind of evaporation.  That was the big reason I got the 180's rather than the model just below them, since the 180's had the better material for the ear pieces.  And while you can buy ear pieces separately for the lower model, at the time they were only available from overseas, and the cost of the item and shipping would've made the less expensive headphones even more costly than the 180's...Each side gets its own AA battery.  The ear pieces just twist off counterclockwise, so it's easy to get the batteries in.There are several differences here than what I'm used to.  Most of them upgrades from my old set, but the aesthetics are a downgrade as far as I'm concerned.  I preferred the smoother, rounded look of my base on the 180's.  This one is blockier, has the big knob in the front, and just doesn't look near as nice on the entertainment center under the right side of my TV.The button positions are MUCH better here.  Power is all by itself on the rear of the ear piece. Then the volume and balance are better placed on the side of one earpiece, a way better layout than the 180's had.  And they're considerably larger.  Finally I can easily adjust the volume, something considerably more painful on the 180's.Auto power on the base - this is huge for me.  I've used and loved my RS180's for a few years now, but the only other thing that drove me bonkers besides the bad button placement was the fact that I'd sit on the couch and realize that I once again forgot to hit the power button on the base...  That's not an issue anymore.I just bought a new 4k Samsung TV, and one downside I have is that I used to have the 180's plugged into the audio out on the TV.  The amplifier would pass through the picture and sound over HDMI even when powered off, so that at night, I didn't have to plug in any headphone jack to use the headphones.  All I had to do was turn off the amp and grab the headphones from the stand and turn on the base.  But with my new 4k TV, I can't get that TV passthrough to work anymore.  So now I am stuck using the headphone jack on the amplifier.  Which means I can't use the included optical cable even though my TV supports it.I get about the same range.  Their numbers they give are ""line of sight"" so you have to be unobstructed.  I don't of any houses that don't have walls, so it's a pretty useless metric for them to include.  For me, it means I can get from the front left corner of my house where the TV is in the front of the great room, back to the opposite corner of the house, about 3/4 of the way.  I still get sound when I'm walking down the back hallway past my son's room, but I can't get the sound in my own bedroom that is on the other side of the house.  To my son's room where sound still works, diagonally through the house, is maybe 50 or 60 feet.  Past that, four or five walls at various angles prevent the sound from going any further.TV shows sound very, very good.  Speech is insanely clear even compared to my nice RS 180's.  Put some music in - and I really liked the sound.  Even with my analog connection that I'm forced to use, it sounds clear and crisp.  The silences between notes is silent.  And apparently I'm in the minority when it comes to my reaction to the bass levels.  Some reviews here and elsewhere had people saying they didn't like the bass, and think it's weak.  I had the opposite thought.  I was actually surprised at how well it reproduced the lows.  Granted, I have wired headphones that have more powerful bass, but they also weigh considerably more than these do, are wired, and limit movement when being used.  So for wireless headphones, these have more than acceptable sound.  I jumped through a few movies, and on to video games on both next gen game consoles.  Destiny on the Xbox One, and Infamous Second Son on the Playstation 4.  I kept jumping between these, the 180's, and my wired headphones, and the wireless Sennheiser sounded as good as the wired did.Now the negatives.  I mentioned I shave my head - so I prefer the velour to the plasticy or fake leathery kind of stuff.  The 180's had the velour on the pads on the head piece as well, but these are that plasticy feeling material.  And I get quite a few drops while watching movies or playing games.  Batteries were charged, but every once in a while it just goes dead, as if from interference or a signal loss.  But the 180's have never done that.  We'll see how things play out over time, but so far the drops are a bit disconcerting.  The base is placed exactly where my 180's sat with no disruption in sound.They sound good, but the comfort and the nice looking base are a compromise when compared to the 180's.  But these do have the optical conneciton option, something the 180's are incapable of.  And having an 11 year old at home, I prefer the open ear design, so I can still hear the ambient noises around the house in case he calls for me at night while I'm watching a movie or playing a game.Edit:  After about 7 months, they started getting wonky.  First, via digital out, sound would be reversed randomly.  Totally bizarre, could be playing my Xbox One, or the TV, and one day left is right, and right is left.  Next day, they're normal.  And it wasn't until I redid my setup to use the new 4K Amazon Fire TV Box and ended up having to switch these to the analog 1/8"" stereo plug and L/R RCA inputs that I found that somewhere, the circuitry for the right ear died utterly.  Via optical, both still work, albeit still flip flopping randomly, but via analog, only the left channel works.  It's not the cable, tried it with other headphones, and it's fine.  So this is getting tossed out and I'll go back to the 180's...",2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound good but not quite as comfortable as the 180's and lasted less than a year

    ","I bought a HDR 185 two days ago from Amazon.  I cannot connect the optical cable into it.  It just falls out. I bought ANOTHER one and this time, I noticed there is a tiny door to the connector.  I was able to plug in the optical cable, but I later had to move things around so I disconnected the optical cable and the door came off.  I can't get the door back on and now the cable cannot be used because, again it just falls out.  I called Sennheiser and told them about the defective part being used in their products.  The rep just said to call Amazon.  Now I'm afraid if bought another one, the same problem will exist with the optical connector. It needs to be beefed up.  I never had this problem with any components that uses optical connectors.  Don't think I will buy another.  After spending over $240 for this, you think they would use quality components that don't break after just one use.Using the RCA connectors, the unit worked ok with just a little electronic noise.  But I could not bring up the volume up to my taste without introducing clipping (distortion).  I could live with it, but I would prefer if I could make it louder.  Using the automatic level controls, it prevented clipping, but I couldn't raise the level high enough to my taste.  The ear phones were comfortable and overall designed well.  The ear speakers are not totally sealed or enclosed and sound is able to come out of the earphones, potentially annoying someone close by.

    ","To get the best sound out of these expensive phones you need to hook it up with an optical cable, which is a much-touted option by Senheiser. But optical cables only work if you use you The TV’s speakers. If your media center uses a receiver, as nearly all of them do, forget it. You have to use antique RCA cables. For phones that retail for $400 this makes zero sense. If you buy the best-and most expensive-radio frequency phones, you surely want to hook ithem up with a cable that results in the best sound, no? That said, the sound these phones produce is the best I’ve heard from RF phones, but with RCA cables it isn’t as good as it could be. The headphone controls are very difficult to use. If you want to adjust the volume, you will most likely have to take off the phones to find the right volume control button.

    ","Not terribly happy with these. I have 3 other sets of mid-to-high end Sennheiser headphones/headsets. I have LOVED all of them so far. This is the first set that are kinda ""meh"". Do they work? Yes. But. They're not very comfortable (for Sennheisers, still better than most on the market), the band is the wrong shape, the padding is thin, and the earpieces are both shaped oddly and have not-too-comfortable pads. Sound is ""ok"" but not as good as my G4ME Ones, let along my HD650s. They feel kinda cheap, which the price tag says they decidedly are not. Getting them on and off the stand is a pain and requires two hands, because you have to spread them apart. There is no 1/4"" RCA headphone hookup capability; it's SPDIF or regular audio jacks, so you need to have an extra component output on whatever you're going to hook them to, or bring your own adapter cable (really? At $400?). There's a delay in the sound. This isn't a factor for recorded music, but if you're using them for gaming or guitar playing, which I am, you'll notice it. The push button volume controls are fiddly, and the other controls shouldn't be on the headset at all. The on-off button takes too long to cycle (2 seconds). When you put them on the stand, you have to be careful to set them just so or they don't charge.Is a lot of the above piddly? Yes. But these are Sennheisers, fer cryin out loud, and $400 at that. One or two of the above would be excusable, but this long list says to me these need a substantial redesign.All that said, they basically do what I need them to do and I'm keeping them.

    ","I've loved previous wireless Sennheiser HDR 140 headphones, of which I've had 3 pair.  These RF's were more expensive and for all I know, the performance may be better in terms of frequency response, but that can't overcome a basic failing.

    ","I got the 185s because my TV only has digital audio out and i wanted to be able to watch tv and movies while prepping food and using kitchen appliances without raising the volume to an unreasonable level. My kitchen is open with a bar separating it from the living room and the TV is about 15-20 feet from where I'll stand if I'm prepping food. If the headphone stand is at the TV with line of site to the headphones I'll get 1-2 seconds of dropped sound every 10-20 seconds. If I move the headphone stand to within 10 feet of where I'm standing I'll get the same drops in sound every 30-60 seconds. If I'm sitting 5 feet from the headphone stand I get pretty consistent sound with a drop every few minutes. Anything obstructing line of site causes increased problems. Running anything electrical in the vicinity causes increased dropping of sound and if the microwave is on (15 feet away from the stand) then these headphones don't work at all when more than 3 feet from the stand. I have an AC wireless router running in my house that might create a little interference but I have a pair of RS180s that I can use anywhere in my house without ever dropping signal. The 185s are also not nearly as comfortable as the 180s for prolonged use. The sound is great when it isn't dropping out. I have made these work by getting a 20 foot optical cable and placing the stand right next to me. It gives me slightly more freedom than a wired set but it almost defeats the purpose of getting wireless headphones. I can't recommend these unless you're using them in front of a computer where you'll always be within a few feet of the stand, but in that case I'd suggest you go wired and save a bundle.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound, terrible range"

    ","I ""upgraded"" to these from the HDR 170. I read a review on here which said that these have a bigger earcup. The HDR 170 is a great product and I wear them everyday for 6-8 hours at a time. My one tiny nitpick is that the earcups could be a tad bigger. So I took a chance on these. That was a $400 mistake. Yes the earcups are bigger and feel great but sadly this headphone design is way too tight. I'm 6 feet tall and weigh 150 lbs. I don't have a big fat head. The HDR 170's just rest on your ears lightly with enough pressure to keep from falling off. These RS 185's clamp to your skull like a vice grip. Whoever designed these must not have worn them for very long. The pressure on my head is unacceptable. Also for $400 you could throw in an adapter for when you want to plug into your laptop or desktop. They give you all the world wall plug ins but I'm not going to Australia, but I might want to plug in to my computer and listen to Spotify or Youtube.

    ","This is my second pair of headphones from this company. What is it saying about the company when the newer headphones don't provide as much comfort and quality/clarity of sound.  I tried the 180 version. It didn't work for me.  I use my headphones to watch TV. They're too tight on my head. There's no way to adjust tightness. The  adjustment controls on the headset itself are very difficult to use while on your head. Though the circle looks designer-ish it jams all the buttons together.  For instance, you think you're increasing the volume when actually you have just lowered the volume in the right ear! As for the sound quality,  for some reason the 120 pair I had had better sound quality.  Maybe by striving for more base it makes it blur the speech? I had hoped if I waited a few years that the new pair would be better. The company also offers a 195 pair that states it's good for hearing impaired. Read the reviews. They certainly aren't. It's  does not give the clarity of sound for TV.  They may be designing to the audio file person? So why did I buy them? I've had my other pair for so many years that the headset is literally falling apart. I've replaced the ear cups on the 120 because they flake off black pieces of material. They were doing that again.  I tried Bluetooth headsets but there's a lag in time between the picture and the sound so it's out of sync. If they are listing what I would like is to have the volume reduced for commercials. The ad people generally increase the volume by 10 dB. When I'm listing to  soft or women's conversation I have to turn the volume up then when the commercial comes the volume is way too loud for my ears. What else would I like to have in a dream pair of headset? I'd like it to suppress the background noise when people are talking.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Read Other Reviews --> They are Not Listening !!!

    ","The more I use these the more compelled I am to write a review simply to vent my frustration.  I had a pair of 165's that lasted me for years until exposure to the Hawaiian sun causes the headband to break.  Even then I used chopsticks and duct tape to hold them together for another year.  So I was pretty psyched when I decided that it really was time for a new pair and I was ready to move up a notch.  Outside of sound quality, however, these 185's have disappointed me in every possible way.It is polite to start with the positive, so I will. I am pleased with the sound quality.  It is at least as good as the old pair,  probably better.  I don't have an optical port on my computer so I can't comment on that, but I am happy to have RCA jacks instead of a phono jack - it makes for a much more reliable connection.  I tend to listen to FLAC when I can get it, but I don't pretend to be an audiophile, these old ears of mine are pretty well beat up.  Nonetheless, it's a good clear sound on everything from acoustic to classical with rock thrown in for good measure.OK, that's out of the way.  Let's get down to brass tacks.  It seems like they took everything I liked about the 165's and changed it.  First, the ear cups are much smaller.  I bought these because I can't stand pressure on my ears (else I'd be using the Grado's in my desk drawer).  These fit tightly and just barely cup the ears, so I have to be careful every time I put them on.  The fit is tight (true I have a swollen head, but not THAT swollen) and the cups are firmer that I'd like.  All in all it is not a comfortable fit.  Not at all.  I don't like it and I find myself choosing no music over using these headphones.  I am tempted to bend the headband to loosen the fit, but this carries an obvious risk of catastrophic failure.Then the controls.  Argh, why mess with a good thing?  No longer is there a simple push button for on off.  Now it's press and hold the button for on (if you can find it, it's tiny) and press and hold for off.  This is just stupid.  And there doesn't seem to be an auto off.  (If there is, it's not working for me.)  So I can't just take them off and count on them turning off by themselves after a period of time like the old set.Volume controls - gone is is the convenient knob.  Once again, press and hold or press, press, press.  I HATE this move away from knobs.  It is infinitely more difficult and time consuming to press, press, press than to simply turn a knob. Yeah, it's trendy but that doesn't make it right. And, as it happens, I AM a UI/UX expert.Hey - balance controls on the headset.  Nice.  I appreciate that.  But why put them so close to the volume controls that you are never sure which ones  you are hitting?  Yeah, really.  Remember, this is by feel as the phones are on your head and you aren't exactly in a position to look at them.The new base is much prettier, but the headband is so tight (see above) that it takes two hands to place the phones on the stand!  The old set, I could just toss them on and it generally worked (at least until they rusted over in the Hawaiian salt mist).  This one has to be positioned just right to make contact.  And did I mention that they are too tight?Why Sennheiser?  Why?  You have a great pair of reasonably priced, good sounding wireless headphones and you screwed it up just to make them pretty.  We are not pleased.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed Fanboy

    ","Brisk connection, easy setup, gorgeous sound make the RS 185's a brilliant choice in Home and Professional Audio functionality.I was taken by the all black look (I own the 180's) but my big appeal was the large buttons on the side ( so much easier for me).  I am using these for sound from my television and gaming device and the depth and range blow me away. On the 180's (not these) I found it very difficult to get the signal to come through the headset but not on these. Connection was fast and effortless.Each ear cup gets a AAA battery inserted by twisting the foam cup which I found embracing and comfortable. I used the optical cable and plugged into the back of my Sound bar. It was so incredibly easy to set up that I was sure I did something wrong in setting them up.There is a way to have the unit Automatically control the levels (ALC) or you can Manually control the levels with the MLC feature and the corresponding knob at the base of the charging unit. I kept mine on ALC and just adjusted the volume as needed from the earcup.Balance (more volume in one side or other) is achieved on the earcup by pressing the ""L"" button for more left and ""R"" button for more right and then Both simultaneously for equal balance .Charging is as aspected and the battery life stayed strong after 4 hours of Television watching.  I could go to the bathroom (down the hall about 200 ft) and still have a connection.  Amazing.Expensive for what I'm using them for but I love not having to worry about a product.

    ","Equipment used:Amp - Arcam a75CD - Denon DCD-520Headphone docking sets, for want of a better term, have never really appealed to me in the past; I have fairly decent audio equipment, and I've got some nice headphones with long leads to use with them. It may be in my mind, but when I used to listen to wireless systems in the 1990s, the sound never convinced me in the slightest - I didn't bother lingering to find out why; at the time I assumed that it might have been due to compression of the sound during the wireless bit (forgive me if I get too technical). Headphone output is all in the head in more ways than one.Well, I've changed my mind. I've always been an admirer of Sennheiser's headphone sound without finding it the most involving; their Momentums are a lovely example of their signature style - very pure, maybe slightly cold, lots of sound stage and separation, lovely for detailed listening such as live orchestral works, but lacking a certain sexiness to really get down on the dance floor.These are open-backed headphones; they are designed to let a bit of noise in and out - it improves the listening quality. If you dont want to hear external noises or have others hear what you are listening to, then you need the closed back variety.These ones produce a very warm sound, which manages to keep that unadulterated feel that people buy Sennheiser for; V-Moda m-100s they aren't, but there's never a moment of doubt in my mind when listening to Mingus, Monk or Miles - the sound is as good as the plug-in alternatives'. The open backs of the cans really lending a sense of space to live recordings; in fact, studio albums become noticeably less enjoyable at times, because you can hear when tracks have been dropped in, rather than recorded at the same time as something else. There's a sense of ease with which the headphones deal with what hits them - they glide; never do they strain.They definitely pass the sound test. I'll update this as they open out aurally. They are open-backed, so other people will be able to hear your music while you listen.The station provides input via two means - both digital and analogue (RCA). At last, you can put those old tape deck audio outputs to use again; they'll connect up to the back nicely. The controls are simple - you can set the output level manually, or use the auto option. It transmits on the 2.4 GHz wavelength.Sennheiser have got around the problem of internal batteries (and the limited lifespan thereof) very cleverly - this is a real problem with the Creative Soundblaster range of cans for example: they used an integrated internal battery that couldn't be removed; this meant that that the headphones probably had a lifespan of 5 years, which for the asking price was terrible. Sennheiser have placed an easily-removeable AAA rechargeable battery in each earpiece, accessed with a simple twist of the ear cushion housing; these batteries get recharged when the headphones are placed on the docking station and can simply be replaced by new ones very cheaply and easily; well done to them for that, even though it feels retro to be using AAA batteries again.The build quality is very good quality plastic all round, with reasonable leather in the usual places (I've felt nicer on headphones); dials glide smoothly and the user experience is a pleasant one, with nothing cheap or nasty to ignore. The ear cushions are velvet rather than leather, and can be worn comfortable for long periods - even by those with large ears.The controls on the headphones are easy to use, and offer volume and balance. Very easy to use. The transmitter supports an extra headphone if you happen to have another compatible pair lying around.The signal does work from room to room, with walls in between, but I did notice a regular sub-second of dropout from time to time (this might be because the 2.4 ghz wavelength is a very busy one in my household - WiFi and Bluetooth all run on the same one). Apparently they have a range of up to 100 metres if you can remain in the line of sight. Good luck trying to do that down my busy London backroad.A minor grouch is with the connector leads provided - why make everything to such demanding standards, and then put bog standard cables in with it? The money saved must be minimal.Overall - I feel like I've brought my old, quality equipment up to date a bit now; my CDs and records are just as good as they always were, and I'm finally converted to the joys of modern wireless audio technology. Wonderful stuff.Most people will probably want headphones that they can also take outside with them, but for those of us who have invested a fair amount of money in their HiFi equipment and want to carry on using it and keeping it up to date, these headphones represent a very good investment.Edit 08-03-15: Frustratingly, I have not found a way to alter the bass and treble levels when heard on the headphones; the amp controls have no effect. This might just be me being dense.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice uncompressed wireless sound; I'm converted.

    ","Just received my 2 x RS185 headphones and I'm absolutely happy with my purchase. They sound amazing!I was a little concerned initially due to them being open headphones as I've only ever used closed headphones up until now. Just thought there would be excessive sound leakage but to my surprise the leakage was minimal. Got my partner to test it by standing a couple of metres away from me and she said ""I can hear that you're listening to something but it's very low and I can't hear what's being said"". This was with the volume turned up to around 80% (So I didn't blow my ear drums) and whilst watching a movie. Made sure to get her to listen during a scene with loud music and a lot going on. There's no way anyone in another room would be able to hear anything.Only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because the RF Transmitter greatly affects my wifi signal. Was trying to watch Netflix on my PS4 which is normally always very smooth with no buffering but whilst the headphones were connected, it buffered every 5-10 minutes which was basically unwatchable. PS4 unfortunately can only use the 2.4ghz band so moving the PS4 to the 5ghz band is not an option.Managed to get it working perfectly after all other devices were disconnected from my wifi. Not a big deal as I only watch movies at night when everyone else is in bed but if during the day whilst others were using the wifi then I'd be in a bit of trouble.Overall though, I'm extremely happy with my purchase and to all those who are concerned about the RS 185 not having enough bass compared to the RS 175, don't stress as the bass sounds great still.EDIT: I purchased a TP-Link AV2000 Powerline adapter and the wifi problem has been solved! Ok, not really ""solved"" but due to the powerline adapter basically functioning like Ethernet, I no longer have to use wifi for watching Netflix etc so no more interference with the RF Transmitter. It's a great solution to the interference problem, especially since the powerline adapter transfers data faster than wifi so basically a win win situation. If you're having wifi interface issues, consider a powerline adapter.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Affects wifi but overall awesome headphones!

    ","I'm not sure what it is but these headphones experience some sound cut off, very brief for about a second but very often. Not sure if it has something to do with the battery or some sort of wireless interruption. Anyone else experience this issue?Update: It seemed that the batteries were the issue. An easy exchange and it everything works as intended. Really enjoying the headphones now.Update #2: Can't say for sure if it was indeed a battery issue as the sound does cut off randomly even with new batteries and it being away from wireless routers, printers etc. It'll work fine one day and then another day it'll randomly cut off for about a second and then continue to cut off in short 1 second pauses. One day I used them for about 12 hours during a work session without problems and the next after i'd say... after about 5 hours of use I started to encounter the problem, so it's random and by all means can be wireless interference but from where? I really don't know.Update#3: I found out what causes sound loss and it's people using their smartphone wifi in the house. Doesn't matter what area of the house they're in the usage of wifi in the house causes the headphones to get sound cut off, aside from this minor thing the headphones work just fine.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome when they work.

    ","After my wife got me the RF-120, I was surprised at how well they sounded - but I didn't like the static. So I decided to upgrade and I ordered the RS-175's, however I didn't like the closed-back design - it felt like I had something stuck in my ears and everything was muffled. Also, they were too tight and the leather made me sweat. So.. I ordered the RS 185's and they are PERFECT! I have a smaller head so the fit is not tight at all, some other reviewers have commented on them being too tight and uncomfortable, not sure if they had a different set of these headphones or not. Also the bass is perfect, doesn't give me a headache like the 175's. Only took three tries, but I finally found the perfect set of wireless headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, Great Fit, Awesome sound and bass! A+++++"

    ","Before receiving this pair of Sennheiser RS 185 headphones, I had been enjoying both the Sennheiser RS 180 and the Sennheiser RS 160 for my television watching needs (in the upstairs gym near my daughter's room, and in the master bedroom, respectively).  I love both headphones, but this pair of RS 185 is even better!My two favorite improvements are the improved control interface on the headphones (the old ones located the power and volume too close together, and too difficult to distinguish by touch), and the automatic-on base unit.  When you're already in bed, and have the headphones and TV on, it's beyond frustrating to get out of bed, schlep to the media center, and power on the transmitter.  This pair alleviates that age-old problem (""problem,"" as used here, means my inability to remember to perform simple tasks).The sound quality on these (I've only tried connecting them with the optical input) is flawless, and like all my other Sennheisers, they're quite comfortable to wear, even for folks with heads as large as mine.  Also like my other Sennheisers, the use of industry standard batteries (AA) instead of some ridiculous $30 proprietary form factor is a nice design choice that demonstrates respect for the consumer.  If you forget to charge them up, you can easily swap in a new pair with no tools and in almost no time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, convenient, and perfect sound"

    ",Improved our ability as couple to watch tv or movies at a sound level we each can adjust to our own seperate comfort levels.I used an optical cable from tv to TNP Toslink SPDIF Digital Optical Audio Splitter (3 Port)-( found and bought here on Amazon)That cable goes into one side of splitter. A seperate digital optical cable comes out of second port of splitter (opposite side} to sound bar and another optical cable from last port on splitter to the tower for these headphones. My wife (hearing impaired) can now use headphones and adjust them independently( of tv/remote volume) via volume adjustments right on outside of ear cup wireless. She can hear many things she was missing before. Music on these is awesome. I can now be in the same room with the tv on and not blasting loud.Being wireless and rechargeable is great. A really good product at a fair price. Also overall shopping experience was good too.Thank you,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally found what we needed to watch/hear tv and movies together at different comfort levels

    ","I was looking for a good pair of wireless headphones to hook up to a Sonos Connect exclusively for music listening.  I first purchased a pair of Sony MDRRF985RK headphones (2016 model) in an effort to be frugal, but I was immediately disappointed by the lack of detail in the sound reproduction.  So I forked up the extra dough for these RS 185 puppies, and holy schnikes, it's not even a fair comparison.  The detail of sound is awesome.  I was concerned by one review saying these headphones are designed for TV rather than music.  Have no fear purchasing these for music.  I am sure there are other headphones that pump out more bass, but I think Sennheiser hit a home run on finding a balance between the low, mid, and high ends.  Sorry, Sony, these headphones make the RF985's sound like the old plastic headphones they used to give on airplanes in the 1980's.  Super satisfied with these Sennheisers and will use them for a long time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Unfair comparison

    ","Good sound, easy hook up, comfortable, advanced features.  I still have a pair of nearly ten year old HDR-140s that I recently replaced the ear cuffs on that sound as good as these with slightly better range (they go all the way up the driveway to my mail box while the 185s lose sound half way up the driveway).  The 185s are no more comfortable than the 140s (discontinued) and I like the control configuration on the 140s better.  Both are over the ear designs.  The 140s cost less too but that was 9 or 10 years ago.  The 185s are fine and have extra features (such as digital input) but overall not a great advancement over earlier products especially when considering the most important factors of sound, comfort and range.  As good as the 185s are, considering the years that have gone by and the increase in prices, I was expecting a bit more.",4.0 out of 5 stars,A good headphone but not a great one.

    ","I have the Sennhaiser RS 170 so I’m pretty much going to compare them to the new RS 185 version. Well, not really, because they just don’t compare. The RS 185 is a classic example of getting what you pay for. At the current cost of $400 bucks, they may seem pricey, but they are totally worth that price.The clarity of sound knocked me off my feet. I connected them to my HDTV using the analog RCA plugs,  instead of the optical plug because my HDTV doesn’t have an optical outlet. The news was on when I first turned on the headset and all I can say is “Wow!” You talk about clear, resonate sound. And, listening to music is even better. I’m no expert, but when I compare the RS 185 to the RS 170, the quality of sound is so far greater that it’s hard to believe they were made by the same company.The headphone is very easy to set-up and comes with an electrical plug that includes attachments for various countries. Plus, there is an optical plug and an analog RCA plug for whichever you can use with your equipment. You can also plug these into a sound system, so TV is not the only way to use them. It comes with a quick start guide and a manual on CD, but I preferred to look manuals up on-line using my tablet, so I haven’t used the CD. The directions on the quick start guide are all you need to get yourself up and running. You won’t need to purchase anything additional – everything is included. In fact, you’ll end up with spare parts.The ear pieces are a bit larger than the RS 170, which helps to keep your ears from being squashed into your head. Also, they are covered with fabric. When I purchased the RS 170, I did so because they came with vinyl ear covers. I wanted something easy to clean. However, they make my head sweat so much I was taking them off during the commercials just to air out. They are also very tight. The RS 185 headset is so much more comfortable that I can keep them on for hours.The best update on the RS 185 are the volume buttons. They are large buttons with engraved symbols for – or + that you can feel with your fingers. The buttons are in a circle along with separate buttons for the left and right ear and one to reset the volume at an equal level between the two. It’s so easy to turn it up or down while wearing them. I had to take the RS 170 off just to adjust the volume.Each earpiece holds one AAA rechargeable battery, included. Just twist the inside of the earpiece off and drop in the battery. When you are done wearing them, place them on top of the transmitter to recharge.Another nice change from the earlier model is that you do not have to turn the transmitter on to use the headset. There’s a button on the headset to turn it off or on. Hold for 2 seconds until the light goes on or off and you’re set. This is nice because I used to get all settled in my chair before I realized I forgot to push the button on the transmitter then I would have to get up again. It seems like they listened to their customers and made some nice revisions to this model.If you’re trying to decide whether to spend the money on this more expensive model, ask yourself if you like great sound. If so, they are worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice upgraded design from previous models. Great Sound!

    ","I have the Sennheiser 180's and have had them for several years.  They have performed flawlessly.  The new 185's arrived and they are as flawless as the 180's and actually sound better.  My usage for these is due to the fact we have small children who go to bed early and we don't want to wake them with our TV shows at night.  The 185's fit that bill perfectly.  They are simple to hook up and the headphones connect to the base quickly.  They are VERY comfortable on my head and I have used them for extended periods of time (think watching Interstellar, Hobbit movies, etc.)  The sound quality is better than any other wireless headphones I have ever used.  Yes they are that good.  I can hear every piece of dialogue, every explosion, every part of the soundtrack.  They are crystal clear and that's exactly what I would expect from Sennheiser.  Honestly after listening with these it's hard to go back to watching tv without them.  Yes they are kind of expensive but you get what you pay for and these are the best.  As far as wear and tear and longevity, we have had the 180's for several years and they still look and perform as good as new.....I would expect the same durability from the 185's.  Overall highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best wireless headphones bar none!  Sennheiser sound and quality are top notch.

    ","I can walk around (1 floor, multiple rooms, 1500sq ft) while listening to music, or watch TV without disturbing people.  Sound quality is very good.  I still prefer high quality speakers for music, but I capture some fine details with headphones that are lost in open air listening.  So overall, they're audiophile quality.Agonized a little between these and the RS 175, but I prefer the open back with more spacious soundstage and cooler more comfortable velour ear pads in the RS 185.  Some reviewers were not that impressed with simulated surround sound in headphones including the RS 175 and I find the greatly enhanced stereo effect with headphones compensates for loss of true surround sound -- JMHO.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones

My hearing stinks after a tour in VN.  I can't opine on the nuances of the quality of the sound because of that hearing.  They are hooked up to the ""center"" speaker output so I get to actually hear the dialogue and not the music.

Everything amazes me about them, the quality is great.I have them on over 12+ hours a day at times and I still don't run out of power.The range is impressive even trough multiple walls in my apartment, they don't have unlimited range of course and the range is lower if the connection side of the headset is not facing the way of the receiver.But still not a problem, it more than you would expect it to be.If you are a gamer like me, then you will need an external microphone, this might be a deal breaker for some.For music listening and TV use, Amazing just go for it.I love having the base to charge them when i'm not using them so they are always ready for use.I've had them for some years now and i'm still running on the same battery and it shows no decline in battery life per charge.This is with many hours of use every single day.To end this, if wireless is what you are after and you don't need a microphone, then this is it, this is the headset you are looking for.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands down the best headset I've ever had.

    ","I would give the RS185 five-of-five stars if the optical audio port could process all streaming formats. It delivers the audio from Netflix and a few other video streams; it does not deliver audio from Amazon, Hulu and U-Tube video streams. The RS185 audio codec is evidently limited to PCM and fails to decode other formats (like from Amazon). My Yamaha YAS-93 sound bar has no problem in decoding all streams so the RS185 failure is a design issue. I did solve the problem by going analog when viewing video streams from Amazon, Hulu, and U-Tube. However, this solution adds yet another cable to my cable bundle and I have to remember to flip the RS185 select switch to analog.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but codec needs work

    ","I bought the Sennheiser RS 185 Wireless Headphones for my wife for Xmas 2015 because she always complained about the TV being too loud especially with movies over Netflix.  These headphones make the speech much clearer even though if you connect to your TV with the optical cable you lose the automatic volume control feature.  A word of warning!  If you have a pacemaker (which I have) the instruction book says you need to keep the headphones at least 3.9 inches from the pacemaker, otherwise the powerful magnets in the headphones could interfere with your pacemaker.  The controls on the headphones take a little getting used to but the learning curve is pretty quick, or other tactile aids can be added.  The ear cups do become a little uncomfortable after hours of wear.  The batteries have held up well for the past 5 months.

    ","It's a great wireless headphone, like RS 180, but not a huge improvement in sound quality. Compared to RS 220, it's not for audiophile. In terms of sound quality and balance, RS 220 is still the best among Sennheiser wireless headphones. It's a shame Sennheiser discontinued RS 220 because of some issues. It might figure that wireless never catches audiophile. In 1996, Sennheiser introduced IS 850 and it has HD 650 sound quality but it was priced at $1,200. It seems that Sennheiser gives up achieving audiophile sound quality on wireless headphones since these headphones are targeted at people watching TV or playing games, not listening to music.
