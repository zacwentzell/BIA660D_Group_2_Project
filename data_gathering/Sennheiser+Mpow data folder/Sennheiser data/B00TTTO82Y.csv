    ","These are great earphones.  My husband and mom both have hearing problems and wear hearing aids.  These earphones have made listening to TV and movies so much better for them.  It is also great for me, as I don't have to keep answering the question, ""what did they say?"".  It's not that I mind answering the question, it is that when I answer it, I sometimes miss the next words being said.  A lot less interruption, but now the problem is they do not hear me, while they are watching TV if I have to ask them any questions.  I have to do get up and wave my hands in their face to get their attention now.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The tables turn
1,"on September 7, 2017",,"Quality is left wanting (3 star). Although, it did pair perfectly with the HDR 175 transmitter. That bumped my review up a star. My old parents have been able to figure it out totally fine.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works with HDR 175 Base.

    ","I use it with my home theater with projector for a few months. It is very loud and if does a good job canceling out the outside noises. Good quality wireless headphones. Connects to the base without any problem and has pretty good sound. Little bit lacking the low end though.It keeps the signal without any problem in any spot withing same large living room, however when I go into the spare room behind the wall it cuts off.There is very little static hiss which is noticeable only when there's no audio going on. The headphones fit well and is comfortable enough for a single movie, not more than that. After an hour so two you'll need to take a break as it creates a little discomfort. Rechargeable butteries last about 7-9 movies and when not in use they do not discharge much. I like it and will recommend it for a normal use. However if you are a music addict and hear every single noise, I'd say go with the higher level models.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for audio and video if you are not a picky person!

    ","I replaced a pair of Sennheisers because we broke one after 4 years of faithful service.  The HDR 165s were priced more then our originals and I expected at least as good of range. This is not the case.  They fall out 25 ft. closer then old ones and the microwave also shuts them down from a distance of 8ft away.  The material covering the head phones seal well, the sound is as good but, prepare to sweat for the material does not breath.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Paid more for less.
6,"on April 5, 2017",,I use these to watch TV. Over ear design keeps room noise down (room has tile floor and high ceilings so acoustics are really terrible). Sound quality is very good.

    ","Use them in our workout room. Purchased with companion wireless headphone system. Easy to set up, easy to use, great sound. They don't block all outside noise, but enough to allow more than one person to work out at a time without being a disturbance. They do cause ears to sweat quite a bit, but just wipe clean after work out. My work out partner actually puts pieces of paper towel between ears and headphones to soak up sweat with no sound interference.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to set up
