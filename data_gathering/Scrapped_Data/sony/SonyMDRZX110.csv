Was this review helpful to you?, August 8 2016,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a pair from this headphone line in the past, and used them until they basically fell apart (one side stopped working, and the cushioning material for the ears eventually peeled away.) And yet after trying myriad other brands, I rate these as my personal best. After my first pair died (took several years of daily use), I went on a quest to try a bunch of different headphones. After wasting hundreds of dollars over the past couple years on everything from fancy $200 pairs, cheap Amazon-branded pairs, and plenty of random ones from places like Big Lots or Walmart, I finally just came back to these for a meager $15. There's simply no beating the combination of comfort (especially for people with glasses!), sound quality, and price. I work in front of a computer for hours at a time, and almost always have headphones (and eye glasses) on. I probably have a larger than average head shape too. Every single other pair I have tried ended up making my ears hurt before long, except this one. While the construction quality is decent, I do expect to run through a new pair every couple years, but at this price point, it's really hard to complain. In summary, I am so thankful these are back in my life.","By Far The Most Comfortable, Especially With Glasses"

Was this review helpful to you?, January 6 2016,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great headphones for music and movies for the price. I have never owned a big-money pair of headphones & after buying cheap ones that I had to replace multiple times due to breakage, I decided to get these after a recommendation from a friend. After buying them for myself, I also bought them for each of my kids. They're great for average use... i've never been bothered by outside noise, they are comfortable, and the sound is of good quality. They also are much sturdier than the cheapie $10-$20 ones I've gotten before. (My kids haven't broken them, which is a minor miracle)

I do recommend getting a bag or carrying case for them (I use a Crown Royal bag:) it certainly helps protect them and they do seem vulnerable at the hinges where they collapse for storage.

The only thing my kid complains about is the wire is kind of short. I prefer it because the wire is nice and thick and never gets tangled. with my previous cheap ones, it was always the wires that were delicate & one or both ears would go out. These are so much sturdier. (I think he just finds them too short when he wants to sit in the recliner with his iPad on the table & watch his Minecraft. If you don't require your headphones to meet these specific and ridiculous needs, the length should be fine.)","Great headphones for average use, wires seem very sturdy & never get tangled"

Was this review helpful to you?, September 5 2016,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),1.0 out of 5 stars,I previously bought a pair of Amazon light weight headphones. Today the Sony headphones I ordered 2 days ago came. Price between the 2 almost the same. However that's where the similarity ends. The Sony headphones don't fit snug...slide all over...outside noise is barely muffled...the sound quality is not bad. But since they don't fit at all can't really appreciate the sound quality. They are going back tomorrow.,Amazon is superior by far.

I'm not an audiophile, so I can't really tell you how the sound compares, but they sound fine to me. I was more impressed with how long they lasted. I took these on several flights, had them in my overstuffed bags, dropped them and generally abused them. Unlike all other headphones I've had (which generally last me 3-6 months), these lasted 2 years! They got caught in my work chair and the pin was bent when I stood up, otherwise I think they might still be going. Since I will be traveling in a few weeks, I've already decided to purchase the noice-cancelling Sony's for a bit more.
The downside to these headphones (and reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the cord is a bit long and would get stuck between chairs, desks, etc (which is what eventually led to their demise). The cord was different which was good because it didn't seem to get tangled so often but bad because I think that's also why they were constantly getting caught in things. Lastly, I like headphones to fit snugly, these were lighter weight (which I don't like as much) and weren't so snug-fitting. Probably better for people with larger heads.",Great Headphones! Lasted me 2 years!

They are excellent for the price. I ordered two pair: one for my 3 year old and one as a travel pair of headphones. The sound quality is impressive for the price. These are on the ear headphones, not over the ear. So, passive noise isolation won't be as good. However, they are quite comfortable. I could easily wear these for a couple hours while watching a movie. The physical size of the headphones make them a good choice for children. Sure, they aren't brightly colored, but I'm willing to bet the sound quality and price are much better than you'd pay for a branded set of crappy headphones. Also, I was surprised at the quality of the cord. I was expecting a thin, cheap cord. It's actually fairly thick and tangle resistant. Only complaint I have -- I wish the cord connected at a single point, rather than running to each ear piece. But, again, for the price they're darn good quality.

Update: I've now used these headphones several times on the treadmill. I like them even more now. When running, you'll occasionally run into a set of headphones with a seriously flimsy cord. As you run, a flimsy cord will bounce and become seriously annoying. These don't do that at all. I love how the solid cord just hangs with minimal movement. Also, the ear pads will get a bit sweaty, but nothing a quick wipe won't rectify. I'll let you know how they hold up for exercise use.",Terrific Budget Headphones

Sound quality is mediocre, but these are a heck of a lot better than dealing w/ the tears-inducing migraine that comes from headphones that squeeze my ears and jaw. They're not as comfortable as they claim to be, but markedly more comfortable than the Amazon Basics ones of similar appearance. If you're looking for something practical, and can handle a very short cord, like if you're on your laptop, these are for you. Wouldn't use them for exercise or movement of any sort. I'll probably buy them again, if they randomly short out on me.

Sounds is incredible, rich bass, not 'deep' as Bose/Beats might sell you, just a solid, full, well balanced sound, much better than I expected from a $20 pair of phones. Looking at the cost difference between the '100's and these, the $5 is laughable.

Feel is fantastic, quality materials, folding pads is awesome and a thick cable with the right angle connector makes life easy. Tug to hard one way? Pressure gets pushed into the wire connection, not the actual plug which (one of my favorite, and most often utilized features of the 100s) so they won't snap on you.

Cost, well, if you can't shell out $20 for a decent pair of headphones it might be worth spending that money elsewhere.

Very happy, terrific product and price point. Blown away!",much better than I expected from a $20 pair of phones
9,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, September 11 2017,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These phones sound really nice, for being under $20. I have owned at least 30 different headphones since 1974, and these sound as good as any of the $100 Sennheisers I had back when Elton John's ""Rocket Man"" was new music. The power requirement for the voice coils in these phones is remarkably low: They sound great for listening to music on a cell phone or tablet, and you won't even have to crank the volume up to maximum. Some of the headphones I have owned recently don't work well with mobile devices, requiring more output power than the audio chip in a cell phone can provide - that won't be a problem with these Sony ZX-110 phones. They sound just fine on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S at 50% of max volume. Frequency response is very good for economy priced phones, with clear treble and adequate bass response to let you ""feel"" the drums and bass guitar. Soprano and contralto vocals sound nice and clear, without that ""muddy"" sound that cheap phones give that don't have enough high-frequency response. These phones fold up into a very small, compact footprint that is easy to store in a medium or large purse, or any briefcase, backpack, or laptop computer bag. The cord is 3 feet, and has a 90° angled plug. This cord length is great for use with a cell phone in a shirt pocket, although not really long enough for home use with a desktop computer. If you are going to use these phones to listen to music on a home stereo or desktop computer, you will need an extension cord, but these aren't terribly expensive.
COMFORT: Sony got this right: these phones grip your head just firmly enough to stay in place, without squeezing you to death. I have had a couple of Sony phones that were horrible in this respect, with way too much compression on an average sized head; that's not a problem with these phones. The ear pads are very comfortable, and they don't press hard enough on your earlobes to make you need to take your earrings off to use the phones.

SUMMARY: A Typical Sony economy-priced headphone with much better sound than you might have expected at this price point. Folds up very small for carrying in a purse or laptop computer bag, Very comfortable to wear for up to several hours.

PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","Typical Sony MDR headphones - very affordable price, sound great, comfortable to wear, excellent value for your money."

Was this review helpful to you?, November 18 2017,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I need several sets of fairly compact folding headphones with decent sound and a good price, so ordered these along with two others to try out (the JVC HAS160A and the Panasonic RP-HX40-G.) Having used Sony products in the past, I expected these to outperform the others, but they didn't. The sound isn't as loud as the others, and it's fairly muffled, not clear. Clarity is important in my application (hard of hearing assistance), but even for casual music listening, these would be disappointing. I tried them on a small battery player and a more powerful Yamaha mixer, but couldn't tell a difference in the sound quality, just more volume on the mixer.
On the plus side, they have a little better bass than the others, and are probably more comfortable to wear for long periods (I only tried them for about a half hour.) And they look more impressive, being quite a bit more bulky.","Comfortable and decent bass, but overall poor sound quality"

We're spoiled with great 2 channel stereos. For headphones I listen to Grado headphones, at least until they finally broke down. Recently we found ourselves surrounded by headphones.

So, in a headphone shootout here at home, two kids, two adults we came to this conclusion.

$200 Beats (paid $70 black Friday sale price): 1/4 picked as fav. (the teen)
$120 Bose: 1/4 picked as fav. (the mom)
$10 Sony: 2/4 picked as fav. (the audiophiles, dad and 10 year old)
$20 Apple earbuds 0/4 picked as fav. (universally hated)

We listened to uncompressed rock over an iPod shuffle, or Youtube.

These ""giant killer"" Sony phones have a clear, detailed, open sound. Meaning that the music don't sound cluttered between your ears, it seems to extend to around your head. Bass has real detail: you can hear the note, the reverb and the string pluck. For bass, these beat the Bose and Beats, with ease. Also, unlike Beats, you can actually hear people talk to you when you have these on. Not everybody in my family thought these were the best sounding though, my wife preferred the Bose.

The low point: they aren't as super comfortable as the Bose. Everybody agrees the Bose are the super comfy pair. Technically, these were not the loudest, but they were plenty loud enough!",mini-shootout winners

Not used to headphones, and liking the sound of the amp, I thought of this as an experiment. With budget being at the forefront of my mind in this experiment and with many expenses related to a move, I gave it a try, and to my surprise, am pretty impressed with them. What I was thinking, that the 'directness' of playing thru an amp' would not be equaled by a headphone, is actually not the case; the headphone puts me more in my piano world, to the exclusion of anything else, and in that way makes it even more direct.You cant really sing along with it but I knew I had to forego that with the landlord above me, so I do that elsewhere. Instead I focus on the piano parts. I chose this head-phone for the extra bass, as I like to hear the deep piano bass sounds akin to a grand, and it does deliver in that range as well.

These work just fine... you can spend the difference on your college math class. Hey...you wanted my opinion.",Right on!
5,Was this review helpful to you?, June 15 2015,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these headphones because my other pair of headphones, made by a different company, broke. When I received the headphones I wasn't that impressed, but then again these are $20 headphones. When I plugged it into my MP3 player I could barely hear my music unless I nearly maxed out the volume. My gummy earbuds have better sound quality than these. If I could, I'd return them but instead I bought a pair of Monster headphones and will keep these as a backup. As for the mic, it's pretty decent. When I first used it however, the other person on the phone kept complaining that they could not hear me. But now I think it is okay.",Not what I expected...
6,Was this review helpful to you?, March 1 2015,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones exceed their price in quality. I'm not an audiophile but I do know a thing or two. I used these Sony Extra Bass 110APs with an iPhone 6 playing 320kbps MP3s as well as a PS4 playing Destiny for voice chat and game sounds. The sound is very balanced and crisp for folk, country, rock, and punk with adequate bass for hip hop and EDM. More on gaming later.

I have a very large head, 7 3/4 hat size. These are just fine. They are very light and the headband extends beyond my needs.

I do not like noise canceling in any form as it contributes to artificial characteristics and I like being able to hear cars and pedestrians as I walk around the city. These headphones are great if you share my tastes. I wear these on the bus to and from work every day and while walking around downtown. The volume and audio mix blend well with ambience and they are light and fold up well into my bag.

For PS4/Destiny the sound was adequate but not particularly engaging. Voice audio was great and my friends reported my voice sounded better than the PS-VITA earbuds as well as the PS4-included chat earbud. The bass was underwhelming for game audio, however. Everything was crisp and detailed but I wanted more bass for explosions and gunfire.

To summarize, these are great for an iPhone commute but only fair for PS4/Destiny.",Great for the commute. Fine on big heads. Adequate for PS4. Quality exceeds price.

8,Was this review helpful to you?, May 7 2017,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Whenever I buy headphones, I make sure to buy the ones that go over the ear because I wear mine usually over the course of a couple hours per session. On-ear was a really bad idea, especially at the default configuration (I have a small head, I didn't bother changing the configuration because any bigger I thought it might slip). After about 20 minutes of wearing the headphones at the default configuration my ears started to ache and hurt, I couldn't spend too much time with them.

However, the sound that comes out of these beauties is absolutely amazing! Excellent resounding bass, not sub-woofer quality but a close second. The treble is very balanced, I can crank these up to high than I usually have and not have to worry about sharp cracks due to the audio track peaking at kicks and snare hits. On previous over-ear headphones the max i could set my overall volume was 25%, which at the time was good enough to hear just about everything. With these I can crank them past 50% and more and not have to worry about any sharp cracks. Truly a good pair of headphones for the price.

Regarding the tightness i felt earlier, I was able to adjust the length to fit my needs. The tightness lessened to the point I was able to wear them for extended periods of time, the pads are very much comfortable even if they appear thin. I still prefer over-ear headphones, which denotes the 4 star. That's just my bias.

These headphones are fold-able to fit comfortable and compactly in medium sized pockets or carrying slots. They will almost never tangle, as noted by the semi-circle shaped cords. Although when you first get them, it might take a while to straighten out the curls. Nice strong and thick cable. Lastly, regarding external noise. Most of the noise is largely contained within the headphones, at least within my experience.

1,Was this review helpful to you?, February 1 2016,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good pair of inexpensive headphones. They are durable. I have bought both the black and white models - just not for myself. I prefer the white ones since they are easier to find in clutter. These can not touch my SONY V6 headphones, not even close. Of course, I don't want anyone to touch my SONY V6 headphones so these fill that gap nicely. After more than two years of use I was surprised that these did not fall apart. These are not that comfortable but that's not the point, these are nice for being $20. In this same price range I paid more than this for ear bud headphones, all of which fell apart. Most of my ear-bud headphones suffered the same fate of having their cables break on the inside.

it's not fare to compare these to more expensive headphones. If you are buying these for yourself and can afford it, of course get better ones.","Durable, nice for $20. Saved me money."

I have small ears so the ear plugs most people use don't work for me. These fit nicely and are adjustable. The sound is good, even at ear popping volume. I haven't had a need to use the microphone yet, but I like having the option. There is no way you can use these for sports, but that is not their purpose, so I'm okay with that. I use them mainly to listen to my Amazon prime music on the iPad. Overall, I would say these are an excellent value. I would definitely buy them again if something happens to the current pair.",Good sound and great value

The sound from these has a very rich bass without compromising the higher end frequencies. They perform much better than the price suggest...they certainly aren't cheap and nasty in their sound quality. They seem to be really good at blocking out external sounds, and I'll be up-dating when I've been on a plane journey which is why, for now I've obly given 4 stars. With good sound deadening on a plane, I'll be up-dating to 5 stars.

The cord doesn't get easily tangled. And something that I didn't notice in the pictures (maybe it was in the description), is that the audio jack is the kind that is at a right angle, making it seem far more durable and long lasting. And I can appreciate that since my other headphones had retired after one or two years because the audio jack had gotten askew or even broken off after one fatal fall. My only concern is the joint where the headphone swivels because it feels a bit delicate but it has been holding up pretty well. For the price, I am beyond satisfied.",Great Quality for Price

I mean, they're Sony's! I was looking for high quality Bass headphones. Sadly, these are not as good as my husband's Kanen i35 Headphones that he bought here on Amazon for under $20. First of all, they have a much looser fit than the Kanen's, so you can easily hear noise around you, preventing a fully enclosed feeling when it comes to listening to my music. The bass quality was also inferior to the Kanen's. I listened to a nice high, bass song like M83's ""Midnight City and did a side-by-side comparison of the headphones and clearly, Kanen's sound came through very loud, clear and with a fuller bass. Had to make sure to share my experience so hopefully it will help someone out when they are trying to make a purchase decision.

I broke my first pair sitting down with my phone in my pocket. The jack bent, and from then on I had to hold the cord at a particular angle to get sound in both ears. I assumed the fault was mine and bought a second pair, but within a week the cord got caught on a doorknob I was walking past, and with very little force, the jack snapped right in half, leaving the metal part in my phone. I don't think I can afford to keep replacing these every month.","Good sound, but too flimsy."

I've never been able to get accustomed to those small earbuds most people use. After a few minutes they make my ears sore. I travel alot also, so I need headphones that will cancel some of the noise from the loudness of the airplane. I'm sure a big set of ""noise cancelling"" headphones would work a bit better in this regard, but for what they are, this set seems to do a fairly adeqaute job. The sound is really good, they are comfortable, and I absolutley love the ""fold up"" feature this model has to offer.

I first tried the Sentey Warps based on all the glowing reviews, but the inadequate bass response deprived the music of real presence for me. These inexpensive Sony’s did not disappoint. The sounds are clear and smooth with reasonably good definition in all frequency ranges. The emphasized bass lets you feel the music without becoming overwhelming. Having said that I should point out that the higher frequencies and even some of the mids are more recessed as compared to other headphones that I own. That may bother some audiophiles. Nonetheless, I am very happy with my purchase – especially at this price point. I like the fact that I will be able to use them with my Android phone. Since these are worn on the ear and not over the ear, they do leak sound so they probably aren't the best for an airplane or other situations where others are nearby.",Pleasing sound at a great price

During that time period I learned that the headset is HIGHLY prone to shorting out on one side. Sometimes the mic doesn't work after a good while of use. Sound quality isn't too great but the folding mechanism is wonderful for storage whether it's in a purse, backpack or just on your lap while you're waiting somewhere.
For the price-- if you need something fairly quick and don't mind replacing them often and are *only* needing them for your phone or light computer work-- I think this is okay. If you'd like better quality for voice and sound-- I wouldn't recommend these at all. If you'd like a product that's going to last over a year-- don't. Go look somewhere else and invest a little more money. I expect these to last for six months with heavy use.",Sometimes the mic doesn't work after a good while of use

I bought these to replace the costco headphones that are battery assisted and where like 60 bucks. So those 60 dollar headphones broke at the dang cord, and cannot be replaced. This cord is the best you can buy and likely wont break the same way as it is protected and flexable.

Sound quality is awesome. The battery assisted ones could go a little louder, but after listening for hours like I usually do, my ears were sore. This is great sound right to the point where it is dangerous, but not hitting that line.

One has to look at their use type to determine their needs of course, but for likely 90% of people the goal is sound quality, comfort and reliability for the money and these Sony's really are fantastic for the price I paid ($20). I use these everywhere, including at the gym where they stay in place better than many earpiece units I've tried, on my mp3 player, tablet or computer for music or tv/movie watching, for audio books and for phone use. There is a slightly cheaper version of these that don't have the microphone but for hands free talk from my phone I can hear those I speak to very well and I also am told I can be heard well too. True these headphones don't have quite the ear hugging pads of some of the higher priced noise cancelling one's but they are still very good at blocking sound and are quite comfortable. These also have good extension for different sized noggins and while lightweight, they feel sturdy and well crafted. My kid has $200 Beats which take less abuse than my Sony's and in less than 3 months hers are already having sound issues while mine keep playing great. I'll be buying another pair of these just to put away, that's how much I like them.","Sony quality, great sound, a real value."
7,Was this review helpful to you?, December 8 2015,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"My ears are very sensitive to the touch with any headphone, and ear buds usually do not stay in my ears, and if I can even get them in, they are quite painful, even long after taking them out. Most low-priced over the head ear phones are also uncomfortable on my head and ears, and the older ones never sounded good.
I've only used these once for a couple of hours, so I can not comment on how long they last. If things change, I will amend my review. With these, the sound was clear, left and right separated well, and did not press too hard on my ear. When I took them off after a couple of hours of use, my head around my ears was slightly sore/sensitive, but that did not last longer than 5 minutes. As I said, that area of my head is quite sensitive.
For $15 I highly recommend these.","they are quite painful, even long after taking them out"

They turned out to be a good set of headphones. The sound quality is good. They are comfortable on the head and ears. The only minor complaint is the person sitting next to you can hear everything if the volume is turned up. And since one of the main reasons you wear headphones is to not bother anyone with your noise, it loses one star. The cord is short, but if you use them with your phone or laptop, it works out perfect. I bought these for a TV, so I might have to buy and extension.

I'm not an audiophile by any means, rather a fairly regular guy looking for a pair of headphones on a budget that will still do a good job delivering great sound quality. These are absolutely the headphones that will do that. Sound quality is excellent from fountains of Wayne's ""Stacies Mom"" to childish gambino's ""Oakland."" Comfort wise the headphones are also excellent, there is no pinch, they're very lightweight, and the ear cups are very comfortable.

The only reason I give these headphones 4 stars is the build materials. Because they are a low cost headphone they are made of a fairly run of the mill plastic, along with that the swivel design is something that I can forsee breaking in the future, it's not flimsy, rather just the mechanism is of it puts a pretty good deal of torque on a fairly small joint.

If you're looking for a pair of new headphones buy these. For the price they can't be matched, just remember you're buying them for less than $20 so don't expect any thing too crazy in the build materials and quality","Excellent Budget Headphone, Not Perfect, But Worth It"

The headphones excel at both, sounding much better than the admittedly good iPad speaker and faithfully reproducing the guitar's tones. (Though that last isn't always doing me any favors.) The headphones sound every bit as good as my gaming headsets costing four times as much. The bass is strong without being overpowering or artificial or distorted, midrange and treble are equally pure and balanced.

I fixed it; just needed to find the small metal pin, reinsert it into the joint and screw everything back together. Unfortunately, it promptly broke again, so apparently ours was defective. I have been working with Sony Customer Service (not always an easy proposition- let's just say English is not the first language of their mostly otherwise helpful and courteous CS representatives) to get a replacement under the 90-day warranty. Had to call them twice in two weeks, then had to send the defective ones back at my expense to Sony. Quite frankly, not a stellar experience, there...
The design of the swiveling speakers is neat, and when it works, convenient for storage. Don't know if the issue we experienced is widespread or not.

I didn't expect fantastic sound. However, I was upset because the comparison chart said the headphones would be over the ear headphones and I definitely received on-ear headphones. I feel like that was really misleading and should be corrected. I originally got these headphones because of the great reviews and I was sick of the headphone jacks on my dollar stores headphones. I can honestly say that the jack on these headphones is even WORSE than dollar store headphones. If I move even the tiniest bit, and even when I haven't moved at all, the sound will come out of the laptop speakers instead of the headphones. I willing to put up with the fact that these are on-ear, but the jack is annoying me so much that I was moved to write a review. I never write reviews. I thought I was making a better investment with these headphones, but honestly I'd rather stick with the dollar store ones.

The jack is a bit fishy at times and sometimes, you hear static. But, again, these were required and the cheapest recommendation for my course. That's the only reason I bought them. And, I usually love all Sony products. I have several GREAT Sony products, so I am kind of disappointed with these.",I love the way these headphones are so compact when you ...

The only thing I will say is that after about a year of use the chord starts to shorten out a bit. And that's after avid use as I wear them to workout at the gym four to five days a week for two hours a day. Great pair of reasonably priced headphones.,Good quality for the price

$70 Audio-Technica ATH-M30x. I first tried these Sony headphones on and was quite pleased. Nice bass response and good overall sound. I was satisfied.

But then I tried the ATH-M30x and noticed the difference immediately. These had much better dynamic range. The highs where a lot brighter and the lows were even lower and more defined. Most importantly the mid range (voices) sound much much clearer.

I tried these Sony headphones again and they sounded pretty bad now. I could really hear how bad the voices seemed muffled and all the treble I was missing.

I'm not suggesting to get the ATH-M30x, as I'm not sure if I'll keep those either (now I'm curious about a higher class headphones). I'm just saying when you compare the Sony's to other headphones they are actually not that good.",You get what you pay for

Item arrive mint in condition. Sound and voice quality is good. Great sony product with a good price point. Recommeded by my friend. But the downside is the wire is a bit fragile. The 2 wires below the the 2 ear cups on each side. If you set the headset down resting on those 2 cable connection to the ear cup. The wires will be easily damage. The weight of the headphone will be pressing down on the thin wire connection causing some static to the headset. Can be fix if you know how to open it and straighten the wire back. Got to be very careful how you set the headphone down. It's a Android headphone. If you want to use it with a PC, need to buy a audio mic splitter adapter like the creative had.",Good Android and PC headphone.

They don't stay well on top of my head unless I'm stationary so i end up trying to make them shorter/tighter. They also hurt my ears after about 30 minutes because they hit right on outside of auricle (and neither are my head or ears larger than typical). We bought 2 pair and my 7-year old son likes them a lot, perhaps because he's got smaller ears they fit him better? I gave my pair to my other son (13) and he also likes them for use gaming.

1. no strain relief at wire and ear cap -- more likely to break, i.e. crappier
2. plastic design of housing is molded to be more lighter and more hollow, i.e. weaker and crappier
3. new hinging design seems to be quite weak, less smooth and more shear-y (it's this weird, crappy plastic-om-plastic bearing), gives the tactile feel of crappier quality.
4. wires to aux have a thinner casing -- i.e. are crappier

Darnit, Sony, stop cheaping out and obsolescing the old design.","Cheap compared to previous design, optimized to make Sony money, but not to impress customer base."

I use a switcher to alternate between headphones and speakers whenever I need to keep the sound to myself. I work on video editing, so I use these ALL the time. After almost two years they are still going strong with nice and crisp sound. I do not hear any distortion or buzzing. It's true what other reviewers mention, they feel a little cheap, but guess what? They are! I bought them fully knowing that they would be everyday working headphones and not leisure or audiophile ones, for that I spent a lot more money and got much better sounding quality. Even so, I took them home a few nights ago (I used a good case protector) to use while at bed and while I could clearly hear the difference between this pair and the good ones, I could still listen to my tunes without issue. They stay on my head at all times.

Pros:
- Easy to use

Cons:
- Single layer cable, is not braided
- Terrible QA, see my picture
- So-so build quality
- Leaks audio at higher volumes
- Shorter cable

Exceeds my expectations, especially considering I got them for $10. I prefer these to the $70 over-the-ear headphones I bought a few years back, since those often leave my ears sore after a few hours. The sound is adequate for my needs. I am a writer and sit and write for long periods of time. I enjoy listening to classical music while I write, and these headphones suit that purpose well. I would purchase these again, and in fact, will likely purchase a pair to take with me when I travel.",Best value for the money yet.

I'm sure everyone hears you too. They're not loud at all. I wouldn't even say their a medium. The bass is pretty much obsolete and the speakers rattle. They're cheaply made and easily fall apart. Very fragile. I find that shopping for headphones on Amazon has become a task because the item is always broken when it arrives. I found a better pair for 23 bucks at a local store. The mic doesn't work well at all and people say they cannot hear me clearly. Consider spending an extra 40 on a good pair or visiting a local store.,Waste of money.

1,Was this review helpful to you?, May 18 2016,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave it 5 stars because of the price and sound quality. If these cost $50 instead of $15 they would get maybe 2 or 3 stars. But with these I apply the 80/20 rule.....at 20% of the price of higher end headphones you still get 80% of the quality. With the 80/20 rule its the other 20% of quality that can really drive the price up :-)

Build Quality; Good enough, little cheapy/plasticy. The padded ear pieces are good enough, and the chord is a nice bonus as its thicker (less prone to damage and tangeling). One mark against them is I found the padding to be a little too much, making my ears a little warm after a couple hours. Some headphones have less padding and a more open design.

Sound; With brands like Bose and Beats I expect a bias in terms of sound profile (eg. too much hi/lo, too much bass, etc...). With the Sony's, the profile is pretty even from the low to mids to highs. Songs with heavier bass sounded fine, with the bass neither under or over emphasized. In terms of quality there's no noticeable distortion. Nice and clean.

If Sony built these with slightly better materials, and added more emphasis to the bass and treble, they could probably sell them for $50+. And, I'm sure they do.",Great for the price.
2,Was this review helpful to you?, February 20 2016,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"For what they are, they deserve 5 stars. I'm more of a habitual user of earbuds, but I wanted a set that I use specifically and only for around my house. For the longest time, I used one pair of earbuds for everything, which led to me constantly having to go to my car or back into the house to get them. For starters, these headphones are very well built! The wires are relatively thick, but not obtrusively so, and the plastic feels very rugged and durable. They are extremely comfortable. I was skeptical of their comfort level considering they don't fit over the entire ear, but the cushy pads work very well. I have no problem wearing these for hours. The sound quality is quite nice. Now I will admit that my buds have a little more sonic depth, but don't worry 13 year old boys- this has good bass, the most important musical quality for anyone under 16. The sound quality is, at most, 4 stars, but I didn't expect perfection (nor did I intend on using these for my music player). These are perfect for watching movies, shows, or YouTube. The fact that they fold up is just a fun little bonus. If you just need a set of headphones for generalized computer use, I can't see you doing wrong with these.",Great budget pair

We are a family of ten with a lot of gadgets and gizmos that require headphones. Plus several youngins' who need headphones for school. This latest adaptation is slightly different from the original in that the cords are flat. Performance though continues to be outstanding. We only ever need to replace these because they've been lost. In the no less than 5 years we have been purchasing these we've purchased other ""top quality"" brands that just do not offer the sound quality or comfort that these do. Frankly, the price is always right and as long as the product is able to withstand a family that includes and bunch of little ones we will continue to purchase well into the future.

4,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, January 16 2015,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are the definition of ""bang for your buck."" I actually own their predecessor, the MDR-ZX100. There is a little more bass than the 100s, but it's not going to blow you away. The cans do a good job of delivering music at high volumes with no distortion. The jack is more slender than the 100s, and should fit into most iPhone cases (fits into mine with no problem). The inline mic picks up my voice just fine, but note there are no volume controls. Just one button to wake up Siri or to pause music. The 110s also fold up a little more nicely than the 100s, and they will fit nicely in my backpack while laying flat.

I suppose if there is a drawback, it's that Sony used a glossy plastic for the exterior of the cans. That means you'll have fingerprints visible. But that's all I can think of as as drawback.

Overall, if you are looking for a replacement for an aging set, even if they are the 100s, I'd say go for it. If the inline mic is not something you think you'll use, there's a version without one that will save you a few bucks.",Best Bang for Buck

However, when I switched to the iPhone 6S, the smartphone started to engage Voice Control for no reason and with no physical intervention. The Voice Control would occur randomly whenever the headphone plug is rotated, which would occur if you were exercising or just moving around. I had the iPhone 6S replaced per Apple warranty, and the same symptoms occurred with the second iPhone 6S. I then used a different headphone on my iPhone 6S, and it worked fine.

6,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, March 4 2016,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received these. I got them primarily for use on my computer, mostly just listening to videos but also to use with voice recognition software, so I got the one with the microphone..

I'm not an audiophile, but I did want decent sound in case I use them on a music player. They sound just fine, as you would expect from Sony, especially at this price point.

I'm quite happy that they work very well with Dragon NaturallySpeaking, which I'm using to dictate this, so the microphone is quite adequate.

What is nice is that the microphone is on one of the wires and it is not more than three or 4 inches from your mouth. Again quite happy with the fact that it works quite well with Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

I can't see me using this for telephone calls. For some reason I don't feel comfortable with over the ear headphones, or earbuds for calls. I don't get a real sense of feedback to be able to modulate my voice. For phone calls I prefer a single ear unit.

The big disappointment is that, like so many Sony headphones I've had in the past these things are so tight, it squeezes your head like a grapefruit. What I've done is take a hairdryer to the headband to heat up the plastic, and attempt to bend it a bit to loosen it up. I've had some success in making them more comfortable. At least this plastic is somewhat malleable, because I found that some of the other plastics are almost impossible to bend without breaking.

For me they'll do the job quite well for something under $20.

After wearing them now for just a few minutes I remember what I hate about most headphones. The vinyl earpiece cover always make your ears hot.
Now I'm on the search for foam or cotton cover to go over these.",They'll do the job.

Great sound, sturdy cable and connector, and very affordable. I got a pair for listening to Chopin at work and have been very happy with them. Comparing these against a set of bose on-ear headphones, the bose do have a noticeably better sound, especially if you're like me and prefer to listen to music in FLAC. Otherwise, on just mp3 these will fit the bill nicely. While these don't have noise cancelling, like the bose, they do get quite loud and don't have noticeable distortion. Lastly, while comfortable these do get uncomfortable if you're wearing them for more than 3 hours at a time. So that's you, the most comfortable headphones I've had were the bose in-ear buds due to the silicon inserts. However, those headphones died after two years because it had junky wiring and didn't hold up to getting tossed in a backpack the way these have.

8,Was this review helpful to you?, May 18 2015,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are JUST what I was looking for: a budget set of commuter headphones. I need headphones that are closed, so as not to bother the people sitting next to me on the subway. Sound leakage on these is negligible. Thumbs up.

I need headphones that are smallish, and foldability is a plus. These are smallish and they fold easily. Another thumbs up.

They are lightweight, and feel a bit flimsy, so I would expect they will not stand up to much abuse. Luckily I have a headphone bag to keep them in when they're not on my ears or hanging around my neck.

I also wanted headphones that are not garish. These have a simple, classic and understated design that will not draw attention to themselves or look dated in a couple of years. Thumbs up.

The sound: so far, I'd say the sound is very good, especially for such inexpensive, closed phones. I'm listening to some Van Halen and the frequency range is good, with lots of punch and lots of presence. Another thumbs up.

Not sure I buy into the whole ""burn-in"" mantra, but I'm interested to see if they sound better in a week or two. Also curious as to how they'll handle other music styles (classical, jazz, etc).

So, first impressions: this is a GREAT set of budget commuter headphones. Superior, in my opinion, to ear-buds, which I can't stand.

EDIT: Ok, first real negative. The hard plastic headband is not comfortable after a little while. I'm going to have to superglue some padding to make them more comfortable.","Great set of budget, commuter headphones!"

The do what they're supposed to do, deliver sound in to your ears from whatever device you've plugged the 3.5mm audio jack in to. I use it to listen to audio from my laptop in bed when watching Netflix/TV/etc. while my spouse watches the regular TV. They are on-the-ear headphones so they probably won't be the most comfortable to wear for long periods of listening but they work just fine for me in short stints. I like that the jack is an L-shape so it doesn't just stick right straight out from whatever device it's plugged in to.","Good, cheap headphones."

I have a big head and find them tight and uncomfortable. The ""natural"" position for these headphones is about 1.5"" apart, which means for every inch you stretch it around your head, the tighter it gets. The sound quality is muddled and has little sparkle or clarity to the highs. The bass is OK in the mid bass range, but sub bass is very poor. I won't bother to return them, for $15 bucks it's not worth it. Don't misunderstand, they are fine for the price...I understand these are not $300 headphones, but my Audio Technica's are relatively cheap too and blow these out of the water.",Don't live up to the reviewers hype by far

1,5 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, May 9 2017,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is based on my first impressions with the ""110's"" on a number of mp3 player, and a number of ""100's"" (the previous model https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WODP20/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) that I have had and used over the years.

Pro - Sound Quality
So far I DO notice more bass in these new (my first pair of the ""110's"") pair of headphones and unlike prior experience with Sony (and other companies too ...) earbuds where the ""new great model"" .. didn't sound as good as the prior ones did ...

These 110's just add enough to the bass and possibly treble too, that makes it definitely sound better then the 100's though it doesn't fall into the trap I described above, when sometimes they add ""more bass"" and it turns out the bass is so strong, that it drowns everything else out. I have to say that this is not really a knock on the 100's .. I do still like them but for the same price on either ... I'd go with the 110's but if there is a ""good deal"" on the 100's and I was getting them again ... I am not against getting another pair of the 100's either.

Yes these are ""cheap"" headphones and probably not as good quality wise as a really expensive pair though I do recall some reviews saying they tried these along side a pair of ""$200 Beats"" and while the did say their friend's Beats did sound better ... they personally would rather get maybe two or three pair of these and still have say $150 left over ... meaning ""they do not sound price-vs-quality of the sound"" .. 'that much better'

Pro/Con - Build quality
These ARE plastic headphones of course, though I do not agree with those that say ""oh its like they are from the Dollar store ... the plastic is horrible ..etc etc""... just if your going to buy a much more expensive pair of headphones ... your will probably get better quality too

The one downside that ... I admit I see in these, and are a problem in the pair of ""the 100's"" that was 100% caused by me ... AND EVEN THEN that exact pair, needed fixing but still sounds great ... I am using THEM while typing this review, is the part where the 100's and the 110's ear-cups move. I am not sure ""how it could be made better"" but that was the exact point of failure for my long-used pair (again 100% my fault for HOW the break,happened) .. note that if it wasn't for me they would still be fine and that is after 3+ years of HEAVY use and they still work ... so maybe it's fine for being able to fold (in both models I mean)

Pro - Fit
I am not sure if i can say one way or the other ""I have a big head"" (100% not a small head) but they fit fine .. even out of the box. Heck after that DIY type of repair I did on my broke pair .. .I had to flip them backwards and .. they for the most part still fit great ... these 110's are no different.

By the way I have glasses (regular and sunglasses used when wearing these) and just like the 100's, these are nice and comfy ... not too tight or too lose, if you ask me

??? - The cord
The cord looks different from the 100's I have and I like the cord ... basically I think some of the cords on others are way way too small and that always leads to the problem of one of the two sides going out for good ... The cord on the 110's looks a tad smaller diameter wise but really if that doesn't mean that issue I just described DOESN'T happen .. I do not really care... I just want the headphones to work for a long time ... if the cord is different but there are no issues ... this change is fine by me.

Plug - I will keep this review updated IF there is a change but I have no had these for long enough to comment on some of the reviews who keep having issues with the plug breaking ... NOT on this pair but my other pair of the 100's get plugged into and unplugged from stuff for over three years now and often too ... never had a problem .. but then again I cant comment on these. for now.

Summary

I would recommend these no question ... though if your expecting a super high end sound (aka are an ""audiophile"") you MAY BE disappointed though as someone who loves his music ... I think the sound with the right equalizer settings, on the device or program your using... I do LOVE the sound of these.

Update - After using a new pair of the ""100's"" ... aka the prior model

Really ... the 110's do have the slightly higher bass and that is not a bad thing either .... the new pair of the 100's I am using I actually thought were the 110's (I just forgot what headphones I was using)... THE POINT? ... they both have great bass and I think the pair that I use to wear daily (the broken pair that still works great.... just doesn't fit perfectly anymore)'s fit actually effects the bass ... that old pair I hold the earcups closer to my ears than how they ""sit"" now .. .and I hear alot more bass.

Between the 100s and 110's ... if the way each one of them fold doesn't matter to you for say fitting them into a caring case .... I recommend both 1000% (no typo) ... find the best deal ... if you can get one a little cheaper than the other ...cool ... there is more bass by a little bit on the 110's but do not think I am saying a new pair of the 100's are weak in that department.",Nice improvement on an already good model of Sony ON ear headphones

The fit is a bit on the snug side (which seems common with many headsets). The sound also seemed a bit ""heavy."" Maybe it's just me. After lowering the volume control a little, the sound quality improved, so perhaps I just grew accustomed to the old headset I've been using. Overall, for the price, the quality is very good.

I wouldn't buy another one pair if the band breaks because I don't have a large head and the band stretching this much shouldn't happen for an average sided noggin. The stretched band also results in a looser fit which means a reduced seal with the ear that lets in ambient noise. The ear pads are comfortable despite sitting on the ears for hours some days - maybe that's due to the spread headband. The set is pretty light. The cord is on the longish side if you just use this with your cell phone.

The lows frequencies are almost nonexistent. There's just enough to let you know there's a drummer pounding the bass, but it's definitely nothing overpowering and not punchy or boomy - it's just barely there. The mids are recessed and slightly veiled and the highs are just meh - I don't think there's much reach on the high end. But really, this is nitpicking because these sound so much better than a $200 seat of Beats and an outstanding value at $15 which is what I paid for mine. I think these go as low as $10 on occasion. For the cost of a set of winter ear muffs, I have a decent set of headphones that play music well enough for mass transit commuting - and also keeps my ears warm ;)

My better set is Audio Technica's ATH-A900x which are probably on low end of the high end, but those are too unwieldy to take outside imho. So comparing these two headphones, I can easily say the set of Sony's has great price to performance ratio.",This is a good set of headphones to throw around and not worry ...

I understand that certain people are discerning, but I suspect that i's just a status symbol. Especially after hearing the clear and rich quality of these headphones. I've always trusted Sony as a brand and they have yet to let me down. These headphones are comfortable, have a great high end and a nice (not overly thumping) bass. Why would I pay more? I was a little skeptical about the folding design, but in practice, the natural shape of the head stops them from folding accidentally.",As Good as Any Headphones You've Heard! Why Pay More?

Was this review helpful to you?, January 3 2015,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Part of the reason I am giving these headphones a five-star rating is the incredible price I got them for on amazon - $10! For just $10, these are excellent headphones! I picked up a couple pairs so that my kids can use them in the van on long car rides when they want to watch a movie on the portable DVD player. We used them over our Christmas holiday travels, and my wife has been taking them to the gym with her, too, for use with the treadmill monitor. (We both despise earbuds and consider them one of the worst inventions of the century!)

Hopefully, these will last a lot longer than the no-name discount headphones my wife purchased at the local drugstore last year. Those were more expensive than these and we had problems with those after only six months of use. Both of those have gone into the garbage can and have been replace with these Sony headphones.

I need headphones that have great sound across my very eclectic music collection-- mainly classical, opera and classic rock, but occasionally some jazz, country or pop-- and are comfortable, because I listen all day while I am working. Price was also a significant consideration-- I can no longer see my way clear to paying $50+ for a set of headphones. These deliver on all accounts! The sound is rich, vocals and instruments come across very clearly and distinctly, and bass response is excellent without being overly ""thumpy"". The pads are comfortable on my ears for all-day listening, and these are also very lightweight. The appearance is basic, classic, and not at all flashy, so they can pass for a professional appearance at work. The cord is thick and sturdy, and the size is widely adjustable. The folding feature is neat, but these stay at the office all the time so not that important for me. I can see it being convenient for traveling. All in all, I would buy these again and again if I were to lose them or break them, and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for an excellent set of headphones at a very decent price.",Excellent sound at an awesome price.

Sony advertises a frequency range of 12-22,000 hz but does not quantify it. I made my own measurements, with an accuracy of +/- 0.5 db from 15 hz to 18,000 hz, that show these headphones provide nearly flat response, within +/- 2 db from 30 hz to 11,000 hz. Many expensive headphones do not perform as well, although their build quality and listening comfort may be better.
Evaluations are usually subjective and each person has his own hearing response function and preferences. Since I am an engineer, I like to see data. There are a number of frequency response graphs made by Headroom that you can find for reference. I have a studio-quality Sony MDR-V6 and found a chart for it by Headroom. I made my own measurements and got very good agreement with Headroom’s results, +/- 1 db. The V6 has nearly flat response, mostly within +/- 2 db from 15 hz to 11,000 hz. Sony advertises a frequency range of 5-30,000 hz. The Headroom graph also shows a sharp dip around 6000 hz. I see the dip at loud signal levels above 100 db but it nearly goes away at comfortable listening levels of 80 db or less. The Sony MDR-ZX110 has a very similar frequency response to the V6 at comfortable listening levels, but develops enhanced bass and high frequency dips and spikes at loud listening levels. At comfortable listening levels there is little difference between the two headphones. In the 25+ years since the V6 was introduced there have been a number of improvements in headphones so that an inexpensive model like the ZX110 can produce nearly comparable results.",Nearly a match for more expensive headphones

I have in the ear headphones for when I work out and see many folks with over the ear headphones doing the same. The sound quality of the Sony phones is just fine but I was unable that I would be able to hear so much outside noise. Guess I should have tried a pair before I bought them. I now use them when I am on my computer and they work just fine....much less noise in those surroundings. I guess I could give them 4 stars but I am deducting a star for my own stupidity for not checking them out better before I bought!,Should have tried before I bought!

I mainly use them for listening to music on my phone and for late night gaming on a PS4 when I don't want to wake up the wife and kids.

These are a sturdy pair of headphones. Most headphones under $20 are flimsy and cheap feeling but these are very solid. I wish there was a head pad though since the plastic is a little too hard for me.

The sound quality is great for the price point. These are perfect for basic every day use. Initially I thought the sound quality was poor but it was caused by me being used to the in ear buds I've been using. Once I was accustomed to the new headphones the sound was great. Although, one thing I don't like is that these headphones are quiet. On my phone, I have to turn the volume up almost to the max. This just might be my personal preference though since I like to tune out all outside noise when listening to music.

These are not a high end pair of Bose or Beats so don't expect perfect quality. These are a great pair of solid headphones that are more than adequate for every day use. As long as you keep expectations realistic you'll thoroughly enjoy these headphones.",Great Headphones For a Great Price

Using them for playback from the Amazon Cloud Player app on my iPad, to my ears the higher frequencies while clearer than the old headphones, could have been brought forward a little bit more. However they remained exceedingly clear. This preference (again to my ears) is easily adjusted with any playback application that contains a graphic equalizer.

With or without a graphic equalizer, the Sony headphones brought out portions of the music tracks making it almost like listening to music with an upgraded quality. I actually bought a second pair for use at home.

It worked on my Xbox One but I had to change a few settings so the sound from the headset wouldn't echo in parties. The ability to fold these headphones is a really cool feature, because it makes them easier to carry around. The headset has a button on the wire that can pause and play content. Overall, these headphones do not disappoint.",Great headphones for a great price!

They won't blow you away but the sound is sufficient for the average listener. Very clean, clear and crisp mid and highs. Bass response tends to flatten out at higher volumes, but tweaking the equalizer in my audio player overcomes that easily.

The cord is a little annoying as it is susceptible to tangling. I use a simple tie to keep the cable neat while packed away.

Overall I'm happy with the purchase. Great value for the price.",Lightweight and compact so they're perfect for travel

I plan on using them mostly for an electronic keyboard we own, and the sound coming through the headphones sounds fantastic -- better than the sound that comes through the external speakers on the keyboard itself (which still sounds decent). The only thing I'd dock a star for is that they feel a little tight. I haven't worn them for very long yet, but it seems like the tightness might be a small issue, and I think there's nothing you can do to adjust them from side-to-side (i.e. width-wise instead of length-wise). Otherwise, they seem great.","Great sound, perhaps a little tight"

I use them to listen to CDs from iTunes on my MBPR. They don't muffle out all outside sounds (so what), but they do prevent others from being bothered with my musical choices.
Excellent quality, especially at the price point. I listen to lots of newer jazz (D. Holland, D. Douglas, B. Stenson. W. Leo-Smith, W. Parker, D.S. Ware, B. Frisell) - throw in some U2, Cowboy junkies, N.Young, B. Laswell etc - NO complaints.

1,Was this review helpful to you?, February 24 2018,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones do indeed do their job as expected and I am generally happy with the result. There is one warning that prevents me from giving this product five stars. It makes a lot of static noises upon first usage. This problem did naturally go away over time as I used them more and more, but it does seem like an issue that could possibly cause a customer to demand a refund if he is not willing to wait out the sound. Other than that issue, the product is great. The cord is a reasonable distance and the sound comes out nicely. It is not extremely comfortable and sort of lacks smooth adjustment maneuvers for the head size, but it gets the job done perfectly, especially for the cheap price it sells for.

I'd recommend the head set coming with a small package of the restrainers that it comes with upon opening. I'm sure I'm not the only person who treats wrapping up his headphones nicely as a big deal, but often lose the restrainer. Doing this might send a hidden message to the customer that the seller expects this thing to last a good while as long as it is taken care of.","Static noise upon first time usage, but it goes away over time."

Maybe I'm getting old, but I was sick of the in-ear buds that my cell phone came with, and wanted some comfort in my life. I purchased these after reading the reviews that they're comparable to the Beats headphones. I don't have a magical ear, but these sound great to me, certainly better than I'd expect $20 headphone to sound. And if you're picky enough to want the sound of $250 headphones, then go buy some $250 headphones--simple, right? I did not want to spend more that $20, and I did not want something that looked ridiculous. These feel amazing on my ears, and don't look odd on my head. I wore them for 8 hours during my plan ride, and felt great. I also like that these can be pulled off my ear and sit on my neck. In-ear buds always got caught in my purse, or fell on the floor (yuck).",Comfortable and sound great!

Music on these is way richer than my MDRZX100. However, everything else seems to be drowned out on these vs the 100. TV shows feel like they have way too much bass. For music, I'd recommend the 110 to anyone but for all-around good sound, I'd have to fall back to the 100. Also, the 110's swivel is much more fragile than the 100's and I feel like it won't last long. My 100's have been dropped, kicked, stomped, and generally manhandled by my kids and they still work just as good as they did the day I bought them.",Music: WOW! Everything else: eh.

Was this review helpful to you?, January 12 2016,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Sony MDRZX110 stereo headphones are often lauded for their amazing sound quality, elegant design, and, most of all, stellar price. I wanted to test out these headphones to see if they were worthy of that praise, and (maybe) snap up some cheap backup headphones in the process.

These headphones sport a clean, minimal design, which I honestly appreciate. Though Beats headphones may look classy to you, I prefer the subtle, understated look Sony accomplished here. There are two models, Black and White (I chose the Black, but I was also able to have some hands-on time with my brother's White model). Each one features a matte finish on most of the body, which looks great; there is also a nice glossy portion on the backs of each ""earphone"" that accentuates the matte well. In terms of ports, the 3.5mm headphone jack is especially convenient, allowing you to connect straight to your phone if you'd like to kick back and listen to podcasts, movies, and, of course, music. There is another variant with a microphone built in, but I did not purchase this model and thus, I will not offer my opinion on it. Overall, build quality and design is excellent, but the top portion that sits atop your head feels a little flimsy, and though I appreciate the fact that the ""earphones"" fold inwards to create a compact package, I feel as though I will break them every time I try. Additionally, they're not completely comfortable, but I found that, during hours-long jam sessions, I never noticed them or had a reason to take them off and stop listening.

In terms of sound quality, Sony absolutely nailed it here. I concur with the other reviewers on this point - it's a nice, balanced sound. You get solid bass and great quality across the spectrum. I honestly think that these headphones could replace your Beats or more expensive equivalent if necessary. Sure, you won't get the complete range in crystal-clear quality and you won't feel as though you're in the recording studio (which is OK because pretty much no modern pair of headphones can achieve that), but (and this is a common theme throughout my review) for a starting price of fifteen bucks, it is a little difficult to nitpick here.

For the price, it's absolutely one of the best products I've had the pleasure of using. These Sony ZX series headphones pack a serious, bass-filled punch. They sport a modern and minimal design and sound quality is remarkable. Sure, the latest pair of top-of-the-line headphones will probably sound quite a bit better than these, and the build quality is weak in some areas, but again - consider the price and you'll be in awe of their performance. Absolute joy to use.",Modern and minimal

I was a little surprised when I opened them and saw how small they are. The ones I had before were over the ear, not on ear, so were slightly bigger. These are fine though. They're comfortable and fit well. I gave them 4 stars because they're not very loud. I can put my music on max volume and still afford to go louder. This is my personal preference, of course, so I'm sure anyone who prefers to listen to music at normal levels won't notice.",Exactly as described

They can take a beating but I didn't want to keep dragging them back and forth to work, so I decided to pick up another similar pair, expecting similar robustness from Sony.

The sound quality is what I expect from $16 headphones, but the design is lacking, compared to the MDR-V150:
- The folding part does not have a strong detent so it is easy to collapse, even just picking them up off a desk.
- The made the ""left side indicator"" (for tactile-y recognizing left-right) very small on the band, instead of on the back of the driver,
- There are no labels for increments on the adjustable size band. The MDR-V150 has numbers for reading the size of the band, these do not, no lines or anything to check size before you put it on your head.

4,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, May 13 2015,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was just looking for some fairly simple headphones to drown out some of the noise at work... I didn't really need a microphone and wasn't really intending to use them with my phone, but the version with the mic was only about $5 more, and I figured it wouldn't hurt to keep my options open.

They work great for their intended purpose. I listen to an assortment of streaming music throughout the day and it sounds great. I'm no audiophile and I don't have the vocabulary to to properly express things like tone and range - but the music I'm listening to sounds good. At least as good as any other speakers or headphones I've used.

The addition of the mic is actually pretty nice, even when I'm not really using it. There's a button on the cord that (when plugged into a device that supports it) serves to mute and unmute the microphone when it's in-use... But it also serves to mute and unmute music when it's just playing music. That's additional functionality that I hadn't expected, and I'm quite happy with it.

The cable is a little bit on the short side - only about four feet long. That's more than long enough to reach my phone or computer, but both of those are sitting atop my desk. If I were trying to plug into something tucked away inside a cabinet or down on the floor I'd be having a hard time.

The headphones fold up for travel. They don't get especially compact... But simply rotating the earphones flat makes transportation much easier.

They're a little creaky. Nothing horrible... But if I move just right there's some creaking in my ears. It isn't a big issue since I'm typically using them at my desk, but I'm sure it'd be more noticeable if I were wearing them while doing something more active - running or something like that.",Great headphones for the price

JVC which are even worse but i call those ''garbage''
since they do not even reproduce music at all that
could be considered music...just musical static....

do know how to do it right but choose to make inferior

Tangle-free cables resists snags so you can get caught up in your music – not your cord.

These foldable headphones include a hidden microphone – seamlessly interfacing with your smartphone.

And the best part is the price – these under-$20 foldable headphones could easily sell for 10 times the price.

Here are the benefits and advantages of these Sony foldable headphones:

– Amazing sound… especially for the super low price… delivers nice solid bass and good clean mids and highs…
– Swivel, folding design is so compact it fits in the smallest part of any backpack…
– Adjustable to fit virtually any size head…
– On-the-ear 30mm dome type headphones are surprisingly comfortable…
– Perfect length cord (almost 4 feet long)… and easily add an extender (see below)…
– Tangle-free cables…
– Tough as nails construction (with soft, cushioned material for our ears)…
– Works on any device with a 1/8″ 3.5 mm CTIA output jack (a.k.a. the “pointy” connector)…
– Employs passive noise cancelling… these foldable headphones shave 15 to 20 decibels (dB) off room noise… cuts about 30% of the noise inside a jet…
– Microphone works on any four-conductor stereo mini plug… works perfectly with Skype/Google Hangouts – even Siri and Google Voice…
– More accurate dictation than using built-in computer microphones…
– Works on any device supporting a Y-type / Plug: L-shaped stereo mini plug…
– The impedance is 24 Ω at 1 kHz.

Here are the downsides of these Sony foldable headphones:

– No in-line volume control (instead relies on device’s volume controls)…
– Too loose and bulky to use for intense workouts (or jogging).

There are a few accessories you might consider buying with the Sony MDRZX110 ZX Series Stereo Headphones:

Cosmos ® PU Leather Protection Carrying Box for LG Electronics Tone LG HBS730 / HBS-750 / HBS-760 / HBS-800 Stereo Wireless Bluetooth Headset - Black
If you are looking to protect your headphones while traveling, this Cosmos hard-shell carrying case is a great – especially as an under-$10 solution.

TRIPP LITE P318-006-MF 3.5mm Mini Stereo Audio 4 Position Headset Extension Cable
To extend the length of these headphones, a 4-pole, mini-stereo plug is needed to work with Sony’s foldable headphones with microphone.

IMPORTANT: Plug in your headphones into the extension cable BEFORE plugging the extension cable into your computer or mobile device. This helps to ensure proper hardware detection.

The sound is weak and the bass is mediocre. There are others out there that's built much better with better sound quality. One for example is the Intone I60 Lightweight Folding 3.5mm Stereo Over-ear Headphones Portable Stretch Headsets Earphones Leather Earpad with Build-in Microphone and Control Button for All Smartphones,laptops,tablets,pc,mp3/mp4,psp,ipod. It's only for a few dollars more but you'll see that the quality is there and the sound is much richer with better bass. My biggest problem I have with this Sony headphone is the built quality. It's very flimsy and just feel very cheap(well, granted it is inexpensive) but there are others out there that's better. I'm really let down by the brand Sony. The packaging is inadequate as well, a simple plastic cover over a thin cardboard and a plastic mold holding the headset. You'll see what I mean if you still decide to order one after reading this review. I really think a customer can do much better than this headphone. Don't buy it just because of brand loyalty because you'll only be disappointed.

They aren't the same quality as Beats but then again these headphones aren't over $100 either. If you want a decent set of headphones and don't want to spend a ton of money then these are a great bargain. You can wear them to the gym and if they grow legs or get damaged then you won't be too upset. They look good and are comfortable to wear. They have held up to normal use with no signs of wear.

I use them to watch movies/video on my mac when the family is watching tv in the same room. I'm not an audiophile so I'm not looking for superior sound. I hear bass and treble clearly and thats good enough for me. The fit is comfortable even during long periods of use. The length is perfect for desktop use and I have enough slack to turn around or sitback when watching a movie. I've had these for over a year and a half and am still happy with my purchase. They work and look like they did when I first bought them.,Great sound and great fit.

At this price, these are unbeatable. Folding design, distinct mellow base, and excellent sound. Compared to my daughter's Beats by Dre and the Beats have better clarity and treble and they block outside sound better, but at about 10x the cost, these are a far better value. Very enjoyable...buy a pair of these for low cost and then see how you like on ear headphones BEFORE you buy the Beats or Bose units. Undoubtedly the Beats/Bose are far superior, but these are really good and you will get a good idea of whether an upgrade is really the way you want to go. Awesome deal!",Perfect for first on-ears. Great range and sound.
5,Was this review helpful to you?, April 3 2016,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best sub-$25 headphones you can possibly get. The sound is even and full.

Pros:
- Cheap (price)
- Good solid bass
- Easy to drive from a phone or iPod
- Look halfway decent

Cons:
- Cheap (construction), my son has gone through like 3 pairs in the past 2 years. The plugs always wear out.
- Mediocre soundstage (for $15-$20, what are you expecting, these aren't Sennheisers)

Its easy to press the button on the microphone and answer calls without digging your phone our of your pocket.

I use them in conjunction with a ReSound Lynx2 hearing aid. This permits me to have good quality sound and since the microphone for the hearing aid is outside the earphone capsule I can for safety reasons maintain awareness of what is going on in the gym.The speaker for the hearing aid does not completely close the ear canal so I can hear the music quite well with these earphones. The extra base helps compensate for my hearing deficiency. I amended my rating from four to five stars because this is the best resource I have found. Wireless bluetooth have short battery life.

Was this review helpful to you?, February 5 2017,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased Sony MDRZX110AP ZX Series Extra Bass Smartphone Headset with Mic to listen to music from my phone at work. I've owned this for about a week now, and for my intents and purposes, I love this headset. However, for my personal audio preferences, not so much.

PROS:
1. Lightweight - This headset is very light comparing to other headsets that I owned.
2. Mic - Since I connect this headset to my phone, it is useful to have the mic to also be able to answer incoming phone calls without taking my headset off.
3. Compact - The earpieces folds really nicely into a flat shape (unlike the Sony MDR7506 or Audio-Technica ATH-M50 which are still bulky even when folded).
4. $20 - It is a very cheap headset. No argument there.

CONS:
1. Sound quality - Rather than ""extra bass"", it feels to me more like ""weak mid and high"". Everything feels mumbled.
2. Comfort - I use this headset at work (which means this thing sticks on my ear for a long period of time in a day, everyday), and on-ear headsets aren't the most comfortable headset.

All things considered, this is a very low price for a headset, but if audio quality and comfort is more important to you, I'd suggest putting in an extra $4.50 for something like the Sennheiser HD 202 II (I use these personally at home for music editing, and at time of writing this review it's sold for $24.50 at Amazon).

5,Was this review helpful to you?, August 9 2016,Sony MDRZX110/BLK ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ran across these headphones while searching for a pair of over-the-ear style, I wanted something that I could use to listen to YouTube videos 44 movies because I have A3 year old child that monopolizes the TV and I wanted the over-the-ear style to cancel out all the Disney. I'm older so I'm not trying to make a fashion statement by having a pair of $300 Dre Beats or Bose I took a chance on these because I love Sony products and the reviews, not to mention that I knew if I had any problems Amazon would let me ship them back for free with a full refund and being a Prime member just makes this even easier. Now one with the review I'm a large adult so least you're cops don't fully in case my ears like my Tony wireless headset for my PlayStation 4 does but they do cover the circumference of my ear comfortably the padding which feels like a very soft vinyl material is very comfortable they don't make my ears hot and sweaty and they do cancel outside noises as long as you have the mic on the line muted if not you'll still here outside stuff because of the inline mic which depending on how you're using them can be an advantage IE your child getting into something they shouldn't. When I first got them I plug them into my tablet fire it up a movie and I was absolutely floored with the sound quality some people say they don't go up loud enough what they do and then you know there's some programs that have sound boost and even with movies and Surround Sound with full Boost the headsets never distorted nice bass crisp treble incredible stereo like sound almost better than a movie theater you just feel like you're immersed in the movie. I've used them for phone calls and they're absolutely amazing and I've asked the other person hey can you tell I'm using a headset to talk to you and they can't tell and they can't hear my TV in the background. I plugged them into my PS4 controller and use them to game and the sound is just as good and people I chat with say that the that is perfectly clear no humming no popping no dropping and can't hear other people in the room talking. Easy to adjust they're comfortable on my large head and they fold up small for travel and I think mine came with a little bag to slide them into. In my opinion this headshot is not a one-trick pony they work great plugged into your phone to listen to music they're great plugged into a laptop or a tablet to watch movies on YouTube and I was surprised how well they work on my PlayStation 4 they just do it all and do it all well. They feel light and flimsy but they haven't broke and my three-year-old has gotten ahold of him a couple times and stretch them out and he didn't break them either which was shocking they don't have that creaky cheap plastic sound that I've seen an older model sony PlayStation headsets that costed $100+. It's only like that I would have had these in stock I would have bought them from there had them match Amazon's price and then paid the couple bucks for the 2-year Geek Squad just in case my kids would have gotten ahold of him and broke up but I got them off Amazon for only $17 they came in less than 2 days and we're going on 2 years now and they still work like brand new and my kids never broke them. I haven't loved a pair of headphones like these since I was a teenager and I used to have a Sony Walkman back in the day. Bottom line if you're looking for a nice set of over-the-ear headphones that can do everything you need them to do for under $20 these are the ones for you. I've used my friends headphones that cost over $100 and they're not any better than these. one of my friends was so impressed by these headphones that he bought them just to use with his PlayStation 4 and saved over $100 by doing this and he games every night.",Awesome cans
