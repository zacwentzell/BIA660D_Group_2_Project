Was this review helpful to you?, August 17 2016,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've tried a ton of headphones lately and these sound by far the best to me. I like generally flat sound. I'm more concerned with clear mids and highs and want present but not overpowering bass and low bass.
Headphones I've tried include the following with my totally subjective sound rating on 10 point scale. YMMV.

Audio Technica ATH-M50X - highs a little subdued for my liking - 7
Beats Studio 2 Wireless - Subdued highs, some mid bass emphasis but not overpowering. 6
Bose QC25 - A little weak on bass and weak on highs, best ANC. 7
Bose QC35 - Can be a little bassy, especially at low volume. Bright highs. Best ANC. 9
JBL - EVEREST 700 - Way too bassy. 5.
JBL - Everest Elite 700 - Much better than non-Elite, 7
OPPO PM-3 - Excellent, expensive. 10
Sennheiser 202 - yuck. Too bassy, no highs, but cheap. 4
Sennheiser 280 - well balanced. 8
Sennheiser Momentum M2 - Close to perfection. 9.5
Sennheiser PXC-550 - wireless noise cancelling. These are excellent. 9
Sony - MDRXB950BT/B - Extra bass says it all. 4
Sony 7506 - Perfection 10

Out of all that I've tried the Sony 7506 are closest to perfection, to live performance. They are not bass heavy at all but can produce comfortable solid bass down to quite low frequencies. Tonal balance leans towards the upper mids and highs. Bright but not harsh. You end up hearing subtle sounds in the music that is missing with other headphones. Those who want more bass or don't want bright highs won't like these. But for my listening taste this matches perfectly.

They are also very comfortable. Many of the headphones listed above are not as comfortable. Either tight band or thin band or ear cups that aren't big or deep enough. These headphones are great. Biggest disadvantage vs. many that I've tried recently is that these are wired... with a long heavy cord easy to get caught on things. I was looking for a wireless headphone. But ultimately I couldn't find one at a reasonable price that sounded anywhere near as good as these. Next closest was the Sennheiser PXC-550, but at $400, wireless wasn't worth an extra $320. I also found that there were times I didn't want noise cancellation. Too bad Sony doesn't make a wireless headphone with anywhere near this sound.
Best of all, these are by far the cheapest of the decent sounding headphones I've listened to. The headphones in this list range in prices from $20 to $450.
Highly recommend the Sony 7506... if you like this sort of sound signature.","Listened to a bunch of headphones, this are closest to perfection. Not bassy. Excellent mids and highs, solid lows."

Was this review helpful to you?, January 18 2015,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are my favorite pair of headphones I have tried so far. The overall sound of these are very balanced. This means the Low, Medium, and high tones are for the most part balanced out. You can easily look up a lot of information on these headphones. They are an industry standard which I have enjoyed owning for more than two years now.

The overall design of the headphones is fairly good. They are structurally well designed for the most part.
- Noise isolation is mediocre. You can hear people saying things through these depending on the volume.
- Sound leakage on the original pads is fairly low. People won't have to hear your music when it is at a fairly loud volume.
- Extremely long, coiled cable with 1/4-inch adapter. Possibly gold connections.
- Sturdy cable design. Each cable bend point is reinforced with additional rubber. Soldering to the driver seems sturdy as well, it should be able to withstand most tugs. This is usually not an issue with the gargantuan coiled cable. The coiled cable also prevents a large number of tangles!
- The headband is fairly comfortable. You could easily find a cover for it if it becomes a problem.
- Cup adjustment pieces have numbers on them to ensure a specific setting.

The problems I've had with these over time:
- Headband will lose its tension between your ears over time. These headphones no longer fit as soundly on my head as they used to.
- Faux leather pads will need to be replaced. I have included a picture of both of my ripped pads which I replaced with ""Beyerdynamic EDT250V Headphone Ear Pads Black"" these will create some additional noise leakage.
- The wire that connects the drivers to the headband can get stuck in the housing. (see picture) This may wear the wire a bit.
- Cable is extremely long. This can be an issue when you want to use these headphones outside of their intended purpose. The cable is generally a bit heavy, causing strain to the connections. I very often have to move it around to have it stop bothering me. The cable can be replaced with some soldering. There have been projects modifying the headphones to have a detachable cable. Google ""Sony MDR-7506 Detachable Cable Mod"" that I believe would improve the design of the headphones.
- Like all over the ear headphones, these will be uncomfortable with glasses. They do become very uncomfortable after a few hours.
- While these do come with a transport bag, even the fold up design makes them a bit of a pain to transport. This is to be expected.
- Fold up design doesn't center the cups when the length of each ear cup is at minimum. (See picture) Not sure what this does to the longevity of the headband.
- The blue portion of the ""Professional"" stickers on the sides are decals. One of mine peeled off. It looks similar, but is starting to disappear, and collects dust. (see picture)

Aside from a few gripes, these are still my favorite set of headphones. They simply sound right. I was appalled to go to the store and listen to some Bose headphones and hear how bad the quality was in comparison: for a set of $300 headphones.

These are undoubtedly worth the price. Don't hesitate to buy them if you can overlook the problems i have had.",SOUNDs like you should buy these headphones!

They are excellent, studio quality headphones. If you plan to wear them out and about though (like the NYC commuter I am) they effectively also serve as earmuffs. That's all well and good in winter, but on the June day I wore them out, I was sweating out the top of my head and down my neck. Amazing sound quality, but not great for being out in the heat. In their defense, these headphones never made that claim. They never made any claims at all, as they are an inanimate object without speech capability. They do have the capability to deliver superb sound quality though, which is mostly what you want in a pair of headphones.",High Quality Headphones
3,15 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, November 28 2015,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my 7506's. I do alot of video editing, edm production and djing as my main hobbies, and I would not use any other headphone. There is just something about these that reveals any and all audio errors. My rule of thumb is if it sounds good in these headphones it will sound good at the club and vice versa. Now that I have told you how much I love these they do have some major faults.

1. These headphones are very cold sounding even a bit harsh especially with low quality sources like spotify and soundcloud. These are aimed at the professional audience. If you have work to do get these. If you want to sit back and listen to music buy the mdrv6 or audio technica mh50x. As an aside everyone that says these and the mdrv6 are identical must be tone deaf. The v6 sounds warm with way more bass. By comparison the 7506's are harsh and cold with a more technical (tight) sound.

2. The ear pads are terribly uncomfortable do your self a favor and replace them immediately. For some reason I personally love the cloth pads from Turtle beach gaming headsets. I just hate leather and velour on headphones they make my head sweat and ears hot.

3. It's time to make these with a detachable cord. Audio Technica made the mh50's with a detaching cord, it's about time Sony did the same with these and the v6's. I am writing this review because of this. I was djing at a club when an attendee (cough very inebriated human being) fell on the ground and ripped the cord right out of the ear cup. Sony is lucky I won't use any other headphone in a professional setting.

When all is said and done though these are unbelievable headphones at a great price with nice build quality. Sony please just make them with a removable cord (im on my 3rd pair in 9 years and would gladly pay double the price for this one feature. Also, I hate having to get used to a new pair every few years). Finally, to sum up the review, if you are looking for good studio/dj headphones these are fantastic! If your looking for a more casual listening set of cans gets the mdrv6 or at mh50x.",My favorite studio cans!

Was this review helpful to you?, August 5 2014,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently developed a liking for headphones and wanted to try out the 7506, having the impression they were sort of a long-standing classic pair. I also read an extensive report claiming them to be the best pair of over-ear headphones in the $150 MSRP range.

I haven't owned them long enough to say much about durability, and they may have not had enough time to ""burn-in"" (I'm not confident myself of the importance of burn-in, but it seems to be a widespread-enough idea that I do give my headphones a short burn-in), but so far I agree that they are a great pair of headphones. They have a much more even or flat response than any popular pair of headphones to be sure, but my primary comparison is my go-to pair of Sennheiser 380 Pros. They are both phenomenal sounding. The best way I've found to describe the difference is that the 380s lean just slightly towards the lower frequencies, and the 7506s towards the brighter side. The 380s have a wider soundstage, as well (probably because of the larger ear cups and distance between the speakers and your ears). As a result, there were some songs that felt more rich from the 380s...but some songs that felt more exciting from the 7506s.

The 7506s have a relaxed fit, and the pads are quite soft. They will likely make contact with your ears, and I do feel some fatigue after extended listening. I have a very big head and typical sized ears, which is why I opted for the 380 Pros as my first pair...the ear cups are massive, very large and deep, and make no contact with your ears, but the headphones are heavier and grip tighter, so instead of any ear fatigue you feel a fair amount of warmth. The 7506s have padding on the speakers themselves, as well, inside the ear cup, so the contact with your ears is padded. They are lightweight and don't grip too hard. The headband is comfortable, though I noticed it tends to grab my hair more than I'm used to.

I don't like the coiled cable, though it is more lightweight than the one on my 380s, so it's a bit more manageable. I also don't like that the cable can't be removed, and therefore not easily replaced.

The ear cups don't swivel side to side very far, but can flip all the way around, and are on a hinged arm. You can sort of push them up against the headband (with the two ear pads together) to make the set pretty compact, and there's a basic storage bag that they'll fit in. They're fairly mobile.

I also noticed that the best place to grip the cups as you put them on or take them off is covered with the same thin material that's on the ear pads. It makes me think this will probably wear out fairly fast, but that's sort of a nit-picking detail.

I'm fairly new to the audio scene and don't pretend to be an expert, but hopefully this can give a wide audience an idea of what these headphones are like. I give them 4-stars for a satisfactory, but not exceptional, product. You are getting what you pay for, but in my opinion, not more.

I'll probably update this review once I've used them a bit more extensively.

Additional comments:

I've now owned these for nearly 4 months, and have used them quite a bit.

They aren't so great for using at my DJing jobs. While their mobility helps, they don't produce massive volume, and they don't isolate all that well. This makes it a bit hard to listen to songs in advance before including them in my set, with the music blasting from my system.

They are, however, unquestionably, the best flat-response audio I've ever heard in headphones. No range is neglected or favored. When I mentioned earlier that they make some songs more ""exciting"" than my 380 pros, I was hearing the crispness these songs bring to audio, particularly in the mids and trebles, where other headphones couldn't seem to be bothered. I was listening to some vocal-heavy music (ie Sam Smith) the other night on another pair, and was just feeling unsatisfied...then I switched to the 7506s, and suddenly the vocals came alive. Vibrant, deliciously crisp, presented on a silver platter. Where my 380 pros still make some dance beats and music that shines with the bass cranked up more punchy, the 7506s just can't be beat in showing you the music in its pure, raw form.

Another update:

These continue to shine as magnificent headphones. I continue to be more impressed the more I learn about audio. I'm going to bump my rating to 5 stars. Of the headphones I own, these are the most satisfying as far as sound is concerned. I do feel like the comfort could be better, but it's not drastic enough to deny that last star. They also, as I mentioned, aren't ideal for DJing, but since they aren't advertised/meant for such purposes, I won't hold this against them either.","Live up to a high standard, though imperfect"

That being said....
WOW. For the price, or even not for the price, these are the single best headphones not only that I've owned but that I've ever listened to. That includes the very high-end cans on sample at Brookstone, Best Buy, etc. Of course, I am not a seasoned audiophile but I know when something sounds good. These sound GREAT. There are pros and cons though:

Pros:
The sound. The glorious, clear, nuanced sound. Just amazing, and if you've always wondered how music is supposed to sound, these are your new headphones. There is a reason these are used in studios by professionals and have been for over 20 years (in which time, the design of the headphones has never changed!). There is no bias in the sound profile, just balance and clarity like nothing you've ever heard before.
The sound.
The sound.
Noise-cancellation. These are not actually designed for it. but given that they are pretty impressive. I usually have them driven pretty hard and turned up to a decent volume. but that's how they're meant to be used and they do not disappoint or let in anything you don't want to bother you.
Comfort. Very nice, don't grab my head too hard, I can wear them for an hour or more before giving my ears a short break.
The cord. I play guitar, and I can stand and move around without any worry because the cord is very long and allows a lot of freedom.
The price. I paid around $80 for these and they far outperform anything I've ever owned, which includes Beats by Dre and others.

Cons:
The cord. These are sit-at-home headphones. I mean, do as you please, but personally I wouldn't be walking around or using these as everyday headphones. At around 10' long and coiled, it isn't as convenient as some.
The bass. If you're a bass junkie, I'm sorry but you will be disappointed. These are meant to deliver a perfect sound profile, the one intended by the original producer. Even then, on dubstep songs and such, the bass falls flat. Not a big deal to me, even though I love bassy songs, because these are so impressive in other regards that I can deal with the lack of power. They do, however, have extremely quick, punchy, satisfying response throughout the audio range and that includes bass....they just lack the power of headphones like Beats and such which are designed for bass.

Overall, just get them. Worth every penny. I use them for studying, playing guitar, watching movies, listening to high-quality audio, etc. and they are always impressive to me. It is actually fun to listen to things with them because everything sounds so good! Everything you've heard on headphone forums and favorable reviews is true, they really are impressive.",Worth every penny. You will not be disappointed! Just know what you're buying....

Was this review helpful to you?, September 26 2015,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been buying and using headphones for a very long time. All the way back to the Koss Pro 4A in the early 70s. I'll say right up front that I don't typically buy Sony products because, while their products are high quality and fully featured, they tend to be more expensive than competitors. I've been using and loving my Sennheiser HD 280 pro for over eight years, but when the ear pads finally disintegrated and the replacement turned out to be overly pricey I started searching for replacements.

I saw a video about headphones for pros on Lynda.com and it mentioned the 7506s. The speaker liked it for post production work because they flat and true which is what I wanted. To be honest, as good as the Sennheisers were I determined after using other cans that they were not flat at all and it was coloring the sound. Not a good thing for post work and another thing pushing me toward replacement.

Checking reviews for the Sony cans, it turns out that many consider them to be the gold standard for headphones and have for almost two decades. The volume of glowing reviews and the sub-C note price let me pull the trigger, and I am so glad that I did. After four days of constant use at work I will say that these are the best headphones I have ever owned. Yup. Call me a fanboy on this one. (And I'm rarely a fanboy on anything.)

On Thursday, I tuned to a friend at work and told him that I was hearing stuff I never heard before. Kinda blew my mind. That may sound cryptic but all I meant was that I could hear all the tonal ranges evenly. The HD 280 pros tend to punch up the high end a bunch and the low end a bit too. The Sonys are dead flat. Exactly what I wanted.

More good news.They are quite comfortable. They keep out the outside noise maybe a little bit better than the Sennheisers but without the vice-like grip they have on your head. The Sony fit is tight enough without being tedious. I wear them over seven hours each day while wearing eyeglasses and I could easily wear them for another seven. As they as comfortable as on-the-ear cans? No, but on-the-ear cans don't keep out noisy people in the room, of which we have a few at times.

If you're looking for good, accurate, true sounding headphones you cannot go wrong with these. If you want something bright and big bump and thump, these are not for you. Sound pros will know exactly what I'm talking about.",Are a sound pro? You should really check out these cans.

Was this review helpful to you?, January 2 2016,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In 1991 Sony introduced the ""Closed"" MDR7506 headphones to audio professionals. Impeccable neutrality, outstanding comfort, and timeless build quality soon made them an industry standard. Today is January 2, 2016. And yes, 25 years later they remain by far the go to headphones of audio pros everywhere. They were high resolution before there was high resolution, Hi Res. The Sony MDR7506 is a true classic. They are great for all genres of music but they will not fake it. If the source ain't good, then the source will not sound good. But if the source is good, then the sound will be just as good. Lead vocals and lead guitars will take their place at center stage. Everything will be in its place the way the artists and engineers wanted it. And everything will be heard. Great music comes into full bloom. Hallelujah!

If I only had two pairs of headphones for listening to music and watching movies at home one would be a Closed and the other an Open back headphone. Though I prefer the open to the closed ""sound "" in general there is a time and a place for both. And sometimes my ears just get stale and need a change. All open and no closed makes Butch have dull ears... For its vivid clarity, wide soundstage, and outstanding comfort my Open choice would be a pair of Sennheiser HD600 Open Back Professional headphones. Check! Nothing less than $400 is as good. For my closed headphone there is none as good as the Sony MDR 7506 for less than $150. Check! Not even the Audio-Technica ATH M50/50X. Yes, they can be a fun headphone to listen to. But they do not ever offer a full bloom due to their Bass bias. All equalization does is further degrade the source's sound. With neutral cans I decide if and where I want any bumps not someone else... At 10 Oz's the M50's are a full 2 Oz's heavier and over the long haul not as comfortable as the 7506's. Nor are they as durable. Don't get me wrong, I love the ATH M50's from time to time, but they are not the headphone the 7506's are. In addition to home use I would add that the 7506 are also very portable. The coiled cable has been designed so as not to want to get tangled up with itself like so many other coiled cables. These Sony's are fully engineered. Professional indeed. Very minimalist down to their flat black finish. Very Zen.",A few words for your ears.

I've had these for almost a month now and the drivers are all broken in, yes it takes time for the drivers reach perfection! The MDR7506 are so accurate, for a reason, as they are studio headphones to reproduce music as it was recorded and as the artist had intended. The MDR7506 were designed this way, and not to create ridiculous highs and thundering bass that distracts from the real sound. Once again I highly recommend headphones above the other players in the game. For you audiophiles that still use records on a turntable with a analog amplifiers, the MDR7506 are the headphones for you! Oh yeah! Also well made and durable. Thank you Sony!

Was this review helpful to you?, July 11 2017,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Previously, I'd been using a pair of Sony MDRZX100 ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Black), and those were fantastic, especially for their price range, but after 5 years they finally bit the dust. I decided that I would go for something a bit higher end, that would last for a long time, and after doing some research, these emerged as the strongest contender. The big factor in this was finding that these don't really alter how things sound, as other headphones apparently emphasize or de-emphasize certain things which can alter how things sound. I largely wanted something that would just be accurate to how stuff is meant to sound, without really wanting ""enhancements"" that can make it deviate from how it was meant to be. The MDR7506's deliver everything I hoped they would.

The songs I listened to had the same character as they did on the ZX100's, but sounded much cleaner and clearer. I found myself noticing more detail and texture in the instruments, but they still sounded like what I was familiar with. I decided to use these for a couple rounds of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and the benefit even more striking than it was with music. I noticed myself hearing footsteps and gunshots from much farther away, and it seemed like I was able to mentally pinpoint where they were coming from much more accurately than before, which was helpful. The gunshot noises in general had a lot more nuance and detail than I had noticed before. Other games, such as Sonic Racing Transformed didn't feel too different, but still sounded good. One added benefit I really wasn't expecting is that these headphones, while not ""noise cancelling"" do an excellent job at blocking out external sound due to how they cover your ear. My PC has fairly quiet fans as-is, but these block it out almost entirely (and now it feels weirdly loud when I take them off). They also take down the sound of my typing quite a bit.

Overall, I'm completely satisfied with these in every regard. They sound good and feel good. They also come with a 1 year warranty inside the box, which is nice. These are apparently the standard in the audio industry, and I can see why, they're great.",Fantastic Headphones

Exact same headphones. They finally died and I looked up reviews for something to replace them with. To my amazement they still exist! Same model from 25 years ago. Not only that, but when I started looking at serious reviews (no offense amazon reviewers, you guys are gold too!), these are still on top of the heap until spending much more.

So I got another pair. They sound exactly the same as I remember when mine were fresh and new. I am a recording engineer with a very acute memory for sounds. They are clear and fairly deep. They have some brittleness or sharpness in the treble, but it's not terrible. It gives them a perceived resolution which is greater than I suspect the really should have. Sound blockage is also very good unless you are eating corn chips ;). They are also some of the most comfortable cans I've worn.

I purchased these on May 21st, 2015 and they are still working and I use them all the time. Currently it's 5/15/2017.

They have Samsung Note 3 (they don't want to upgrade- love them as they are) and plugged in...... eyes lit up, they love the sound- even, balanced, rich bass, clear mids and nice trebles. They just love how it sounds. I explained these are reference style headphones and that if you want more bass- use the phone eq. They don't want to touch it- the songs sound great as they are-. Now I only have to teach them to be 'cool' with their new phones by not yelling when they talk- just the right amount of exterior noise suppression to impress them.

I took a chance- it paid off and I saved some cash because I saw the Amazon feedback confirmed what I remembered about these headphones. To top it off, one got a phonograph and loved the retro look, and other got a beginner Pioneer DJ setup.

Was this review helpful to you?, January 3 2018,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I worked in radio stations for most of my career in the working world and am now happily retired. Though my duties at work were in the offices, I had daily business to conduct in the studios, so I got to visit with the DJs and production people quite often. In later years, I noticed that they were all wearing Sony MDR-7506 headphones - and that was the model that our engineering staff would provide for them. In my home systems, I always preferred Sony equipment and had purchased a pair of Sony MDR-V600 headphones. Mistakenly, I thought they were pretty good, but after I sampled first a V6 and then a 7506, I knew that the 600s were to be relegated to the pile of unused equipment.

As I said, I started with the 600s and then discovered the V6s. Reading up on headphone reviews and sales sites, I learned that the V6s were making a comeback after a few years off of the consumer market, and that many recommended them for their ability to provide a true, uncolored sound. That was what I always strove for, so I took the plunge and got a pair of V6s.

Still, I remembered the ""Professional"" sticker on the 7506 headphones of the DJs at work whereas my V6s just said ""Digital"". When I first looked for 7506s, I could only find them on professional musician-type of websites. Then a few years later, they appeared here on Amazon and I finally got to compare them to the V6s that I so loved.

At first, when brand new, I thought the 7506s weren't quite up to what I was used to with the V6s, but after a short break-in period, I couldn't tell the difference between the two, and I now used them interchangeably. Both give me accurate frequency response across the entire spectrum of audible sound, and both continue to impress long after the initial purchase.

Alas, they are not perfect. Their flaw is the material that the earpads are made of, a thin leatherette material that when new, provides an excellent curtain for exterior sound blocking. But with usage, the leatherette dries out and flakes off. This is easily reparable with replacement pads, but at a cost. Genuine pads are fairly expensive, but yo end up with practically brand new headphones again. There are other makes of pads that fit, but they color the sound differently, so I avoid those.

Basically, what I'm saying is that these are so good, that it's easy to forgive the pads that wear out over time. And from my perspective, you are safe purchasing either the V6s or the 7506s, on whichever you can get the better price. They are functionally identical.",Put the WOW factor back in your music!

They punch weigh above their weight. Can be driven solidly and accurately from small usb powered amplifiers, offer surprising fidelity from headphone output of a decent CD player but scale well with better sources and amplification. This headphone is no different in that respect. The build is the same. A red “professional” sticker on the cups versus the mdr-v6’s “Digital”. That’s literally where the difference in build begins and ends. A sticker. Popping the cups open may and probably does reveal more that causes the subtle yet firmly present change in sound signature. As with the v6, the pads being the same; kind of suck but if you’re invested in these, dekoni makes a utterly delightful pad that while expensive is ridiculously comfortable without screwing up the sound signature. I can’t hear any changes meaningful enough to be able to convince myself it’s there for the better or worse that the dekoni pads effect anything at all.
Efficient and accurate, I do feel the 7506 is a little more analytical, not cold or lifeless by any stretch but certainly geared more for the professional requiring accuracy and neutrality but that doesn’t exclude the casual listener or music/headphone enthusiast even the budget oriented audiophile can get a lot of enjoyment from this particular set of headphones. I hear these to be a little more mid range; maybe not forward or emphasized but certainly more mid centric than the mdr-v6 which in and of itself has a very pleasant mid range. The bass; the bass is different. The first evening I had them. I played Aretha Franklins Ain’t no way. I kept hearing these super low tones and thought they were coming from behind me. Kept looking over my shoulder. It was bass I hadn’t heard in the same track before. I played it over and over and it’s the same sub bass, in the same places. Very low. Solidly around 20Hz. Impressive. Not overpowering, flabby or booming but present in justbthe kost convincing way.
I feel there’s a difference in sound stage, maybe it’s just in separation but it does feel a tad narrower but still wider than I expect a closed cup to be. Still; to me anyway a very entertaining headphone.
Enclosed is a “service manual” of sorts and a parts list of the entire exploded headphone and some online research shows this headphone is certainly rebuild-able maybe even scratch built with parts sourced online. That’s handy if your both a headphone enthusiast and tinkerer. More online research nets very little information on Sony’s website regarding either the mdr-v6 or this set of phones. Only posts under “community” so the fate of these headphones, possibly the provenance may be questionable. I am confident both pairs of mine are genuine and both this and the v6 sound wonderful in their own way. Really a solid purchase. I really wish I’d known about these Sony’s and the koss portapro when all I had for music was a portable CD player/headphones and a binder full of discs. I’d have probably never gone over to the dark side with MP3’s.",Pads suck but otherwise an impressive headphone.

I did a lot of research before I bought these Sony headphones because they were pricey and I wanted the best sound for my hearing loss. I lost all my high pitches so I need both volume and the ability to get crisp clear sound in order to make up for my deficits. After reading review after review of different headphones, I chose these.

These have large ear cups which is great because I can wear them over my hearing aids without pain. Although I usually don't wear my aids with headphones due to feedback, when I do, smaller ear cups really hurt my ears due to the pressure of the aids against the headphones. These are comfortable with or without the aids and can be worn for extended periods of time without any problems. They have a long cord which is great for me. I often workout watching exercise videos on my computer and have to have headphones to hear the music/instruction. The longer cord gives me the ability to do that although I also use Bluetooth headphones to eliminate the wires all together.

But the real winner here is the sound. It's so good. It's rich and full and music sounds so good that I can't believe it. However, for me, spoken words like podcasts and movies don't sound quite as good. That is due to the amount of bass in these headphones. For normal hearing people, the bass is a plus. For me, it sort of muddles speech. Still, I can use these to watch movies and they are only slightly less clear than my other favorite headphones by Turtle Beach.

For music though, wow. Very, very good. My son who is an audiophile and has $300 headphones actually feels these headphones sound as good or even better than his and that's saying something. He says speech is crystal clear for him (He has normal hearing.) and the volume is way more than enough for any application. I also find it to be sufficient.

I love the headphones for music and use them mostly to listen to music. I will also use them for other things but they really are made for music and they do a heck of job making each instrument stand out and creating a really pleasurable listening experience. That is rare for me since my hearing loss makes things sound flat and tinny a lot of the time. I am happy with these headphones for music and I can use them for other applications as well. I have had them for months and they have held up just fine. They're a bit bulkier than some other headphones but so worth it. Great sound.",Absolutely great sound when listening to music.

I like the sound better than my brother's Beats and other more expensive, more ""fashionable"" over-ears. I will say, though, that the coiled cord is a bit inconvenient if you're just planning on listening to music on your phone. It's very long and prone to kinking. These headphones were made more for use in a professional studio where they won't be traveling too far. Also, the jack has difficulty fitting into and staying in an iPhone 6 when there's a cover on it, since it's only BARELY long enough to snap in without the case on. With the case preventing it from going in all the way, it's a bit more prone to slipping out of the phone when you move around, and you'll have to reconnect it every so often.","Unmatched sound quality, but the coiled cord is a bit of a mess"

Was this review helpful to you?, October 14 2015,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"SOUND: I agree with what others are saying about the sound quality. These headphones are very well balanced throughout the entire range. The mids are crystal and I've heard some of the clearest vocals that I've ever experienced. As you can see in the attached screen shot of the equalizer the sound profile of the MDR-7506 is pushed toward the high end so it does need a little boost in the low range to help bring the bass tones out. But also notice that the mid to high range is nearly flat. These cans sound great right out of the box!

COMFORT: To be honest I've owned better. I am able to wear them for a couple of hours without feeling too much discomfort. But eventually the slight pressure starts to squeeze my ears. It would help if the both the band and ear cups were a tad larger.Also the ear cups have a vinyl covering that traps heat and causes sweat to build up. I ended up purchasing a pair of velour pads which I highly recommend.. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081SO0RM?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00

CONVENIENCE: The band double folds for storage and a carrying bag is provided for travel. Just to be clear though, when I say ""travel"" I mean sticking them in a suitcase, not using them on the go. The coiled cable is not detachable and these are not the sort of headphones you would use on a bus or plane. I would recommend against purchasing these if you want something for both home and your commute.

OVERALL: I am extremely happy with the purchase. The sound quality is fantastic! They are reasonably comfortable. The price is definitely right.

Ok so they are the best pair I have ever owned in
their ability to reproduce what was recorded but
I have a few points to make about that perfection.

The average song will need equalization to boost
up the bass a tiny bit, and cut some of the highs.
And add a tiny degree of echo....this is all it will
take to make these headphones sound perfect...

But without equalization they are a little bit flat
in the bass and too bright in the highs and do
not have a ""spatial feel"" They sound precise...
Not warm and not enhanced at all...

This I guess is what it means to be a studio
grade professional headphone....but without
having an equalizer you will hear everything
but it will be flat...just as the recording was
made....so....think about using the Klipsch
Image One premium...the highs will not be
as crisp and clean but the bass will be in
a ""sweeter spot' that provides great sound
in uses where you don't have a high end
equalizer with you...

Of course some laptops allow some basic
sound enhancements but on my laptop its
not possible to match a real EQ's ability to
contour the sound as it needs to be for
making these Sony's shine...Apple laptops

My only complaint with them, with an easy fix, is that the headphones like to collapse too easily making them hard to wrangle back into shape sometimes. I found an easy fix for this though, a pair of 3/4"" binder clips over the collapse pivot. After opening the clips and clamping them over each side, you take off the binder bin handles, and you can barely see that there is a anything there keeping the speakers from folding into the headband. It also keeps them from squeezing your head too, making them fit much looser, which was a benefit I didn't anticipate.","With a couple of easy mods, these headphones are great!"

The phones themselves are of simple design, without unnecessary frills, but the focus is sound quality, one thing that Sony dominates. The +20 years the 7506 are in the market prove this quality

The audio itself is clear and well-balanced, the phone works well on any cellphone or portable player and there is no need of an amplifier (They are very loud), the bass end is a little low compared to other headphones available on the market, but with a small tweak on any equalizer or bass boost can fully reproduce a subwoofer without quality loss.

1,16 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, September 6 2013,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently acquired a Korg Triton Extreme keyboard, which I just simply adore, and which I play often and for extended periods of time. I also recently invested in Logic Pro X, which, together with my Apogee Duet, has allowed me to build up songs, track by track. So I decided that I needed a neutral, closed back headphone set for not only playing, but also for tracking and mixing (when I need to not disturb others). I adore my Grado SR-225 headphones, but I have never considered them to be ""neutral"", and they are about as open as you can get. So, I started my research into what are known as ""Studio Monitor"" headphones.

My search revealed three main contenders in my price range: these headphones (the Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone, which are sonically identical to their predecessor, the Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil), the Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones with Coiled Cable, and the Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones.

I learned pretty quickly that the 7506's are considered to be an industry standard, but also that some consider them to be somewhat unmusical, or ""too analytical"" or something along those lines. Fine for cold hard calculating sound engineering stuff, but not great for LISTENING to (and enjoying) music. So, this put me off the 7506's.

As for the HD-280 Pro's, there were a number of reviews where the plastic of the headband cracked after just a few months and eventually broke, which concerned me, and many reviewers found them to be uncomfortable. Of course, there are a LOT of reviews and these were still strong contenders. However, I got a chance to listen to these locally, and didn't really like my first impression of them--although I would definitely require some extended listening (and break-in) before making any judgement of them.

Moreover, it seemed that the Audio Technica ATH-M50's were by far the best reviewed headphones of the three, and were considered to be very musical. In fact, according to HeadRoom, they are one of the top 10 headphones under $500. Very impressive! So, I decided on the M50's and ordered them from Amazon.

Unfortunately, I was definitely NOT impressed! You can read my review for more details, but the short version of it is this: the M50's are not linear, have a hump in the bass at 100 Hz and another below that; have recessed mids; and sound muddy and dark to my ears. I didn't like them at all, not for music appreciation, and certainly not for use as a ""studio monitor"", which they clearly are not.

So, I returned the M50's and decided to try the industry standard, hoping that I wouldn't find them to be too harsh. I was worrying they might be a little like the Yamaha NS10 studio monitors, which are infamous for not sounding great, BUT are really useful because, if you mix using them, and get the mix to sound decent on the NS10's, then the result will sound great on ANYTHING ELSE! Or so the legend goes. I've never heard NS10's. But I was hoping that the 7506's wouldn't be like that. And I was reassured by one review which specifically said that they weren't. So I decided to give them a try.

Boy am I happy that I did! I wish I had gone for these first, and I would STRONGLY urge you to be skeptical of all the claims that these headphones are too analytical or that they are unmusical or any of that. Nothing could be further from the truth. These are wonderfully, brilliantly, clearly, and precisely musical, faithful, and enjoyable. I stayed up late more than once because I kept wanting to hear how something else in my music library would sound through these headphones. I LOVE that they are ""analytical""--i.e. that they are NEUTRAL and even-handed. It's SO NICE to listen to equipment that has an extended, and yet not boomy or exaggerated bass. These headphones are really, really great for the price. And they are very comfortable and have a good amount of isolation. The isolation of the 7506's is not as good as the M50's, in my experience, and about the same as the 280's, although, to be fair, I only have a very limited amount of exposure to the 280's.

In any case, there's a reason that these are an industry standard. And they are not just popular with sound engineers; they are also renowned among musicians. One of my friends even told me that there are albums where the V6 / 7506's are specifically mentioned as what the artist recommends that the record be listened to on. Or something like that. You can't go wrong with these headphones. You really can't. For any purpose. And that reminds me, I should add that while I did do a lot of listening to these using my Duet as both DAC and amp, I found that the 7506's sounded really great straight out of my iPhone 4 (and out of my Korg Triton, too, of course). The fact that these can be driven well by the iPhone definitely sets them apart and it's another huge plus for these headphones. In my experience plenty of other ""easy to drive"" headphones still suffer when used straight out of something like an iPhone or iPod, but not the 7506's.

Now, personally, I prefer open cans to closed (and sometimes I NEED to be able to hear my surroundings), so I do most of my listening to music on my Grado SR-225's or my Sennheiser PX-100's (the original version, not the PX-100 II 's, which are not nearly as good). But I would be pretty happy listening to the 7506's as well. And when I play my Korg, and/or compose/record, I use the 7506's exclusively and they are awesome. Highly recommended.","Wonderfully, brilliantly, clearly, and precisely musical"

These are also made from Sonys professional department, which to my knowledge handles their warranties differently, for example if something were to go wrong with these you get the same pair or get them fixed, but if you had purchased a pair of the MDRV6, and something were to go wrong with them, you would get a replacement pair of a older model headphone, I think the MDR600 or MDRV600 (I forget the name, I think it's. The MDR600 though), since its through Sonys digital department. If you're in the market for a pair of studio headphones I highly reccomend these (Sony MDR7506 Professional). It's worth it.",These headphones are great.

After seeing them declared ""the literal best headphones in existence"" by every person who had ever stuck them on their head, I was expecting some kind of magical fairy dust type s*** to happen when I plugged them in. Imagine my disappointment when I put them on and couldn't hear any difference from other giant headphones I had tried. But, then I noticed that I was really getting into the song that was playing. I felt chills going down my spine, which almost never happens, and never on the 100th or so time listening to a song.

So, I have no idea what makes these headphones good. They are comfortable enough that I suspect I could wear them 24 hours a day, forever, without any problems (which is apparently what I'm going for, as I am now sleeping with them on more often than not). I put other headphones on and cannot hear a bit of difference, but somehow, in some hipster audiophile way (which I really suspected was just pretentious BS until now), these headphones are better.

My head is fairly big and they are very comfortable to me. They even sound good with low quality, low definition, recordings as long as you don't crank it up too much. Some of the stuff I listen to on You Tube is low def. You can't really turn up low def or it just gets mushy, but that's not the headphones fault at all.

I have glasses and typically over- or on-ear headphones are very uncomfortable. These are comfortable to wear for hours.

The extra small wires around the ears are somewhat unsightly. Even when headphones are at maximum extension, there is extra slack in those two wires. They should be shorter.

A small piece of metal (from soldering?) came loose in the left earcup and was rattling around after two weeks of use. It was easy to remove the earcup, unscrew the covering (4 small screws), remove the little metal piece, and screw it back together. Putting the earcup back on was a bit of a challenge (didn't want to tear it).","Lovely sound, comfortable with glasses, easy to open to repair"

I wanted to like them, of course; but I did not expect to prefer them to my Grado sr-225s. Not that they walk all over them, but they are just that bit more 'more' fuller and richer. (without being overly warm) I needed closed cans as the grados leak sound like crazy, not great in hospital waiting rooms or polite buses. What surprises me is that I want to wear these over the Grados even when I could benefit from NON closed back. ( like walking around. These seal out so much it could be dangerous, but it is all about the sound so I wear em anyway) I honestly think they compare favorable to the all metal 500-whatever line/dollar Grado phones. Though I think THOSE Grado are better, and I haven't spent much time with those I still think it's apt. These ARE 300$ plus headphones, but now you can get them for LOTS less.
I'd do it. But one thing: these cans seem to really suppress tape hiss. This is a boon for normal listening, as it does NOT obscure treble detail or MUCH ( but SOME) 'air', but for monitoring?!?!
I wouldn't. Not analog anyway. If lots of studios use this since the nineties, it may well explain the WILDLy differing levels of tape hiss between albums of similar sound quality (and even on the SAME album sometimes - especially with lots of multitracking 'mixed down') as you really aren't going to hear all the hiss that IS there sometimes(analog mostly), so how can you fix what you can't hear? So- if I were releasing commercially sold music I'd find something more ruthlessly revealing (dunno what). They're good though. Very. And if you are semi pro, the price makes up for that by far; and if you AREN'T mixing, well- the hiss suppressions almost a bonus, then!
Excellent - but the five stars would be four if these were compared to Stax phones or top drawer Senns or HI FI man ( I imagine) cans. At 300, I'd recommend them highly. At the less then 1/3 of that current price? I'm going to buy a spare at least; and I call them a SCREAMING bargain. DESTROYS top beats, Bose and skullcandy.

They are very comfortable to wear, and fold to a compact enough size for travel. They seem well-made, like most Sony products. However, I am not all that impressed by the sound quality. I listen mostly to classical music, and thought these headphones are fine in the mid-ranges, the highs are a little too ""bright"", and the reproduction of string bass is odd. It is sort of fuzzy, with a slight echo, or with a small excess vibrato sound.

Since then I've bounced around various cheapo phones and earbuds, and wished Sony still made that model. Finally after sniffing around the net and reading reviews I broke down and got a pair of these, and they are all that I hoped for. Finally once again I can listen to music with the clarity I remember. These are no-frills headphones: no Bluetooth, no controls or sliders, just plain old-fashioned headphones with great sound that are very comfortable to wear. They fold up and fit into the included vinyl storage bag, and the cord is long enough to relax on the couch. Wouldn't recommend these for running or working out or anything; too bulky and the cord is too long. These are for studio work and serious listening. The outer shells are very sound resistant; when the music stops I can actually hear my own heartbeat inside the shells and no traffic outside or anything.

Everything's crystal clear, bass is tight without being boomy, more than enough for me.

9,15 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, July 30 2010,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"-Background-
This is my third headset for use in the workplace. I'm in the IT field. I spend about half my day talking to people, and the other half with my head down working. The trouble is, the people around me are in the same situation, and our quiet parts of the day are seldom aligned, plus we are all loud talkers, so my office is usually really noisy.

The first two headsets I tried were earbud headsets. One set (Shure e2c) accomplished sound-isolation via earbuds composed of foam earplugs. Another set (from Phillips) used active noise cancellation. Both worked pretty well, the Shure being the standout for sound quality, but earbuds have a few fundamental problems.

I found earbuds were a real pain to take in and out of the ear to accommodate 'drive-by' conversations. The Phillips would sometimes fall out of the ear. With the Shure headphones, I could stand to have them in my ears for about a half-day before the skin in my ears became irritated and wearing them became painful. The noise cancellation feature was great for external low frequency sounds, but did not isolate the real noise problem of background noise from other people talking.

After some painstaking Googling and reading up on reviews here at Amazon ('Amazoning?'), I landed on these headphones.

-Sound Quality-
This was my first set of high quality over ear headphones, so I cannot size these headphones up against their competitors. That said, I was floored by the sound quality of these headphones. Previously, my favorite place for enjoying music was in the car, where I can play it as loud as I like without the concern of disturbing others (my own little environmentally-controlled acoustic bubble). They blew away any consumer-accessible home theater setup, car stereo, headphone or earbud I had ever heard previously, and instantly sold me on high-quality headphones as the ideal music enjoyment experience.

These headphones are very well balanced. The lows are perfect: Strong but not overpowering or uncomfortable, present, and clear. Well managed bass is typically difficult to find in headphones, where it is either overdone or underpowered. Highs are are perfect: Clear, and not overpowering or ""over bright."" I have never heard high 'clipping' or distortion unless it was in the recording. With well-balanced highs and lows, the oft-neglected mid tones are in perfect balance with the rest of the sound. I feel like the sound is perfect, an even, level balance, even after several years of heavy use. I hear things in music that I never noticed before (even with other headphones), like sniffs and coughs from the audience during a winter-time recording of Horowitz.

-Sound Isolation-
The headphones have a sealed back. They do a great job of filtering out background noise. I sometimes wear them alone (no music) just to muddle down the noise in the office and on airplanes. They work just well enough - better than nothing but not as isolating as foam earplugs (and certainly more comfortable).

Good sound isolation sets the stage for good sound reproduction. I barely have to turn my iPod up to enjoy music at a comfortable level. The lowest volume settings easily drown out my coworkers and works well on crowded airplanes, also.

They also do a great job of not letting sound *out.* I often listen to really good jams pretty loud at the office. When I press the ear cups together, I can barely tell they are on while holding them in my hands. Great for not disturbing people around you or for not disturbing one's partner when playing video games late into the night.

-Usability-
You don't need a powerful setup to enjoy these headphones. I use them primarily with an iPod, but I have also used them for gaming.

They are easy to take off and put on for quick conversations.

While the sound quality is excellent, and a sealed back design is good for sound isolation, they may not be so good as a DJ headset, since the ear cups do not rotate 180 degrees.

-Comfort-
I have a large cranium (I wear a XXL motorcycle helmet) and large-ish ears. These headphones fit great and feel great. Usually they are all the way out to the second or third from last 'click' on the headband adjuster. With the ear cups on, the headband rests on the top of my head, but has never tossed my hair.

I routinely wear these for a full 8-12 hours. There is no pressure on or around my ears or on my head. Sometimes they get a little warm, but never uncomfortably so.

On airplanes, I usually put them on as soon as I sit down to filter out the conversations around me, and leave them on for the whole flight, including sleeping with them on.

-Durability-
These headphones don't get out much. They mostly sit in a drawer at my office when not in use. I have taken them on a few trips (DC to Salt Lake City and to Greece) where they have had to endure air travel in a laptop bag and a few trips through security. They have held up very well, with no signs of wear.

-The Bottom Line-
These headphones changed the way I listen to music, and they inspired me to seek out a headset for gaming. I would buy them again without a second thought.

I know Sony has made a successor to these headphones, and from what I've read, the sound quality on the newer headphones is not as well balanced. I hope Sony continues to manufacture these, as they are a very nice, high quality product. Why mess with perfection?

I often seriously consider buying another set for home or as a backup to my set at the office.

Highly recommended.",A great set of headphones

They perform as admirably as headphones costing over twice plus they are solid, easy to fold for transport and are pretty efficient at keeping the listener isolated from outside noise. I am using them primarily to use my iMac to access my itune AAC256 audio files and play them on the VLC 2.0.6 media player. I plug the 7506s into an HRT microStreamer, and the DAC is plugged into one of the iMac’s USB2.0 ports via an audioquest Forest USB A to mini cable.

For the past couple of years, I’ve been listening to music with my Dunu Trident DN-12 ear buds directly connected by their 3.5mm jack to the headphone out/optical digital audio port of my iMac. Ever since I’ve added the new headphones and DAC, I’ve been enjoying a noticeable improvement in the sound quality of my audio files.

The Dunus are a pretty good product, so I should mention that the sound improvement is still pretty noticeable even when I use the Dunus. However, the 7506s are a definite step up from the Dunus, as they have a fuller midrange, a deeper bass response, better sequestration from outside noise and are more comfortable. I’d roughly estimate that about 70% of the improved audio quality is due to the HRT DAC while the remaining 30% is contributed by the improved headphones.

Both the MDR-7506s and the HRT microStreamer provide a uniquely affordable solution to improve the audio quality of a basic system. I would recommend using one or both devices to anyone who wants to significantly improve their audio capabilities without breaking the bank.

While this is probably already self-evident, these two items are probably not appropriate for those with more experience and have their eyes on upgrading to more advanced audio technology. This encompasses finding and listening to music in lossless (e.g. ALE, FLAC) or high-res (DSD) formats. Generally, the more serious an audiophile you become, the more money you will spend. You’ll need more advanced (read = usually more expensive) technology such as a DSD capable DAC and higher-end headphones and/or speakers. You’ll also need to determine which high-end audio player (Channel D, Bit Perfect, Ammara, Audirvana…) fits your specific needs the best, pay a subscription fee for access and endure the learning curve until you understand how to use the software and can then start paying, downloading and modifying your music files so you can listen to top quality audio.

I bought them on a recommendation from a friend who owns a pair of the similar MDR-V6's, and I am so glad I did. The headphones feel solid and well-constructed, and have stood up to their fair share of abuse over the past few years. I've dropped them, put them at the bottom of a bag with a 4.5lb laptop in it and then dropped that on the floor, put them in a carry on which fell out of the overhead bin, and so much more, and not only did they not break but the sound quality has not diminished whatsoever. A little bit of tweaking is required as they can be somewhat bass-heavy out of the box but that is true with any headphones. The gold plated plug has outlasted a number of devices and the cord is just as strong as the rest of the headphones are.

I got these for about $75 on sale, and purchased the Beyerdynamic velour replacement earpads for $20. While the pleather pads that come standard are not bad, the velour earpads are much more comfortable for long periods of wearing. Overall, these are exceptional headphones for entry-level and professional persons alike.",Exceptional quality entry level headphones

The audio range sounds accurate and dynamic. Most headphones (and certainly monitors) sound a certain way that the brand intends. These headphones feel pretty darn accurate to the audio in your mix.

The headset is quite comfortable. The ears are the most important comfort zone and this set is just fine on mine. The headband begins to feel a little uncomfortable but this is only after prolonged use while I am mixing down.

I really like the coiled cable. When I need to reach for something across the room, the stretching ability of the cable always surprises me. It's also nice how the set comes with a 1/4"" plugin attachment which you can unscrew to reveal a 1/3"" connection instead. Very cool.

My only gripe is that there is a thin wire that runs from the head band to the ear pad. This cable is actually exposed for about 2.5"" of length and makes me very nervous about accidentally hooking to something and pulling the wire out or breaking it. I would have much rather seen this wire discretely and safely run form headband to ear cup another way.

For $85 I couldn't be happier with a headset. Highly recommended.",Excellent value

Also it would have been an added touch if the plug would have been a 90 degree instead of straight or would have had that type of plug included as an adapter.

I use headphones primarily for gaming (pc), listening to music, streaming movies, and for audio-out via my guitar/bass amps. I was looking to move away from the mic gaming headphones I generally use (i.e. SteelSeries, Logitech, etc.) for something better quality. I am glad I made the move to the MDR 7506 headphones. There is no comparison between any of the gaming headphones I have used in the past and the MDR7506 cans. My SteelSeries headphones sound like a cheap speaker in a cardboard box in comparison. With the MDR7506 cans, every footfall, every shot, and the environmental sounds are super clear, giving fantastic directional feedback for FPS games. They have been great for RTS and TBS games as well.
For music, they are pretty amazing. I adjusted the EQ for my soundcard to get my prefered bass sound for some music styles, and the MDR's have responded beyond my expectations. Through my Fender amps they are great. Initially, there was some ""rattle"" in the right ear piece with my bass amp, but after a short burn-in (2-4 hours of blues/jazz/downtempo) and a session thru my guitar amp, the bass rattle is now gone.
I would describe the sound as clear, crisp, bright and rich. The clarity is what really impresses me about these cans...whatever mix I am listening to, or EQ I am using on my amps, everything is just clear, and unadulterated. For the $ I couldn't imagine buying anything else.",Should have started with these years ago...

I have used many different models from many different manufacturers over the years, and the 7506 are the classic, good sounding, accurate, comfortable, well made, inexpensive cans you have been looking for.

They are closed back headphones, which means they eliminate some of the background noise and help you hear more clearly the sound you are listening too. This is a two edged sword, because while you can focus and hear your music/game/movie more clearly, you won't be able to hear other people talking to you in the room. This is a good thing and a bad thing... :)

I have had a few pairs of these headphones over the years, and I have never had a bad experience with them, or had them go bad. The only reason I replaced them, was because they were stolen (I WILL AVENGE YOU HEADPHONES!!!) or destroyed (run over by a semi truck) and everything sounds very good through them.

Was this review helpful to you?, September 24 2013,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm always looking for the best deal in headphones. I have a few that are considered up there- Koss Porta Pros, some Senneheisers, the Grado 125's... and somehow I just found out about these a couple months ago through an article on Wire Cutter, when they named them the best headphone under $150.

That was pretty remarkable considering they were almost half that- about $78 on sale when I got 'em here on Amazon. The closed (i.e., sound doesn't leak) design and coiled cord makes them more practical than the Grados. And both the structural design (especially the soft ear pads) and the sound itself (I found the sound of the Sonys less harsh and sibilant). Though the Grados have more 'punch' to the bass and a little more detail overall, I think this is the more balanced, true-to-the-source headphone. It's easy to see why they're the industry standard in recording studios around the world.

I almost ended up getting the Audio Technicha ATH-M50, but after reading the Wire Cutter article, I got these instead. And at nearly half the price, I'm glad I did. These aren't a pair of headphones that will ""enhance"" the music you're listening to (like the M50's) through beefed-up bass; these cans will just give you a detailed, unbiased picture of the source: nothing more; nothing less. To some folks used to that sound, they might think the Sonys sound ""recessed"" because their frequency balance is so remarkably flat.

So I decided to buy these Sony MDRs just to see. I noticed right away that the sound quality is a lot clearer and I can hear more of the lower in frequencies and the high end as well. I admit I do play my music a little bit too loudly but it seems like these headphones can take it. They are of good quality and can get very loud.

The headphones sound great and enough of the ambient noise is eliminated to make them useful for monitoring video camera audio in classroom environments.

I was having to turn my Bose ear-buds up to uncomfortable levels to be able to concentrate on my work. With these headphones, the noise is cut down to a tolerable level without having to have my music at hearing-loss levels. I don't hear any more slurping or lip smacking but the phone conversations do tend to bleed through a little.

As for quality, these headphones provide great clarity - better than anything I currently own or that I tried in the store (though there could be many issues with the display models, so take that for what it's worth). Like others have mentioned, there was a break-in period for a couple of days where the low end seemed nearly non-existent, but now they sound nice and balanced.

The headphones are also pretty comfortable. I typically wear them a couple hours at a time and my ears don't get hot. Sometimes they do put too much pressure on my glasses but taking breaks cuts that way down.

These headphones by themselves don't seem to be pre-set (like Beats) to have massive amounts of bass blasting in your ears, which is what I was wanting in a pair of headphones. HOWEVER, if you use an equalizer on your computer or cell phone or whatever you use to listen to music, these things can PUMP OUT some serious bass, as well as keeping the highs and mids crystal clear. I am VERY impressed so far, and I haven't even had a chance to ""burn in"" these headphones.

They seem to be well-constructed and legit. I just got them today, so I will update this review should anything go wrong in the next little bit. Some of the negative reviews may have simply come from people who ended up getting fake headphones, which wouldn't surprise me. I spent maybe 20 minutes comparing the headphones I received with confirmed legit heaphones online, and these seem to be good!

I would recommend these headphones to anyone. Just make sure you burn these in before you make any judgement on them. The sound right out of the box may be a little less warm. Maybe I got lucky and won't have to burn mine in at all. :)

My first ever ""professional"" headphones was a pair of what I believe to be an older version of this model. I used them for a good 20 years until they finally fell apart. Since then I have tried a variety of cans including Bose, behringer, and JVC. For the price, The sound on these 'phones is AWESOME. Big bass sound, but tight and clean. Nice clear mids, crisp highs. The cups cover your ears and provide as much sound isolation as you'd want (they're not active noise reducing). You also don't get that weird pressure wave that many active sound isolating headphones have. Here's the pro /con breakdown:

PROS:
*GREAT sound! I'd put these up against headphones three times this price. Big bass sound, clean and tight, not boomy. Clear mids and crisp clean highs.
*pretty darn comfortable (I have a big melon) I've been wearing them for 3 hours straight and have no discomfort, no cauliflower ear, no sweaty ears.
*good sound isolation - since they cover your ears, they block out most outside sounds to my satisfaction. you can still hear sounds, but you can't make out details.
*Reasonably priced - I paid about $90
*comes with a 1/8 plug and 1/4 adaptor for those of you who still have old school a/v equipment that still requires 1/4 jacks (I think that's more for plugging into a console since they ARE designated as ""professional"")
*The fold up reasonably compactly, for as big as they are.
*comes with a handy drawstring ""pleather"" carrying case.

CONS:
*Long dangly curly cord (ok, that's not REALLY a con, but I had to come up with something)
*Because of their size and propensity to block outside sounds, I wouldn't recommend these for any kind of outdoor use. These are great for home or work where you aren't moving a lot.

I've been using the Sennheisers for nearly seven years.

The first thing I notice is that the Sonys are much more comfortable; they don't squeeze in on my head like the Sennheisers do. The extent to which someone else would notice this difference likely depends on the shape and size of their head, but I suspect the Sonys would be more comfortable for most people.

The sound of the Sonys isn't a world apart from the Sennheisers. Doing an A/B comparison, one right after the other, I can definitely hear a difference, but after listening for a couple of minutes to one pair or the other, I would have a hard time claiming that one sounds ""better"" or ""worse"".

I do notice that the Sonys seem to somehow flatten and reveal more details of the sound. It's easier to pick out specific instruments / voices / effects from a song mix. The Sennheisers seem to gel everything together better. This might make the Sonys less preferable for general music listening, but more preferable for musical analysis.

Other reviews speak critically of the durability of the ear pads. In my one hour of using the headphones, I haven't experienced this, but I don't doubt it's true.

Coming from a pair that promises to make your music sound like the artist intended it to, the differences between a bass-heavy, brand-hyped pair of headphones and one that actually delivers their promise became immediately apparent. Amazon service was awesome, just ordered them on the 6th and received them today.

The 7506 definitely pumps out bass. However, that is not strictly what these cans were designed for. No, they won't win any awards for style, nor will they make you run faster or instantly turn you into an audio professional, but they tell the truth. First, they completely cover the ears, so forget about hearing anything else while you have them on. Bass is punchy, mids and highs are easily distinguished from other components. I found the overall sound quite impressive. Compared to other brands, the sound profile of these are relatively flat, in a good way. I'm not saying that there aren't some out there that won't blow these away, but I am impressed. Also, the treble seemed a little crunchy at first. After a couple of days this seems to have evened out.

They put out plenty of sound with low volume settings. The source does not have to be turned up very high to achieve ear-damaging levels, so keep that in mind. With MP3 players, that can translate into longer battery life and fewer blown headphone jacks.

Feeling these in my hand, I noticed that the headband is made of spring steel and all of the mounts seem sturdy, although I have yet to test their durability. They're comfortable, at least from my observations. Wearing glasses also makes a huge difference in the comfort level of headphones. I have no qualms with wearing these for extended periods of time, outside of the slight warm feeling that the surrounds unleash on your ears.

I must admit that I didn't have very high expectations at first. I did a little research before buying these and found out that these are indeed the industry standard for broadcasters, studios, etc.. Still, nothing beats being able to actually put them on and try them before purchasing. If I'd have had that luxury, I would have purchased these over a year ago. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely be recommending them and Amazon to my friends.",Won't make you run faster or instantly turn into an audio professional...

Instrument separation, soundstage/headstage, bass or treble response... these are all dependent on the recording, not the headphone! As such these Sonys tend to become brutally honest and end up either pleasing or disappointing their owners who are looking for something that may or might not be there.

Hearing it the way it's meant to be is an ad nauseam term that can only be satisfied by one question: What headphones or monitors did the sound or mastering engineer use to produce the final cut of the track? There is no one common headphone that can answer that question, but this particular model shows up in studios more often than not.",Standard classic

I do use these both at my piano, and on the road, but it took a couple of hours to get used to the sound for the latter application. Puccini? Perfect. Beyonce?

I picked up a pair of the same headphones about 13 years ago at a music store local to me for about $120. After 13 years of abuse I still use these headphones almost daily and they still sound fantastic. The earpads have since worn down to the point of having to replace them but it doesn't diminish the quality of the sound at all.

Anyway, I've been working a lot at home lately and decided it was time to get a good pair for late nights when I can't use the speakers for fear of waking the wife + baby. So I thought i'd look into getting the same pair of Sony's I bought 13 years ago. And am I ever glad that I did!

The Audio - 5 Stars
These headhpones, simply put, produce some of the richest audio your ears will ever hear. Crystal clear with an impressively wide range for earmuff headphones. These are not overamplified and over-EQ'd like crappy Beats, Bose or similar brand headphones. They have a relatively flat response and do not 'color' audio like Bose do! Since these are 'studio monitor' headphones they are meant to be used in a mixing room environment to mix and produce master tracks for studio recordings. And studio producers demand accurate reproduction of audio when they work their magic. That's what these headphones were designed to do and that's what they deliver - clear, accurate audio from your source. Even at lower volumes you will still get a remarkably rich sound (unlike Beats, where you literally have to crank to get a full range of audio out of them). I've also literally worn these for hours without experiencing aural fatigue like I do with earbuds / other over-the-ear headphones.

Fit / Comfort - 5 Stars
I have a big noggin'. It's often really difficult for me to find any sort of headware / apparel that fits me properly, let alone headphones (they're usually too narrow). These fit like a glove. You quickly adjust the length by pulling down on the ears and that's it - you're in comfort land. They don't pinch / fatique any part of my dome either.

Price - 5 Stars
You can easily pay twice as much for something twice as bad. If you're looking for audiophile quality headphones without breaking the bank then look no further. Forget Beats, forget Bose, forget all of the other crap - the sony MDR7506 headphones are what you want!",Best headphones i've ever owned

Make sure to purchase a hardcase if you plan to do any run and gun video work, or a mobile DJ. They are accurate, comfortable and fold up nice.

Grab a DVD, go to the special features and view the behind the scenes docs. I dont care if it's a low budget film, or the most expensive blockbuster of the summer, ... 8 out of 10 times the headphones you will see the director and sound people wear are these particular headphones.

So I brought these after wasting hundreds of dollars on other items only to have to return them when they didn't work. These things are a lifesaver. They are not only beautiful, but they also are a ten in the performance category. They are the best headphones I have ever owned and I am glad I decided to pay the xtra money and not go with a cheaper pair

Pros- They have a long enough cord so I don't have to sit right on top of the tv.
I can pair them with my led hd tv and also with my laptop dvd player via led tv for playing movies. I watched two movies last night and I didn't hear anything going on around me. It was like being at the movies. .

Cons- As long as the cord is- for me I wouldn't mind it being a tad bit longer. That way I could go into the kitchen and grab a snack without having to pause the movie. lol..

They are good at blocking out sound around you but if you turn up the volume too much its possible for people sitting closeby or sleeping to be able to hear what you are listening to. So be very careful if your intent is not to disturb others who may be sleeping nearby.

Otherwise for that price you absolutely can't go wrong! I just wish I would have found these sooner as they would have saved me a ton of money and headaches! These would also be a great gift for gamers too!!

Update:****** 02/26/15- I still have these headphones and believe it or not they still work great. They have survived months of torture including me falling asleep with them on in bed while watching a movie, sitting on them by mistake or laying on them, extreme heat, and extreme cold. Despite all of that they haven't fallen apart on me yet. For that alone they are worth the price. Plus they have not lost their sound quality.

Those headphones were revered by many musicians and DJ's for their sound quality. When it came time for me to upgrade from my older MDRV6's, i decided to see what has changed . I found that there has been a new revival for higher quality headphones and there are old and new names making them. I discovered during my research these which were the professional models of the MDRV6. I tested a few others but liked the neutral sound the Sony's produced. After a few weeks, these I am still enjoying them and these are my observations...

Sound Quality: As mentioned in other reviews, these headphones are very accurate, meaning you hear what the engineer heard when either recording the music or producing the finished product. I have listened to other brands and the difference is these have crisp highs without artificial sizzle and deep punchy bass without the sloppy boom.

Build quality: overall these have a nice feel, not too heavy yet solid. Like most items I expect them to wear over time, but so far they are solid.

Overall, if your listening preference is for overstated bass, these are not for you. These headphones are for the listener who wants to distinguish a Gibson from a Fender or hear the breath of the singer on a good recording. I highly recommend these headphones.",Great Headphones for a great price.

I found the comfort factor good and appreciate the light weight on the head as well as the easy on/off.

I compared the sound to my Grado RS-1 set which I've owned for many years but rarely use due to the relatively poor comfort factor after a short usage time. These Grado's are nice to have, though, especially as a reference sound for checking other headphones.

I compared the Sony vs. the Grado with a number of CD-sourced recordings that I consider of good sound, including tracks from Miles Davis, Ry Cooder, a Mahler symphony and Orff's Camina Burana. In all tracks, the Grado's sound seemed slightly more refined, with more perceived presence, instruments more readily separated and identifiable in the mix, a feeling of slightly greater control in the bass, and a more extended high end. No doubt, if you were engaging in close attentive listening you would rather be listening though with Grado's (if you could handle wearing them for any length of time).

Time will tell on the wear-ability for me of the Sony's - as mentioned my initial impression is good. These should make a good, daily use headphone for music listening when I'm engaged in other tasks.

Although the packaging is intended to impress I count it more as falling into the ""excessive materials"" category.

Or, as a better comparison. Guys, think about your wife. Beautiful, no? Remember what she looked like at your wedding? Yeah... it's kinda like that.

The only thing I could say against them is that you HAVE to have a headphone amplifier. I have tested these on the headphone output of my laptop, a Vox Headphone amp that I use on my bass, and on my M-Audio AV40s with mixed results. But, when they are connected to my Asus Xonar Essence sound card, which has a headphone amp built in to it... wow. That's literally all the more that can be said. Wow. See, with the other devices, they still sounded good, just weak. With a good quality headphone amp though, opens up more than you can believe.

They can sound a little shrill at first, but that's actually normal. See, lower-end headphones are designed to sound good enough. Not great, just good enough. Part of this is giving them drivers with scooped frequency response. These particular headphones do no such thing. What you will hear with these is the music as it was written, and recorded. All the highs, all the lows, and certainly everything in between. You will hear everything, and you will not regret it once you get used to the broader, fuller frequency response.

Oh, and the sound isolation is phenomenal, nearly to the point of noise cancelling. And they're very comfy.

Uniquely great headphones for the price. You know how some companies just make a product that is so perfect everything else can't quite get there and many just stop trying? Sony did that here. Here is a pair of headphones that are so great for the money, everything else in this space falls short. I have other pairs of headphones - I love my Bose headphones for the airplane, but they were $300. I can't really tell the difference in sound quality. I've tried some Sennheisers, I must not have divine hearing because I can't tell the difference. I have a pair of AKGs which are really great but open-backed which was disturbing my co-workers.

Let me first start by saying that when it comes to headphones, the price not always correlates with sound quality. I tested this headphone in a Sony testing room at CES 2018. They were side by side Sony MDR-Z1R, which is ~$1.7K. Honestly, I liked the sound of MDR7506 over MDR-Z1R. The sound is very crisp, natural, well balanced for all frequencies, with good separation. If you like to listen to Jazz or any acoustic music MDR7506 is a great choice for you. After CES, I purchased this headphone and compared them side by side with my other headphones. Here is how I would rank them:
Sound quality:
1. Pioneer SE-MS7BT-T (9.6 out of 10)
2. Sony MDR7506 (9.5 out of 10; both Sony and Pioneer sound great but I think I slightly prefer pioneer)
3. Bowers & Wilkins P7 (8.5 out of 10)
4. Sennheiser HD598C (8 out of 10)
Comfort:
1. Pioneer SE-MS7BT-T (10 out of 10)
2. Sennheiser HD598C (9 out of 10)
3. Bowers & Wilkins P7 (7 out of 10)
4. Sony MDR7506 (5 out of 10)
Design:
1. Bowers & Wilkins P7
2. Pioneer SE-MS7BT-T
3. Sennheiser HD598C
4. Sony MDR7506

So far Pioneer SE-MS7 and Sony MDR7506 are one of the best sounding headphones I tried, even if you compare them to significantly more expensive MDR-Z1R, B&W P7, or Sennheiser HD660.",Great sound but could be more comfortable.

The reason I bought these was because I was tired of getting ripped off my cheap gaming headsets with fake 7.1 sound and non existent bass. The initial looks of these kind of felt cheap at first, but once I put them on my head and folded them after, they felt pretty sturdy. I know, I do not work at a studio, but I do love sound and I heard these sounded amazing so I had to buy them. these get a pretty great range of highs and lows. the bass is great and not to intense or fake. These are perfect for people who just love sound and love to listen to music or test their new sound card out. I apologize to the real studio workers because I cannot say that they are the best for making music or sounds, but I can say that they sound great for the everyday average joe or gamer. The comfort is just unexplainable, I don't even know if they are on half the time, because they feel like nothing. lastly the chord is basically tangle free since it looks like an old twisted phone chord, which is perfect also because it is always the right length every time. Just be careful with these because I still don't trust the build quality. I know what I said initially, but in my past experiences with other headphones from Sony, they usually break, fingers crossed and be really careful with these just in case.",First Impressions After 2 Days

Also important is finding quality earphones that fit our budget; a recently purchased pair of $275 dollar earphones at a nearby video/audio store failed the test on both accounts. Enter in these Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm (Studio Monitor) Headphones. They are not only fantastic in every way, but cost just under $80!

What is so great about these earphones? They are super comfortable, even during endless hours of use. The coil cord is great, and helps to keep the 9.8 foot cord untangled and out of the way. You could spend 10X the amount for barely discernible difference in sound quality. The earphones come with a 1/4"" adapter, which makes it compatible for nearly any audio device.

Would we order these earphones again? You betcha! In fact, since getting my husband the first pair in December of 2015 (for use with his home recording studio), we have purchased 2 more pairs. One for me (to replace the afore mentioned $275 earphones that don't even come close!), and the other pair (still in their packaging) to have on hand, should anything happen to one of the pairs in use.

NOTE: for someone wanting a deep/amplified bass experience, these earphones are NOT for them. These earphones are true to sound ... un-enhanced, and crystal clear.

I felt pretty stupid for cheating myself out of the pleasures of good music all this time. They also feel comfortable to me after a few hours and I'm a tall person with a fairly large noggin. The fancy packaging makes me feel like I bought $500 headphones and gave me that quick passing feeling of being a wealthy person.

I would say in particular my electronic, ambient, classical and choral music benefited the most. That's where I felt the ceiling and floors dropped out to reveal new dimensions. Older stuff like 60s rock certainly sounded better than before but I could also detect more flaws. If your MP3 collection is 128 bit rate prepare to be upset how bad they sound in good headphones.

It goes without saying that if you're going to spend $80 on good headphones for computer use, your computer should have a good sound card. Onboard sound cards typically have noise interference. I'm using an old SoundBlaster Live! 24-Bit External USB and cannot hear any noise or hiss whatsoever when these headphones are plugged in.","I did not find religion in these, but I did rediscover a lot of my music"

They deliver a wonderful clear sound. I purchased them mainly for listening to podcasts, streaming music, and watching streaming video. They are 10/10 for non music audio and 9/10 for music audio.

The headphones are beloved by live audio professionals and for good reason. You aren't going to get better sound live audio, talk, and streaming TV/movies unless you are willing to spend hundreds more dollars. If you go into a live studio TV, radio, or internet you will likely find the MDR7506 on a lot of heads.

For music it depends on what you're listening to. If hip hop with a ton of bass is your main interest these probably won't be at the top of your list. Likewise with classical music. The lower end just isn't represented strongly with these headphones. You can boost the low end and it works fine. Plugged directly into a phone or tablet it's fairly weak.

I paired mine with an Fiio E11k portable headphone amp. It can push them to a very high volume cleanly and has a decent bass boost. On a PC or stereo with an equalizer they are lacking nothing.

8,9 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, May 22 2013,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these Sony MDR-7506 headphones a couple of months ago. More recently, I've also purchased Sony's very similar (but not identical - see below) Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones. My reason for purchasing a second pair (and getting both models) was because the V6's were very inexpensive at the time I ordered ($30 cheaper than the 7506's), and because I was curious to see if I could tell a difference between the two. In reading many of the reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, I knew that the two are constructed very similarly but there were different opinions regarding both the differences (if any) and which has the superior sound.

These are both headphones in the $100 and below price category, which seems like a reasonable price to pay for high quality sound. I do not like to listen to music using earbuds, I prefer this style of ""over-the-ear"" headphone. although it does take some getting used to. I also have very inexpensive Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones for occasions when I don't want to use my more expensive Sony's.

I am very satisfied with the sound quality from these headphones (both models), and with the comfort. They are the first ""quality"" headphones that I have owned, and the level of detail in the sound, lack of distortion, and overall quality is simply superb. I am completely satisfied.

Now, regarding both similarities and differences between the Sony MDR-7506 and Sony MDR-V6, here is what I have found:

- externally, they are almost identical in construction and appearance. The V6 has red stickers on each headphone ""for Digital"", and the 7506 has blue stickers ""Professional"". The phono jack for the V6 is silver metal (all metal), for the 7506 is gold (rubber and gold). Those are the only visible differences I am able to detect.
- when I listen to the two headphones back to back, at the same volume level and with the same music, I can detect a slightly clearer treble and midrange from the 7506, and very slightly clearer sound. This is consistent with several of the other reviewers on Amazon for the 7506, who say they can detect a slightly better sound separation and more open sound for the 7506, with the V6's sounding a bit warmer. One reviewer also says that the internal grounding for the two headphones is different - the 7506 uses a separate internal ground for the left and right channels, where the V6 uses a single ground for both channels. (It seems to me that both grounds are going to the same place anyway, but if this is true - and I am not able to confirm whether or not it is - then maybe this contributes to a slightly different sound).
- some reviewers state that the internal speaker drivers are different for the two headphones. However when I went to Sony's website to check the specifications for the two models, that is not what I found. And here is what the Wikipedia page states for these headphones: ""both models share the same part number for their driver, but the magnet therein is known to vary. The MDR-7506 was introduced with a samarium-cobalt magnet, as is currently used in the MDR-V6. However, at some point, the MDR-7506 switched to the slightly more powerful neodymium magnet. These changes were made without changing the driver part number.""
- The box for the 7506 states ""neodimium magnet"". The operating instructions included with the V6 state ""samarium cobalt magnet"". Possibly either or both of these are out of date (as Wiki states, they may make spec changes over time) - the 7506 box is copyright 1994, and the V6 copyright is 1996.
- The 7506 box includes an exploded view and parts list, which is very nice to have. The V6 box does not.
- Both headphones include a soft case for storing/carrying the headphones, and both include an adaptor plug so that the headphone can be used with either a stereo mini-plug or a normal size plug.

UPDATE 7/22/13 and 7/30/13: The Sony MDR-V6 and MDR-7506 headphones have just recently been reviewed by CNET, with similar comments to my own regarding the small differences in sound quality. Both headphones receive a very high recommendation from CNET. See the MDR-7506 review at [...] and the MDR-V6 review at [...]

According to the specifications on Sony's website (which should be up-to-date), the only difference between the two headphones is frequency response:

- MDR-7506:
- Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 10-20kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity

- MDR-V6:
- Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 5-30kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity

I am not able to explain how Sony is claiming different frequency response for the two headphones if all of the other specs are identical, but this is what they are saying. And I do believe that the two headphones have slightly different sound.

Although there is a slight difference between the 7506 and V6, the sound from both headphones is very neutral. The ""professional"" choice between the two seems to be the 7506, and it is the more expensive model. If you read other reviews you will find that the 7506's are commonly used by studio engineers, because they are designed to reproduce the sound just as it is, without adding emphasis to the bass as some other headphones are designed to do. At this point, for me they are both excellent, and for thirty bucks less I'd go with the V6 if I could have only one of the two.

I've been using these headphones with the Audioengine D1 24-bit digital-to-audio converter, and I am extremely pleased with the quality of the sound.

As a final comment, some owners of these headphones comment that the ear pads wear out over time, and some owners also prefer different ear pads for better comfort. I also purchased a pair of Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions for this reason, and although I have not yet given them a try to compare them with the ear pads that come with the Sony headphones, I do like the fact that it is possible to fit different ear pads if desired in order to provide more comfort, as well as replace them when they have become worn (some owners use these headphones for many years).

I notice that there are a very large number of reviewers for these headphones, many of them long-time owners who feel very strongly that these Sony headphones are the best. I'm just beginning to use them, but I have high hopes that they will be durable over time and that I will continue to be as satisfied with them as I am today.",Superb Headphones and Excellent Value (with comparison to Sony MDR-V6)

Back to the headphones; the only other things are that the cord is a little long, the bass is a little lower than usual, and that colorful tag thing on either side of the headphones actually consists of a colorful sticker covered with another clear sticker, that peels up over time and is a little annoying to have on your $80 headphones.

now the good things for buyers to know, i just plugged in from my laptop and i have to say they sound much better,
things i like:

Long and soft cord, since im a cord destroyer this is just what i needed
treble, man, they sound crystal clear, and can hear any detail on music sorry bose, you cant beat this babies
confortable, last might i slept for about 5 hours woked up took em off, and no pain at all
nice design, very flat and they seem to last for ever, however i put insurance from squaretrade for 3 years 7 dlls w discount
they stay on your head, even when laying down, so runners this is what you need,
they work nice with my keyboard, i thought i was in the concert then realized it was me playing lol,
they come with one year warranty, for those who said 3 months.

I had to come back and give one more star to this headphones, since they work twise better by adding an amplifier to them specially if you are using them with iphone or even computer,, wow its all i can say,,oh, i got fiio E6 for 26 dlls here ar amazon, and what i great devise as well

Bose's (on ear) gime me more bass but they dont sound as clear as this ones, so 4 stars because of the bass, perhaps i come back later and do the 5 stars when i try them from stronger source. i stared falling in love with them,, metallica is on(nothing else matters) wow.

sure i will keep bose in the closet for a litle awhile and test this ones longer, i will be back i can feel it

I read somewhere that ""they don't make headphones like this anymore,"" and now I believe it. Pretty comfortable as well.

Con's: My ears might be a bit too big, but it bothers me (only slightly) that my ears press up against the inner part of the headphone. Maybe it's supposed to be that way? I'm not sure. I don't believe I've tried to listen to a .flac file with these, but they seem to lack a bit of bass. Also, a non-detachable cable is a huuuuge downside for me; my cord's always go out after a year of use, so it's almost a must for any of my headphone purchases to include a replaceable cord. Only way around that is to be extremely handy with a sauteing iron. It is possible to mod it to have a removable cord, but be very careful not to ruin such a great investment.

2 - wonderfully balanced sound (the best out of all headphones I've ever tried)
3 - does it's best to firmly place itself on your head without making it feel like it's viced
4 - surprisingly good at suppressing outside noise and containing your sound
5 - just an overall great pair of headphones",The best

Have I used a lot? No.

I've used a couple of different pairs of Sony's (MDR-V150 for probably the past... 8 years?) another pair I can't remember the model number of, the ubiquitous iOS ""white"" earbuds, and some Sony behind the head headphones. I've used all of them for the same tasks... maybe with the exception of the V150s... and that is editing/listening to music/working out/and listening to audio interviews.

Clearly, the earbuds were the most uncomfortable, a 3 on a 1-10 scale with 10 as the best. The behind the head, headphones are OK, but after awhile, they hurt too. The sound isn't incredibly accurate out of those either, but they have a nice shorter cord and fit in my gear bag excellently probably a 7 out of ten for overall use, comfort and dependability. The V150s are somewhat comfortable, like a 6? or 7? out of 10, but they've got a super long straight cord that makes working out in them totally dangerous and I never used them for that. For other uses they're... OK.

THESE, the 7506s answer the need for great 'cans' for editing, great for field monitoring and even just for kicking back and relaxing listening to music!

I'm considering getting another pair or two to keep stashed away in case they ever break. These have replaced my behind the head, headphones for field monitoring (and another sony pair that I borrowed from someone similar in style to this but nowhere near as nice. Not sure on model nomenclature.)

They've replaced anything else for editing other than speakers when I'm at home in my office.

Bass is rich and the the cables don't get in the way (DJ's will probably appreciate this the most).

That aside, based on the build quality, it's not something that i think will last more than about a year of occasional use and about half that time if it's for daily use.

The material on the ear pads peels off very easily leaving residue on your ears and; the ear pads come off the speakers pretty frequently.
EDIT 1/5/2016
Forget when I originally purchased these headphones but I have had to replace the foam pads twice now. Other than that, it has taken some serious beatings but it still works well. At $10 to $20 per replacement ear pads, might not really be a worthy investment.

A workaround would be to buy custom ear cups to go with it but for the extra bucks, you might as well invest in a slightly more expensive product.

They are terrible and the next headphones I found were these.
Everyone was right with the MDR7506's. They are absolutely incredible.

Pros:
Very accurate
No ear fatigue (I can listen to these for 8 hours and still be fine)

Cons:
Many times, I wish the cord was shorter, but I still like the length

This is only a problem when the office temp is 73*F +. Usually the office is at 70*F, but can get hotter when people constantly come and go through the hallway door. When it's that cool, my ears don't sweat and these headphones are A+++.

I am not a studio professional, I'm a graphic artist. I use these all the time while doing work, it pretty much cuts off the outside world, and I love that. the sound gets loud, stays clear, and has worked great on pretty much every genre of music in my eclectic playlists. the bass especially delivers for headphones. This is the first pair of headphones I've bought that I can't have at max volume all the time because they're that powerful.

My only complaint: the chord. it's meant for you to be wheeling around a booth, or between camera and whatever, without getting unplugged, so the cable is super long. but it's also coiled, so it doesn't bundle neatly, it's heavy, and highly prone to twisting and tangling and catching on things. if they made a standard consumer version of this, that's all I'd change, a shorter straight cable (even the industrial aesthetics are good to me). but since they're monitor headphones I knew what I was getting into.

if you can deal with the wire, these are the best headphones you'll get for under $400 (avoid the ones with bright plastic, they're usually a sham).

I wanted my headphones to dampen ambient sounds, be comfortable enough to wear for a couple hours at a time, and play sounds.

They are pretty comfy. I can happily wear them for a couple hours.
They play sounds. I've never had great headphones before and it is terrific to hear better bass and better sound overall than I'm used to listening to.

I didn't realize the cord on these was 10 feet long. This is very long. If I'm walking around with these plugged into my phone I have to gather the cord up and stuff it into a pocket. I would love if I could get these with a much shorter cord. The coiled format is great for a 10 foot cord, though.

You will hear every little detail in a recording with these. This is great if you use them for editing purposes. If you listen to compressed audio (streaming/youtube/mp3s, etc), you will hear the imperfections in there. If you listen to high-quality files, though, you're in for a treat. Very detailed sound in all frequencies. It all sounds very balanced. All the highs and mids are there without being harsh. All the bass is effortlessly there without being boomy or overbearing. They have that ""monitor"" quality to them. You'll hear the recording the way the producer intended it to sound.

These are easily the best-sounding headphones I've ever owned so far. They provide a very pleasant listening experience no matter what I throw at them. ""Balanced"" is the best way I can describe the sound. Unlike most other headphones, these don't make my ears tired.

4,Was this review helpful to you?, May 19 2013,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've now had these headphones for about 7 months. I wanted to wait and see how they would hold up over time. So far they've been perfect. I was considering the Grado SR-60 as I heard they had the best sound under $100, however there were quite a few things that made this pair more appealing.
1. The Grado's are open backed, which may allow for superior sound, but apparently also makes your music slightly hearable to those nearby. I bought these for blocking out outside noise in computer labs and the library so I think this pair is a more practical choice as they have very little noise bleed.
2. The collabsible factor is a little iffy but makes these headphones a very pragmatic choice as a they can easily collaspse and be stowed away for transport. This feature also brings up my one (minor) complaint with these headphones. The mechanism to collaspse them feels a little flimsy. Again, this is a very minor issue, but it sometimes feels as though the hinge should be bulkier for the amount of pressure that's exerted on it. It should be known that this has yet to give me a problem and I did not hear it being an issue with anyone else when I looked at other reviews for these.

One more very slight complaint is that the material on the earpads can get a little sticky after listening for a while as it doesn't breathe very well. A popular option that I tried is to upgrade the pads to the Byerdynamic velour pads. With these new pads the headphones are amazing for long listening and extremely comfortable.

On the whole these are a great deal at this price and are a very solid pair of headphones. I would give them my full recommendation.",Solid headphones

I think they have the most pure, strong, and natural sound I ever heard. Listening to my favorite songs, they got my full attention. The only think anybody can say they lack is a little boost on the bass side. Again, my amplifier provided just that. The highs sound great; the treble, no piercing sound there, just perfect.

I was looking for an ""over the ear"" set to listen to short wave AS WELL AS portable MP3's and Pandora without disturbing those around me.

Initially thinking that extremely faithful reproduction was not that important for my primary use, I looked at the less than $50 cans. I learned this was a mistake. Among the best rated among the less expensive units was the Monoprice, which is what I ordered. After testing and comparing it with my other phones, I determined they were unacceptable. They lacked ""air"" and sounded like there was excessive harmonic distortion, possibly from reverberation inside the fairly large cans. Choral lyrics were distorted, not from cone breakup, but from internal resonance, I suspect. Those were returned and I upped the ante and ordered this Sony.

The Sony sound is dryer, not as much low-mid, but cleaner mids and highs. These phones will rival the two really nice ones I already own, but with a different purpose.

The form factor is also better: lighter, less bulky, and more comfortable than the Monoprice, feeling very much like my Senns but with a wire.","Definitely superior to ""budget"" cans"

They might feel a bit light and flimsy at first compared to other monitors, but you'll find that they're actually very sturdy.

Their light weight is actually really fantastic because you can wear them all day comfortably.

The cable is great too. There's a rubber sheath where the wire joins the connector housing, which allows it to take considerably more abuse than the standard headphone cable. This is important because the cable itself can stretch up to 10 ft, and when it's compressed it can be a bit heavy. The connector itself is gold-plated with metal housing.

Wonderful. Instruments were distinct and clear. Horns sounded rich and full. A little Springsteen and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper confirmed that these phones will handle a broad range of musical styles. Sgt. Pepper was the album that made an audiophile of me back in the 60's when it was released. At that time, I had a cheap portable stereo with a tilt out turntable and fold out speakers. I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day. I heard things from that music on his system that I had never heard on my cheap stereo, and I was hooked.

I have had countless cables get brittle and break, drivers start to distort over time, but after extensive use of the MDR-7506 for over 3 years now, the only thing that had worn down are the stickers on the ear cups. The cable has survived the metal casters of my chair rolling over it countless times with no visually apparent damage, I have dropped the headphones similarly countless times without as much as a scratch. These poor headphones have been through hell, and yet they keep fighting strong.

My only complaint I have with them are with the stock ear pads, specifically. At first, I had replaced them with Beyerdynamic velour ear pads. While comfortable at first, a little over a year later, and they had become completely covered in this horrifically disgusting layer of oil and dirt that was literally caked on. I set the headphones down on a piece of paper on my desk overnight, and in the morning, the paper had a giant oil stain on it. Needless to say, I was mortified. I eventually replaced those with the Brainwavz Sheepskin ear pads. While stupid expensive, they avoid the sucking powers of cloth and the flaking qualities of pleather. Highly recommended, if you don't sweat easily, that is.

To sum up, these headphones are unassuming tanks; They look cheap and flimsy at first, but these guys pack some serious punch and are cost effective to boot!",These Headphones Are Unassuming Tanks

Cannot imagine there's a better value out there - was surprised to find that these industry standard phones are under $100. I 100% recommend these.

I run sound at church and needed headphones that will faithfully reproduce the signal. An audio pro who does both studio and live work gave a clinic for our sound team and recommended these.

I cannot be happier.

Affordable, comfortable, perfect amount of noise cancelling, exceptional sound reproduction - what's not to love?

I'm also a drummer and these work great for reducing the db assault on my ears during practice. I hook them up to my iPhone to listen to the click or songs I'm trying to learn. Everything sounds great. While the db from the drums is reduced it's not muffled in a way that interferes with practice. For example, I still know if my rim click sounds right or is slightly off.

I love that the 1/4 adapter screws on and off so it won't accidentally get left behind when I pack up or switch jacks.

The cord does not seem like it will tangle easily and I have not had any issues yet of it kinking up and don't anticipate that to be a problem.

The 1/8 inch plug housing can interfere with connecting it to a phone depending on the case you have so you may have to modify your case (enlarge the hole that goes to your headphone jack), take the case off, or what I do is carry an extension cable.

I do recommend buying a case for them.

Was this review helpful to you?, October 27 2010,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got these on a recommendation from a friend, he said they are an industry standard and he and many people he's known have owned theirs for many years. He himself said he's had his for 10 years, and as you'll see it's not uncommon for people to say they have had them for that long.

Packaging:
Freaking sweet! I guess I didn't expect much for headphones but it comes in a pretty nice box, solidly packaged. It was sitting on top of some ruffled silver cloth, looked great. Includes headphones, large jack connector (not sure what it's called) and warranty info / disassembly instructions.

Build:
These things are built like a rock. They are also beautiful. Just looking at the screws and the stitching of the leather on the headband I'm highly impressed.

Fit:
This is a point I docked a point, maybe I just have a big head or ears. The first day I wore them my ears got a little sore, they aren't real tight mind you, but probably a result of me being an ear-bud style kind of guy for so long.

Audio:
Look I'm no audiophile, but man can these pump! I never knew what I was really missing musically. I've discovered so many new things in the music I listen to. The base isn't overwhelming but it's nice. Have you ever been in a car with wayyyyy too much base to the point you couldn't hear the actual music? I have, and hate that. If you're looking for extreme base well, go put some subs in your car! These like any good headphone will excel when connected to a better audio device, like a headphone amp, or a good computer sound card (and yes you can tell a HUGE difference). I had these hooked up to a Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeMusic Card (a midrange sound card) and there was a huge difference from on board computer audio (heck my headphones where noticeably shaking). I'm now getting a top of the line ASUS card that has a built in headphone amp and expect even larger gains.

Other Thoughts:
On recommendation from a friend I got different earpads. I got the velour earpads meant for the Beyerdynamic DT250/DT280 from [ ... ], you can actually find the link to it right here on Amazon by searching for ""Beyerdynamic DT250/DT280 Replacement Earpads Headphones"". At the time of writing they are about [ ... ] shipped. They have a larger ear opening. I've seen others say that their ears can sweat when wearing the stock ones for a long time, but these are great and won't stick to your face so check those out.

These leak sound a little, it's not terrible but keep that in mind if your looking for a pair of headphones that won't leak at all these are not it.

I will update when the new audio card comes in next week.",Awesome cans for the price

I recently replaced a pair I've had since 1998. They're especially great for listening to music made with modern instruments, including rock and some jazz. They are possibly a bit too ""technical"" for classical music, and will certainly expose flaws in recordings that you wouldn't ordinarily hear on lesser headphones. They're comfortable enough for multi-hour listening sessions and fit comfortably.

Was this review helpful to you?, July 14 2010,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently produced five CDs for the Yale Whiffenpoofs and spent many hours listening to singing. The most difficult task was working with a recording engineer in Florida while I was in Connecticut. He would put the transcribed music on the server for me to listen to, and I would send back my comments and suggestions. It was important that I hear the music as clearly as possible, and after trying 8 different pairs of headphones, I am convinced the Sony MDR-7506 headphones are the best available. The only other phones that were comparable were the Sennheiser HD650s, but these cost roughly three times more. But I prefer the Sony's for their realism and sound stage.

Sound stage is an abstract concept that is difficult to explain. When earphones provide a good sound stage, the listener feels both left-right differential but forward-back depth. This capability is a perception, not a reality, and has a lot to do with how well the music has been engineered in the sound studio. But some headphones present a full sound stage and others do not. I have always appreciated the Sennheisers for doing this well, but the Sony MDR-7506 headphones do it the best. This gives the music a depth beyond that generated by stereo, and allows one to listen for extended periods of time without fatigue.

I even recommend these headphones if all you are going to do is listen to rock. The bass response is flat, not enhanced, however. But I have listened to some well engineered rock with these and it comes alive. The midrange is alive and crystal clear. Vocals are so realistic that you are transported. Sometimes it takes my breath away. I love these headphones.",The Best Headphones for Classical and Vocal Music

Was this review helpful to you?, January 20 2015,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm working in a small home studio where I generally record no more than two musicians or singers at a time. I needed to purchase two pairs of headphones so that I could monitor the recordings while also allowing the musicians to hear themselves. After doing considerable research, I settled on these the Sony MDR7506 headphones.

First, they're widely used in professional studios, so you know they're going to have good build quality. Second, they have a relatively flat frequency response. If you're looking for bass-heavy phones, something from Beats will probably make you happier. But in a studio, the flat response of these phones really works well.

I also really like the coiled cable. I've had phones with both coiled and straight cables, and the coiled seem to be less of a hassle overall, especially when you've got a dozen other cables snaking around the room to mics and instruments.

Being able to easily convert from a 1/4"" jack to a 1/8"" jack is a really great feature that's fairly common on headphones like these, and it's appreciated.

Finally, the price is what really seals the deal. You can find better headphones, but they're going to cost a good deal more than these. Altogether, I think they're great for small studios or traveling musicians that need a solid set of phones.","High quality, great price"
8,Was this review helpful to you?, September 13 2013,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had this headphones for 4 years now and they are still working great. no problems with them other than that the ear pads started to get worn down so i bought some new ones, the sound is just amazing in this headphones and i would buy another pair of them when my other ones break down. This headphones can really take a hit, I have been using them weekly for 4 year and I usually just trow them in my backpack without the protective bag around it, and they still work well. the cord is doing well and like i said earlier they are still working like they wear new. The sound quality on this ones are also amazing, if you want anything close to this that i have tried you need to go 2-3 times the price.

I use a lot of time traveling around and if i sit in a car or flying i will use them for hours at the time, I can easily wear them for 5-6 hours at the time listening to music, listening to audio books or watching movies, they work great for everything. It don't matter if it is loud music in the car or you are on the plan. The headphone block out most of the sound. At the same time you can play the music as loud as you want to without the guy next to you hearing anything.

I can honestly say that these would be Considered GREAT!!!!! The amount and quality of sound that these put out is phenomenal!

If you have never listened to a pair of good headphones then these will blow you away. These will play any note your ear can possibly hear with ease. I've listened to the similarly priced Grado SR80e Prestige Series Headphones, and although the Grados had slightly better highs and mids, these absolutely DESRTOY the Grados when it comes to bass. The bass was tight and loud and made Hip Hop/Rap And EDM sound incredible. I personally thought that the highs were too harsh and bright but most people will actually like it and feel like it has more detail As for comfort, these aren't so great. It might be because I'm spoiled with high end headphones but to me, these felt rather cheap and light. They're On/Over-ear headphones. They squish uncomfortably against the bottom and top of my ear.

The headband spring also didn't need to be decompressed to the same degree.

While I enjoyed the reference quality sound of the Sennheiser better, once they bit it I wanted something more affordable. These phones do the job. The bass levels are not out of control (which they were for the DJMs, and are for non-professional, non-audiophile phones like Beats), something I don't need while trying to figure out how much bass I need while DJing.

I don't feel that these phones have all the range and precision of Sennheisers, but the price is definitely right. Headphones only last three years of combined professional and personal use with me, so I'm happy with my decision to use these for the next three years.

Was this review helpful to you?, March 24 2014,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have very high quality recordings of Chicago's (Chicago Transit Authority) ""I'm a Man"" and ""Questions 67 and 68,"" as well as Canned Heat jamming with with John Lee Hooker, ""Whiskey and Women."" I selected these three songs because there's a lot of range in these songs covering many instruments (a wide variety of percussion, strings, horns, electric, distortion, and different voice textures). It's very easy for these songs to become muddied due to the richness and complexity of the the various ranges. I listened to these three songs through these MDR-7506 first. Then I listened to it through a pair of Koss UR/29s, then through a pair of Sennheiser HD 202s (because these are the only headphones I have available and wanted to compare them). Then I returned to the MDR-7506s.

When I first listened through these headphones I was stunned by the clarity and separation of the instruments and the clean character of the sound. When I listened to these through the Koss UR/29s they were about 8-10% muddier (to my ear). The Koss UR/29s are surprisingly clean but they seem to miss the highs and too many of the instruments blend, losing distinction, and some subtle sounds of instruments were nearly undetectable. Still the Koss UR/29s are good headphones and sound very nice for listening to music. For $30.00 they're a heck of a deal. The Sennheiser HD202s actually sounded like there was a curtain between me and the sound of the music. In fairness these Sennheiser HD202s are $25.00 or $30.00 also. The Koss UR/29s put them to shame.

Then I went back to the MDR-7506s and I was very pleased; ""thrilled by the quality of the sound"" is a better constative. These headphones are remarkably clear and they convey the recording as it was engineered and intended to sound. I got them for about $82.00. A little pricey but considering the quality of the sound, well worth it. I would not chase the Bose, the Beats, or the other high-end offerings because I like the music presented as intended, whereas Bose loves to shape sound, and the Beats are definitely engineered for enhancing types music as well (typically the base and highs). One last thing, these are comfortable and relatively non-intrusive on my head; that is, they're easy to wear. The UR/29s are comfortable as well but again, the difference between these and the MDR-7506s is significant.

Note: I recently purchased these so I am critiquing the quality of the sound only; if I remember to come back here in a year or two, I'll give a followup regarding performance and durability over time. I purchased a set of the Beyerdynamic replacement ear cups and when the originals fail and I replace them, I'll probably write the follow-up piece at that time.",Very clean

If you are looking for a great set to use for these purposes, look no further.

The great thing about the Grado's is the sound quality, the bad thing is the comfort. I felt, after reading countless headphone reviews, that these would be a good choice. I did not expect them to equal the Grado sound, and they are not. Then again, they are less than 1/3 the price of Grados. The comfort level is very, very good. I am occasionally bothered by the band pressing on my head, but that is after many hours of listening. Another reviewer of this line of Sonys complained that the wire going to the ear cup broke from taking the headphones on and off. Being forewarned was a good thing as I was able to pull some of the excess wire down so that the headphone flipping as I take them off did not put stress on the wire. These are designed to fold up and that is my only real complaint. The ear cup flips into the folded position when I take them off, and then requires a few seconds to flip them back into position before putting them on. This happens ALL the time and though the time involved is small, the irritation is not. It took about 50 hours to break them in, and the sound quality is fine for TV, movies, and background listening while I read.

The Sony's have a coiled cord which is less likely to tangle or trip people. The Sony headphones work great when plugged directly into my portable MP3 players (Sansa Clip and Coby models), do not require an adapter, and can be worn around the house because the cord is coiled and does not drag or tangle.

I never should have let all SIX get away during liquidation. Someone once told me that I should never pay consumer prices for great audio. Once you own professional equipment, consumer audio never quite sounds the same for the price.

Anyways, as you can tell I sold my equipment and the headphones with it. That was a mistake. These headphones were the main stay of my productions, and editing. I now had to settle for in-ear buds which never stay in for me. Or, I have the complimentary headphones one gets when buying popular language learning software. (Yikes!) But I persevered through that muck for about 5 years to purchase again these headphones. My ears are in a blissful state once more! Thank you Sony for never giving up on a good product!

These headphones have a GREAT sound!!! I like the other brands, you know...Senn, AT, AKG, etc. but I LOVE these Sonys. They have a crisp, clean brilliance of sound while maintaining a full, rich bass presence. Nothing is muddied unless it's in the recording that way or your amps just won't reproduce the sound cleanly.

I gave SIX pair of these phones away and I regretted every minute I went without them. I am fortunate to find them here for a VERY low price of $77.XX. I paid about $110.00 for each pair in my studio.

I am SO glad to have these Sonys back! Each pair is almost identical to the next in the Sony MDR-7506 line. These sound pretty much the same as my 6 pair in my studio.

As far as total transparency, these phones tend to accentuate the bass while leaving the mids and highs about level to a ""flat response"" EQ setting. The closed design does help reduce ambient noise considerably. In my estimation, these PROBABLY reduce ambient noise by about 15-22 dBs.

The comfort of these headphones is amazing. The foam cushions keep the drivers from putting pressure against the ears causing discomfort. They are not too tight in their fit as to cause headaches from wearing these phones for long periods of time such as in the back of the mini-van for 6 hours while watching the latest Scooby Doo episodes on DVD.

One more thing...volume. These phones can take the volume without distorting on their own. Any distortion that comes through those drivers is most likely due to a bad recording or amps that cannot reproduce sound that well.

You want some advice on what to purchase for headphones? Buy the Sony MDR-7506es. They are by FAR the best audio bang for the buck!

This is just an excellent product. As other reviews have stated, this is standard equipment in recording studios all over the world. What gets more professional than that? Basically these blast my non-modified Grado SR-80's (purchased a couple of years before this, and excellent head phones in their own right, out of the water). My music sounds different (as in better, more clear) since I got this: and I have a MP3 (320 kbps), FLAC and vinyl collection that I listen to every day. My computer games also sound better than before. Of course, my GF's audio setup also sounds better than before; her equipment gives out more nuanced sounds than I thought it could. I also use it as a monitor when I'm recording audio with my Tascam DR-100MK2 for some amateur film-making.

I was prepared to spend in excess of $200 for a good pair of headphones but I'm glad I continued to shop. There is good contrast to the ranges and the sound is full without feeling like it's right on top of you. The bass is good without too much artificial 'thump'. They are also comfortable with my glasses, which has not been the case with other headphones I tried.

A couple of things to keep in mind that some may consider a drawback: the cord is heavy, which is to be expected with professional headphones. This makes mobility awkward if using with your phone or smaller devices. Also, they can get hot if you're not in a climate controlled environment. I use these headphones for chilling at home, so none of these things are an issue for me.

I am just a regular consumer who appreciates a quality product and can recognize a high value item. In those terms the Sony 7506 is a grand slam home-run. You should buy these headphones!

Sound: The sound quality is exceptional at any price point. The sound reproduction with these headphones is extremely well rounded, clear and distortion-free at any volume. I can see why these would be desirable in a studio setting. The bass is deep the highs are crisp and the mids are in full effect. These are enjoyable headphones to use for listening to music from classical to rap as well as for spoken word audio like podcasts or talk radio.

Quality: So far so good. These have been around a while which speaks to the solid design. Some of the materials feel a little cheap and the overall feel of the headphones is slightly low-rent. The ear cup and headband leather feels cheap and the padding is not nearly as nice as the Bose QC15/25 (the standard for comfort in my opinion). They are in no-way uncomfortable even after an hour or more but could be more comfortable. The cord and wiring seems very robust. I would like the option to plug in a shorter cable for us on a computer or listening outdoors on a walk/hike or while travelling. The casing for the electronics however seems like pretty nice quality plastics. They seem rugged and all the hinges and hardware seem tough and I see no reason they wouldn't hold up to years of use.

Value: Value is an 11/10. Seriously, if you appreciate a quality set of headphones and think you can't get good sound and/or build quality for less than $300 should rethink your headphone search. These may not be the king of the mountain at any price. But, for $80-$100 they CANNOT be beat.

Was this review helpful to you?, May 3 2012,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a Mobile DJ that travels from club to club, gig to gig. I've used Headphones that go for 400.00 to ones that cost 10.00. The've all broken the same after about 8 months of heavy use. I'd keep spending money on them though because they were labeled for ""DJ Use."" Honestly it's all marketing bs for companies to get people to buy their products. I remember the days when expensive prices actually meant that something was going to last a lot longer. Not the case with most head phones on the market today.

These Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone's have with stood the test of time over and over again (if it ain't broke don't fix it).

During school I worked at the college radio station and all we used were these Sony's. I'd nearly forgotten how bad we used to treat them; they took such a beating that I thought all headphones were built this way. Not the case. The only thing I was see going on these is the ear pads (which are replaceable. As much as I use these, the way I take care of my equipment, I won't be needing to replace the ear pads for the next two years).

When I bought them last year there were something like 82.00. Very much worth the price even at 98.00. To this day if you ask me what are the best head phones to DJ with I will tell you to get these. They are also amazing for the Studio as well. Go figure.

Update: 10/14/12
Just replaced my my ear pieces as they were tearing on the inside and had this weird flaking issue. The foam pieces I replaced them with are excellent (Pearstone delux ear pads), have used them for the past three days with no issue; and def no flaking (which only starts to happen with the originals after a year or two depending on use).

The only weakness these headphones possess is the foam ear pieces which are not as durable as the Pearstone's I just purchased. I recommend buying the Pearstone Delux earpads (they go for around 20.00) along with the MDR-7506. You will not be disappointed.",Still going strong
1,Was this review helpful to you?, October 1 2014,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I work primarily as freelance radio producer and occasional DJ and am no stranger to Sony headphones. Having babied a well-worn pair of Sony MDR-V700 headphones for the past decade for general studio/work use, I was in dire need of a new set of cans.

The 7506 has a long reputation as a solid set of workhorse headphones with above-average sound quality. I've seen them used in countless radio and recording studios time and time again for years now. Having logged about 20 hours or so with them thus far, I can see what all the praise is about.

The fit is comfortable for longer sessions and the earphones themselves, as mentioned elsewhere, can be driven quite loudly before any audible distortion kicks in. I'd describe the overall sound quality as balanced: highs are sharp without a piercing quality, mids are present without any muddiness and the bass is punchy and warm without overpowering the rest of the spectrum.

Mind you, this is only as good as your source material, but in playing back typical 16 or 24-bit WAV audio in the studio (as well as 320 MP3s and even some older vinyl) the 7506 has done well with each source so far. No complaints.

I'd say the only caveat with the 7506 is in its design. They're NOT the sturdiest of headphones on the market in terms of build quality. They're considerably lighter than others nowadays which adds to the comfort factor but can be an issue over time where durability is concerned. They do fold up for transport but the wire to each earphone is exposed - another rarity compared to other current models - though said wires are held somewhat firmly in place.

I'd say the key to getting the most out of these in the long run is to handle them somewhat delicately. My older MDR-V700s were notorious for breaking at the hinges but having babied them for so long it's not terribly difficult to keep them usable with a bit of proper care. These ship with a soft leather carrying pouch which should be adequate for carrying these around in most situations but a hard-shell or zippered vinyl case (Slappa, UDG, etc) wouldn't hurt to have on hand either.

Overall, on sound quality alone and comfort alone, the 7506 is a must-have for anyone who spends a good chunk of their life living in headphones.",Workhorse headphones... provided you take care of them.

Well, it would be nice if they had a replaceable cable, and that way you could choose a length to suit and whether it was coiled or straight, but other than that quibble, they sound great and are comfortable to wear, and surely that's the main thing to keep in mind.

I have several other pairs of headphones, costing many times more than these, but the stunningly clear precise sound from the MDR 7506 draws me back to them, time after time.

4,Was this review helpful to you?, August 28 2014,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sometimes older is better. I was looking for over-ear travelling phones (as I have grown tired of earbuds). I have used MDR-V6s in the studio for two decades and have always loved their clean, try, reasonably flat qualities. They are also comfortable. Sure, the cushion material eventually cracks and flakes, but they just keep sounding great.

Anyway, as a love of Blue mics, I was holding out hope for the Mo-Fis, which I ordered within minutes of their availability and primptly returned because they are so heavy (see review). I continued my search for a short time before putting on the V6s, suddenly realizing that the answer for my travelling needs was already on my head. Shopping Amazon led me to discover that the MDR 7506 cans were about $15 cheaper (and are basically the same). So, I used the savings to buy a pair of the Beyerdynamic velour pads (much softer and cooler).

They arrived about an hour ago and haven't left my ears since. The 7506s compare favorably with every set of headphones or earbuds I have ever used; Sennheiser, AKG, B&W, Etymotic, Shure, and now, Blue. They sound amazing with little or no coloring (I want my audio to sound like it was recorded). Pus, they are light enough to wear for hours (half the Mo-Fis), fold better than most over ear phones for traveling and they hold up. They are efficient enough that my iPhone and iPad drive them with plenty of leftover head room.

Apparently, the proverbial ""wheel"" doesn't need to reinvented. Now, my V6s live in the studio and the 7506s travel in my bag.",Don't mess with a great thing

However, the build quality is very poor. Like many other reviewers, the right channel stopped working entirely after about 6 months of use. I'm pretty handy with electronics, but couldn't figure out what to do to fix these. I took them apart, tested the connections, used an ohmmeter to try and pinpoint the failure/short, but to no avail.

Very balanced with a nice, even response curve. Highs and lows both sound fantastic, as do the mids.

I have these hooked up to an amp for my computer, and I have no need to spend more money on a nicer pair, as the sound is fantastic.

2,Was this review helpful to you?, March 5 2018,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really REALLY like the sound quality on these headphones. In fact, it is the sound quality that inched it up to 4 stars instead of 3. I played around with many different brands at local music shops and such and frankly, these were on par with everything but the most expensive as far as sound quality.

Now for the dis: As with most headphones of this style, they do not let your ears breath so wearing them for prolonged periods (more than 30 mins.) means you are going to sweat in them, possibly a lot. Sweat breaks down electronics as well as ear-pads (not to mention being uncomfortable). The other one that almost put these in the 3 star territory is the obnoxiously heavy cord. From using them on an electric piano to smart phone to portable guitar amp, the cord is constantly in the way and constantly a pain. I realize this is a problem for all corded electronics to some extent, but this thing is heavy so no matter how you position it, gravity does it's thing in short order and it is pulling on the input jack of your device (premature wear) as well as the headphones (wrapping tight against your neck and causing a lot of strain on the point where the cord goes into the headphones which means this will eventually pull out and fail).

All in all, they are nice and I like them, just be prepared to fuss with the cord a lot or come up with a way to clip it to your clothes or something because it'll drive you nuts.","Excellent sound quality, good price, obnoxious cord."

These are the real deal, made in Thailand, not one of the fakes flooding the market right now. A better pair for the money doesnt exist. These are great headphones for listening to music if you enjoy an accurate representation of what the recording provides (as I do) and if you're a bass-head do not fear, simply adjust the bass slider up and the treble down a bit on your Amp/Equalizer and enjoy! These headphones are comfortable and fit any sized head, but if the cushions are not good enough more cushion-y pads are available from numerous sellers on Amazon. As for durability, these headphones are well made and solid. It is important to note though that they have exposed wires on both sides of the headphones which are small and can easily become caught or crushed if the headphones are adjusted into the storage position. This is the reason for some reviewers finding the sound stopped working on one side, as they likely unknowingly crushed one side of the wire. If these wires are damaged it may not be visibly obvious. Take them to any half-decent electronic specialist and they would be able to resolder the damaged wire no problem, Sony even includes in the box, a schematic for the headphones with all the wires shown making repair a trivial process. So, just be very careful when folding them or better yet just avoid folding them at all unless you really have to. Also, the wire is quite long which is great for plugging into your hi-fi setup and sitting/laying down 5-6 feet away. This long cord also makes these very impractical for use with Walkmans on the go, so don't even try, just use a cheaper pair for on-the-move listening. These also block out sound quite well, so don't walk down the block with them on for that reason too, you'll probably get hit by a car.

I don't know how much I believe in all that, but I swear they sounded less strident in the highs and the bass had become a smoother and solid experience.

They are not to my liking for the brightness of the treble, which is not strident, but the bass cannot keep up. The highs are fine, only the bass is too quiet for me and not to my belief, accurate. If you were using these to master, you would keep messing with the bass and treble on your mixes to accomodate these headphones' negative characteristics.

Positive is that they still sound balanced, and they sound good. I think most people will notice there is quite a good sense of ambience presented by these, a rather spacious openness but the midrange, while perfectly functional, doesn't inspire. These are very careful headphones, they seek not to offend. They are sort of the Toyota Avalon (""A Lexus in all but name"") of headphones. Above the Camry, but not quite Lexus.

They are extremely comfortable, I love the design. I love the way they fold. These are some of the most well-designed headphones I've ever seen, amazing. Fat, thick cord that will never let you down (heavy, though!). You can wear these for hours (I can... I have a small head, more on that in a sec) and never feel a thing.

I have noticed with these, if I press them into my ears a little harder, they sound more impressive. The bass and lower mids come up and I really like their sound, at that point.

I wondered if people with big heads might be getting a better, more satisfying sound out of these because maybe the speakers press closer, thus correcting some of the bass problems I sited.

Bass is there, and accurate, just not with the 'oomph' that it should have. It's like it represents the bass, but it doesn't really sort of, appreciate it. And these headphones are like that with the whole spectrum, like I said, they're kinda like a Camry/Avalon thing where everything is fine, but you're not exactly inspired.

I knew they weren't noise cancelling when I bought them, but have seen several reviews saying they're a great travel headphone because the over the ear, closed-back style helps block noise. I was recently on a flight a couple of rows away from a crying baby and they really didn't do much to block that out. I bought these to replace a set of Sennheiser HD 598 Cs Closed Back Headphones that somehow got lost on a recent trip, and the Sennheiser's do a MUCH better job at blocking out background noise. Of course, they are about $75 more expensive.

Compared to the Sennheisers, these are smaller and easier to travel with because they fold, and adding a case to the Sennheisers makes them even bigger. I was hoping to use these instead for that reason, but I'm going back to my Sennheisers. The Sennheisers also have a little better sound quality IMO, although I do think for the price these Sonys are excellent.

This can take some getting used too coming from other styles of headphones which are designed to amplify some aspect of sound (like bass or treb).

I had been using bluetooth earbuds for my transcription work. I didn't like the feeling of being ""tethered"" to my desk, so I went wireless. I had no idea that I was missing critical information. These headphones not only helped remove a lot of the buzzing caused by the bass in the audio, but it also helped me hear small mutterings that I had been missing. As a court reporter and transcriptionist, it's important that I hear every spoken word and type it for the client...once I started using the MDR7506, I found I had been missing so much!

Now I'm able to hear every utterance, even when two people are speaking at once, I'm better able to discern them apart and catch every word. While these headphones don't totally block out my dogs barking or the sound of the washing machine, it does help to sort of fade them into the background because what's going on in my ears is so much clearer.

Was this review helpful to you?, June 10 2016,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones just arrived in the mail today from Amazon. I needed something that was compact and still sounded just as good or better than my old Sony MDR-V600's while still costing me less than $200. I read exhaustive reviews and comparisons on pairs by Sennheiser, Bose, Audio-Technics, AKG, Sony, Graco, and a few others. I must give a tremendous thanks to the top three ranked in-depth positive reviews on this site for guiding me to this purchase that was a no-brainer in the end. These headphones are about half the size of my MDR-V600's when folded up and make that old pair sound like tin cans. These have bass, but nowhere near enough to please the kids that drive around with their fenders rattling. I listen to real music and no rap at all.

Since these would be traveling with me on a long trip, I first tested them on my Sony boom box hooked up to a flash drive containing all of the music that I would need. Granted, this is a low tech audio source, but that is one way to compare headphones, since faults of each set will be made much more obvious. Again, these MDR 7506 beat the pants off my old MDR-V600's and have a more authentic sound reproduction as well. The next step was to compare the two sets hooked up to my iPod Classic with the volume set to about 80% and the EQ set to ""Rock"". Again, it was no contest and these new ones win easily. I also did not have to adjust volumes for either pair. Then I got to thinking as to why I even need to bring that bulky boom box and flash drive, when the iPod Classic fits in the palm of my hand and can be charged up with my wall charger. The boom box is not what I consider to be portable, even though it takes batteries and I had only intended it to be used in my hotel room.

One other thing I remembered from reading all of these reviews is about how modern CD's are too compressed. I remember when I first started to rip my entire CD collection 8 years ago and asked another music nut about the bit rate. His advice was to use 128 kbps because very few ears could detect the 320 kbps ripped files that take up 2.5 times as much storage space. So with that in mind, I chose to rip one very long song (Awaken by Yes) at 320 kbps and compare it to my version that I previously ripped at 128 kbps. I tested both versions under each pair of my old and new Sony MDR headphones and I could not tell the difference. However, both versions detected a ""mistake"" left in during the first two minutes, which sounded like someone dropped a silver dime during recording it and they just could not remove it. Under regular speakers, this cannot be heard, but this shows how a great pair of headphones can let one hear things in a song that were never heard before. Again, I thank those highly ranked positive reviews for reminding me of this.

So what do I think about the few complaints on compression rates for MP3 files now? This is nothing more than a pathetic excuse to give bad reviews to new music releases and brag to fellow music fans that they have several thousand dollars worth of equipment. For studio work, the higher bit rate is probably needed, but for the average listener, 128 kbps should be sufficient. Some of those bad music reviews also tell me that some people are just too lazy to adjust the volume knobs.

Update on June 16, 2016: Oops, I forgot to mention comfort, so I tested them in my back yard this evening hooked up to my iPod Classic. Talk about concert sound that one can take with them anywhere and give the neighbors no reason whatsoever to call the police on you! I wore them for several hours and the only discomfort was from the bug bites under an approaching full moon. I wore protective clothing, but the little buggers still bit all over my hands. If that was my only discomfort, then these headphones feel like they are not even on your head. Incredible!!!! They also did not drain the battery of my iPod as I had initially feared. The cost of all the songs on this iPod make the cost of these GREAT headphones seem like nothing at all. As for outside sounds venturing in, only during very quiet passages in the long musical epics did I hear anything at all from my home AC unit. As for anyone being annoyed by sound leakage from these headphones, I seriously doubt it (just tell them to get a life!)",I never thought any pair of headphones could top my old Sony MDR-V600's until now!

Indeed, the MDR7506 is the ""go to"" headphones for industry. Period. They are the original Xerox machines of photocopying, they are the Kleenex of facial tissue paper, they are the Listerine of mouthwashes, the Corn Flakes of breakfast cereal, the KDKA of AM radio stations. Often copied, rarely duplicated, the MDR7506 stand as testament to the idea that good design trumps all even in this day of breakneck technological innovation. Released some nearly 3 decades ago, they remain the industry standard.

Before I continuing, let's get old thing out of the way (if only because it seems to be repeated in so many headphone reviews and provides a point of context for a younger generation or two). Yes, these headphones sound better, are better built, last longer, and will give you a more enjoyable music listening experience than will ""Beats / Monster Beats / Apple Beats / Beats by Dre""...oh, and they cost much less.

To my own ears, the 7506 provides that ""motion thump"" that is necessary to bring modern pop, rock, EDM, and other bass-heavy genres come to life. It's not overly bass-y and certainly not distorting or loose. It's tight, rich without being too brassy, and balances the wide field into the highs naturally and with as flat a response as you're likely to hear without a laboratory.

As a synthesizer programmer, lifelong player, sound designer, and enthusiast, I always describe the 7506 this way: They are the only cans that can accurately reproduce an open cutoff saw or supersaw. Period. Everything else is relative to the 7506 cans. For those who aren't synth heads, let me put that in English: ""You hear EVERYTHING""... and in the proper ratios and levels. Good or bad, there's no kimono to lift with filters with these cans, the sound is naked and true. If you can't mix with these, then give up on mixing even with open air monitors, you'll never hear well enough to get your room acoustics right.

Then there's the band that goes over the top of your head: it's hard, has very little give to it, and overall feels terrible.

But after the comfort problems, sound quality is the biggest let-down here. The highs are very harsh, with vocals and certain types of music actually hurting my ears at even medium volume levels. Exaggerates sibilance and sounds a bit like listening through a tin can. The bass is almost non-existent, especially if you loosen the fit a little bit. The mids are rather decent, but that's about the only thing that I can say I enjoy about the sound.",Sound quality is the biggest let-down here.

I decided to buy a pair of these headphones because I started a podcast and I needed recording headphones to go with my Blue Yeti. They do work for this purpose-- they isolate sound. However, there is a sort of electronic buzzing that almost always seems to be there when I'm recording, when I'm listening to music, even when they're just plugged into my computer. I bought the first pair refurbished and I thought that the fact that they were refurbished was the problem, so I sent them back and brought a new pair. I tried plugging them into my laptop, and they're much better, but unfortunately they still have a little bit of white noise that you can hear when listening to music or audiobooks..

I'm not exactly sure what the issue is. I know these are supposed to be high quality recording headphones. I'm happy to get advice from those who know what they're doing because I'd love to love these headphones.

Otherwise, the headphones do ok as recording headphones. They fit nicely and are comfortable-- I have a small head so I find a lot of headphones to be uncomfortable. So if you're a podcaster, they'll work for their intended purpose, but you may need something else to listen to music.",Headphones intermittent electronic buzzing/white noise (and I've tried two different pairs)

As a musician and general music nerd, I have pretty high standards, and I'm positive you can not do better for the money than these things. Not only that, but they're actually so good that while yes, you can do DIFFERENT, and you CAN do better, you can't do MUCH better. I can't remember the last time I was in a studio that did not have a pair of these sitting around for reference, and I've been in studios with some people who have worked on some pretty big things. Everyone in the industry knows them. That being said, they have a very specific sound profile. I am the kind of person who likes to explore different sound profiles in different pairs of headphones. I think generally speaking these will cater to a lot of people, but probably not everyone.

The pros:

-Very comfortable. Can wear these for pretty much all day without getting uncomfortable.
-Great, crisp sound that will allow you to hear intricacies especially in the upper mids
-Amazing price for the quality
-Will last you your entire life if you don't abuse them

The cons:

-Those foam pads will deteriorate with time. You'll need to replace them. I guess it depends on use, but in my case it took around 4-5 years (and the pads are a very cheap replacement). Actually, they'll deteriorate even if you do not use them.. just the name of the game. Not a huge deal.
-Because the sound is focused very much on mids, trebles, and generally higher frequencies, it can get a little fatiguing. I haven't had many issues with this, but if you are using these for a while and switch to another set of ""mellower"" headphones you will notice it.

As for the sound profile, as mentioned they're generally focused on higher frequencies, but the bass is still very tight and perfectly audible. I listen to literally every kind of music and they are applicable across the board, though certainly shine with rock music.

I own a bunch of nice headphones that I've paid more for than these, but if I had to own one pair I think these would be the ones (although my new Beyerdynamic DT 770s are giving them a run for their money). One pair to rule them all. Muahahahaha.

If your looking for quality sound at a affordable price, this is your best option. It's funny, I've had these for 5 years now and decided to try ""newer"" headphones to compare them to these and the differences are minimal if non existent. I tried the Bose, B&W, and Beats. The B&W were the closest, then the Bose. BUT were great but nothing worth the extra $, and the beats were trash (can't believe people spend so much money on junk). Reliability = 100% These are like the civic's or camry's of the car industry, they just keep working (and I'm rough on them!) Another awesome reason to buy these is that parts are replaceable. For example, about a year ago I had bent the jack by dropping my laptop on the floor landing on the jack that was plugged in (derp). But because Sony makes a replacement coil, I was able to easily install a new one! Anyways, I'm not going to go into technical detail with this review because there are several of those already, I'm only posting this to share with you good people the awesomeness of these headphones.

THE ONLY CON: The only con that everyone has already explained are the ear pads. Mine lasted about 4 years before starting to flake, now in there 5th year they are really looking sad. Though there is good news, Amazon sells Beyerdynamic replacement ear pads that won't deteriorate because of its hybrid construction, you can find them here: www.amazon.com/Beyerdynamic-EDT250V-Headphone-Pads-Black/dp/B0016MF7W2",5 Years and Counting!

Comfortable, great sounding headphones are a must and for those in the recording industry, the MDR7506's are industry standard for a reason. These headphones do a great job of not bleeding through the sensitive microphone my husband uses. Bleeding click tracks are a huge problem in some studios, but the MDR7506's really keep the loud click noises away from the microphone. The pads go around your ears, which is a much more comfortable way of wearing the headphones than the ones that go on your ears. He gets headaches if they don't go around your ears. Also, the earpieces are a little bit tilted, which seems to give the headphones a really fantastic fit. The only complaint is that the cable is set up like a spring. That's nice for cable management, but it means there's a bit of pull if you need some length out of the cable.

Any headphones are very subjective, but I found the highs very harsh and I found them not very balanced, lacking mids. I ended up with another pair that I liked better. Again it's subjective. The first pair I got sounded horrible. My recommendation is to try a few different headphones to test them out and choose the ones that sound best and work best for your needs. Also, my old Sony headphones were made in Japan, now they're made in Thailand, so I'm sure there are quality differences. The headphones are okay, so that is why I gave them 3 stars.

That line didn't resonate nor hold much meaning for me until I put these headphones on and listened to music at home for what felt like the first time in my life. No joke. I didn't know Bass had actual character to it. Before these headphones, Bass served as a heavy muddled effect to rule as overlord over the mids,highs,and lows. With these Sony headphones, Bass sounds like an actual live instrument complementing the musical gang as a family working hand in hand. Each instrument from vocals, to guitar, to bass and percussion have a vibrant LIVING element to them. I love the long stretchable cord as I have a habit of walking away from the computer too often on a short leash (ouch).

Was this review helpful to you?, January 3 2015,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Background: I got tired of all the mixed reviews of best “closed, around-ear” headphones fewer than $200, so I got 7 of the top recommended brands/models and decided for myself (luckily, they had a 15 – 30 day trial period). I needed a “closed” headphone so NO sound (for listening enjoyment only) could be heard by people around me. I’m somewhat of an audiophile and an ex-band director…so perfect sound is important to me (note: I listen to concert band, jazz, orchestral movie soundtracks, choral, classical, and even some pop/rock/country). My “control” for testing was music from my iTunes Library (apple Lossless files) on my laptop with advanced soundcard. I wanted to spend fewer than $200. Here are the following results:

1st place: Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. (score: 90/100 points) Pros –It does a variety of tasks really good with no real weakness at anything. It’s best for listening enjoyment…not professional studio monitoring as advertised. It has very warm sounding vocals, a balanced sound (with very slight favor to lower mid range & upper bass), and comfortable (loose) fit on my ears/head. It handles thick, polyphonic music passages with ease without distortion…while keeping the main melody/vocals volume and tone quality still cutting through with warmth. The sound feels like you’re in a very large professional concert hall! People with large heads will appreciate the fit of these comfortable headphones. Cons- Although you have the feel of being in a large concert hall, the distance to the stage seems a bit too far away…perhaps the 30th row. These headphones are the highest price of those tested (around $170…ouch… but, it comes with 3 different chords to the headphones/ and bag).

2nd Place: Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. (score: 88/100 points) Pros – Very balanced sound throughout the registers…no favors to any register!!! It can be used for both studio monitoring or listening enjoyment. The extra-deep bass extension can be “felt” during musical passages…nice. This Headphone has as a very “live” performance sound…like you’re on the 5th row during a concert. Best headphones for listening enjoyment under $100 (only $99!). Cons – The tone of melody/vocals sound a bit thin or “electric” at times during thick/polyphonic textures in musical passages…especially male tenors and trumpet/alto sax solos. Although you feel like you’re on the 5th row during a concert, it sounds like you’re in a small auditorium rather than a concert hall. Fit may a bit tiring after a long period (good clamping pressure).

3rd Place: Sony MDR-7506. (85/100points) Pros - These headphones must be the best at studio monitoring…or when you need to be critical and “dissect” music…every detail can be heard throughout every register (you can even hear faults in the recording you never wanted to hear before). The sound feels like you’re in a closed room with a live band)...not a performance concert hall/auditorium (there is a lack of reverb) good for recording professionals (and only $86!). Very clean and articulate at the “attacks” of instrument/vocal notes (not much sustain with these headphones) throughout all of the registers. Cons – Very bright sound…taxing to the ears after a while (Treble is very pronounced). Must use an equalizer to add bass/warmth to the sound for listening enjoyment...Yes it’s a pain, but then they do sound good after those adjustments.

4th Place: Bose SoundTrue, Around Ear. (80/100 points) Pros – These headphones have a good, balanced sound throughout the registers (Note: you will have to turn up the volume on these headphones). They are very comfortable and “light” on the head….you almost forget you have the headphones on. Cons – Sound is very “speaker” sounding...like you’re at a concert to hear your favorite band in the 50th row, but the stage is full of speakers playing CD recordings of your favorite band; therefore, there is just too much distance from you to the stage. Price is too much for this headphone ($150).

5th Place: Koss SP540. (75/100 points) Pros – These headphones are very cool looking, and somewhat comfortable (I have normal/smaller ears). The sound is not balanced…favors the bass/mids…good for rock/rap lovers. Mids and treble sounds have been somewhat muffled…so the bass and lower mids “boom” throughout your music. Cons – Feels like you’re sitting behind the band at a concert. Not worth the $150 price tag. Note: I have a Koss 35 Pro A and love the sound of these headphones (but they are half-open designed, not fully closed) and I hoped these sp540 models could compete…disappointed.

6th Place: JBL J88a. (68/100 points) Pros – These headphones are the most comfortable…no competition in this department! Bass is very heavy….rap/rock lovers will appreciate these headphones. Cons – The mids and trebles have been purposely muffled…almost non-existent...feels like you’re sitting behind the band during a concert (with cotton in your ears). Price is good ($99), but come on…try to have some balance throughout the registers.

7th place: Grado SR125. (65/100 points) Note: This is the headphone I’ve had for a couple years...and why I started a search for a better headphone. They are not what I needed because they are “open designed”…thus, people around you can hear them. Pros – Very crisp and clear mids and trebles…you can hear every detail. Comfortable fit. Cons – no bass what-so-ever…thus, bright and airy sound only. It feels like you’re sitting on the 75th row at a concert! These headphones are rather expensive (around $120 bucks when I bought them 2 years ago…$150 today).",HEADPHONE SHOOT-OUT !!!

They sound natural with out coloration. A clean rich full sound that's not basey or tinny. They fold up compactly and are versitle able to be used either with 1/4"" TRS or 3.5 headphone plugs. The only weak aspect to them is the rim or edge of the ear cusion - the vinyl cover - breaks up quickly and easily where in no time the vinyl coating flakes off and the cloth backing breaks apart. There are third party terry cloth covers sold for these though which extends the life of the ear pads. Otherwise, replacement earpads are fairly cheap and readily available. I currently own many sets and have owned many over the years. One thing to watch out for, like so many of the popular items out there the counterfeits are almost more plentiful than the authentics.

Then our kitten bit through the cable, so im like ok, its a sign. Clicked 'checkout' and so far have not been disappointed!
Recieved them and, just as a precaution, almost immediately turned on a super long video of ""pink noise"" on medium-low volume to try a burn-in. I made the mistake with my Sennheisers of just plugging them into my ipod and having the first song start off loud and with an abrupt snare crack, so that kinda hurt em right off the bat.
But connected to an ipod is where I feel other reviews on these babies kind of combine, i.e, the ""good, solid bass"" vs ""meticulously analyzing your music"". Leaving the EQ settings on 'rock' gives a great punchiness that people like to compare to say, Beats - except garunteed these Sony's handle it much better. Everything is clean and clear, with the soundscape of a great studio recording session - tight ambience with very present instruments. Switch the EQ to 'flat', and you really hear everything with an almost perfect balance - mids, highs and lows. The sound stage widens, but everything is still very nicely present. You lose the puncy bass, but in an ideal mix the bass shouldn't be overpowering anyway. In my opinion, the flat EQ on any device is definitely the optimal setting to get the full benefit of these headphones - save adding a little bass for movies.
The package warns that ""at higher listening levels, outside sounds may be reduced"". They weren't kidding! Listening at a mere comfortable level reduced my girlfriend to nothing but some distant resonance. Can't wait to try them out in the field or recording my drum covers! I feel like I'd have a much more solid playing session when able to hear a more dynamic mix of the other instruments. That being said, I keep listening to all my favorite songs through these, expecting to truely experience the music for the first time or rediscover it, as some have described. I'm not sure it's that big a jump. I mean from earbuds of anykind, I don't doubt that it is a new experience. But even if you've used any sort of high-end headphones, the difference in quality will be noticable, but not astronomical.

But I didnt just buy these to plug into an ipod. I'm a musician and intermediate-level film-maker and was looking for sound dampening headphones for recording audio as well. I unfortunately havent hsd a chance to try them out in either scenario yet, but i also havent had them very long. My only concern with them is when editing, that the flat sound will result in over-processing of the sound files dynamic range, resulting in way too much bass. I recently had my first film to be shown at a film festival and it sounded very much in the theater as it did on my Sennheisers that had higher highs and lower lows. I guess in a theater scenario, too much bass or high end isn't really a deal breaker, but it'll take some getting used to to edit with a flatter-sounding audio monitor. Which I guess in the end is really a good thing; because if they sound good through something virtually unprocessed, itll sound great on most anything!
In the end, a great buy and an all-around amazing set of headphones!","Harmonically versitile, with great external sound dampening!"

These are studio headphones, designed for recording and production, meaning they have a very true, neutral sound. Most of the major, popular brands 'color' their headphones with extra bass, or a very high/low sound. This is unacceptable for the styles of music I enjoy. I listen to primarily mathcore/deathcore/djent and various other forms of eclectic metal. Most headphones muddle the sound of the complexity and do a piss poor job of playing vocals and any synth/keyboards.

If you listen to any music that has any form of complexity beyond mindless repetitive thumping, then take your Beats and throw them in the trash and buy these.

My one main complaint over previous models of this headphone by Sony, is the exposed wires coming from either side, as you can see in the picture. These wires are very thin, and easy to pull out. Very easy to snag a finger or something into the small loop, and boom, ruined. Of course, they were designed for studios, not working out, like I was using them for. So be mindful of what you intend on using them for.

So many things to love about this instrument; the sound quality of the built-in speakers is NOT one of them, which was a big disappointment to me when I purchased the instrument. The point of a high-end digital like the Clavinova is that the quality of its sound recording should sound very close to an acoustic piano, but the built-in speakers make it sound tinny and fake--it sounds like the digital it actually is. I really wanted a nice set of headphones that would allow me to truly hear the professional sound of the instrument the way it was meant to be heard - clear trebles, rich bass, etc. I chose this set after reading many reviews and felt it would best fit my needs - it did. Thanks to these headphones, my piano sounds so much like an acoustic, you can barely tell the difference. This product really allows me to enjoy my instrument, so that made me pretty happy.

This set is very, VERY comfortable. I have a rather big head and it fits snugly without being too tight. It never gives me a headache. The pads are soft and large enough to cover my ears easily-actually, they will cover my ears and a smallish set of drop earrings, too. The cord is pretty long, so it doesn't get in my way when I play, which is very important. The cord is also weighty enough that gravity prevents it from bouncing around while you are moving, while not so heavy that it would drag the headphones down. The set folds up neatly and easily, so it is easy to fit in a suitcase and not worry overmuch about it being broken during transit. The set also comes with a 1/4"" jack. I found the price to be reasonable for the very good quality of the product.

It does not have noise-canceling technology, but does a good job blocking out sound, which is so wonderful because it lets me concentrate on playing without being distracted by all the other things constantly going on in the house. I don't listen to any other music with it, but I imagine it would be similarly useful if you want to listen to music without being disturbed. I have a very loud window-unit air conditioner in the same room as my piano, but I can barely hear it with the headphones on. I also don't hear my roommate watching TV or talking on the phone in the next room. If something blew up or someone was screaming bloody murder in the next room, I would be able to hear that and respond to an emergency; otherwise, I don't hear much in the way of external noise.

Would I purchase again? Yes, if mine were worn out, I would happily replace them with the same product.
Would I recommend to a friend? Yes.
Did I receive a promotional credit on this item? No.",Purchased for use with my digital piano

The clarity is absolutley amazing!! Seriously crazy good sound. Highly recommend buying the wicked cushions ear pads too. Makes these headphones over the top comfortable!!! Also if using with a samsung note 5 you will need the fospower 3.5mm female to 3.5mm male adapter to work. The headphones come with a 3 pole (2 ring/TRS) jack. The samsung note 5 only recognizes the 4 pole (3 ring/TRRS). I tried plugging them directly in and they didn't work at all. Plugged in with adapter works awesome!!

I doubt very much that the response really is as flat as people claim though. They are VERY bright-sounding. That being said, these are designed to be used as studio monitors, not ""hi-fi"" headphones, and in their intended use (to monitor sound) they do a decent job. I find the sound too bright and fatiguing for use as ""hi-fi"" headphones though. My old Sennheisers are much better suited to that job, but then again they cost about 5 times the price of the Sony MDR-7506. These are 100 times better than the ""other"" studio favourite (the Beyer DT100) which are also supposed to be flat-response but instead just sound absolutely horrendous in every respect! The fragile material used on the earpads is a strange choice for a model which is supposed to stand up to professional use too.

Bose seemed completely uninterested in fixing them and I'm not about to hand them another $300 for new headphones. These are a lot cheaper so I decided to give them a try. Overall I prefer them to the ones they replaced.

Pros: Sound quality is a lot better with these, largely thanks to a better low-end response. They're a lot more comfortable to wear all day. There's no active noise cancelling, but once they're over your ears they kind of naturally seal out all sound anyway. No noise bleed at regular listening levels.

Cons: The cord is really heavy and non-removable, so it can take some time to get used to the lopsided feeling. I would have liked to unplug it and replace it with a smaller lighter one. Also, these are somewhat collapsible but not in a way that feels secure or makes them safe for stuffing in a bag like the QC25 did.",Excellent headphones

Happy wife...you know the saying. So I remember how back in the day when I lived for music, even though I had these great speakers, I could never wait to put any new music through my headphones. This was my answer! Research the heck out of everything in my budget and settled on 225i Grados. After almost a year with them I'm listening less and enjoying music less than ever. Then I realize I'm just not crazy about the sound. Not wanting to spend an arm and leg to find out, and seeing how the Sony's were in contention in the first place, why not? I could always return them.
Not in your life!! THIS is what I was missing! I seriously cannot believe how these just trounced the Grados. I pulled out my best recorded cd, went back and forth between the phones. The Sony's were clear, concise, alive. I can only describe the Grado's as muddy.....sounds blending into one another. I never would have noticed it without hearing the Sony's.
If you love the sounds, there is no reason to get anything else or pay more. I paid almost 3 times the cost of the Sony for the 225i Grados, and it's not even close. Not even.",I'm a believer.

Was this review helpful to you?, December 24 2015,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these primarily for PC gaming, which usually includes listening to music. They sound as good as headphones can probably sound. Never been impressed with headphone sound quality compared to the effect real speakers have. I have them plugged into the 1/4"" headphone jack on my Onkyo TX-SR70 receiver, which receives audio from my PC via optical cable. I like my bass to have more kick and ""oomph"" to it so I used an EQ/preamp software to adjust accordingly. These headphones are capable of producing a satisfying amount/volume of low end bass, without much distortion. And as some reviewers have noted, they have excellent ""punch"" with transients. An old song I had listened to many times suddenly surprised me with a sudden bass impact I never heard before. (Keep in mind I'm using a preamp to improve dynamic range, the only thing holding me back before was my inferior headphones..so don't expect this just plugging them into an ""ipod"".)

The one thing I appreciate the most is the cord. My old cheap headphones ($30) have the typical straight cord, which is constantly finding its way into the crevices of my chair's caster wheels. The coiled cord with these is just the right length too, so that they reach my bed while sleeping at night.

These headphones do a decent job at reducing external noise. Previously I had ""on ear"" headphones which pretty much acted like open back headphones, so that there was no sound isolation, and everyone could easily hear what I was listening to. The closed back design also has the added bonus of improving sound isolation the greater the SPL. Which is great for me, so that I don't have to hear my loud roommate. The only caveat is that when you take the headphones off while playing loud music/sound, they're basically like small speakers and can be heard through walls/doors, or anyone nearby.

The frequency response definitely sounds flat, which makes a lot of songs sound rather lifeless. Which is exactly how headphones should be- neutral and accurate.

Was this review helpful to you?, April 13 2014,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waffled back and forth about whether to order these. Added them to my cart, deleted them, added them, deleted them and then finally decided to pull the trigger and WOW, I'm glad I did !! These are spectacular !!!

Design/Comfort: 4 out of 5 stars---The MDR7506 headphone have a very basic, non-assuming, and somewhat retro look to them but don't let that stop you from ordering them. The clamping force is perfect. Not to tight, not to loose. Just right. They are very comfortable. I can barely feel them on my head. The earcups are comfortable but do not completely cover your ears. They are about the same size as my ears and feel like a large, on ear style. This is the only bad thing I would say about the design/comfort but its really not bad. They are very comfortable, they just don't completely engulf your ears like most traditional circumaural headphones. These are closed back headphones with minimal leakage.

Build quality: 4 out of 5 stars--Construction is of plastic and metal. The earcups are plastic but feel very sturdy. The headband is metal (or at least the adjusting band is). There is no padding on the top of the headband but don't be concerned by this because the headband only makes an ever so slight contact with the top of your head and is very comfortable. The earcups have some play in them to allow for a perfect seal but they do not rotate to lie flat. They fold up into the headband for carrying and the headphones can get very small when folded to make them very portable. Overall, the MDR7506 feels very sturdy and I expect it will last for years.

Sound quality: 5 out of 5 stars --It is no wonder that the MDR7506 (and its older brother, the MDR-V6) is the industry standard for monitoring/reference headphones in the recording industry. This fact, in itself, should tell you all you need to know. But, if you want to know about how they sound, the best word I can use is B-A-L-A-N-C-E-D. This is a very neutral pair of headphones. Lows are very tight and warm but do not bleed over into the mids. Mids are very crisp and right where they should be, Not to forward and not diminished by the lows. Vocals (which reside in the mid range) are as near perfect as I think you will find. And finally, the highs are pristine. No fatigue in the highs and no simbilance. There is absolutely no harshness to the highs. Highs arrive right on time and in the correct balance to the rest of the spectrum. Despite the closed back, the soundstage is excellent and sounds much larger than most closed back headphones.

What these phones are not:
--They are not a fashion statement.
--They do not have overpaid celebrity endorsements behind them.
--They are not colored headphones with overbloated, muddy bass. (if you are a basshead, its probably best that you move on)

However, let me give you a WARNING:
These are a suburbly accurate pair of headphones that are very revealing and unforgiving. Don't blame the headphones if the audio you are listening to doesn't sound good. If the song sounds bad, it is most likely a POOR recording. A bad quality recording will still sound bad with these headphones and will probably sound even worse than it does thru your apple ibuds. These headphones accurately reproduce the sound given them. A very high quality recording will sound spectacular, a bad quality recording will sound like crap. Upgrade your quality of recordings before you blame the headphones.

Now for the cons, which are minimal:
1) The cord is coiled, non-detachable and it is heavy. This may be a distraction to some and it makes them a little inconvenient to carry around. I would like to see Sony offer them with a detachable cord that could be swapped out for a straight cable.
2) The earcups are not as big as traditional circumaural headphones. If it would not change the sound quality, I would like to have a little larger earcups that completely cover my ears.
3) There are wires that are exposed on either side of the earcups. Not really a big deal but by being exposed like they are, I would think that they would be prone to getting snagged on things which may cause damage to the headphones.
4) The earcups do not rotate to lie flat. May not be a deal breaker for most folks but would be a nice feature.
5) From what I understand, the ear cushions wear quickly and need replacing frequently. Would like to see the ear cushions made of a little more durable materials.",Perfectly Balanced--This is a nice pair of headphones

I have only ever owned these and AKG k240's, also awesome, but tried and used many others. The AKG's are incredibly comfortable, as they have much bigger earcups and a suspension system. The Sony's can be stretched to make them more comfortable (The very top band can be firmly stretched wider, worked for me), but there is no comparison comfortwise,the AKGs are like pillows. For 4 hour DJ gigs, these Sony's are comfortable enough. For long studio sessions, I go with the AKG's, especially when I'm tracking instruments (I play guitar, bass and sing as well), I forget I'm wearing them. As for audio quality, the Sony's have more presence and tighter response (i.e. mids and highs), the AKG's are a little less detailed- that doesn't mean the Sony's sound thin though, not at all, they seem equal in low frequency response to me. If I had to say which was more ""accurate"" I'd say the Sony's due to the extra crispness and detail (seems like a flatter frequency response overall to me), but that's pretty subjective, unless people are going to listen to your music on the same speakers or headphones you created it on, there will be ""inaccuracy."" Hence my desire not to go too crazy with my work headphones, I've never spent over $100. I would only go more expensive for pleasure headphones, with noise cancelling, etc. The main thing is, learn what your headphones/speakers sound like, and mix accordingly. The Sony's have a closed design, so they're well suited to DJing, but I still need an external amp to boost the signal in a cranking DJ setting (I always use earplugs too, which fit in these cans no problem. In-ear monitoring is honestly better, but the problem is people keep bugging you when you're DJing with in-ears, when you use headphones it's easier to ignore people interrupting you since they can see you're working). I use a Topping NX1 portable headphone amp, again not ""obsessive audiophile approved"" but very good value. If you're looking for absurd comfort and good sound, go with AKG k240's, they're the same price, at least the older gold AKG's. If you want tightest response and closed headphones, go with the Sony's. Can't really mess up too badly either way.","Really good, read for comparison with AKG k240"

Needless to say i am not dissappointed. I listen to a lot of Trance and house music sometimes techno and the crystal clear audio with the lows mids and highs sounds like listening to a higher quality track of music, however i am using premium streaming at 320k mp3. I have also tested lossless codecs and the sound is beautiful.

Bass is pretty heavy on my unit. Some people are reporting no bass but i can hear the low and high bass pretty well and it definitely has a hard boom to it however it seems this is more apparent where the artist intended it and not artificial like equalizer settings.

Older or lower quality songs you can hear sometimes the dirtyness of the track and the white noise in background but equalizing eliminates it.

Mozart and symphony sound very nice on these.

The headset is light and portable, long cord is nice as i use these at work, only complaint is the earpads can get fatiguing after a while that i do need to take a break after 2 hours or so but otherwise i even use these when laying down in bed. Quality of materials is strong and pretty flexible. Cable is nice and thick, gold strong headjack that is also thick.

These sounds great on the high end and mid range. Plenty loud, great for playing guitar with.

I played my guitar through the focusrite using the audio technica's mx50 and it sounded like poop. The headphones sound cool for listening to music in general. In fact I'd say they sound ""cooler"" than these.

I tried earphone pad replacements but couldn't stand the smell so I'm back to the pleather, which can be hot and sweaty in my humid climate. I finally bent the head bar to widen it so the pressure would not be so tight and wear it far forward, toward my forehead so the tops of my ears are not being pressed down and only the lobes get squashed. I'm female and small boned. I do not have big ears. I can't imagine how big guys could get their ears totally inside these ear cups.

The cord length is perfect for using with my laptop in bed but it stretches enough if I need to move to say, answer the phone.

I do wish the cord was replaceable. I don't like anything that makes a product potentially obsolete when just a little extra would allow for repair instead of replacement.

They're comfortable enough, but the plastic on the earpads gets sweaty after a while. Similar products usually start flaking off quickly. I bought a pair of replacement pads that have a soft suede feel to them and are much more comfortable.

If anything breaks (unlikely, but possible), the exploded parts diagram makes repair rather easy. This is also useful for disassembly.

I removed the small, metallic ball instead of sending them back to Sony under their ninety day warranty. If I had to complain about something, it would be the short Sony warranty. I know, it is probably never used on the MDR-7506, but a company with a professional product line should not, in my opinion, offer the same warranty that covers the $10 earbuds.

Just be aware that they might not be the best for simply listening to music. The stereo field is very wide which helps some music but hurts other - in some recordings in can tend to bring the right and left (usually instrument tracks) to for forefront and push the center (usually vocals) to the back. In others it brings a clarity I'd never heard before - one was the Broadway version of My Fair Lady with Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews - I started to listen a bit just to sample it with these headphones and wound up listening to the whole album. Who knew they could record with such high fidelity back then?

Another thing to remember is that the purpose of the ear cups is not to exclude outside noise, but to prevent the sound from the headset from leaking back into the microphone. They are not noise canceling.

(These were the replacements for the venerable V6s with the new 75XX designation). These are portable-friendly like the V6s, light and foldable and they have the studio sound of the 7509s. For those who have never listened to either phones, the V6s were considered the sleepers of their day and the 7509s remain studio standards, rivaling the Beyer Dynamic DT770s. Sony sold a plethora of all three of these phones.

They are clear, articulate, flat and true. No artificial fluff, no emphasis, just musical and easy to drive with their 60 ohm impedance.

They are the slightly upgraded cousin to the MDR-V6 which was introduced 1985. They have gold jacks and use a different driver that some believe is ""more closely matched"" to each other. Take that as you will.

The MDR7506s are universal thought of as the standard in audio monitors with a very flat curve and highly detailed sound.

I bought this as a replacement to my Klipsch Image One generation 1 when it became apparent that the Gen 2 versions of that series were something of a downgrade.

The differences in the two are very apparent and what you might choose honestly depends on how you want to listen. The MDR doesn't have a ""punched up"" bass like most modern headphones do; so with bass heavy tracks, they might sound lacking.

On closer inspection, I noticed that the klips use a very punchy and fluid bass line and very warm vocal range to make them sound pleasing, and don't get me wrong, they do, but you lose detail.

And the devil is in the details. The MDR's are the industry standard because you actually hear more. Modern music, in many cases that are mixed for autotuned vocals and bass bass and more bass might not sound as ""pleasing"" as it would on a different set of cans, but on older tracks, properly mixed modern tracks, and classical music, the MDRs really shine.

It really just depends on what you are looking for. Some headphones are really ""cramped"" - no highs, no lows, must be bose, some go for a ""pleasing"" sound, and some like the MDR's go for a nice, flat, detailed sound.

After about a day or two I adjusted to the new sound quality I could hear with these and ever since I have been loving it. Making music or listening to music while drawing with my tablet has never felt so great as it does now, but don't be discouraged by the price. These headphones are relatively cheap in comparison to some of the more expensive options out there, but they contain much more sound quality than the competitor brands. The MDR-7506 is very comfortable and can adjust to fit anyone from kids, teens, and adults however I don't recommend something this powerful for kids since they tend to be a little careless with listening volumes.

The uses of the MDR-7506 is more than likely for professional sound recording, but I use it for everything including sound recording now. Playing games on the PS Vita and 3DS also sound amazing with these headphones and watching movies on the computer or TV via aux is really nice.

As for the sound: It's very crisp and clear, and compared to ordinary cheap headphones they give you a much better sense of the location of each instrument in the mix -- which is great because I bought these to get started in music production. My ears almost felt a tiny bit disappointed by the lack of bass, though; It sounds a bit flat and quiet compared to what I was expecting... Perhaps that may actually be a good thing in the case of audio production and mastering, since it provides a bit of added clarity.

I personally hate the extra loops of speaker-wire extruding from the intersection of the headband and earpieces, but that's unfortunately not uncommon with monitor headphones.

As for sound quality, MDRs represent a step up from anything else in the price bracket. Keep in mind that these are not intended to be used for everyday listening at the gym etc. If you want a pair of consumer headphones that will bump up the bass and scoop the mids, grab a pair of Beats (if you're made of money) or stick with Shure/Bose. But if you need to have access to all the sonic colors in a mix--a flat EQ with plenty of character and warmth--these are going to fit the bill.

One star deducted for those ugly, clumsy loops of wire.",Lives up to the hype

Was this review helpful to you?, December 5 2016,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,4.0 out of 5 stars,While I tend to look for higher end (higher priced) audiophile stuff for my listening needs I decided to measure the reviews and order this Sony set of cans. Quick delivery...actually same day! These did live up to their other reviews. Very well balanced. Very comfortable. Very nice listening. Whether they need a break in period or not these are very nice cans for the money. The loudspeakers I currently use in my system actually deliver better sound...but when there's a conflict of listening sources in our home these phones will solve the problem. I've used more expensive cans in the past which were marginally better in terms of presentation but also cost much more. I don't need to impress anyone...just want to enjoy my music...and these cans will work well for that.,Very comfortable. Very nice listening

Yes, I honestly did and they have lasted all those years, until this year. I know, almost 30 years and they were still working? Yes, they were, that is how well Sony makes their products. One of the wires broke on the headset and my husband could no longer hear anything out of the right side. I could not find any where to repair this issue, either.

So, I went on Amazon, thank you Amazon for having great products for your customers!!! I found the same kind of Sony Headset that I have gotten my Husband about 30 years ago. It is comfortable to wear, has a 9.8 foot cord to connect to your A/V receiver or TV and plays excellent Bass when listening to music on your Stereo/Surround Sound unit and TV. My husband is one happy camper. He can't believe how good the sounds are, in the headset. He is blown away by the Bass sounds. Plus, when he has them on. . .He can NOT hear anything else, including me. LOL

I highly recommend this headset. It has all that you need to get great sound, it truly is noise-cancelling and it is a Sony who makes wonderful equipment for the Audiophile. Sony also has an excellent reputation for producing excellent products, to sell to consumers.",Excellent Headset for listening...

Was this review helpful to you?, March 3 2014,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing, especially for the price. These headphones were introduced in 1991, so surely something in this price range has come along that is better, right? What I found, nope. These are still the king. I researched several headphones before making this purchase. I narrowed it down to these (Sony MDR-7506) and the Audio Technica ATH-M50, which at the time of this review, were $50 more than the 7506. I had seen both headphones recommended numerous times. Luckily for me, 2 co-workers had the 7506 and the M5's, so I was able to AB test both.

I listened to a variety of music on each pair. Here's what I found:

Sound:
• Treble - The 7506 is a fairly bright headphone. It does tend to push the highs a tad, but I didn't mind it. I didn't find it painful to listen to, even after an extended period, and I liked the detail that it brought out in some songs. The M50 did not seem to push the highs as much, but to me, it felt a little bit more restrained and almost muffled sounding compared to the 7506. Not bad, just not as ""airy"". Overall, I preferred the 7506

• Mid-range - Both headphones did well in the mid-range, but I thought the 7506 was overall more clear.

• Bass - This is where I thought the M50 would win hands down. After many reviews that I read, I expected the 7506 to really get trounced here. This was definitely not the case. It could be just my tastes in sound, but the 7506 had very tight, detailed bass. The M50 had slightly stronger bass, but not quite as detailed as the 7506. I would guess, like many things audio, this will be largely subjective on which you prefer. I did not find that the 7506 was lacking at all in bass, though.

• Comfort - This was probably the biggest plus for the 7506 vs the M50. The M50 felt much heavier to me and squeezed my head a lot more than the 7506. The 7506 were light and much more comfortable. Complete win for the 7506. The pair I tried had the Velour ear pads, which may have helped with this. I highly recommend those as well. You can find them here: http://www.amazon.com/Beyerdynamic-Velour-Earcushions-MDR7506-Headphones/dp/B0016MF7W2

• Price - Even with the upgraded ear pads, the 7506 came in over $30 cheaper. Win for the 7506 here.

• Build quality and durability - Both sets of headphones seemed very well built and durable. I don't see any immediate issues with either pair. I've heard many people with 7506 that have owned them for 10-20 years with no issues except for needing to replace the ear pads. I also read numerous people with M50s since they launched (5 years ago) with no issues either.

Conclusion:
Not surprisingly, I ended up purchasing the 7506. They were cheaper and I liked them better all-around. I'm sure there are other people that would do the same AB test and prefer the M50, so your mileage may vary. I actually ended up purchasing 2 sets so I could have a set at work and a set at home. Highly recommend these headphones and get the Velour pads as well as they are a very worthwhile upgrade.",Oldie but a goodie

They're not quite as good as the Sony 7520's costing about 4x more, but they're a great buy for the $. I've used Sony headphones for decades in my work... they're rock solid. I can't speak to how long they'll last yet, but I'm still using another pair that's over 15 years old, so we'll see...

That being said, I do feel that in many other product areas Sony has really gone downhill. And their customer service is godawful.",Good buy for the $

I have tried so many others but found these to be clearly superior. I like to listen to theater organ music whether on CD or over the internet. This is a very difficult instrument to record and to reproduce accurately whether over speakers or using headphones. There are so many layers of sound all coming at you at once. The base is deep but subtle with a lot of differing textures instead the the loud dead thud heard in so many other genres of music. These headphones right out of the box do the best job of faithfully reproducing all of the above of any that I have tried or unfortunately purchased. They should do even better after burning in.

Listening to a live performance of a pipe organ, one is impressed by the ""airiness"" that only an organ has. It has to do with the sound being produced by wind and by the acoustics of the building in which it is housed. These headphones do an excellent job or reproducing that as well. I don't get that feeling of having something plugged in my ear or even listening to headphones. That was an unexpected bonus.

I had tried to get by with headphones in the $30-40 range but the learned the hard way that he who buys cheap, buys again. I am aware of the fragile leather ear cups from other reviews, so I will treat these gently because these are so comfortable.",These are the best! I have tried so many others but found ...

Coming from a pair of Grado SR-80i, I will point out that these sound very different. The Grados are open-backs with lends a wider soundstage and better mid-range definition. The Sony MDR-7506 are closed-back, has more top-end and extends much lower in comparison. If you love your Grados like I do, this will take a while getting used to.

I do not think comparing the Grado vs. Sony makes much sense given the difference in operating principles. Yet if someone needed a clue, I found the Grados more forgiving on bad recordings. The Sonys on the other hand will tell you as it is. If you can afford 2 pairs of headphones, I will suggest the Grado for HiFi and Music appreciation (read as enjoying) and the Sony for more critical listening where accuracy is important (monitoring).

Both a great set of headphones for the money. I do digital backups of my vinyls so the Sony sees more head time.","Not the 'Be All, End All' but Excellent for the Money"

I do, however, have one issue with them and that is that they do have a higher frequency within the 3 khz to 8 khz area which you may have to compensate for if you are looking for a true flat studio range.

Now with that said, these are great for normal music listening with a wide dynamic range.. picks up high ranges very well.

I actually have had 2 sets of these MDRs over the years just for the enjoyment of listening to music.. Very good Noise cancellation.",Very Nice Headsets.. Studio Use may Require Compensation
5,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, March 25 2017,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a nice around-the-ear set of headphones at a reasonable price. My choice came down to these and the Audio Technica ATH-M50x headphones, which cost nearly twice as much.

The sound from these is awesome. It had been probably 20+ years since I'd worn ANY over-the-ear headphones and I was instantly reminded how wonderful they are. You will notice things in your songs that you hadn't noticed before.

While these are not noise-cancelling, they do a good enough job of limiting noise. I've worn them on planes and while walking on the treadmill.

Be advised that this comes with a long cord. The product listing mentions the length of the cord, and it is accurate....and looong lol. I have it resting on the back of my neck when I'm doing dishes for example. This may be a deal-breaker for some.

They do fully cover my ears and as a result my ears get warm, especially when I'm on the treadmill. I know these aren't designed for working out, but be advised the pads will be wet with sweat if you work out wearing these. I usually just dab them with a paper tower and let them air dry.

Finally, headband is slightly uncomfortable for me at times. The padding of the band is good not great, and my shaved head probably doesn't help. Also it may be that they a little breaking in.

That may sound like a lot of complaints but to me they are minor. I like these headphones a lot and wear them often. They sound sooo much better than the earbuds I've been using for so many years. Getting these was a blast from the past, a reminder of how great music sounds through a good set of headphones.",nice with a few minor issues

Maybe you shouldn't get them; all my other headphones sound like garbage now.
Whenever someone plays music from their phone speaker, it hurts me. Once you hear these, you can never un-hear them.

These headphones sound amazing, and are totally worth the ~$80 pricetag. Nothing I have sounds better.
But they aren't very portable, and are surprisingly large on your head.
They are amazing, but leave them next to your computer, and get something else for out and about.

For sound, they get an 11/10, they aren't made to be portable, and they aren't very portable. But I still bring them to work with me whenever I remember.",Amazing sound quality to leave at your desk

Was this review helpful to you?, October 3 2015,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you've only had iPod quality earbuds and midrange speakers like me, these will change the way you listen to music. The sound is warm, clear, distinct and enveloping. With the Beyerdynamic Earpads, they feel like a fleece for your face. The long, telephone style cable is excellent for fiddling, although it is a little bit of a pain to tuck it away if you're going for a walk. Which you really shouldn't be doing anyway because this sound is so enveloping that you won't be aware of a mugger until they have your money.

I guess the looks could be a downside for some people, but I get a bigger thrill from seeing professionals use my headphones than having them be clear of text, snazzily designed and a pretty color. Also, at least for me, you can't really comfortably sling them around your neck for a minute when someone's talking to you, you have to just take them off.",Changed how I listen to music

First and foremost they are comfortable even on my large ears. It takes many hours of use before they become uncomfortable.
They sound fantastic. They aren't bass heavy or anything. They are well done. They also do a descent job with noise cancellation even though that's not a feature. You can still hear through, them though (nothing crazy though). The cord on these is nice. It is very long and springy. You won't accidentally rip your headset off with this cord. I have a sound card which really brings out the greatness in these. Of course everyone has a preference. I tune up my equalizer and theses sound perfect to me. I would recommend getting the Soundblaster ZX with a nice pair of headphones if you like to change up your settings on demand. I love the combo.",Very Well Done

After much research and seeing these have been the industry standard headphones for decades thought they would be a great place to start to start improving my sound for the videos I edit. These headphones are awesome! If you are using them for extended periods of time (several hours) then you may need to take them off from time to time to give your ears a break but can generally keep them on for quite some time which is great.,Fantastic headphones for video editing and sound producing!
