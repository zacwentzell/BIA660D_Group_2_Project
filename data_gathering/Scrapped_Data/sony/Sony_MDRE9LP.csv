This is my 4th or 5th pair of these headphones. I constantly lose or break my headphones from daily use and bringing them to the gym. I have found that these are a great cheap pair of headphones that sound good for most daily listening. They do not block out any noise, but they play music very clearly and without any distortion. They do not fall out of my ears at all while running.

The different color styles are a nice added bonus.",Best cheap pair of headphones I have ever used

Was this review helpful to you?, April 29 2017,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Prior to this, I purchased the Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds for use with a small mp3 player I use while weightlifting. They were cheap and had good enough sound that I purchased them on numerous occasions over the years as each pair eventually became destroyed by sweat. I was disappointed to find that they were discontinued and purchased these ear buds with the expectation that they would be ""pretty much the same"". They're not, they have no discernable base sound. That may be fine if your using these to watch TV through a device or prefer ""the transistor radio sound"" but for my needs they are useless. Now I suppose I'll have to dredge through many pages and reviews to find something that suits my requirements (cheap, decent volume, reasonable sound).

EDIT: Based upon another review of these earbuds with a similar perspective to mine, I purchased the Edifier H180 earbuds. A little more expensive but much better sound IMO.",Not for me

Was this review helpful to you?, July 9 2017,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these 2 years ago after my first pair from purchased from Walmart probably 5+ years ago now bit the dust. I hate the headphones that go in the ear and I dislike the look of headphones that go over the ear. These are the only headphones I'll tolerate but stores no longer sell them. Thank you amazon! These have a 90 degree angle at the headphone jack which means I don't end up with exposed wires or sound in just one ear quite so fast. The first pair lasted me all of high school although I wasn't using them daily. The next pair has lasted me 2 years of daily use in college and now are in my pocket all day everyday at work. Which is how they ended up going through the washer and dryer. Twice. 2 years later, these still work great, no exposed wires and the only reason i'm replacing them is because I was careless and after the second wash and dry cycle, the sound on the right side occasionally goes out. My bad. Today I'll be purchasing my 3rd and 4th pairs and I will continue to purchase as long as these continue to be made.",You can't go wrong with these

Was this review helpful to you?, July 16 2016,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are very person specific, they fit me perfectly fine and the sound quality was pretty good. My girlfriend however was a different story. After attempting to use the headphones multiple times I was repeatedly told that they were falling out of her ears and the bass quality isn't very good. They are also shorter than the previous Sony design which makes them ride ""strangely"" in your ear canal and make them more difficult to take out of your ear quickly without losing your grasp on them.

Coming from someone who doesn't deal with super heavy bass music I thought the headphones performed quite well for the price. However if you're looking for headphones with supreme audio and very heavy bass you might want to look elsewhere. For the price however they are well constructed and would be a good fit to any ipod, mp3 player, or even cell phone because they are compact and can go anywhere. The overall cable design is well done, and it easily provides enough length to run up your shirt or hoodie if you desire your headphones to be discreet. Are they going to be for listening to music for hours on end with supreme quality? No, probably not, but will they get the job done? Sure. If you're looking for cheap head phones with a custom color then these will probably suit you.","Not bad, Not Great"

I had a pair of these for about 4 years until I dropped them while on a run and the buds fell off entirely. They fit my ears so well that I just bought another pair. Although, a lot of my friends who have used these have often told me they don't fit their ears very well. My ears tend to not fit the general earbud size, so these fit mine very nicely. But if your ears often fit the stick-in earbuds (like the ones SkullCandy sells), these probably will not fit as well. If your ears are like mine and can't keep those earbuds in generally, these will fit nicely.",so these fit mine very nicely. But if your ears often fit the stick-in ...

I have been buying these exact ear buds for years now. The first time, I bought them because the ear buds that came with my iPod Classic died and I wanted something affordable but good quality. I bought them for about $10 at some local store and fell in love. They have a great length to them and are long lasting. Honestly, the reason why I've bought so many of these over the years isn't that they break - it's because I end up losing them on public transportation or among my collection of things. This style of headphones has lasted with me over the years and I know that the moment I lose (not break) the ones I currentlly have, I'll buy another pair.

Pros:
- Long cord that makes it easy for you to comfortably place your phone in your front or back pocket while listening to music. Also - great length for when you want to rest your phone on the treadmill stand while running.
- Durable - can handle more abuse than any product should be able to withstand.
- Decent sound quality. I'm no audiophile - I just want to be able to hear my music. It plays classical well enough to hear the flutes and it's decent for when you have a lot of bass.
- Price - for 10 bucks or less you can't go wrong.
- Portable - small headphones that are easy to keep with you everywhere.

Overall, I definitely recommend these headphones if you're looking for some decent headphones for a great price. Perfect for the person who takes public transit, runs, or just lives an active lifestyle.",My favorite headphones - hands down.

Was this review helpful to you?, January 5 2018,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After listening to a bunch of different earbuds I have, I can put them into 2 categories: Ones that sound like music, and ones that sound like music is coming out of a tin can. These, unfortunately, do not sound like music. They are ""right at the lip"" of the tin can, but, yes, still ""in"" the tin can. I bought the Sennheiser MX365's at the same time as these, and there is no comparison as to the sound quality. I have another pair of Sennheiser buds, the MX271, and both are exceptional in sound. I have a couple pairs of old walkman buds that also have a very similar sound to these Sony's. I have a cheap pair of JBL's (no model #) that sound better than the Sony's, but tonally not very well balanced and well below the quality of the Sennheisers. Do yourself a favor, and spend just a few dollars more for a whole lot better experience and buy some Sennheisers.",Mediocre sound

I'm not an audiophile and I' didn't want to pay a ton for watching movies on my phone. I'm also not someone that buys into name brands like Beats just because they're trendy. I needed something simple that wasn't made by a no-name company that may or may not exist in a year and these fit the bill. A great cheap alternative to more expensive options from a company you can at least immediately recognize so you don't have to worry about what corners were cut.

That being said, the sound quality is fine and even bordering on ""good"". The sound is about 4 stars for the price you pay. They look just like the pictures and the blue that I got are nice and subtle but bold at the same time. I hear a weird ""click"" sound every once in a while when I move around which I believe is coming from the headphones... or I'm going crazy only while wearing the earpieces. I'm waiting for them to tell me which it is. Until then, a perfect 4 star product that I'd gladly pay again to save a fortune.",Just right for the price

Was this review helpful to you?, January 8 2016,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use my phone almost exclusively via earphone, so anytime I'm around others I at least have phones with me. I use these other than a headphone as I only read the phone rather than call, etc.. In other words I don't need the ""call, dial, etc"" features typically.. only listening.
Due to low vision, my phone has a text-to-voice app which most wouldn't use, but it makes the phone accessible for me. I also follow podcasts and audio books a fair amount and don't like bothering others.

I find that these phones have the following advantages:
1. Inexpensive, so if I lose it or it breaks or whatever, it's a minor issue
2. Rugged.. I don't baby them and them. Once the part holding the pads snapped out of the hole and had to be pushed back on
3 .I LOVE the ""handing"" rather than the ""in ear"" type.. Much more comfortable over longer periods, adequately loud, yet don't block outside sound.. I don't like to ""sound bubble"" myself
4. Cord is long enough for me to comfortably put my phone in my pants and run the line up my shirt to my ears.
5. Sound is decent for an earphone of this price. At higher prices, I'd have to make a decision
I am not saying this is a perfect item, but darn good for the price. I keep a spare in case I lose or break it. I definitely would buy it again.","Good, Inexpensive, ""out-of-ear"".. what else?"
9,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, July 29 2015,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This will be a first impression review of 3 Sony earbuds bought at the same time:
*** MDRE9LP (the Ipod type that only sits inside the outer part of the ear)
**** MDR-EX37B (black body insertion type)
***** MDR-EX25LP (tiny unit that goes entirely into the ear)

All arrived in the typical over-engineered packaging that you can see that the designer is the only one that knows how to open without destroying the packaging. I've yet to figure out why.

Background:
My wife uses earbuds all day, home or work. Connecting to her BLU Selfie phone, her HP Laptop, her Toshiba Chromebook and her various Samsung tablets. She goes through them quickly, but we've had bad results from buying cheap buds, especially the Panasonic RPHJE120 line, which we bought 5 different colors and are all in a drawer because they don't align easily in the ear and have low output volume and very low bass... unacceptable even though they are Amazon's #1 Best Seller. She prefered to tape together some of her other broken earbuds and limp along with those instead. Her favorites to date have been the nice earbuds that came with her BLU phone and some very old ones that came with an Ipod she seldom uses anymore, but both of those are held together with scotch tape and come apart easily.

Soooo, I decided to buy one each of some Sony units to see which she liked. We both tested each using the same song at the same volume out of the phone.

She likes the EX37B ones the best (first quick use). These were priced at $13.99 and are the standard kind of L configuration. I like that they have a rugged appearance and a very good stress relief so the wires are not so likely to get damaged when she yanks them out or they get snagged on something as she rushes around while using them. To me (refined pitch perfect audiophile ears), they are a little distorted and loud, but have tremendous bass response.

Second she liked the tiny EX25LP. THEY WERE MY FAVORITE BY FAR! These were priced $14.99 and are little egg-like things that fall completely in the ear with only the thin wire coming out. My concern with these was that there is no stress relief for the wires at all, but upon trying them, we both remarked how easily they slide exactly into the right place in our ears, no alignment needed and they come out VERY easy... but do not FALL out on their own. They fit perfectly and have a very good sound, but not a huge bass note like the EX37B and our BLU phone buds.

Lastly she didn't like the MDRE9LP units that just are like little speakers that do not go into the ear canal, like so many you see and exactly like the Ipod buds she likes so much. These are hard to place properly in the ear and don't have the volume or bass quality of the other two. They are the cheaper of the trio at $8.99 and I don't see these being used unless it's a choice between those and the Panasonics.

If you want ear buds that you can take on 0 degree runs, accidentally send through the washer and dryer, travel with, crumple in your pocket, use to catch a falling phone, and generally misuse, buy these.

I buy a new pair every 2 years or so, and these are earbuds that I carry with me every single day.

In my opinion the Sony's were the worst, mostly due to the terrible bass response. Both the JVC and Panasonic buds had decent bass. In the end I liked the JVC set the best due to that and the fact they fit the best - the Panasonic ones are awkward and fall out easily.

For the record, I dislike buds that enter the ear canal. While they would probably give even better bass, I just can't do it.",There are better buds for your money

If you could do a sound comparison on these and the $10+ ones you will find subtle differences, but compared to any that cost $1, major differences, and these were only around $7! I like the depth of these, not tinny or compacted, there are definite deeps and lows in these compared to more treble as many others have. For a true audiophile, for the price and size they perform really well and are long enough to work while listening to your tunes.

""I ordered MDRE9LP/BLK Earbuds. Instead of the normal Sony packaging they came in a weird little ziplock bag kind of thing with the text ""Original high quality best accessories"".On the back is the text ""Accessories There is no best only better products. Enjoy the best quality Made in China"". No mention of Sony on the packaging they came in anywhere. There is a label stuck on the back that says Sony black MADE IN CHINA. I opened them up and there are white earbuds inside, not black. They actually look more like MDRE9LP/GRAY. However, the printing on the side is so faint you can barely even see it and the parts don't seem to have a good fit. I actually had to put reading glasses on to read the logo. Sony is usually pretty good about making sure you can see their logo on their products and I don't think they usually ship them in a bag that says Best Accessories, Original High quality.""

Like AYG, I got white headphones instead of black, they came in strange packaging, and the sound quality is poor.

This has proven very useful for times when I put on hearing protection (when mowing grass for example) or when wearing a snug fitting hat. The low price makes the purchase a no-brainer.

Edited to add 1) the plug is a right-angle design, and 2) the left ear plug has a small bump on it so that you don't have to read the printed ""L"". This info was not provided in the product description.",Very compact with very good sound quality

0,Was this review helpful to you?, January 10 2013,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm amazed by the number of positive reviews here, because I could not be more disappointed with these earbuds. Like several others, I owned and used the previous model of this product (E10LP) for years because they were both very cheap and had surprisingly good sound quality. Which is why I bought these. But I guess I should have paid more attention to the reviews beforehand, because the sound quality of these things is abysmal. Have you ever accidentally pulled your headphones partially out of the jack, and you get that really hollow sound quality, usually only coming out of one earbud? That's what these sound like. It is the most insubstantial sound I have ever gotten from a pair of headphones. As someone who usually hates the high amount of bass found in many cheap earbuds, I'm yearning for more bass here the way Oliver Twist yearns for a second helping of gruel. I can't even say ""well, I guess at least I have a backup pair"" because listening to music on these is physically discomforting. You might as well just hire a bum to shout songs through a tin can tied to a string.

Two stars for these only because they are functional, in the loosest sense of the word. Maybe you could get some use out of them listening to talk radio or something similar, but do yourself a favor, and buy a pair of E10LP's (which is what I just did before writing this review).

2,Was this review helpful to you?, May 21 2013,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an older iteration of these that worked well even after I dunked them in my morning tea. The ear bud was comfortable and small. I figured I'd upgrade and ended up being just so-so. The ear piece is pretty bulky and the sound wasn't that great. I used to take walks with these and it was okay that sounds penetrated because then I could hear what was going on around me.

One fateful afternoon, not three weeks after I purchased them, I bent over to tie my shoe and when I stood up the wire wrapped around my knee, and the bud was yanked from my ear and rather dramatically whipped around and smashed onto the floor. :(",I wouldn't buy them again

I like these for the adequate resonance in sound since I do listen to varied forms of music. I would advise to adjust your player's (phone, mp3 player, etc.) equalizer to your liking; they will be dynamic enough to adjust! Overall, if you take care of them they will make your music enjoyable till you find that other earphones (with a bigger bass response and fuller range) are appropriate to your listening experience. Sony brand knows their tech :)",On the go earbuds!

These are great headphones for a sweaty workout. I am a runner and a fitness freak. Whenever I worked out, the buds never fell out of my ears and they stayed in place.

Somehow, my blue headphones got misplaced either I threw them away by accident, they were stolen or I must have dropped it by accident somewhere. So I re-ordered new ones, and I am glad they have green ones, too. Green is my favorite color so yep! For anyone who is looking to buy headphones for a workout session to listen to your music as your run, buy these. They have a good cord length and like I said, stay in your ears.

The ones I have now, ""Gummy"" Sony black ones. The ear buds always fall out of my ears. As I am running, I have to reach out to the ear bud, as it falling out of my ears, and put it back in there. The cord length to my current ones are very short and they bother me because I like to run the cord underneath my shirt so it's a problem for me. I would not recommend the ""Gummy"" Sony earphones. Just these!

However, the sound quality for both headphones are excellent! I can't wait to get my green ones in the mail. I brought the blue ones at a K-Mart and they lasted me for two years!!",Great headphones for a sweaty workout!

I didn't need anything fancy and these are very basic, but they are comfortable and the sound is good. They are comfy enough as is, but there are also some little spongy covers included, if you prefer not to have the hard plastic right up against your skin. The cord is longer than the original ones, which has turned out to be a big help, as I tend to catch it on things. (It's nice not to have them yanked out of my ears!) Finally, the plug is L-shaped, which helps keep the plug plugged in, even when jogging, etc. I would recommend these to anyone wanting basic buds at a great price.","Good Value, Basic Buds"
7,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, November 4 2013,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed with these headphones. I've purchased several Sony MDRE10LP earbuds, and while they ended up breaking after about a year they were comfortable and reliable until then, and while some people might not like the sound quality I couldn't tell the difference. The MDRE9LP sound is noticeably tinnier, although my ears get used to that after a while and the wires for the two earbuds separate about 18"" from the earbud, significantly longer & more prone to tangling than the MDRE10LP and it doesn't have a slider to shorten it. But the reason I will not buy this model again is that the plug seems ridiculously sensitive. If the plug shifts a bit while the device it's connected to is in my pocket I get bursts of static & lower volume, which eventually turns into no volume if I don't twist or press it back. I've tried unplugging & replugging to see if it was just how I put it in, but the problem keeps recurring. I'll keep these as emergency backup headphones, but they won't be the ones I regularly use.",Significant downgrade from Sony MDRE10LP headphones

The protective covers that come with it really help and if they get dirty just wash with soap and water. The only thing I don't really like is how long the cord is.

Was this review helpful to you?, June 27 2012,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound - Well, it's nothing for an audiophile, but it's great for just about anyone else! Sound quality is crisp, smooth, no static or anything, just overall perfect. The bass isn't anything compared to iBeats but it's much better compared to Apple iPod earphones, and it's pretty good for $10.

Comparisons/Durability - 4.5 - I put these through a lot of abuse, wearing them pretty much 9-12 hours a day. This includes constant yanking out of the laptop, (they are so well-fitted in my ear, that its nearly impossible for them to yank out of my ear, thank god.), bending the wire, listening to music on-the-go (while running/walking), stepping on them, and so much more. The longest pair I had lasted about 5 months, until I accidentally dropped them in a bucket of water for hours. When I took them out, only the right side worked. The next pair I had lasted for 4 months, until my foot got caught on the wire and the left wire was disconnected from the earphone, so only the right side worked. Alongside that 2nd pair, I had purchased Skullcandy Ink'd Earbuds, which cost considerably more than these. I am not a fan of earbuds like those, and the fit was terrible regardless of which earbud size I used. The sound quality was also very poor. And alongside the Ink'd and my broken 2nd pair of Sony's, I had some JVC earphones. The sound quality was much better than Ink'd, although not as good as Sony's. Alas, the fit was rather uncomfortable. Which led me to buy yet another pair of Sony MDRE9LP Ear buds. My 3rd pair, the one I am now, is about a week old and I love them Another thing I likeabout them is how simple they look, and the colors/design of them. I've had blue, purple and now black. They are great earphones and I recommend them to anyone.

Comfortable - 5/5 - They fit great on my ears, with or without the earpads they supply.(In general, I tend to rip the earpads after a few days, but regardless of that, they are still comfy.) They have never come out so far. Regardless of how many times they've been yanked, they've always managed to stay in. It's a lightweight design and it's enough that if I don't have music playing, I'll even forget that I'm wearing them. They're not a bother and I can wear them for very long stretches at a time, the longest I've worn them being about 8-10 hours.

I recommend these to pretty much everyone, from the lightweight music listener to the diehard teenager.",Great deal for under $10

3,Was this review helpful to you?, October 4 2015,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These suck. A few years ago, I bought the Sony MDRE10LP (note the slight difference in model number) and they were the best! Now, it seems like Sony doesn't make those anymore, and this is their replacement.

This new iteration is so much worse. I'm using the former model as my basis for comparison, since both were around the same price. What I did was to listen to a song with the old ones, and then play exactly the same song but using the new pair. In comparison, the bass is non-existent and the treble is weak. Sound quality is low and lacks depth. With the switch, the music sounds like the bit rate was halved.

If someone knows of a good pair of affordable ear buds that are equivalent in quality to the former MDRE10LP, please let me know.",These suck. Not what they used to be.

If you want a pair of buds to take to the gym, go running or biking in, then these are great. When you are running or biking out in the city or outside of a gym in general, for safety reasons, you don't want earbuds that go inside your ear canal to create that ""soundproof seal"" that blocks all outside noise. If I am sitting on a subway or at home or on a treadmill then the situation is different and in-ear buds that create that seal are what I prefer over these ones.

Still have good sound even though I use them for hours every day. The occasional crackling still happens, but it goes away if wiggle them around in the jack a bit.

There are two things I really like about these headphones: 1) the type of wire casing they use. On a lot of headphones (*cough*Apple*cough*) the rubber casing disconnects/rips exposing the wires, which I HATE. These headphones are a bit more old school in that the wires are fully encased in the tight, flexible plastic-y rubber, the kind that lasts forever. 2) the type of bud. I hate the elongated rubbery buds you have to shove deep into your ear canal. They don't fit my ears well, and are uncomfortable to use if you're laying on your side. Since I usually fall asleep with my headphones in, that's a major issue for me. These ones fit a little looser and fall out occasionally, but they're much more comfortable for me.
This is my second pair of this brand of headphones. The old ones lasted almost a year-and-a-half (wearing them daily for a majority of the day), which I found very impressive. The sound in the buds grew slowly fainter until finally one of the buds gave out. If this pair lasts as long, I will be satisfied.
The only annoying thing about these is that occasionally they crackle. That's not a deal breaker for me, though.",There are two things I really like about these headphones

1,Was this review helpful to you?, August 14 2013,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe it's just the way my ears are shaped, but these are the most comfortable earbuds I've ever owned. I've easily had them in my ears for eight to ten hours at a time without any pain whatsoever. They are so comfortable, I frequently forget that I am wearing them.

While most other earbuds come with silicon padding, these don't, and that's why I love them. I absolutely despise earbud padding; I frequently eat while watching videos with my earbuds in. Earbuds with padding amplify the sounds in my head so the sounds of chewing are louder than whatever I'm listening to. Not with these. With these, you can eat whatever you want with these in and you'll never hear yourself chew.

These are definitely the best earbuds you can buy for less than $10.

Other things that are just personal preference: these don't come with a volume control and some would say that the bass isn't very strong. Both of these things make me very happy. A volume control is unnecessary, as everything I plug these earbuds into has its own volume control, and I prefer low bass so that I can actually hear what I'm listening to.

My only complaint is that the cord could stand to be a bit longer, but that's almost never an issue for me.",The only earbuds I'll ever buy

4,Was this review helpful to you?, November 18 2015,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, seeing the decent reviews of this product—and trusting the Sony brand—I thought I'd give them a shot. Mistake. I thought I was plugging them in incorrectly or something. Nope: the problem is that there is no bass response in these earbuds. I switched them back and forth between the Apple EarPods and there is NO comparison. The EarPods blow them away.

I can't wear the ""in ear"" type earphones that plug the canal (too dangerous for me to block out all external sound), so I guess I'll spend the thirty bucks for the real Apple deal. Maybe there's a similarly performing non-Apple product around the fifteen or twenty range? Anyway, do yourself a favor and skip these if you care at all about hearing the lower half of your music. If you only listen to lectures and don't care about natural sound, maybe you'll be fine.",Zero bass. I'm not kidding.

6,Was this review helpful to you?, January 10 2014,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality that can be expected of a brand like SONY. They are really great top notch cheapos. Dont spend less than about $10 for a pair of buds and dont trust other no-name companies. These wont beat say a $30 pair of SONY's but they do work the sound is good and so is the base. Good for the everyday car ride/train/ commute. But obviously if you need better quality spend more money. But for me, these are just right. Cant blast them all the way up to max or you'll get a perma static and they will start to die. So as I said, top notch cheapos but if you need real high quality .. still go for SONY (I like them) or other brand and just spend more money. But my headphones take a bit of punishment over time. Yanking by mistake or taking them off when Im on pc and dropping them to the ground, not tossing carelessly but I dont really bother to set them down with the utmost care. So these are good for runners and people who work out and they might last a few months, maybe I'll update when they go dead but I dont think itll be soon as SONY does make good quality stuff. Buy them! For $10 its good bang for the buck. I will be buying again or I might move up to buying $20 SONY's, $20 SONY's are a real safe bet in terms of bang and buck.",Great!

They are VERY clear sounding and really make the music sound good. I prefer earbuds like these because I can listen to music at low volume and still hear what's going on around me. You can't do that with those squishy in ear speakers. They could always use more bass yes, but what do you expect from such a tiny speaker. Plus you can accidentally pull on the wires more than just one time without them breaking like most of the others seem to do. Highly recommended.",Excellent sound!

When I bought these my uncle who works for a big electronics company said that earphones with a right angle cord that you plug into the hole (i dont know what it is called so dont judge me) is good because the wire wont come out when you dangle it and wrap it etc. anyway so these have that and I really like how they have different colors. The only negative thing is the covers are easy to come off but other than that there really good personally these are like the cheap version of beats although you can hear people in them if its low it still gives you that quality of music that the beats has personally to me.,There really good

These Sony's have way too much treble and little to no bass reproduction. It always amazes me the difference a good set of earbuds makes vs a not so good set. The difference is not subtle. The Panasonic's do a much better job of sound reproduction, including bass without the ear piercing treble. I was surprised because Sony usually means good (I have many Sony products that are great), but not in this case. Just get the Panasonic RP-HJE120.","All treble, no bass, limited spectrum, pass"

2,Was this review helpful to you?, December 18 2013,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first plugged them into my iPod and listened, I was taken by quick surprise. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THESE EARBUDS?

The sound quality was terrible. The song didn't sound good at all; there was no bass coming from these earbuds. This resulted in a tinny, weak sound. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I can tell the difference between my old earbuds and these (and I compared them by switching them out back and forth; noticeable difference).

I wouldn't recommend these earbuds at all. Luckily, I had ordered two different pairs of earbuds from Amazon at the same time. I think you really get what you pay for. I don't like those earbuds that stick deep into your ear, so I tend to get this less intrusive form factor. If you want to stick with SONY, I'd recommend the earbuds with the case, model No. MDR-E828LP. The case isn't necessary, but the earbuds are much better. I've bought them multiple times, and they happen to be the second pair I bought along with these bad ones here. Using those right now and I'm satisfied. It costs a bit more, but it's worth the quality in my opinion. However, if you want to stick around this price range, or you want a white-based earbud, I'd go with the JVC Gummys. They have good sound quality for this form factor, and I've used them a couple times. I don't think they last very long though, as I bought these new SONY earbuds because my JVC burnt out on the left earbud. But they're cheap, and once again, you get what you pay for. Just in the case of these SONY MDRE9LPs, it's not even worth $8.",Very Inferior Sound quality

Now that it has been over a year with my current pair it was time to get a new pair. I found that the Sony Mdr-E9Lp were the newer version of favorite earbuds, and i was expecting at least quality equal to that of the older version.

When i got the earbuds, i had nothing to complain about the packaging and product design is almost identical to the Sony Mdr-E10Lp, except the stem on the earbud itself is much shorter than its predecessor. Everything seemed fine, until i pressed play on the music with these. The sound was a disaster. There is no bass, volume of sound is dramatically decreased, sound is muffled. Even with different music and video players, there was no improvement. I was so disappointed. I don't know if i received a defective pair of earbuds or if this is what the product is.

The main issue I have with these is the design of the wires going into the ear bud. If you look at the photo below you see the wire is on a rail system, however they added a gap just big enough to make the wires to the ear buds have the ability to move up and down. Because of this mobility the wire actually creates this popping sound if you move your head up and down or side to side. At first I thought it was something wrong with the audio or maybe I had my speakers too high. I tested it and on the lowest setting pops still remained if I barely moved my head. Sound overall is pleasant nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done. I must say if I had the choice of buying these again I would on the condition they fix that gap problem.

The bad thing about these headphones is pretty much everything else. The sound quality of these is absolute garbage. There is no bass whatsoever and music sounds tinny. I've had to replace at least 5 of these before I realized I was stupid for buying them after I suffered the same issue with each pair. I originally bought these from my local Target which carries a lot of these in stock. The problem with these earbuds is that the cable connecting the earbuds and the 3.5mm jack is flimsy. All of my previous pairs of these earbuds died because the sound in one of the earbuds would just stop working effectively making this an earbud for only one of your ears. This is because over time, the cable would stretch and break a connection to one of the earbuds. I know what you're thinking, but I don't recklessly yank or pull my earbud cables either. I've been babying my last few pairs to try to make them last as long as possible, but each of them inevitably dies on me. In addition, the foam padding that is included in the packaging that would be used to cover the earbuds for comfort would always become loose and eventually fall out. To be honest, if you need a cheap set of earbuds, you could look literally anywhere else. BUT I would highly recommend that if you wanted to buy comfortable earbuds that look good and sound good too, invest in a pair of Apple earbuds. Just be careful of buying them online because there's a lot of fake ones around. I'm not an Apple fanboy but I can't deny that my Apple earbuds are pretty good sounding and comfortable too.",From experience - I can't recommend these

I tend to fall asleep every night watching something on my phone, which is a compromise I made with my partner who cannot stand having the TV on when falling asleep. This means that I have destroyed at least a dozen pairs of earbuds from just the jostling and stretching of the cord that happens over the course of a night. Without fail, I would always get a good two or three weeks of usage before they one earbud would cease working, and then another week before both earbuds were broken.

I don't even remember how I originally got these earbuds, but after a year of using them without the slightest loss in sound quality (n.b. the quality is perfectly fine for this price point, though not necessarily groundbreaking), I felt I needed to order a second set in case I ever lose them.

They're decent headphones, and at the price they're at, you don't have to worry about them to much if you lose them. They still function perfectly fine if one of the earpieces gets broken or cut off, the other side still works.

I use these when I don't want to worry about getting my expensive blue tooth headphones damaged, along with acting like a backup, so I've had several over the years and stash some at work and at home and my car. I have never had one stop working from wear and tear, only from accidental destruction.",Average quality at a below average price - Perfect for main use or as a cheap but decent backup.

These ear buds are well priced. So much so that, when the day after I received my order of two pairs and our new pup immediately chewed one pair and chewed the second pair the following day, I didn't have to hesitate to quickly buy two more pairs.

I mostly listen to talk radio and have found the sound quality to be very good. I like to listen to podcasts at night to help lull me to sleep. For this purpose, the ear buds have been very comfortable. I can lie on my side and not feel as if the bud is going to puncture my eardrum. They also remain in place and I usually find them intact in the morning, with no discomfort to my ears or ear lobe. There is no volume control attached to one of the wires, but that is not an issue for me. My only complaint is that it is hard to know which bud goes in which ear. They are labeled but the label is hard to read and if I am inserting the buds in the dark I do not know which bud is for which ear. I solved this problem by attaching a small piece of colored tape to the wire of the right ear bud. Hope they last a long time since I have found most ear buds stop working in about a year. If this happens, I would consider buying them again.",Yes I would recommend these ear buds.

They are simply terrible. I bought these to replace a set of Sony headphones that are failing. I needed earbuds that weren't the in-ear style that isolates outside noise, so I could still hear what was going on around me at work. I didn't need highclass sound, just something to listen to some tunes and make the day pass a little faster. These were a severe let down. They worked and are cheap. Those are the only positives. The earbud is too small for my ears, so it fell out constantly. I don't have large ear canals and most earbuds fit me fine. This is the first time I have ever bought a pair of headphones that didn't fit. The worst and most crucial part that these headphones epiclly fail on is the sound quality. They have zero bass. Like negative bass even. I played a song and switched headphones to see if it was in my head and it was like night and day between my old sony's and these headphones. And my old Sony's were not some high quality noise isolation headphones. They were just like these only with a billion times better sound and fit. These things have tiny sound, so you'll have to crank the volume to hear them and crank up the bass to even slightly make up for their total lack of bass response.

The previous version had a design that would let you tell left from right ear buds at a touch, which these lack. The other ones had a bass level that I previously hadn't realized was possible in a pair of ear buds, while these have yet to learn that such a thing exists.

Ultimately, I should have stuck with the E10LP and accepted the fact that I couldn't find them in black, rather than bothering with these. They work, they're well built, but ultimately I'm disappointed every time I use them because they're not the previous ones I had.

Sony knows how to make a great earbud with a healthy sound and deep bass response, yet these have neither.

The new model MDRE9LP is a disappointment for all the same reasons. Sound quality is significantly worse than the discontinued model, they don't fit my ear very well (slightly larger earpiece?), the cable is a bit more stiff and holds a kink from packaging and they are symmetric making it hard to tell right from left.

I don’t know if that’s how they all are, or if I got one that slipped by Quality Control. Either way, they pale compared to the 818/828’s “Twin Turbo” design.
Detailed version:
I bought these because my MDR-E818 wore out at the jack from daily use/abuse, and the MDR-E818 & 828's prices went from $8 at the W* store to $20-40 after they were discontinued!!! I'll break my review down into separate categories to make it easier:
- Fit: They are very lightweight, and with/without the foam cover fit my ears OK. They are not biased, so you have to look at the shaft to see which one goes into which ear which may be a challenge while in motion (on a bike, running, etc.).
- Durability I tried these out for a couple weeks, but that's not really enough time. I am returning them for the reason below...
- Sound: This is why you buy headphones. I know you'll never get the ""full, rich sound"" from ear buds due to their size and the laws of physics. That being said, they are very ""tinny"" compared to my SanDisk OEM ear buds I use while working out, and EXTREMELY tinny when compared to the MDRE818's I use daily at work which are the ones they are supposed to replace.
Bottom line: If you want cheap, decent ear buds without the rubber “way into the ear” style, and you’re not worried about super-rich sound, these are OK. If you want the best sound I’ve ever heard out of foamy style ear buds, you’ll have to pay a lot for the MDRE818/828. Why Sony had to discontinue their best ear buds is beyond me.
These are going back to Amazon today. Amazon’s purchase was easy, fast, they were packaged nicely, and their return policy is one of the best in the business. I purchased a pair of the Panasonic RPHJE120S, and they are about equal to my SanDisk OEM, which is better than these, but again they also pale next to the 818/828’s.",They are not as good as the MDRE818 or MDRE828...

My first and second headphones got misplaced in Malaysia when I went back there during last two years and last year summer. As a person who is having an active lifestyle, this earbuds headphones is crafted to perfection for hectic daily activities.
The description of this earbuds stated that its’ provide “quality audio in an ultra-lightweight, compact design with 13.5mm neodymium drivers, an open-air design and 3.5mm chord length”. This statement could not be any truer due to my own experiences wearing these earbuds while walking, running, chilling or even cooking. The good cord length make it easy for you to comfortably place your gadgets anywhere while listening to the audio, the high standard of quality audio lets you listen to the audio without any hassle and the ultra-lightweight make it easy for you to bring it anywhere. Not to mention, the price is so cheap ($10/pair) that even if you want to replace it when it is missing, you will never think twice. As for now, I have had this earbud headphone lasting for one year and it is still working great. This shows that the durability or this earbuds is really good.
This earbud headphones comes with eight colors which are black, white, purple, grey, blue, red, green and pink. The variety of color itself will let you have choices on picking up the color that suit you best. On the earbuds, you will see the letter L and R crafted, which act as an indication for you to plug in the earbuds correctly to the side of your ears. This is because, it is designed specifically to one side of the ear. If you wear it correctly on its side, you will find that the earbud headphone will stay in place and never fall out of your ears as long as you wear it.
As you can see by yourself, this earbuds headphone is a made up using classic design. The new design is either in-ear design or headset design are preferable by some people. If you are the kind of person that did not like classic design, this earbuds is not suitable for you. However, if you are the kind of person that did not care about the design of the headphone, but others such as the audio quality, length of the chord, durability or even the price, this earbud headphone might be for you.

2,Was this review helpful to you?, June 3 2013,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these ear buds since the beginning of 2013 and they are good considering their price. The reason I like these ear buds is because they are from Sony. Anytime you buy from Sony you are guaranteed a reliable product. Another nice feature of these ear buds is that they come with different colors which are a cool thing (I bought the orange ones btw). I guess the main disadvantage of these ear buds is that the bass coming from them is pretty standard and not very impressive. I know the description says “enjoy powerful bass on the go” but believe me I’ve had other ear buds and in comparison the bass is not that powerful. If you want one to go with your mp3 player I would recommend “Panasonic RP-HV152 Portable Earbud Headphones with Powerful Sound” they are a bit more expensive but worth the price. If you are price sensitive and don’t really care about the bass, get these ear buds.",Good Earbuds for the price

Unexpectedly, the very inexpensive Panasonic was much better. Here's why:

- I found these Sony earbuds uncomfortable, with an awkward fit. They were coming out of my ears easily. It's like they weren't quite made right for my ears (and maybe any ears). The Panasonic were really comfortable and fit securly.

- The sound on the Panasonic was much more clear and crisp. For the Sony earbuds, when I was watching a movie I found I was missing a lot of the words, and the sounds just weren't as full, crisp and rich as with the Panasonic.

So honestly I wouldn't recommend these earbuds, but I'd suggest the Panasonic as a good quality pair at a very, very low price.",Wasn't really thrilled

I was initially unsure about buying a 7.5$ earphone though it was from Sony. But its totally worth every penny. Its 6 months since I bought them and they've functioned superbly. They have had some rough times.. I've pulled them when they're plugged into the laptop at times, I've lifted the iPhone by the wires. I have crushed them ,slept with them on, left them in my jeans and turned them into the washer by mistake. Both but both the sides still working and they sound great. Noise cancellation- I would say 80%.. Theyre very comfortable in my ear as well..
The only reason I give a 4 is due to quality of the foampads. They are terrible and kept slipping off until they eventually tore when I was refitting them. If not for this, they are perfect.",They're excellent

I wear earbuds at work, so I can't use in-ear headphones (too hard to hear if someone has come into my office or said my name ect). They are the most comfortable earbuds I've ever used, and fit nicely in my ear without being too snug.
They are a great price, and they last super well. I buy a couple pairs every 3 years or so, usually because I've lost my old ones. Over the years I think I've had only ever had two pairs that had one headphone stop working, and I am _not_ gentle with my earbuds.
Exactly what you want in a cheap earbud, inexpensive enough that it's not painful to re-purchase, but sturdy enough that you don't have to re-purchase because they just quit working!","cheap, comfortable, durable"
1,Was this review helpful to you?, June 13 2014,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very particular about the earbuds I use. The ones with the rubber tip that goes more into your ear canal make everything sound weird to me and the round ""Gummy"" ones fall out of my ears. What I hadn't noticed in the picture before ordering is that these aren't perfectly round (nor are they banana shaped like one reviewer said) and I think that helps them stay in. At least in my ears, I can't speak for anyone else.

Another issue I have with earbuds is with the cord being long enough. If I'm listening to my mp3 player and have it on my desk at work, I can move it close enough that a shorter cord doesn't matter, but when I'm listening to my scanner and having it close to me isn't an option because I'd knock it over I want a longer cord and while the cord on the MDRE9LP could be an inch or two longer, I'm glad they're not shorter. The cord is almost the ""pefect"" length.

Overall, I'm super happy with them after using them for only ten minutes and I'm glad I bought them.",LOVE Them!!!!!!

Then I found the little spongey things that made them too big and they fell out easily, so I took them off. Now they still pop out fairly easily when I'm walking about. I'm plugging them into my bluetooth clip on so there's an abundance of wire that seems to weigh, snag and pull them out. Latest engineering has the clip hanging from a safety pin and reducing the weight from pulling on the earbuds. I think I'm missing something, but these earbuds are the same configuration of wires and plug and I think I got them because they are a foot shorter than most. All the excess wire is heavy.

90% of the time, I purchase Sony earbuds because they give you good sound at a cheap price. Unfortunately, they failed with this set. Even worse, I bought two of them.

It's hard to explain, but the sound is not as crisp on these. The bass, or lack of, is bad. Because of that, everything sounds flat. Then, that leaves me to go and mess around with the 'EQ' settings on the iPod. That's an issue, because I have more than one genre of music on the iPod. So then I have some songs that sound good and others that sound poor. With previous Sony earbuds, I never had to worry about that. The difference in sound was negligible when it jumped from one genre to another.

When I listen to music, I have to turn up the volume a little more than I usually did with my old Sony earbuds. When I listen to podcasts, I have to raise the volume quite a bit more.

I can't complain too much because of their price, but I've certainly had way better Sony earbuds for under $10. Now I have to put up with these until they break. Both of them.

I replace these earphones every year sometimes twice a year because the ear buds usually drop on the floor and the plastic piece that goes into the ear just breaks apart. I still end up buying another pair because I love these ear buds. They are very comfortable, unlike other earbuds I don't have to squeeze these earbuds into my small ears. Other ones also make my ear itchy--not sure why--these don't do that. I usually wear mines without the fabric covers that come with it. I just don't like the covers going in my ear something about it just makes my ears feel dirty.

Long story short I broke another pair of these earphones today. Mostly my fault; I'm a savage when it comes to handling these things. I'll be ordering another pair pretty soon.",As much as I love this product it keeps on breaking every couple of months

I'm an avid podcast / radio listener and a lot of times the high-end in-ear headphones make voices sound muffled.

NO BASE at all... Very weak sounding, actually. The sound is very thin, if that makes any sense. The closest thing I can compare them to is the headphones that are passed out for free, on airline flights. The really cheap, no name brands. Thus, I would certainly expect more from Sony! My previous pair were Sony MDR-E828LP, which were great. Thus, I went back to the Sony name thinking they would again offer a great product. But, these aren't near as good as their predecessor. Now, I get they are sub $10 headphones, so what do you expect? I guess something that offers semi-decent sound quality. The pros, if there are any, are in the cord length, the ear comfort, and the price. But, to me, the sound quality is so poor they are just not even worthy of purchase. I'm currently listening to the $10 Apple pair of OEM EarPod headphones & these are much better than this Sony inferior product.",which were great. Thus

- sound quality is very tinny and a bit muffled - a huge decrease in quality compared to those other models.The fidelity is what I'd expect from a free pair of earbuds that comes with a cheap phone.
- The size of the speaker is smaller, and thus, a very loose fit in the ear. If you are moving around at all, it requires constant re-adjustment.
- The wire gauge and weight of the buds is less - cheaper construction and cheaper feel.

I bought these to replace my 828's that I wear running 2-3 times per week, which finally died after 3 years, and I simply can't stand the sound quality on these new ones. Maybe worse, the fit/weight makes them pop out of my ears constantly while running. Thus begins a new search for quality earbuds...",A decrease in quality

After Sony discontinued the MDR-E828LP, my favorite inexpensive earbuds, I bought these thinking that they would be of similar quality to the MDR-E828LP. Not even close. The bass on the MDR-E828LP is great considering that they are earbuds. The bass on the MDRE9LP is practically nonexistent, and they have this hollow/boxy sound that is just not pleasant to listen to. After suffering with them for 5 months, I was able to purchase 10 sets of refurbished MDR-E828LP earbuds. These will last me for a while, hopefully long enough for Sony to actually improve on the MDR-E828LP rather than put out something vastly inferior.

The shape of my ears makes high-end, rubbery, noise-canceling ear buds a no-go; I much prefer these type of ear buds.

I was sadly very mistaken. These are horrible. Mushy, muffled sound, like having cotton in your ears. No bass. Tinny. Not to mention the shape, which is uncomfortable and chunky.

I'm sure that listening to podcasts constantly instead of loud music is better for my eardrums but it is murder on the earbuds. I have probably bought more earbuds in the last five years than five people buy in a lifetime. Since I have an Apple Nano and an iPod Touch, I was buying Apple OEM and replacement earbuds. I would buy twelve or fifteen at a time. The problem was that the earbuds might last only a week before either one side or both stopped working.

I bought a pair of these Sony earbuds a few days before Thanksgiving at a local discount store. It is now the end of January and the earbuds are still working like the day they came out of the store. And yes, they have been put through the wringer.
The sound is better than the cheaper Chinese Apple replacements, but what really seems to set these earbuds apart is the way they are constructed. The wire connections to the earbuds and the plug seem much stronger and more durable than the Apple design.

I'm sure that listening to podcasts constantly instead of loud music is better for my eardrums but it is murder on the earbuds. I have probably bought more earbuds in the last five years than five people buy in a lifetime. Since I have an Apple Nano and an iPod Touch, I was buying Apple OEM and replacement earbuds. I would buy twelve or fifteen at a time. The problem was that the earbuds might last only a week before either one side or both stopped working.

I bought a pair of these Sony earbuds a few days before Thanksgiving at a local discount store. It is now the end of January and the earbuds are still working like the day they came out of the store. And yes, they have been put through the wringer. I've snagged them on the cabinet knobs. I've lifted the iPod Touch by the wires. I have slept with them on. Both left and right are still working and they still sound great.

The sound is better than the cheaper Chinese Apple replacements, but what really seems to set these earbuds apart is the way they are constructed. The wire connections to the earbuds and the plug seem much stronger and more durable than the Apple design.

I am happy with the product. In fact, I've already ordered a supply of them from Amazon. I would definitely recommend this product.

P.S. Music sounds great on them, too! Enjoy!",Inyer Ear

They had a very tinny sound and the volume wasn't great; I had to turn the volume on my device WAY up compared to where it normally is just to get a comparable level. In addition to the terrible sound quality, the construction was very poor; the buds themselves were very light plastic, and the cord was very thin and easily tangled.

The only reason I give this product 2 stars is because they fit in my ear perfectly. They weren't too snug, but they hung in there very well, even on a run. That said, you can get ear buds with those same qualities and much better sound elsewhere.","Terrible sound/construction, great fit"

These sound terrible; don't buy them. Tinny, etc as others have said. I was going to try and return them, but in the return process it says it would cost around 5 dollars to return, and I'd only end up with 4 dollars refunded in total. So I'll avoid that and just be stuck with them I think.

Have used Sony headphones for years, same price, but old ones were much better quality. They used to curve to fit the ear and my last pair lasted literally years.

They are always available on amazon prime for less than $10 and come in a variety of colors. I am not an audiophile by any means, but I notice better quality out of these ear buds than from headphones up to 60-70$ (I have never bought headphones more expensive than that, so they make stack up better in some cases).

Since they are at such a low price, I didn't initially expect much. I am on my 4th pair now, after about 10 years of extensive use. My old pair is only showing some minor signs of usage, but they do need replaced every once and a while because they do go in your ear and they do have small holes.

I am always at my desk, for work or gaming, and I am always listening to music and these do the trick for a low price. I expect to purchase another pair again in a year or so.","Great Earbuds, well above their price"

For $8, I would recommend these to anyone. The sound quality is pretty good for the price and they've held up well, despite being yanked out of my ears multiple times for various reasons (catching the cord on a door handle, my dog pulling them out when he's excited, etc). I've had problems in the past with other headphones where one of the earbuds dies while the other one still works, and I have not had that problem with these yet. I used to buy them at Target, where they were $15, but I bought this pair in November 2014 and recently bought another pair in August 2015 because I lost the first pair. I use these with my ipod, multiple laptops, and my samsung galaxy S3 with no problems. Good quality, but if something happens to them its not a huge loss either.",Great for 8 bucks!

7,Was this review helpful to you?, December 28 2012,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All earbuds break eventually, This is due to the headphones getting old and wires growing weak. These however can last you 12-18 months before one ear stops working! i have owned other brands like panasonic and Philips that have stopped working in one ear 4-8 months time! Plus these are a bargin price and there are lots of colors.

The big reason these last so long is the headphone jack. You see the main reason they break is when the wire is bent by the headphone jack in a weird way (like wrapping it around your mp3 player) These however got the L shape jack so the wire doesn't get any stress at all! personally i think my last pair broke because i dropped my mp3 player around 5 times over the year causing the wire to catch it causing stress to it.",These headphones are the best to get trust me

1,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, September 19 2012,Sony MDRE9LP/BLK Ear Buds,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first plugged the headphones in and pressed ""play"", I literally laughed out loud at how horrible the sound quality of this product is. All kinds of music, from classical to classic rock, come out tinny and distorted, as if you were listening to a tape recording of a record, played behind a few sheets of cardboard connected to a string tied around a tin can.

The build quality is also shoddy; even the slightest brush against the cable or jack will lead to loud distortion and echoing while playing music from any kind of mp3 player or computer. This means that this item is entirely unusable while walking, let alone jogging.

This item actually makes the default iPod headphones look good in comparison. From its cheap materials (Plastic that feels weak and thin) to the lack of any features (Mic, volume control, quality audio, etc) this item is most certainly not worth even a dollar. I feel silly having paid even $7 for this piece of junk, and would definitely not purchase it again or recommend it to anyone.

DO NOT BUY.",Absolute Garbage.
