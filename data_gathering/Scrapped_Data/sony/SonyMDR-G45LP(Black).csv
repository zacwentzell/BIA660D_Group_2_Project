I used them for nearly 6 years before they finally broke. I used them in nearly every workout (6 days a week, for about 90 minutes a day). I sweat constantly, and these headphones really held up through it all. Because I sweat so much, I would clorox spray them occasionally. Honestly, I was so surprised at how long they lasted. I bought another pair because of how long the first pair lasted. They are comfortable, durable, and have decent sound quality. Honestly one of the best purchases I've made. When I ordered them from amazon they came in a timely manner, were packaged nicely, etc. Worth every cent.","They are comfortable, durable"

They can be comfortably worn around the neck too, which is nice. If you're buying these, you aren't looking for sound quality, so I'm not even considering that. They stay on your head when you excercise, can you say that about any other over the ear headphones?","For the price, it is more than enough"

I have had several pair already over the years and I would probably be a bit devastated if they stop selling them. They last a decent amount of time; mine have lasted anywhere between 1-3 years (1-1.5 on average) which is pretty good for the price and I love the sound quality. It may not have as great of sound quality as some of the expensive ones like Beats, but it's still pretty good. The only trouble with it is if you play anything louder it can be heard by others around you.

The only trouble I ever have with these is after so long the wire at the base of the aux connector will break, but it takes a while for it to happen (this is why I need to buy a new pair like this every 1-3 years). I wear mine a lot too, especially when walkin and moving around so it does get a little roughed up, but it holds up well and relaxing them at the price isn't so bad at all; I definitely get my money's worth out of them!

They are comfy too! I wear mine for hours and have little to no discomfort at all and they can be worn with glasses on without issue (usually any discomfort from wearing them is not common, minimal and goes away if they are removed for a few minutes, and the discomfort is mostly when I've worn them with glasses for long periods of times, generally after a few hours).

They're also not as easy to accidentally knock off ones head as they do have a plastic loop that sits over the war to keep them in place, and don't fall off easily either. They stay in place and out of the way.

I would recommend these for anyone who just wants a comfy pair of headphones that will stay in place, but aren't looking to break the bank on an expensive (overpriced) pair.",Always love these

These are good for workouts, sweat doesn't short them out. Good enough bass, comfortable. Cord is long enough for computer use.

Was this review helpful to you?, September 27 2016,Sony MDR-G45LP (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, there isn't very much you can complain about in the sound quality department. These get plenty loud and fairly clear with a somewhat flat frequency range that's slightly more pronounced on the high and with a little boost on the lows, but not a bassy set at all. Sound stage is great for the price range. They feel heavier than expected in the hand, but light on the head.

Biggest complaint is that there is a designed under cut that runs along the entire bottom part of the plastic band and has a slightly rough or sharp feel to it so it gets annoying and irritates the top of my ears from the plastic that's around the area that sits on your ears. I don't care how this looks, but I stuck a bit of athletic tape around that area and it's fine.",Good for the price. Annoying cut in the band.

Was this review helpful to you?, June 27 2017,Sony MDR-G45LP (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"I prefer earbuds, but I recently got a daith piercing in each ear, and the jewelry I have in my ears at this time won't allow ear buds to fit, so I wanted to find a different style headphone that didn't seem very obtrusive. The ear clip style that are similar seemed to have such mixed reviews as far as the clips breaking, so I chose to go with this style, which seems sturdier in construction. I love that the ear portions tilt and move so that they grip tighter to your ears, making it easier to hear the sound clearly and also helping to avoid others around you being able to hear what you're listening to. The only possible down side I've found so far is that I had to have my phone volume at almost halfway before I could really hear what I was listening to, when, with other varieties of headphones, I can't get the volume turned down low enough to not bother my ears, so they definitely don't provide a very loud output, but I've found them to be sufficient. I have not yet tried these in a place with a lot of ambient noise to know if they're decent at blocking that out or not.",Good Headphones for a Great Price

This is the best pair of headphones for running, period.

Sony sound quality is more than acceptable for this use, and the shape of the headphones precludes them falling off of you as you run, a common problem with little earbuds or separate headphones.

However, the cheap plastic of the band does tend to pinch on the ears if worn for prolonged periods. If you just use them for a 15 minute jog, you should be fine. However, working overnight listening to music for hours the discomfort becomes apparent rather soon.

Most of my older headphones are made by Sony and Sennheiser. This Sony MDR-G45LP is light and comfortable to my ears and ear cannals, but Sony has something to do about it because the slit below that part of the plastic headband which hold the tiny electrical cord to the other speaker is ""biting"" the top skin of my ears due to its weight after long hours of wearing it. If you're planning to buy this style of headphones, and you use this for exercising or jogging/running, you are better off to buy that other style that has the slit positioned at the side (not at the bottom) of the head-band. I don't want to return my headphones to Amazon that's why I wrap that portion of headband with soft fabric, and planned to replace it with a short transparent plastic tubing later.

I've had them for two or three years now and the fabric on the inside of the headphones is starting to wear thing and come off. Then again I wear them all the time, especially when I workout, so I feel like 3 years worth of use for such a cheap price is totally worth it. The only complaint I have is that sometimes my ears get sore from the plastic on the top, but that's only after wearing them for a long time and it's still better than the earbuds constantly falling out or the giant padded ones that make me feel claustrophobic. Overall, good simple headphones for a great price.",Good for those who don't like earbuds.

5,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, April 7 2012,Sony MDR-G45LP (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"These pair of headphones are very, very loose. I have used Sony's behind the neck headphones for the past 6 years and every single pair has had at least twice the clamping pressure...which isnt a bad thing if you want them to stay put. They should stay put, not move or bounce around with any movement. And I have a bigger head too, it would be even looser on a smaller head.

The sound quality is what you would expect from $14 headphones, decent sound. Build is lighter and feels cheaper than my previous sony headphones.

Conclusion is I can't recommend these headphones because they are way too loose, if you aren't moving at all then they might work for you.","Fairly comfortable, but very loose"

7,Was this review helpful to you?, May 27 2011,Sony MDR-G45LP (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sony has let me down once again.

I only bought these because I had newly pierced traguses and needed something of good quality to go over my ears. There was a better version of these headphone but as usually, they discontinued it, and we are left with these crappy ones. These are so bad that I decided to just remove my piercings early, suffer the bleeding and swollen ears to put in flat backed piercings so that I could wear NON-Sony earbuds again.

I have a bad history with Sony. I have had to buy $400 in headphones from them (before I realized it) because their phones and earbuds have a tendency to fail after a few weeks, no matter how well cared for, the left ear ALWAYS goes out. When I call and ask them to improve the product they never do. When I get a replacement pair (not a refund) when my earbuds quit working after a week, the replacement pair also breaks or I am charged for it. Between my poor history, my Sony Playstation Network account being hacked and my MP3 Walkman being on the fritz since I first bought it, I'm done with Sony for the most part.

The speakers sit too high up on the ear, rather than being nicely centered; and the earpieces are poorly shaped, making them uncomfortable or even downright painful to wear for long periods of time. The sound quality isn't great either; it's only slightly better than what you'd get from a cheapity-cheap pair of supermarket headphones. Regretted buying them on only the second day I owned them, when I had to wear them when my ears were already sore from wearing them the day before. I would not recommend these to anyone who wants good headphones in this style.",Uncomfortable Fit and Mediocre Sound

Good:
1-Priced to sell, after shipping and tax they were under 15$ which is nice.
2-Sound quality for what you pay is amazing. I can hear the bass well and all that.
3-They don't fall off your head while bicycling.
4-I have a huge head and was afraid they would be uncomfortable but they are not.

Cons:
1-The audio quality is not up to par with that of the 300$ headphones but they were under 15$ so who cares?",Amazing headphones

8,Was this review helpful to you?, December 4 2013,Sony MDR-G45LP (Black),5.0 out of 5 stars,"OVERALL
A very good headset for the price. Caveat, the price varies considerably, even on Amazon.com, often from hour-to-hour. I purchased a new set for $9 from Amazon.

COMFORTABILITY
""Behind-the-neck"" headphones are generally the most comfortable type you can purchase. However, you can buy a half-dozen different headsets which look identical except for the brandname. Some will be comfortable, some won't. Apparently different folks have different shaped heads and ears, which is important to the fit of behind-the-neck headphones. So, when you find a set which is comfortable for you---buy an extra set or two and stash them. Personally, I find the Sony MDR-G45LP headphones to be very comfortable---but your experience could be different.

ADJUSTABILTIY
Like all other ""behind-the-neck"" headphones Sony MDR-G45LPs are non-adjustable because no adjustment is necessary. In fact, that is one of the advantages of ""behind-the-neck"" headsets as compared to ""top-of-the-head"" headsets.

CORD LENGTH
Despite the silly complaints of a few other reviewers that the cord is short, it is in fact the Sony MDR-G45LP cord is the standard length---long enough for you to carry your MP3 in your pants pocket. Short is better than too long---you can always add a cheap extension, for example Cables To Go 40405 3.5 mm Male/Female Stereo Audio Extension Cable, Black (1.5 Feet/0.45 Meters). If the cord is too long, it will catch on things, straining the cord at the plug----which is what will ultimately kill the headset.

SOUND QUALITY
The sound quality of the Sony MDR-G45LPs is VERY crisp and clear, (unlike many headsets which are optimized to ""pump up the bass"" which makes voice and treble muddy). I use the headphones to listen to audiobooks for which it is perfect.

CONSTRUCTION QUALITY
Appears to be good, but unfortunately, the Sony MDR-G45LP has a right-angle plug. Virtually all headsets ""die"" by strain on the wires at the plugs---so straight plugs are far better than angled plugs (because straight plugs pull out easily, rather than straining the wire).

COMPARISON WITH OTHER TYPES OF HEADPHONES

""Behind-the-neck"" headphones are generally the most comfortable type you can purchase. They also the best at staying in place when exercising.

For an ""outside the house/office"" headset, I prefer my J-buds JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (White) with my Budkeeper Carrying Case - Fire Engine Red (BKFD20-G47) case, which I clip to a belt loop. I can also stash a couple of extra AAA batteries with my J-Buds in the Budkeeper. The J-Buds in the Budkeeper are a much smaller package, and J-Buds are better at noise reduction, for example in a doctor's waiting room with a TV on. However earbuds can become uncomfortable after several hours. I suspect that the build-up of heat and moisture in your ear canals might lead to infections if earbuds are worn several hours daily. Indeed, enough heat builds up to melt your earwax, which then solidifies in and on the earbuds. Premium earbuds even have replaceable ""wax filters"". If you wear non-premium earbuds, clean the earwax out regularly, or it will get to the speakers and kill them.

""Top of the head"" headphones slip easily, require adjustment, interfere with wearing hats and interfere with women wearing hair ""up"". The only purpose for which a ""top-of-the-head"" headset is better, is for listening to music while taking a nap.

Apple/airline type earplugs are just plain uncomfortable, fall out of your ears easily, and do not provide the noise isolation of earbuds.

Since the only thing I have to compare them to are the earbuds that came with my iPod, I didn't know if they were worth the high price tag. Now I know. You do get what you pay for!

While I love that pair of Monster headphones, I couldn't use them and wear a hat. I use them while doing my walking outside and, with it being Spring and soon Summer, I want some of the protection a hat would provide. I looked at some options here on Amazon and decided on these neckband headphones.

They do allow me to wear a hat and still not have to resort to the earbuds, which I find are uncomfortable. Even to my untrained ear, the sound from these is tinny, at best. They block no outside noise. As a result, I have to turn the volume way up with these where I turn it way down with the others.

I wear it for about an hour before needing a break. Music is clear, detailed and crisp - I say this after trying three other low-priced headphones.

They were cheap, durable, and best of all, they sounded great. They would normally last me about 6 months before the headphone jack would rip off, and about a month later the sound in one side would eventually go out. For me, 6 months is a long time for headphones. These headphones were, however, extremely painful on my ears. I had to remove them after a while because they would hurt really badly and I had to rub my ears.

I have tried multiple behind the neck bands and have found most of them uncomfortable where the band presses behind my ears. I have returned several due to them being unwearable. I found one type that I loved - a Phillips/Nike brand that was extremely light and flexible with silicone ear pads. But the wire eventually broke at the back of the band due to the constant bending. By that time it was discontinued. Sigh. I have invested more money in the Sennheiser PMX95 with floating ear pieces, which are very comfortable.

9,Was this review helpful to you?, September 12 2013,Sony MDR-G45LP (Black),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these as my running headphones. After owning some $40 Sennheiser headphones for years now, I've learned what good, low-cost headphones sound like. These are not good low-cost headphones. There's an area between subwoofer and mid-range where things are too quiet - the headphones can't really put sound out well in this range. The sound in general is a little tinny and scratchy. The combination ends up adding up to a disappointing sound when listening to any recorded voice, because it typically has been put through that kind of mic processing to have that deep male radio voice, right in the range these headphones are worst.

All of that said, the sound isn't terrible, it's just subpar. You'd think Sony could produce headphones in the same quality range as Sennheiser for a similar price, and based on what I know about headphones - it's a difference of a few cents for the manufacturer to get that right, so they're making crappy headphones to avoid competing with their more expensive products. Very lame.

There's also an issue when running with these. I wear glasses - pretty light ones, which are nice for running. The way these clip around my ear can sometimes cause them to slowly wedge themselves beneath the stems on my glasses, causing them to bounce around while running - a very dizzying experience. However, on a few runs I've been able to gradually adjust them to prevent that - basically if I set them back a little farther on my ear than where they'd naturally sit, they seem to stay in place just far enough above the stems that they don't cause issues. So far.","Bad sound quality, so-so for running if you have glasses"

However the build quality is a little iffy. The jack itself fits very snugly into most devices which means you have to tug a little to unplug the headphones. After a few months of this, the rubber bit came off the L shaped jack. This exposed the wires and as a result, I can now only hear in the left ear (wire failure). It may also be due to me dropping my iPod Touch a few times (tugging on the wire where it hits the jack), but I'm not sure.

Either way I'm going to buy another pair as I'm otherwise happy with them, but this time I'll be pulling off the rubber sleeve and sticking a little glue in there to be safe.","Good, but a little low on build quality"

They seemed more heavy duty and could take a lot of beatings. I had a pair of the old model for almost 10 years!!! I hope these last as long; we'll see. There is a little plastic piece that I've noticed aren't on the new model, which supports the headphone on the ear more or something. I know some people thought it was annoying but I thought it made the headphone a little more stable on the head and comfortable for me. Not a big deal though.

I bought a pair similar to these, made by Phillip, and I hated them. They're ok for just sitting around listening to music but if you are looking to go running or something of the sort they are not good at all. They fell right off of my head (maybe I have a small head I don't know). I was very happy when I got my Sony headphones. Hardly moved at all while running.

The sound quality is pretty good; good enough bass for a pair of headphones like these. I felt the old pair had better bass though but egh not THAT much of a difference. Definitely happy with these. Also noticed the cord on these isn't as long as the old model either which I like a lot! The cord for the old model was WICKED long and was annoying I had to rap it around my iPod to keep it from getting in the way while running.

I was looking for a quality behind the neck headphone, at a low price, from a good manufacturer. This one, from SONY, came up in my search. It was under $20.00. I am glad I purchased it. It is lightweight and fits me perfectly. It has a cord for headphone jacks in your phone, Kindle, etc. It is not wireless, I was not looking for that feature. The sound quality, for the price, is excellent. I listened to some music on my Kindle Fire HD8, and the sound quality from that device was excellent. The headphones are well constructed, which is typical for SONY products. I recommend this product with no hesitation. I found no faults with it.",A Quality SONY Headphone At A Low Price

I've been a long time Apple guy but have become disenfranchised with Apple lately. I also travel weekly and want something I can pack easily. I downloaded some of my favorite songs for working out onto my Samsung S7 and then began my quest for either Wired or Wireless headphones/buds.

For on the cheap, these are really hard to beat especially at $15.
ROVKING Over Ear In Ear Noise Isolating Sweatproof Sport Headphones Earbuds
Sound quality is good and the design helps keep them put.

Since obviously my phone supports Blu Tooth, I wanted to find a pair of wireless
SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earphones w/ Mic IPX7.
These are around $37 depending on color selection. I was very impressed at the sound quality and
that you don't have to have the buds baried in your ear canal to hear quality sounding music.
I'm on the small size of ear canal so I have trouble with those that need to stick into your ear.
These were good, but I found I was always adjusting depending on my workout.
I was pleasantly surprised when I had an incoming call and was able to answer and talk as well as
listen through these. The music was automatically paused. BONUS for those of us that don't keep normal
work hours!!!

And then I tried Phaiser BHS-750 Bluetooth Headphones Headset Sport Earphones with Mic @ $36
These stay put the best for me. Music and sound quality are nice. I gave the SENSO's to my wife
to try out. She loves them. She also has more of a normal ear canal opening than mine.

Now there is a headband to place behind your hair when the older model had a cord. It is hard to carry in your pocket with your Ipod as it doesn't wrap around it anymore. It still plays well and is better than that earbud that you have to place in your ear. The earpiece is also not as comfortable as the older model.,Not as good as the old Sony

The cord is a prefect length as there isn't a whole lot of extra slack when I have my phone in my pocket. I would like them to be louder but that's only because it's really loud where I work. Definitely would recommend these to people who don't like earbuds,Good when moving around a lot.

I felt the sound was good but I went from Bose Ear Buds to these so not a fair comparison but I felt these were not good at blocking out enough of the surounding noise or maybe these could have gone a bit louder then they do!?

The reason for this is that I bought these in hopes of addressing a specific problem -- fit for a small head and ears while also retaining decent sound. The bar for ""decent"" sound is relatively low also since I am deaf in one ear.

Despite the behind the head band, these headphones still slide off altogether too easily for me. I find I regularly have to move the headphones back up on my head again. In addition, the sound quality is so-so, even for myself with limited hearing. I really don't expect much at all in the way of sound quality from headphones due to my hearing loss and, given the inexpensive nature of these headphones, perhaps that is the reason for the less than decent sound quality. Thing is, I have another pair of Sony headphones that cost all of about $15 more and they are terrific in terms of sound quality, so I'm not so sure it's a function of price.

3,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, December 17 2017,Sony MDR-G45LP (Black),4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Street Style MDRG45LP is just what my husband needed for his rather large cranium. The behind the neck design is the only option the feels comfortable. He has tried ear buds and they result in either always falling out or when in for longer than 20-mins result in ear pain. The behind the neck design of the Street Style provides a comfortable solution for those grocery store visits.

The physical design is sturdy and provide enough flexibility to be adjustable without fear of breaking them. The padding on over the speakers are a typical foam that provides a level of comfort. The on-ear design allows for clearly being able to hear both your audio of choice but also the world around you except of higher volumes.

These are wired and come with a long enough cable to allow for use of an audio source in your pocket. The end is equipped with a 1/8“audio jack which is a perfect pair for most mobile devices. The connector has a 90-degree angle at the end. I like this touch as it feels like it will have less of a chance or kinking while in a pocket. I did have some issues getting it to sit just right in my iPhone 6. If I pushed it too far in it would sound very low and distant. If I pull it out just a bit and make proper contact it worked like a charm. We have been through several headphones/ear buds and never had this prior.

Sound quality is decent, considering this price point. (currently $15.62) It has a fair base response and the high were adequate. My source for testing was Amazon music streaming and some pod cast. I know these are not the best sources but also consider that this is what my husband uses this for. That being said, the base is ample however lacks accuracy. The highs are strong and match pretty well to the strength of the base tones. It’s the mid-range that suffers the most. Vocals can be muffled at time depending on the music. Pod casts work very well as any vocal bas tones augment this short fall.

Pros:
• Solid construction
• Fits well for those with a large dome
• Wired so you never have to charge them and can keep them in your car
• Great value

Cons:
• Sound quality is adequate. There are better sounding headphones however for this price point this is the best by far.

Conclusion:

This may sound like a bad review but it is quite the contrary. The Street Style MDRG45LP headphone is comfortable, durable and provides good sound quality for this price point. I gave it 4 stars because of the price for performance. Subtle changes that would have me up it to 5 stars would be to flatten the response to allow the mid-range to open vocals. That being said I have yet to find anything better at this price point.",Good Headphone for a large dome

I love the wrap around design and that the speakers stay in place over my ears. I've never had a pair that didn't last at least a couple years, and I'm so happy they are still available.

One minor warning, if you listen to a lot of music with really heavy bass (death metal, techno, etc.) and crank the volume too high for too long, you can blow out the speakers. They'll still work, but you'll definitely hear a bit of a rattle every time the bass gets going, and it impacts the overall sound quality that you'll get.

6,Was this review helpful to you?, July 17 2017,Sony MDR-G45LP (Black),2.0 out of 5 stars,"Looks: They look and feel cheap.
Quality: The sound is bare bones. Basically the same quality you get from any given pair of cheap plastic headphones. The cushions are very thin. Recommend buying some thicker cushions to replace the stock ones.
Price: It's cheap, that's why it gets an extra star.
Users: It DOES stay on your head rather well, so it'd probably be OK for working out (I'd still recommend thicker cushions though), way better than earbuds at any rate. I can't recommend it for folks with glasses though (it starts giving me a headache after a while). It works just fine for an office environment with the HUGE caveat that it blocks no sound whatsoever, so it fails for me, as this is the main reason I bought it. You can kinda block out noise by blaring the music but to block out background noise but these headphones will be audible to a cubicle neighbor. Additionally, at that volume they really show their low-quality from an audiophile perspective.",Cheap Behind-the-Head Headphones

I only bought another pair because I bought Sennheisers out of curiosity and was disappointed... they had the same sound quality. Anyway, I couldn't believe these were still available and couldn't resist buying a new pair... and the quality is still there! I'm betting this pair will last another what... probably ten years if it was anything like the last pair.","Longlasting, Lightweight, and Comfortable"

Of the 3, these came in 2nd. They have a weak sound, with limited bass response, and although they're cheap and pretty, they just don't compare in quality to the Philips options

The winner was the HS520, with strong bass, low price, and quality construction.

Philips SHS5200 have the best sound, with the HS520 's a close second.

However, the SHS5200 is about 33% more expensive, at $20, while these Sonys and the HS520 are $15.

Also, the SHS5200 has a problem of the plug breaking when the cord gets snagged on pretty much anything. I had 2 of them break in a 6 month period. They're virtually unfixable when they break, as the cord is braided, and not a simple soldering job to repair.

So if you're in the market, go for the Philips HS520",Not the best

I am not big on sound, as long as it is good quality then that is fine with me. So the sound quality is good enough for me for this headphone. The reason I am not happy is that the foam covers started coming off all the time. First the right and then both sides. I bought foam replacements, I hope they are better than the first pair.",I love to buy Sony brand but this time I am ...
